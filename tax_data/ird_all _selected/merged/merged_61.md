It provides an analysis of options to implement an information-sharing mechanism between Australia and New Zealand for the recovery of student loan debt. This analysis follows approval by Cabinet in August of last year to negotiate and progress towards an agreement with Australia for the purpose of exchanging information to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held by borrowers currently residing in Australia. Negotiations with Australian officials included a test data exchange to examine the ability of the Australians to perform the relevant information exchange and the likely benefits to New Zealand for having such an exchange. In assessing the likely revenue benefits and determining the cost of the exchange, assumptions were made regarding the frequency of exchange and number of borrowers whose details will be matched under the proposed facility. Estimation of the revenue benefits and analysis of the problem also makes assumptions about the extent of the overseas-based borrower population residing in Australia. Because of the lack of quality contact details held for borrowers overseas, particularly for borrowers in default, it is difficult to ascertain what proportion of these borrowers are in Australia. The information-sharing mechanism requires amendment to both Australian and New Zealand legislation. Further work needs to be undertaken to develop the required legislative changes. No public consultation was carried out in respect of the proposed Arrangement. Extensive consultation occurred between Inland Revenue officials and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that the potential privacy impacts have been identified and properly considered. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted with regards to the appropriate international instrument to support the proposed exchange of information. There is no legislation accompanying this Arrangement. However, legislation will be required before exchange of information under this Arrangement can become operational. The required legislation could be included in a student loan scheme bill scheduled for introduction in the second half of this year. None of the proposed options are expected to impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. Chris Gillion Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 10 February 2015 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 3 of 74 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Overseas-based-borrower debt 1. There is currently over $683 million owing in overseas student loan default. In 2015 this is likely to increase to $880 million, which will represent well over 90 percent of all student loan default. Approximately 65 percent of overseas-based borrower default is estimated to be held by borrowers residing in Australia. 2. Overall, repayment rates for overseas-based borrowers are very poor. Nearly 80 percent who had a repayment obligation on 31 March 2014 failed to make their payments. 3. The key to collecting overdue repayments is holding up-to-date contact details for defaulters. Inland Revenue holds some form of contact details for only approximately 30 percent of overseas-based borrowers. This lack of contact details makes engaging with overseas-based borrowers difficult, including those borrowers based in Australia. Previous initiatives 4. In order to address the high levels of non-compliance by overseas-based borrowers, several initiatives have been introduced over the last four years to increase the quality of contact details held by Inland Revenue for overseas-based borrowers. 5. From 2012, borrowers applying for a repayment holiday were required to also provide details for an alternative contact person based in New Zealand. In 2013, legislation was amended to ensure all borrowers have an obligation to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of any change in their contact details. 6. Additionally, Inland Revenue has an information match with the New Zealand Customs Service, which allows Inland Revenue to receive the contact information from the arrival cards of serious defaulters. There is also an information-sharing agreement with the Department of Internal Affairs, which allows Inland Revenue to receive contact details from passport applications and renewals for overseas-based borrowers who are either in default of their repayment obligations or whose contact details appear not to be up-to-date. 7. Inland Revenue also entered into contracts with private debt collection agencies in Australia in 2013, which allowed these agencies to locate borrowers’ contact details and pursue debt collection activities on behalf of Inland Revenue when required. 8. The exchange of information underlying the proposed Arrangement follows these initiatives in scaling up the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative which began in 2010 (and initially focused on borrowers based in Australia). The initiative is run by Inland Revenue, which reports on its progress quarterly to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment and the Minister of Revenue. Status quo 9. There is currently no written understanding in place to facilitate and support an information-sharing mechanism between New Zealand and Australia to assist in the recovery of student loan debt. 10. At the Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting held in February 2013, it was agreed that officials from Australia and New Zealand would work together to investigate the possible implementation of a reciprocal student debt recovery scheme on a without-prejudice basis. 2 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 4 of 74 11. Following the Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting held in February 2014, the Prime Ministers welcomed progress on work to set up a mechanism to share data to assist New Zealand to recoup unpaid student loans in Australia, with the option of New Zealand providing reciprocal assistance should Australia adopt an overseas-based borrower regime in the future. 12. In August 2014, Cabinet agreed that New Zealand officials would enter into formal negotiations with their Australian counterparts in relation to an agreement to exchange information to assist in the recovery of student loan debt \[CAB Min (14) 26/22 refers\], 13. There is a concern that the status quo is not sufficient, as there is no official political commitment between Australia and New Zealand to assist in the recovery of student loan debt. As mentioned above, Australia has previously signalled an intention to cooperate with New Zealand in the recovery of student loan debt; however, this intention is not currently formalised in any manner. Assistance in recovery of student loan debt in Australia would be beneficial to New Zealand, as there is a high level of student loan default held by borrowers currently residing in Australia. Problem definition 14. The problem addressed in this RIS is limited to implementation of an agreement following negotiations with Australian officials, as Cabinet approved these negotiations in August 2014. This RIS therefore identifies the implementation options available for an agreement for the assistance in the recovery of student loan debt between Australia and New Zealand. 15. After formal negotiations with Australian officials, which took place in September to December of 2014, it has been decided that the type of agreement that is acceptable to both jurisdictions is an Arrangement. An Arrangement is of less than treaty status and instead embodies a moral and political commitment. 16. In this context, this RIS is concerned with how to progress the exchange of information between Australia and New Zealand to assist with the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held by borrowers residing in Australia. 17. This RIS does not consider a legally binding agreement (treaty) as an option. Formal negotiations with Australian officials have indicated that their preferred option for an international instrument is an Arrangement. OBJECTIVES 18. The objectives are to: (a) Support an information exchange between the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Inland Revenue in relation to New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia. (b) Commit Australia to enter into a mechanism for the exchange of information for information on student loan borrowers. This will require consensus with Australian officials. (c) Gain access to contact information for New Zealand student loan borrowers in a cost-effective way. 3 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 5 of 74 (d) Achieve (c) in a timely manner, recognising that the quicker Inland Revenue can make contact with these borrowers, the more successful the initiative is likely to be. (e) Maintain flexibility to negotiate debt recovery terms, including information requests from Australia to New Zealand on Australian borrowers living in New Zealand (reciprocity). 19. The primary objective is to advance an information exchange between the ATO and Inland Revenue in relation to New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia (objective (a)). The objectives (b), (c), (d) and (e) concern the specific criteria to be considered when trying to achieve (a). 20. The ability to maintain flexibility, particularly for the purpose of potentially providing reciprocal facilities in the future for sharing information on Australian borrowers residing in New Zealand (objective (e)) is likely to involve more lengthy negotiations. Accordingly there is a trade-off between objectives (d) and (e). 21. For an information exchange to become operational, both Australia and New Zealand will require passing amendments to current legislation to allow for the sharing of information. This means that the earliest any information exchange will be operational is the middle of 2016. 22. Following consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and as stated in the proposed Arrangement, any information sharing will be canned out in accordance with applicable privacy laws in both jurisdictions. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 23. This RIS considers the status quo (option one) and one alternative (option two) as options to address the stated problem and achieve the desired objectives. Status quo (option one) 24. There is cunently no written understanding between Australia and New Zealand that allows for assistance in the collection of student loan debt. Accordingly, there is currently no ability or mechanism to share information with Australia for the purpose of obtaining contact details on student loan borrowers. 25. If the status quo is retained, the ability to implement an information exchange with the ATO is substantially reduced. 26. Negotiations between Australian and New Zealand officials have indicated that it is preferable for there to be a high-level written understanding or arrangement in place to facilitate an information-sharing mechanism between tax departments in each jurisdiction. 27. Therefore, if the proposed Arrangement is not made, there is no support for an information exchange mechanism to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held in Australia. 28. If the information exchange is still pursued, re-negotiations with Australia officials will be required to ascertain whether it is possible to implement an information-sharing mechanism either without a high-level agreement or with another kind of high-level 4 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 6 of 74 agreement (for example, a treaty). This is likely to substantially delay the implementation of an information exchange and the likely benefits. Enter into an Arrangement (option two) 29. Option two is for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into an Arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation (Australia) for the exchange of information on New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia. The information exchange proposed under this Arrangement will require changes to both Australian and New Zealand legislation. In particular, it will require amendment to the tax secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and further changes to either the Tax Administration Act or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 30. This proposed Arrangement is a high-level document that embodies a moral and political commitment. It allows for the exchange of information between the ATO and Inland Revenue. This information exchange would allow Inland to receive up-to-date contact details for New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia through matching borrower details against the ATO database of Australian taxpayers. Inland Revenue would then be able contact those individuals to keep them engaged with their loan obligations and, where appropriate, recover outstanding student loan amounts. 31. To indicate the potential benefits of the proposed Arrangement, a test information- match occurred in November 2014 between the ATO and Inland Revenue, using a sample of New Zealand student loan borrower data. 32. The high-level data match process involved the following: • Inland Revenue selected 1,000 active student loan cases. • The cases were sent securely in two batches to the ATO. • The ATO performed an information-match. • A high-level report was provided to Inland Revenue. 33. The results of the test match were as follows: Confidence Group 1 (up-to-date contact details) Group 2 (contact details not up-to-date) Total High confidence of match 483 96.6%38476.8% 86786.7% Low confidence of match 3 0.6%224.4% 252.5% No match 91.8%58 11.6%676.7% Inconclusive match5 1.0%367.2%41 4.1% TOTALS500 100.0%500 100.0%1,000100.0% 34. This table outlines the degree of confidence of the information-match performed by ATO using the data Inland Revenue sent on New Zealand borrowers. This data was separated into two groups of borrowers. Group 1 consisted of borrowers for whom Inland Revenue believed it had up-to-date contact details. Group 2 consisted of borrowers who were not considered to have up-to-date contact details currently registered with Inland Revenue. 35. This test match indicates that an information exchange between the ATO and Inland Revenue is likely to be a good source of contact details for New Zealand borrowers residing in Australia. 5 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 7 of 74 36. The results of this test match were used to estimate the likely revenue benefits from an information-exchange mechanism. Additional assumptions were made regarding the frequency of exchange and volume of borrowers’ details sent to the ATO for matching. These benefits were estimated to be around $NZ10 million in repayments (additional to the repayments already being received under the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative) for the first year. Subsequent years are estimated to have a similar increase in borrower repayments from new contacts made as well as from those contacted in previous years who have continued to make their repayments. 6 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 8 of 74 37. This table summarises our impact assessment of the options. \*The Arrangement is able to be easily amended in the future to incorporate reciprocal information sharing. However, there is no explicit provision in th e Arrangement to cover information sharing on Australian student loan borrowers in New Zealand. 3 C/3 © 3 a E © • C/3 Cd © c/3 X > © © ■—1 !— t\*1 M 2 4 g o - | r \* 53 © £ © X £ C/3 £ © z T3 3 3 3 i © > o D- 3 s \* s C/3 © C/3 © © t - © 3 § O 3 C/3 © -x l . s § g § i , X 5- 3 z -T O cd 3 £ 3 cd X X -X 3 3 cd Id t-H ts © 0 X 3 0 X E ^ 2 © © oO 3 g © s- ^ > O 92 © > X- 1 X 3 3 O D .SE < N o 3 © C/3 t-H 3 0 < -a Risks No formalised po litical commitmenl from Australia to 3 c d \_o 3 © \*X 3 to 3 53 > o o ©h O C/3 C/3 \_o Id 53 © £ "53 X £ © £ -a 3 3 3 -x 3 © £ © bD 3 3 3 2 3 3 X 0 3 ^ to < | c S ecedent in tional at ion for New d student loan covery - may § 2 -x £ 3 3 22 © 3 £ 3 !— Xh © © © 0 £ N Sfg CO cd debt re 3 © O Clh £ ~o o o bU 3 C/3 3 < 3 2 3 © N n c < $ N 3 3 t— c © E SC ^ 13 E g-t5 £ B ^ O “ U C/3 .3 © N 3 a.'\_g « Z E E •= .c 2 § E '| Xh © C/3 > Announcements have been made regarding the intention of 0 3 C/3 C/3 Environmental, soci and cultural Australian and NewZealand to work t ogether for student loan debt recovery.Failure to proceed might be perceived negatively.Change in cultural perception - signals t b orrowers in Australi that Inland Revenue i able to obtain contacl in formation from ATO. 08 Q. £ Fh ,o <D O 3 O © X- © 3 X- ©h <Z) 3 \_cd C/3 •— t3 3 \_ © “ . 3 © £ 0 ”2 ^ w Compliance No compliance cosi b orrowers.

Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 9 of 74 CONSULTATION 38. Inland Revenue officials have developed the proposed Arrangement in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Treasury and the ATO. The New Zealand Treasury and the Ministry of Education have also been consulted on the proposed information exchange and proposed Arrangement. 39. In particular, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted with regards to the privacy impacts and relevant information safeguards in the development of the text of the Arrangement. Inland Revenue officials will continue to consult with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in the drafting and preparation of the legislation required to implement the information exchange. 40. The Australian and legal divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted extensively with regards to the most appropriate international instrument to bring the information exchange into effect. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 41. Inland Revenue’s recommendation is for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into an Arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation (Australia). This option meets all of the objectives outlined above. 42. The Arrangement solidifies the intention for Australia to assist New Zealand in the recovery of its student loan debt through an information-exchange facility (objective (b)). 43. The status of the Arrangement allows the exchange of information to become operational pending the enactment of legislation to allow information to be shared between Australia and New Zealand for this purpose. The information-exchange mechanism is expected to become operational in the second half of 2016 (objective (d)). 44. The Arrangement supports a one-way information exchange between Australia and New Zealand to assist New Zealand in the recovery of its student loan debt held in Australia. However, the nature of an Arrangement means that it is able to be amended in the future for the purpose of supporting a reciprocal information exchange (objective (e)). 45. This service is to be provided on a cost-recovery basis. Australian officials have provided Inland Revenue with an indicative cost of $1,143,600 (AUD) over five years. The results of the test match indicate that the ATO is a reliable source of information on New Zealand borrowers based in Australia (objective (c)). 46. Entering into an Arrangement is considered to be preferable to the status quo because it ultimately supports an information exchange with the ATO to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt (objective (a)), while the status quo does not support this. IMPLEMENTATION 47. The Arrangement is required to be signed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office. 8 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 10 of 74 48. In order for the exchange of information facility to be operational, legislation will need to be passed in both Australia and New Zealand to allow for the relevant sharing of information. In New Zealand, legislative amendments would need to be made to secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Further amendments would be required, which could be included in either the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Those amendments could be included in a student loan scheme bill, scheduled for introduction in the second half of 2015. 49. Following the approval of the Arrangement, a service-level arrangement will be drafted between Australian and New Zealand officials. This document will govern the operational details of how the information exchange will be carried out, and it will be able to be amended where necessary to ensure efficient operation of the information-exchange mechanism. 50. The Arrangement includes guidelines for the use of information. Specific operational details of the handling of information and appropriate safeguards will be included in the service-level arrangement. 51. Broadly, the exchange of information is intended to work as follows: at the request of the New Zealand Central Authority1, the Australian Central Authority will take all appropriate steps to provide directly to the requesting Central Authority, as promptly as possible, any information it holds on: • the most recent residential address of a student loan borrower; and • the contact information for a student loan borrower. 52. Inland Revenue will then use the contact details in normal student loan collection processes for overseas-based borrowers. 53. An impact assessment has been completed within Inland Revenue. This assessment indicates that the administrative impacts of this proposal are likely to be minimal. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 54. The Arrangement provides that Central Authorities may carry out an annual review of the Arrangement, and additionally may review the whole or part of the Arrangement at the request of either Central Authority. This is outlined in paragraph 10 of the Arrangement. 55. Once this proposal is operational, its results and evaluation will be included as part of quarterly reporting on the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment and the Minister of Revenue. 1 The New Zealand Central Authority refers to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or a person authorised by the Commissioner. The Australian Central Authority refers to the Commissioner of Taxation or a person authorised by the Commissioner. 9 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 11 of 74 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 12 of 74 Chris Gillion Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 23 June 2015 Regulatory Impact Statement Charitable organisations for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to provide student loan borrowers working overseas for a charitable organisation better access to an interest write-off on their loan. This policy ensures that the differing treatment with regards to interest for New Zealand-based and overseas- based borrowers does not affect a borrower’s decision to volunteer for a charitable organisation overseas. To assess the likely administrative and fiscal impacts, assumptions have been made about the numbers of expected applications from charitable organisations and borrowers seeking an interest write-off. These are based on the number of applications received in previous years and further assumptions about the volumes of applications if the preferred option is implemented. The amount of interest foregone is approximate, based on average loan balance and the current interest rate. These assumptions do not materially affect the analysis in this RIS. Officials consulted on details of the preferred option with other government agencies, in particular with the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Department of Internal Affairs’ Charities Services, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development. No public consultation was carried out in respect of the preferred option. Due to the difficulty and cost involved in identifying individuals and organisations that might be affected from the change in process, and the expected benefit from consulting widely, it was considered that a full public consultation process and its associated costs would have been disproportionate to the expected benefits and the magnitude of the impact. The preferred option will require a legislative amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (and a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007). The required legislation could be included in the student loan scheme bill which is scheduled for introduction in the second half of this year. None of the proposed options are expected to impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. The preferred option does not involve any additional compliance costs on businesses or charitable organisations. Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 13 of 74 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. Student loan borrowers who are New Zealand-based do not pay interest on their student loans, while overseas-based borrowers do. There are some circumstances where an overseas- based borrower may be treated as New Zealand-based and therefore eligible for the interest write-off. 2. An overseas-based borrower may apply to be treated as New Zealand-based and receive the interest write-off when they are volunteering or working for token payment for an approved charitable organisation for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (“the Act”). This policy aims to ensure that interest does not create a disincentive for borrowers wishing to volunteer overseas. 3. The policy was intended to ensure that only students working for bona fide charitable organisations would benefit from the concessionary treatment. It pre-dated implementation of the Charities Act 2005, and the introduction of Charities Commission register in February 2007 which introduced more rigorous requirements for the registration of charities. 4. To qualify as a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act, the organisation must be listed in the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011 (the Regulations). If not listed, the organisation must apply for inclusion in the Regulations and provide evidence that it meets criteria established by the Government when the policy was introduced in 2006. To benefit from the interest write-off, each borrower must make an individual application to Inland Revenue with evidence their volunteer work meets requirements specified in Schedule 1 of the Act.1 5. The Regulations are also used in defining the eligibility for KiwiSaver member tax credits. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, KiwiSaver members are eligible for member tax credits provided they are working overseas as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the Regulations. Status quo - the current process 6. The current process for a charitable organisation to obtain approval for the purposes of the Act involves Inland Revenue’s assessment against the criteria set out below in paragraphs 7-8. Once assessed, the charities must then be submitted to Cabinet and approved to be added to the Regulations via Order in Council. 7. In March 2006, the Government established the following criteria for listing charitable organisations in the Regulations: • The organisation must carry on charitable activities\* 2 and be established for charitable purposes; and • It must have been established and operating for at least two years. ^ A borrower must provide the Commissioner with evidence the work they are doing is for the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness, or the ravages of war or natural disaster, or improving either the economy or educational standards of a country which is on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s list of countries receiving development assistance. 2 The borrower must also provide evidence as specified in footnote 1, which limits the borrower to a subset of charitable activities in order to be eligible for the interest write-off. 2 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 14 of 74 8. In addition consideration should be given to: • the credibility of the organisation (with the presence in at least five countries being an indication of the organisation’s credibility); • the not-for-profit status of the organisation; • whether it has recognised record keeping • whether it is publicly accountable • the monitoring and evaluation processes it has in place; and • whether it has a New Zealand base (but this is not a determinative criterion). 9. The requirement for a charity to be listed in Regulations, combined with the length of time it takes to add a charitable organisation, can mean a borrower who meets the policy intent is denied access to the interest write-off. 10. As noted earlier, for an individual borrower to be entitled to an interest write-off, they must make an application to Inland Revenue with evidence that they are working for an approved charitable organisation and carrying out work that meets criteria specified in Schedule 1 of the Act3 Problem definition 11. The current process for approving charitable organisations is inefficient, as it does not always meet the policy intent of providing interest relief for borrowers volunteering overseas for a charitable organisation. There is also a duplication of processes which are already in place for assessing charities for an income tax exemption. 12. One of the five most common reasons a borrower’s individual application for an interest write-off is denied is that the charitable organisation is not listed in the Regulations at the time the borrower is volunteering overseas. This can be partially attributed to the slow process involved in adding an organisation to the Regulations. 13. It is helpful to illustrate the steps in the current process and how this may impact on a borrower gaining access to the interest write-off provision. Of particular concern is the situation where an organisation is only prompted to apply to be an approved charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act because one or more of their prospective or current volunteers has a student loan. When an organisation applies to Inland Revenue, it must be assessed against the criteria set out in paragraphs 7-8. This often involves correspondence between Inland Revenue and the organisation to gather the appropriate information to support their application. Once Inland Revenue is satisfied the organisation meets the criteria, it is recommended to Ministers, and subsequently Cabinet, for approval. Following Cabinet approval, an Order in Council can take a minimum of 4 weeks to draft, depending on the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s availability. The Order in Council must be presented to the Cabinet Legislation Committee before a second approval by Cabinet and signing by the Governor General. An Order in Council cannot come into effect earlier than 28 days after date of publication in the Gazette. 3 See footnote 1 3 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 15 of 74 OBJECTIVES 14. The objectives are to: (a) provide an interest write-off to borrowers who are volunteering overseas for charitable purposes (b) have an efficient and timely process for assessing a charitable organisation’s application for charitable status (c) reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue (d) reduce compliance costs for charitable organisations (e) ensure integrity of the process and mitigate abuse of the interest write-off provision. 15. The key objective, objective (a), reflects the original policy intent, which was to ensure student loan interest did not deter borrowers from volunteering with charitable organisations overseas. The remaining objectives concern the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 16. Three options were considered to address the problem identified above: retaining the status quo, delegating the authority for approval of organisations to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and backdating the effective approval date of the charitable organisations. Option one - status quo 17. The status quo is to continue the current process, which is set out in paragraphs 6-10. The authority to approve charitable organisations would remain with Cabinet. As a consequence, there would continue to be a delay, as outlined in paragraph 13, between when an organisation applies to be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act and when the Order in Council comes into effect, adding it to the Regulations. 18. All charities seeking to be included in the Regulations and therefore be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act will continue to be required to apply to Inland Revenue and provide information in support of the criteria outlined in paragraphs 7-8. Option two - Delegate the authority for the approval of charitable organisations to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Officials’ preferred option) 19. Option two would involve the delegation of authority to approve charitable organisations for the purposes of the Act to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Once approved, a charity will be added to a list of charitable organisations for the purposes of the Act (“the approved list”). Such a list is already published on Inland Revenue’s website. 20. The Commissioner could utilise current process for the assessment of charities for income tax exemptions and therefore reduce the duplication of assessing a charity separately for the purposes of income tax and the student loan scheme. It is proposed that the Commissioner will automatically approve charities that are registered with Charities Services, or already approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax. 4 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 16 of 74 21. Charities that are already registered with Charities Services would not be required to apply to Inland Revenue for inclusion in the list, because their charitable status will have already been established through the Charities Services process. Similarly if a charity has already been assessed and approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax, the charity will be automatically added to the approved list for the purposes of the Act4. 22. Under this proposal, when a borrower volunteering for an organisation that already has charitable status with Charities Services, or has been approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption, applies to Inland Revenue for the interest write-off, the organisation will automatically be approved and consequently added to the approved list. 23. Charities that are not registered with Charities Services, or approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption, will still be required to apply to Inland Revenue. However, the process is likely to be quicker, as the charity will be able to be immediately added to the approved list once Inland Revenue has completed the assessment. This is unlike the current process, which requires two Cabinet approvals and the subsequent Order in Council to come into effect before the charitable organisation is added to the approved list. 24. Those charities referred to in paragraph 23, will be assessed against the existing criteria set out in paragraphs 7 - 8 with the exception of the two year rule. To ensure consistency with the criteria used by Charities Services and by Inland Revenue when assessing charities for an income tax exemption, the requirement of a charity having been established and operating for two years could be removed for charities that apply and are assessed on the existing criteria. 25. This option would also decrease compliance costs for applicant organisations, as those that are already registered with Charities Services or approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax will not be required to provide additional documentation to Inland Revenue to support their application. 26. The application requirements and process for individual borrowers would not change. To qualify for the interest write-off, a borrower will still be required to provide Inland Revenue with evidence that they are volunteering for a charitable organisation and carrying out work specified in Schedule 1 of the Act5. 27. It is proposed that the Commissioner would also have the authority to remove a charitable organisation from the approved list if she becomes aware that the organisation no longer meets the charitable criteria, such as when the organisation has been de-registered by Charities Services. This will increase the integrity of the approved list by mitigating the risk of borrowers working for charities that no longer meet the criteria. 28. The removal of an organisation from the approved list will not affect the eligibility of borrowers to an interest write-off if they volunteered for the organisation during the time period that the organisation was on the approved list. 4 Charities registered with Charities Services are automatically approved for an income tax exemption, and Inland Revenue follows Charities Services criteria when independently assessing an organisation for an income tax exemption. 5 See footnote 1 5 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 17 of 74 Option three - Change rules around effective date 29. Another option considered would be to retain the Cabinet approval process but change the rules around the effective date that an organisation becomes a charitable organisation for the puiposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and is added to the approved list. This would potentially involve retrospective legislation. 30. This could allow for the approval to be backdated to the beginning of the tax year or to another earlier specified time from which Inland Revenue and Cabinet are satisfied the organisation meets the charitable criteria. 31. This would give more borrowers access to the interest write-off. Charitable organisations would still be required to apply to Inland Revenue and provide information to support their application in line with the criteria set out in paragraphs 7-8. The time delay outlined in paragraph 13 would still occur, however this delay would be less likely to restrict a borrower’s access to the interest write-off as they could still be able to claim an interest write off dependent on the effective date. 32. To ensure the charitable organisation met the criteria at the earlier point in time, Inland Revenue may need additional information from the organisation, potentially increasing compliance costs. In addition, detennining the effective start date and applying a date retrospectively would be more complex to administer. 6 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 18 of 74 33.

Increase support to borrowers volunteering for an overseas charitable organisation. Potentially some time delays if organisations that are not automatically approved are slow to provide necessary infonnation. Overall positive, as allows better access to interest write-off in line with the policy intent. Reduction in administrative costs mitigates, and potentially outweighs, small fiscal cost. Objectives: (a) provide an interest write-off to borrowers who are volunteering overseas for charitable purposes (b) have an efficient and timely process for approving a charitable organisation applying for charitable status (c) reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue (d) reduce compliance costs for charitable organisations (e) ensure integrity of the process and mitigate abuse of the interest write-off provision 6 Based on the average loan balance held by Inland Revenue at 30 June 2014 of $19,731 and the current interest rate of 5.3% p.a 7 This estimate is based on the following assumptions about borrower applications: 25% increase in the number of applications currently approved (one of the top 5 reasons a borrower’s application is currently declined is due to the borrower working for a charity that is not currently approved), and an increase in the number of individual applications by 30% (using the year with the highest volume of borrower applications and assuming all new applications are also approved). 7 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 19 of 74 O ptionsDoes it m eet the Im pacts objectives (a, b, c , d, e)?

The following agencies were consulted on option two and support the proposal: the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Department of Internal Affairs’ Charities Services, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development. 35. The Ministry of Education raised a concern around organisations which might cease to become charitable remaining on the approved list. To address this concern, officials recommend that the Commissioner is also given the power to remove a charitable organisation from the approved list if she becomes aware that it no longer meets the criteria. 36. There was no public consultation carried out in respect of option two. This decision not to consult was made in consideration of the difficulty and cost involved in identifying individuals and organisations that might be affected from the change in process, and the likely (marginal) benefit from consulting widely. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 37. Inland Revenue recommends proceeding with option two - delegating authority to approve charitable organisations for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 38. This proposal meets all five objectives. An interest write-off is provided to borrowers who are working for a charitable organisation overseas and who meet specified criteria, which meets the original policy intent as reflected in objective (a). 39. Objective (b) is achieved, as the process removes the requirement for Cabinet to approve each charitable organisation and the subsequent addition to the Regulations by Order in Council. 40. The delegation of authority to the Commissioner also reduces administration costs for Inland Revenue, as there would be automatic approval of charitable organisations that are already registered with Charities Services or approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption (objective (c)). This will decrease the duplication of assessing charities separately for income tax and student loan scheme purposes. 41. The automatic approval and removal of the requirement for charitable organisations to apply if they are already registered with Charities Services also reduces compliance costs for many charitable organisations, achieving objective (d). 42. The integrity of the approved list is maintained (objective (e)) by giving the Commissioner the authority to remove a charity if she becomes aware it no longer meets the criteria. This will apply to any charity on the approved list. 43. Options one and three also achieve objective (a) and (e), as they both continue to provide an interest write-off to borrowers working overseas for volunteer organisations and use the existing criteria for inclusion in the Regulations. 9 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 21 of 74 44. Option three allows backdating of the effective date that the organisation is deemed charitable for the purposes of the Act, which makes the process more effective in providing eligible borrowers with access to the interest write-off, and therefore partially meets objective (b). However, option three does not meet objectives (c) or (d) and may increase the administration costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs of charitable organisations. IMPLEMENTATION 45. To implement option two, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could assess charitable organisations that apply to be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act in the following way: i. Automatic approval: Charitable organisations that are already registered with Charities Services, or independently approved by Inland Revenue for exemptions from income tax, would be automatically approved for the purposes of the Act. ii. Consideration under existing criteria: Applications from other charitable organisations would be processed by Inland Revenue and considered in accordance with the existing criteria set out in paragraphs 7-8 (without the need to be established and operating for two years). 46. To ensure consistency of the criteria used for the organisations automatically approved with those charities individually assessed for the purposes of the Act, the requirement of a charity having been established for two years could be removed for charities that apply and are assessed on the existing criteria. 47. Charitable organisations already listed in the Regulations will automatically be added to the new approved list at the time when the Regulations are revoked. These charities will not need to be re-assessed in order to be included on the approved list which replaces the Regulations. The approved list will continue to be published on Inland Revenue’s website. 48. Decisions on registration of resident charitable organisations with Charities Services in accordance with the Charities Act 2005 are made by an independent Charities Registration Board. The Board tests each application against a set of nine criteria, which are intended to provide assurance that the organisation operates in accordance with the Charities Act 2005, meets minimum standards of reporting, and is publicly accountable. Each of the officers in a registered charity must also be qualified as an officer under the Charities Act 2005. 49. Charities Services tests applications for registration of non-resident charitable organisations against the same criteria, but the organisation must also demonstrate a strong connection with New Zealand. 50. The charitable organisations that are registered in accordance with paragraphs 48 and 49 are automatically accepted by Inland Revenue as eligible for an exemption from income tax. However, Inland Revenue also has an internal process for assessing applications for income tax exemptions from non-resident charitable organisations that are unable to be registered by Charities Services because they cannot demonstrate a sufficient connection with New Zealand. 10 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 22 of 74 51. An organisation will be able to dispute the Commissioner’s decision to decline adding a charity to the approved list. Where possible this will use existing processes in place - for example, the disputes resolution process provided for in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 52. The necessary legislative amendments to bring option two into effect could be included in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill planned for introduction in October of this year. It will be necessary to concurrently revoke the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would be prioritised in the context of the current Tax Policy Work Programme, and any proposals would go through the GTPP. 11 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 23 of 74 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 24 of 74 Regulatory Impact Statement Options for optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for optimising the effectiveness and the integrity of the “bright-line test” proposed in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill. On 14 May 2015, the Government announced plans to introduce a bright-line test to buttress the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The proposed bright-line test would require income tax to be paid on any gains from the disposal of residential land that is acquired and disposed of within two years, subject to some exceptions. The Government also announced plans to investigate the introduction of a withholding tax to collect revenue arising under the bright-line test. The analysis in this RIS was informed by public feedback on proposals contained in the officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax, which was released on 31 August 2015, and further discussions with practitioners involved in the conveyancing process. The issues paper proposed the introduction of a withholding tax to collect revenue on gains from the sale of residential property to improve compliance with the bright-line test. The preferred option is to introduce a withholding tax, similar to that proposed in the officials’ issues paper. It is designed primarily as a collection mechanism for the proposed bright-line test and so is not intended to raise Crown Revenue. As the preferred option would apply to a subset of bright-line sales, it would collect a portion of revenue arising under the bright-line test. The exact fiscal and compliance cost figures for the proposed bright-line test are not available because Inland Revenue does not currently have accurate data on the types and levels of land sales occurring or how much is collected under the current land sale rules. The data for these areas is expected to improve as new information disclosure requirements for property come into force and Inland Revenue implements a new form to better monitor taxable land sales. The analysis in this RIS needs to be considered in light of the additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue at the present time, which is its inability to make significant systems changes in advance of the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation programme. This proposal has been subject to public consultation and the design features take a number of these comments into account. However, owing to time constraints, the time provided for submissions was slightly shorter than the time ordinarily provided under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Further, the time between receiving submissions and reporting on the final design was compressed. As a result, we cannot be sure that the nature and scale of the 1 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 25 of 74 impacts and any potential unintended effects of the proposal have been fully considered in this analysis. We note that the Bill will be subject to a public consultation process as part of consideration by Select Committee. Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 09 November 2015 2 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 26 of 74 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The Government is concerned with high house prices, particularly in the Auckland area. Other possible causes, both on the supply and demand sides, are being separately considered, but property speculation is seen as one of a number of causes of the current prices. The attractiveness of property speculation, when compared with other forms of investment increases, if the gains are able to be realised untaxed, when gains from other investments are taxed. 2. The main change arising from the Budget 2015 property measures is the proposed introduction of a “bright-line” test that will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property that is bought and sold within two years, with some exceptions. 3. The purpose of the bright-line test is to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The intention test makes gains from the sale of real property purchased with an intention of disposal taxable. The intention test can be challenging to enforce due to the difficulty in proving a person’s intention upon acquisition, which is a subjective test. The bright-line test is intended to deal with the problem by supplementing the intention test with an objective test. 4. If enacted, the bright-line test will generally apply to property acquired under an agreement for sale and purchase entered into on or after 1 October 2015. Legislation for the proposed bright-line test is included in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill. 5. In addition to these measures, the Government announced that it would investigate the introduction of a withholding tax for non-residents sellers to collect revenue arising under the bright-line test. The Government directed Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to develop a withholding tax that could be implemented by mid-2016 to improve compliance with the bright-line test. 6. This regulatory impact statement deals with the question of how to optimise the effectiveness of the bright-line test and support the integrity of the new rules. Compliance with tax obligations 7. New Zealand taxes its tax residents on their worldwide income. New Zealand also taxes foreign investors on income that is sourced in New Zealand. When a foreign investor has a branch or controls a subsidiary in New Zealand, tax can be imposed on the New Zealand-sourced income of that branch or subsidiary in the same way as it would be on New Zealanders. However, when the foreign investor does not have a New Zealand presence, it is more difficult for New Zealand to collect tax from them. 8. New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle of voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. 9. Foreign investors may not always have the same level of understanding as taxpayers based in New Zealand, and they do not have the same level of connection to New Zealand that would otherwise create an intrinsic incentive to voluntarily comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. 3 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 27 of 74 10. While voluntary compliance is an important feature of New Zealand’s tax system, withholding taxes are imposed on many types of income where there is likely to be a tax liability and there is the possibility of unenforceability or evasion. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control of the funds. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has the ability to impose penalties on taxpayers who knowingly fail to deduct withholding tax from a payment they have made and on those who have withheld tax for any purpose other than for payment to the Commissioner. 11. Existing withholding taxes in the New Zealand tax system include withholding taxes on: • employment income; • interest and dividends; • payments to certain contractors (including special rules for non-resident contractors, entertainers and insurers); and • distributions from trusts. 12. In these situations, it is likely that the payee will have a New Zealand tax liability in relation to the income they receive, and in order to ensure the satisfaction of that liability, tax on that income is withheld before the payee receives the income. 13. The Commissioner also has a number of powers to enforce the tax obligations of taxpayers to assist in the collection of taxes.1 One concern is that these measures are not always administratively practical or effective when the taxpayer has no presence in New Zealand. 14. New Zealand can request help to collect tax from foreign investors from overseas revenue authorities under its various international agreements, including the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, bilateral double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements. These agreements allow for the exchange of tax-related information and assistance in the collection of taxes. While these are useful tools in enabling the Government to collect tax, they are a backstop and should not be the primary tool. 15. We are not able to quantify the size of the problem. This is because to date, Inland Revenue has not had access to detailed information about compliance with the existing land sale rules. However, information collection measures introduced in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 will provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales in the future. This information will enable Inland Revenue to have better information about compliance with the land sale rules and in particular, the proposed bright-line test. The Commissioner may impose a number of monetary penalties, including, for example, late filing, shortfall, and late payment penalties. The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged. This ensures that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently, at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. In addition, the Commissioner has powers available to recover amounts of unpaid tax. These powers include requiring deductions from payments made to the defaulter by any other person, and court action. 4 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 28 of 74 OBJECTIVES 16. The objective is to both optimise the effectiveness and support the integrity of the proposed new bright-line test. 17. Optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test involves maximising compliance with the new bright-line test, having regard to other factors such as compliance and administrative costs. 18. Supporting the integrity of the new bright-line test (which, if enacted, will form part of the tax system) is important in ensuring that New Zealand’s tax system can effectively rely on the principle of voluntary compliance. The “integrity of the tax system” is defined in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as including (among other factors) the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law, and taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. 19. In addition to the stated objective, the fiscal, economic, administrative, compliance, and fairness impacts of each feasible option will be assessed. 20. The fiscal impact is the likely effect of a given option on Crown Revenue. The bright- line test has been forecasted to raise approximately $5 million per year. As this analysis is targeted at optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test, none of the feasible options identified and analysed in this statement are intended or expected to raise revenue, but may lend themselves to collecting a portion of the $5 million. The $5 million per annum figure forecasted for the bright-line test is based on a number of behavioural assumptions, which are inherently difficult to quantify, such as the number of sales that would be delayed in order to exceed the two-year holding period. The actual revenue collected under the two-year bright- line test may be significantly more if the behavioural responses are different to those assumed. 21. The economic impact of each feasible option will also be assessed, in particular, whether compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules more generally may be affected and whether there may be possible flow-on effects in the residential housing market given that the proposed bright-line test is targeted at short-term churn and speculation in residential housing. The bright-line test has already been identified as creating a “lock-in” effect as people will have an incentive to hold onto property for longer than two years - this is an economic distortion as people may not undergo efficient transactions due to the bright-line test. The economic impact of each option identified in the regulatory impact analysis is over and above that of the proposed bright-line test. 22. An important component of any recommended approach is the administrative impact. Thus, the impact analysis of the feasible options includes whether, and to what extent, a particular option requires changes to systems in order to administer it, for example, whether changes are required to Inland Revenue’s computer systems or other processes, and/or whether a particular option requires the use of additional resources to implement a solution or identify and investigate cases of non-compliance. 23. Conversely, the recommended approach should not unduly impose compliance costs, although some compliance costs are to be expected. The regulatory impact statement Bright- line test for sales of residential property noted that the bright-line test would increase compliance costs for those whose sales of residential property were not previously taxable under the intention test as they would be required to start accounting for income tax on their property sales. The compliance impacts identified in the impact analysis are over and above those identified for the proposed bright-line test. 5 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 29 of 74 24. As noted previously, New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle of voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. Where there is unfairness or a perception of unfairness present in the tax system, people may be less willing to voluntarily comply with their tax obligations, which may undermine the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. Fairness (and the perception of fairness) is accordingly an important part of the principles underpinning the integrity of the tax system. As the New Zealand tax system relies heavily on people voluntarily complying with their tax obligations, we consider that the fairness impacts of any feasible option are significant in determining whether the option meets the stated objective. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 25. We note that the identification and analysis of a full range of practical options to achieve the Government’s stated objective has been constrained by a number of factors: • time available for policy design and consultation; and • Inland Revenue’s need to limit the amount of significant or complex changes within its legacy systems in advance of the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation programme. 26. Further, the Government directed Treasury and Inland Revenue officials to develop a withholding tax to improve compliance with the bright-line test. 27. However, to assess whether the design of a withholding tax folly meets the stated objective, we have also evaluated the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and other possible non-regulatory approaches to determine whether they may also be appropriate for optimising the effectiveness and integrity of the proposed bright-line test. 28. Four options for optimising the effectiveness and integrity of the bright-line test are considered below: • Option 1: Rely on existing compliance measures (the status quo); • Option 2: Status quo, but provide more guidance on tax obligations; • Option 3: Status quo, but review effectiveness of bright-line test in three to four years; and • Option 4: Introduce a withholding tax on sales of residential property made within the two-year bright-line period that: (a) is restricted to instances where the seller is an offshore person; (b) applies to all sellers. 29. Options 1-3 are non-regulatory responses, while option 4 is a regulatory response that would require both administrative and legislative changes. 30. Option 4 is divided into two possible approaches, with option 4(a) applying in instances where the seller of residential property is an “offshore person”, and option 4(b) applying to all sellers regardless of their onshore/offshore status. We consider that these two differences in scope to be significant enough to warrant undertaking a foil impact analysis for each approach. The overall effectiveness of both options 4(a) and 4(b) are dependent on a number of key design features. These features are discussed in further detail in the section titled Further analysis of option 4 - detailed design issues. Our recommendations regarding these design issues have informed our impact analysis on option 4. Option 1: Rely on existing compliance measures (the status quo) 6 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 30 of 74 31. This option would require no legislative amendment and would instead rely on the Commissioner’s existing tools for collection and enforcement, which we have outlined above and have also summarised below. It would also rely on the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation outlined in the regulatory impact statement Bright-line test for sales of residential property - this will include updating forms and communication material. To assist in the implementation of the bright-line test, Inland Revenue is also developing a new attachment to income tax returns. 32. As discussed in the regulatory impact statement Bright-line test for sales of residential property, one of the concerns with the “intention test” in the current land sale rules is that it is difficult for the Commissioner to enforce due to difficulties in establishing intent and the high volume and chum of residential property sales. The proposed bright-line test is designed to be an unambiguous and objective test. This in itself would improve compliance with, and the enforceability of, the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. 33. The status quo would be problematic from an enforcement perspective. The Commissioner has a number of tools available to assist in the collection of taxes, for example, late filing, late payment and shortfall penalties. In addition, the Commissioner has powers available to recover amounts of unpaid tax. These powers include requiring deductions from payments made to the defaulter by any other person, and court action. However, where the taxpayer has no presence or other assets in New Zealand, these tools and powers are not always administratively practical or effective. 34. Note that in situations where there is the possibility of unenforceability or evasion of a tax liability, withholding taxes are commonly imposed before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control of the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case of residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 35. New Zealand can request help to collect tax from foreign investors from overseas revenue authorities under its various international agreements, including the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, and bilateral double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements. These agreements allow for the exchange of tax-related information and assistance in the collection of taxes. While these are useful tools in enabling the Government to collect tax, they should only act as a backstop. 36. Inland Revenue does not have detailed data about the compliance of non-residents with their New Zealand tax obligations on their New Zealand-sourced income. However, there is anecdotal evidence that compliance with the land sale rules to date has been low, particularly in relation to non-residents. New information collection and reporting measures introduced from 1 October 2015 regarding residential land sales should provide better quality information in the future, but using this data to form views about compliance rates and trends regarding the proposed bright-line test will not he possible for several years. 37. Option 1 is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. It would make the tax system less coherent as a whole, given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms of income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). The absence of a withholding tax as part of the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement is not practical where 7 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 31 of 74 the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand, which is where voluntary compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules is less likely to occur. There is also a strong risk that this could create a perception that foreign investors are not paying their “fair share of tax” in relation to income derived from residential land, and that their tax obligations are not being sufficiently enforced, thereby undermining the integrity of the tax system. Option 2: status quo, but provide more information guidance on tax obligations in relation to residential property 38. This option is a non-regulatory response that is similar to option 1, but in addition to the Commissioner’s existing powers for collection and the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation, it would also involve additional information being provided and education campaigns being run in an effort to boost levels of voluntary compliance in relation to the new bright-line test (and potentially the other land sale rules). 39. Targeted education campaigns have been utilised by Inland Revenue in the past to deliver messages regarding significant changes to the tax system and to ensure those affected understand their obligations, for example in the child support area. 40. A similar strategy could be used for the proposed bright-line test, with the level of detail of the information provided and the medium dependent on the target audience. 41. However, a major limitation with this approach is that it requires in-depth knowledge of the appropriate medium in other jurisdictions to best ensure that the appropriate audiences are covered. As previously mentioned, Inland Revenue does not currently have access to detailed information about land sales in New Zealand. Information collection measures introduced in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 will provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales in the future. However, in order to be able to understand characteristics of and patterns surrounding residential land sales, for example, the country of residence of those involved, the data over the medium term will need to be evaluated to ensure effective targeting. 42. In addition, the success of this option is dependent on another major assumption - that non-compliance with the proposed bright-line test will arise from a lack of information and knowledge about the tax implications of sales of residential land. There will be instances where an improved understanding of the tax rules and one’s tax obligations in relation to a particular transaction may lead to higher levels of compliance. However, there will be taxpayers who, regardless of their level of knowledge, will not voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. 43. As noted in option 1, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. As a result, withholding taxes are commonly imposed in other situations where there is the possibility of unenforceability or evasion of a tax liability, before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control of the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case of residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 8 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 32 of 74 44. Option 2 is not preferred. As noted in option 1, the absence of a withholding tax would make the tax system less coherent as a whole given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms of income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). Further, while option 2 may assist in increasing taxpayers’ awareness and understanding of their tax obligations in relation to residential property sales, it will not increase compliance with the proposed bright-line test in instances where voluntary compliance is unlikely to occur regardless of the extent of taxpayer education. It would also require the use of Inland Revenue resources to implement. Option 3: status quo, but assess levels of compliance with the bright-line test in three to four years 45. This option is also similar to option 1 in that it relies on the Commissioner’s existing powers for collection and enforcement and the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation, but it also introduces an explicit requirement that the effectiveness of the proposed bright-line test be reviewed in three to four years (when it is expected that those who purchased on 1 October 2015 or shortly after, and sold at or prior to the two-year mark, to file their income tax return). 46. Some submissions on the officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax expressed concern that until Inland Revenue has undergone its Business Transformation Programme, it would be unable implement an effective and efficient withholding tax. These submissions therefore recommended delaying the implementation of a withholding tax on income derived from sales of residential property, and Inland Revenue should first conduct a review of the effectiveness of the proposed bright-line test. 47. The review of the effectiveness of the proposed bright-line test under this option would involve analysing data on land sales collected under the new Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and identifying areas of risk and non- compliance. Identification of specific areas of non-compliance would allow for better targeting of Inland Revenue’s resources. 48. In addition, the resulting analysis could assist in determining whether a separate regulatory response to optimise the effectiveness of the proposed bright-line test is, in fact, required. It may also provide useful information for shaping the scope of any regulatory response, such as a withholding tax, which has been identified as a feasible option in options 4(a) and 4(b). 49. One advantage of this approach is that it may turn out that the Commissioner’s current powers for collection and enforcement are sufficient in ensuring high levels of compliance with the proposed bright-line test. Conversely, if there are low levels of compliance with the proposed bright-line test, the Commissioner will need to rely on her existing tools and powers to remedy the non-compliance in the period prior to the review, and a regulatory response would also need to be subsequently designed. 50. As noted in options 1 and 2, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. As a result, withholding taxes are commonly imposed in other situations where there is the possibility of unenforceability or evasion of a tax liability, before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of the 9 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 33 of 74 amount due to the payee before the payee gets control of the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case of residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 51. As noted in option 1, the absence of a withholding tax would make the tax system less coherent as a whole given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms of income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). Given the structural inconsistency with other types of income that this would create, and the apparent low levels of compliance with the current land rules to date in relation to residential property, option 3 as a “wait and see” type approach is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. This is because it would likely shift the problem to a later date and require the use of the Commissioner’s resources to collect unpaid amounts of tax that arose in the review period.2 Inland Revenue’s preference is to optimise the effectiveness of the proposed bright-line test as soon as the new rules take effect. Like options 1 and 2, the “wait and see” strategy of option 3 may undermine the integrity of the tax system if there is a public perception that foreign investors, particularly in residential property, are not paying their “fair share of tax” in New Zealand. Option 4: introduce a withholding tax on sales of residential property (“residential land withholding tax” or “RLWT”) 52. This option would introduce a withholding tax on sales of residential land (“residential land withholding tax” or “RLWT”) where the seller acquires the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has subsequently disposed of the property within two years. The meaning of “residential land” and how the two-year ownership period is calculated would directly follow the proposed bright-line test. 53. As noted in the section titled Status quo and problem definition, an important feature of New Zealand’s tax system is the existence of withholding taxes on many types of income where there is likely to be a tax liability and the possibility of unenforceability or evasion. In these situations, it is likely that the payee will have a New Zealand tax liability in relation to the income they receive, and tax is accordingly withheld before the payee receives the income. 54. With the proposed introduction of the bright-line test, it highly likely that sellers who sell residential property within two years will have a tax liability in New Zealand in relation to income from that property. As noted, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. In the case of bright-line sales made by overseas sellers, it would be consistent with New Zealand’s broader approach to withholding taxes to withhold tax from the amount received by the seller. 55. As New Zealand currently only taxes the disposal of land in very limited circumstances, there has been no imperative to have a withholding tax on property-related transactions. Further, because under current law tax is generally imposed only when certain intention tests are met, it would be practically difficult to identify situations where tax should be withheld. 2 As discussed in option 1, there are likely to be limits to the effectiveness of the Commissioner’s abilities to collect these tax debts when the taxpayer has no or very limited presence in New Zealand. 10 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 34 of 74 56. In situations when tax is likely to be imposed on income from a disposal (such as where there is a broader capital gains tax), many countries consider withholding taxes on sales of real property to be an effective collection mechanism. Countries with property withholding taxes include Canada, Japan, and the United States. In addition, Australia has recently announced that it is introducing a withholding tax on sales of certain interests in land by foreign investors to support its capital gains tax. 57. The RLWT would require the seller’s conveyancer or solicitor involved in the conveyancing process (the withholding agent) to withhold an amount from the proceeds of the sale before the funds are released to the seller. The withholding agent would then be required to pay this amount to Inland Revenue. 58. The RLWT has been designed as a collection mechanism for the bright-line test, which means that RLWT is a non-final withholding tax and the seller would be able to offset the amount of RLWT withheld against their income tax liability arising under the land sale rules. If the amount of RLWT withheld exceeds their final income tax liability, they would be entitled to a refund. 59. Two separate approaches have been identified under option 4. Option 4(a) restricts the application of the RLWT to instances where the seller is an offshore person. Option 4(b) would apply to all sellers regardless of their offshore status. Under both options, there would be an exemption for transfers of inherited property or property transferred under a relationship property agreement. 60. Changes to Inland Revenue’s systems would be required to implement options 4(a) and 4(b). These options would impose additional compliance costs on taxpayers selling residential property, and would incur administrative costs. The administrative and compliance costs of 4(b) are likely to be higher than option 4(a), for the reasons discussed below. 61. The extent to which the two approaches under this option meet the objective of supporting the integrity of, and optimising compliance with, the bright-line test is dependent on a number of key design features. These key design issues are considered in further detail in the section titled Further analysis o f option 4 - detailed design issues. Option 4(a): applies to sellers who are offshore persons 62. As noted in the discussion on options 1-3, the Commissioner’s existing tools are not always practical or effective when the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. Other areas of the income tax rules currently recognise this practical concern and use a withholding tax to assist in the collection of taxes where there is likely to be a tax liability and where there may be issues with enforceability or evasion. 63. New Zealand imposes withholding taxes on many types of New Zealand-sourced income derived by non-residents. For example, non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) is imposed on certain types of passive income such as dividends and royalties, and a form of withholding tax called “schedular payments” is imposed on non-residents performing a contract activity. These withholding taxes are imposed on the payer, who is usually resident in New Zealand, which makes enforcement and collection easier. 11 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 35 of 74 64. The RLWT proposed under option 4(a) would only apply where the seller is an “offshore person”, a concept introduced in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. In response to submitters’ concerns relating to the difficulties of establishing whether a person is an offshore person (particularly relating to non-individuals), it is proposed that the definition be modified to be simpler and more prescriptive. In particular, the requirements in relation to trusts have been made clearer. 65. An individual is an offshore person if they are not a New Zealand citizen who has been physically present in New Zealand within the previous three years or a holder of a residence class visa who has been physically present in New Zealand in the previous year. It is proposed that a non-individual will be an offshore person if, in the case of a company, any of its directors are offshore persons, it is constituted outside New Zealand, or 25% or more of shareholders are offshore persons. This is broadly based on definition of “overseas person” in the Overseas Investment Act 2005, which provides for the screening and consent of proposed overseas investment in sensitive New Zealand assets, with modifications. It is also proposed that a partnership will be an offshore person if any of its partners are offshore persons. A trust will be an offshore person if any of its trustees or settlors are offshore persons. In addition, a trust will be an offshore person if all its beneficiaries are offshore persons, or if at least one beneficiary is an offshore person and has received a distribution from the trust within the last six years. For further discussion on this issue refer to paragraphs 103-118. 66. Given the general difficulty faced in collecting tax from foreign investors and other non-residents with limited presence in New Zealand, the introduction of a withholding tax under option 4(a) is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. To minimise some of the potential compliance costs under this option, particularly those borne by withholding agents, some-self certification may be required by sellers regarding whether or not they are an offshore person. 67. This option does not explicitly provide for the main home exception available under the proposed bright-line test. However, the main home exception would not apply to most offshore persons anyway, so withholding under this option where no tax liability exists is unlikely to occur. 68. While we see this option as increasing the effectiveness of the bright-line test by increasing compliance with the new rules and other options may also do the same, we also view this option as optimising compliance with the bright-line test, due to its impact on fairness as well as compliance and administrative costs. The compliance costs of the withholding tax under this option would legally fall on the person with the ultimate tax liability, i.e. the seller. As the withholding tax under this option would only apply to offshore persons, it is expected to increase the perception that foreign investors are paying their “fair share of tax” in New Zealand, thereby enhancing the integrity of the tax system. Option 4(b): applies to all sellers regardless of offshore status 69. We identified option 4(b) as a possible option - a withholding tax as outlined in option 4(a), but applying regardless of the offshore status of the seller. 70. Officials consider that this would be the most effective way of ensuring maximum compliance with the proposed bright-line test. Another advantage of this approach is that it would reduce some compliance costs, as there would be no determination required as to whether a person is an offshore person or not. 12 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 36 of 74 71. However, we would expect overall compliance costs and administrative costs to increase relative to option 4(a). This is because there would be a greater number of transactions that require withholding. The number of sales likely to be affected is unknown, because there will be a number of behavioural effects associated with the introduction of the bright-line test, which are inherently difficult to quantify - one of these is the number of sales that would be delayed in order to exceed the two-year holding period. 72. Income from many of these sales will be exempted under the bright-line proposal because they relate to the seller’s main home. Accordingly, tax would be more likely to be over-withheld under option 4(b). This would increase compliance costs as such taxpayers would need to apply for refunds. It would also increase administrative costs, because Inland Revenue would need to process these refunds. 73. It may be possible to develop exemptions that relate to the main home to address situations of over-withholding. These exemptions would need to be clear and robust and would take more time to work through than is possible under current timeframes. Any such exemptions would increase the complexity of the rules. 74. While Inland Revenue is able to implement a withholding tax under option 4(a), implementation solutions are restricted by Inland Revenue’s ability to make significant systems changes ahead of the appropriate phase of its Business Transformation Programme. This means that it would be very difficult for Inland Revenue to implement and administer a withholding tax on all sales of residential property made within two years of acquisition. 75. Thus, option 4(b) is not recommended at this point in time. Summary of analysis of options 76. The table below summarises the impact analysis of the identified options. 13 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 37 of 74 O p t i o n Meets objective?

As noted above, the extent to which option 4 meets the objectives depends on a number of detailed design features of the RLWT. These detailed design issues require separate impact analysis and this analysis is summarised below. 78. These key design features were areas we consulted on as part of the submission process for the officials’ issues paper and submitters’ views have been taken into account in our recommendations as they provided valuable feedback on the compliance burden likely to occur with each feature and option. The RLWT withholding rate 79. The officials’ issues paper proposed a “lower of’ approach, whereby the amount of the RLWT to be withheld would be the lower of 10% of the total sales price (“the default rate”) and 33% of the seller’s gain (i.e. total sales price - seller’s acquisition price) (“the standard rate”). In most cases, we would expect the standard rate to apply, but the default rate acts as a back stop to prevent significant over-taxation where the seller’s acquisition price is unable to be obtained. 80. We recommend that the “lower of’ approach proposed in the issues paper be used as it strikes a balance between creating a collection mechanism that approximates the amount of tax payable under the bright-line test and making the process straightforward for the withholding agent, while also reducing the risk of significant over-taxation. 81. Ideally, the RLWT should neither under nor over tax the seller. However, for the RLWT to retain simplicity and reduce the compliance burden faced by taxpayers, the amount withheld will not be exactly the same as the seller’s ultimate income tax liability. As discussed previously, the Commissioner’s powers for enforcement and collection can be limited in some situations, and for this reason, we recommend that the RLWT should be more likely to over tax rather than under tax. As a result, the standard rate proposed in the issues paper used the top marginal tax rate of 33% (which is consistent with the default resident withholding tax rate on dividends where no tax rate has been provided) rather than the lowest marginal tax rate of 10.5%, for example. 82. During consultation, it was raised by some submitters that a 33% rate would always result in over-taxation in relation to sellers that are companies; they suggested a 28% rate would be more suitable. Officials agree and recommend that where the seller is a company, the standard rate should be 28% x the seller’s gain. 83. To mitigate the risk of over-taxation and potential cash-flow issues for sellers, we recommend that sellers should be able to file an interim income tax return following the payment of RLWT to the Commissioner in order to obtain a refund, rather than having to wait to until the end of the income year. Submitters considered this to be an important factor in making the withholding tax practical and effective.

R e c o m m e n d a ti o n : r e c o m m e n d e d . The withholding agent 84. In general, withholding taxes are used to ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of an amount due to a person before the recipient gets control of the funds. The recipient may have an incentive to spend the funds before tax has been paid, which is generally why tax administrations “clip the ticket” before the money reaches the recipient. In finding an appropriate party to clip the ticket, we consider it should be the person with the least to gain from failing to comply with the rules - this is normally the payer of the amount. This is particularly relevant to the problem here, because the RLWT under option 4 is aimed at enforcing the seller’s tax liability under the bright-line test, where the seller may not otherwise comply with their tax obligations. 85. The officials’ issues paper proposed that the withholding agent should be a solicitor or conveyancer involved in the property conveyancing process (“the conveyancing agent”) and not the buyer or seller themselves.3 This is because they already have professional obligations to discharge in relation to the conveyancing of property and this would more naturally form part of those other obligations. They also have the systems and trust accounts needed to manage the funds involved in the settlement of property, which is important in terms of ensuring the integrity of the withholding process. 86. The majority of submitters agreed that neither the buyer nor seller should be the default withholding agent and proposed that the seller’s conveyancing agent should be the withholding agent. This is because they have ready access to the required information to determine whether the seller would be eligible for an exemption from withholding and it would minimise the required interaction between the buyer’s and seller’s conveyancing agents. This reduces the compliance burden imposed on the conveyancing agents and their clients. In addition, a major advantage identified by submitters was that it would make the However, many other countries place the withholding obligation on the buyer, but they expect the buyer to use the services of a solicitor to discharge their withholding obligations. 18 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 42 of 74 withholding tax a lot fairer - the compliance costs of the withholding tax would be borne by the seller. 87. Officials do not consider the issue to be as clear cut. There are a number of advantages to requiring the buyer’s conveyancing agent to withhold on the buyer’s behalf. The first is that it follows other withholding taxes (both in New Zealand and overseas), where the withholding agent is the first payer in the chain. Other advantages include that a secondary obligation can be placed on the seller’s conveyancing agent if the buyer’s agent fails to withhold, the funds are more likely to flow through a New Zealand bank account, and it would not create a potential conflict between the seller and their conveyancing agent where withholding could go against a client action. 88. Officials consider the advantages and disadvantages of both options to be finely balanced. There are marginal compliance cost benefits to the proposal that the withholding agent be the seller’s conveyancing agent. On the other hand, there are marginal revenue integrity benefits to the proposal that the withholding agent be the buyer’s conveyancing agent. 89. Officials consider that the better approach, on balance, is the proposal that the withholding agent be the seller’s conveyancing agent as long as sufficient other revenue integrity measures can be put in place as part of the overall structure of the proposed RLWT. 90. Where the buyer is the withholding agent, we recommend that they should be required to provide a statutory declaration stating they have fulfilled their withholding obligations. We consider this necessary to protect the integrity of the RLWT. We understand that while it is possible to complete a property transfer without a conveyancing agent, only very few people do. RLWT should not encourage people to undertake their own conveyancing simply in order to circumvent the application of the withholding tax.

When should the Commissioner be paid before other disbursements? 91. In situations where the buyer’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT, the amount withheld would be paid to Inland Revenue and the remaining funds would then be passed to the seller’s conveyancing agent, who would use the funds to pay the seller’s mortgages and outstanding local government rates, before paying the remaining amount to the seller. 92. Where the seller’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT, the issue of whether the withholding tax should be paid first (that is, before mortgages on the property) arises. 93. The issues paper proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements. 94. If withholding tax is collected first, this would be consistent with the situation where the buyer’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT. It also provides the same result as other withholding taxes such as PAYE, as tax is withheld by the payer before the payee receives the balance. 95. If withholding tax is not collected first, there would be an incentive for an offshore seller to effectively strip out the profits from the sale by increasing their mortgage prior to the sale in order to avoid payment of RLWT. This may be particularly problematic where the mortgagee is an overseas lender, as in those situations, New Zealand Reserve Bank lending ratios will not be relevant. 96. Where there is a resulting unpaid tax liability, this behaviour could be subject to penalties for tax evasion. However, because the offshore person is unlikely to have any presence in New Zealand, the Commissioner would need to rely on the existing rules for collecting tax. Under these rules it is more difficult to collect tax from offshore persons. Accordingly, if RLWT is not collected in these situations then the objective of the RLWT rules is significantly undermined. 97. Therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred approach is for the Commissioner to be paid before other disbursements, as it is (in substance) consistent with other withholding taxes and it would be the most effective approach from an integrity perspective. 98. However, submitters on the officials’ issues paper considered that the Commissioner should not be paid before the seller’s other creditors. Their reasons centred on the fact that it could leave insufficient funds to discharge the seller’s mortgage, resulting in delays in settlement, or prevent settlement from occurring in some cases. Submitters also noted that income tax does not usually have priority in circumstances of liquidation. However, officials consider that the better comparison in this context is with other types of withholding taxes, which are paid first. 99. Officials were asked to consider alternative options to address submitters’ concerns while still providing an acceptable level of integrity. 100. An option suggested by one submitter was for RLWT to be paid first, but the mortgagee releases title on the basis that when the seller’s ultimate tax liability in relation to the sale is calculated, Inland Revenue could repay the amount of overpaid tax directly to the mortgagee. 20 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 44 of 74 Under this approach, the mortgagee would effectively step into the shoes of the seller. This could involve relatively high administrative and compliance costs. There would need to be criteria for Inland Revenue to determine whether the refund should be provided to the mortgagee, for example, on the basis that the seller has no ultimate tax liability, or that Inland Revenue has determined that there is no abuse. Further, it may be difficult to implement as the mortgagee may not have sufficient information about the seller in order to claim the refund from Inland Revenue. 101. Officials considered whether specific anti-abuse rules could target avoidance situations, for example, requiring RLWT to be paid before other disbursements where the seller has deliberately geared up prior to the sale or has an arrangement with an associated party. Any anti-abuse rules would need to be applied by the withholding agent rather than by Inland Revenue, so from a practical perspective, the rules would need to be straightforward and able to be easily determined. 102. To address to an extent the concerns raised by submitters in relation to delays in settlement (or non-settlement), it is proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements unless the disbursement relates to a mortgage held by a New Zealand- registered bank (or a New Zealand-registered non-bank deposit taker). Officials consider that this rule should provide a reasonable level of integrity as priority would apply in situations where abuse is particularly likely to occur. This rule should also be relatively straightforward for withholding agents to apply. Definition of offshore person/information requirements Individuals 103. For individuals, an offshore person (as defined in the recently enacted Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015) is a person who is: • not a New Zealand citizen or does not hold a New Zealand residence class visa; or • a New Zealand citizen and has been away from New Zealand for more than three years; or • a holder of a New Zealand residence class visa and has been away from New Zealand for more than one year. 104. Several submitters on the issues paper asked for further detail around what would be required to satisfy this test. We propose the following criteria. 105. The withholding agent would need to be satisfied that the seller meets the requirements for non-withholding. 106. It is anticipated that in most cases a New Zealand citizen or holder of a residence class visa who is selling within two years could satisfy the proof requirement by meeting with their New Zealand conveyancing agent in person and showing them their passport. The conveyancing agent would be able to take a copy of the documentation and record that they have seen the person in New Zealand (as the person is currently in New Zealand, this means that they will not be an offshore person). 107. If an individual person is selling their property from outside New Zealand, a certified statement or other suitable proof from the seller that they are not an offshore person should be provided to the withholding agent. This could include evidence of flights to New Zealand within the relevant time. 21 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 45 of 74 108. The proposed requirements for sellers to provide further information on their offshore status go beyond the recently enacted information requirements for requiring IRD numbers on property transactions as specified in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015. However, we consider that, in order to make the proposed withholding tax effective and to minimise compliance costs for agents, this additional information is necessary. In practice, for individuals this information would likely have been captured by conveyancing agents as evidence anyway. Non-individuals 109. The issues paper proposed that for an entity or an arrangement (e.g. a company or a trust), an offshore person could be a person who is either incorporated overseas or who is owned or controlled (legally or beneficially) 25% or more by offshore persons. This is based on the definition of “offshore person” as defined in the recently enacted Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. 110. Concerns were raised by submitters around the potential difficulties for withholding agents to determine whether a non-individual is an offshore person. This could be complex and involve high compliance costs if the withholding agent needs to verify the underlying ownership of an entity or trust. We also have some concerns with the 25% threshold in relation to certain arrangements (in particular, partnerships and trusts). 111. Accordingly, we consider that the test for non-individuals (including arrangements) should be modified to be more certain and to ensure revenue integrity. 112. For a company (including a unit trust) to qualify for the non-offshore exemption, the following conditions should be met: • the company is registered in New Zealand; and • all directors of the company are non-offshore individuals; and • not more than 25% of the shareholder decision-making rights of the company are held by offshore persons. 113. This could be satisfied, for example, by proof such as: • a copy of the company’s New Zealand registration; and • a copy of each director’s New Zealand passport or residency visa sighted during a meeting with the conveyancing agent; and • a statement from each director that, to their knowledge, no more than 25% of the shareholder decision-making rights of the company are held by offshore persons. 114. For partners of a partnership, we propose that if any of the partners is an offshore person, then the RLWT should apply. This will ensure integrity is retained. 115. We propose that discretionary trusts should be considered offshore and subject to RLWT if either a settlor or trustee is an offshore person (as defined above). 116. In addition, the trustees of a discretionary trust have the ability to shift the tax liability to one of the beneficiaries by distributing the income to the beneficiary and treating it as beneficiary income. In order to ensure that the gain does not escape tax by being transferred to an offshore beneficiary, the RLWT should also apply to gains of trusts where: • all of the beneficiaries of the trust are offshore, or 22 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 46 of 74 • one or more of the beneficiaries are offshore, and the offshore beneficiary received a distribution from the trust within the last six years. 117. This should limit instances of abuse. At the same time, it would ensure that most ordinary family trusts that only hold the family home would not be subject to RLWT solely because some of its beneficiaries reside overseas. 118. A corporate trustee would be able to qualify for the non-offshore exemption if it met both the company and trust criteria above. Certification 119. Pure self-certification is not recommended in this instance, due to the funds potentially at stake - the two outcomes for RLWT are withholding and no withholding, while for the majority of other withholding taxes, the two outcomes both involve withholding, but at different rates. Pure self-certification could create an incentive to fraudulently self-certify as not an offshore person, thus reducing the effectiveness of the withholding tax.

Penalties play an important role in ensuring that taxpayers, including withholding agents, do not have an incentive to not comply with their tax obligations. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a number of monetary penalties, for example, late payment penalties and shortfall penalties. 121. To maintain overall coherence of the penalties regime, we recommended as a starting point, the existing penalties that apply to withholding regimes should apply to withholding agents who have not complied with their withholding obligations. 23 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 47 of 74 122. In some cases, it is possible for criminal penalties, including “absolute liability offences” to apply. For example, failing to keep documents required to be kept by tax law is an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $12,000. During consultation, some submitters expressed concern in relation to the potential application of criminal penalties. While they agreed that monetary penalties were appropriate, they were concerned that applying criminal penalties in relatively “low level” cases could have overly severe consequences for conveyancing agents. We note that potential criminal penalties are relatively few in number, but are critical to the integrity of the tax system. They apply to all persons with tax obligations. 123. However, unlike other withholding regimes, we do not recommend also making the conveyancing agent responsible for the underlying amount that should have been withheld. This is because they are an intermediary in the process and neither the purchase amount nor sales proceeds belongs them. To do so would likely increase the cost of professional indemnity insurance, potentially substantially. 124. Other countries which place the withholding obligation on the buyer are able to hold the buyer liable for the amount that should have been withheld. However, since we are recommending a departure from that approach, we do not consider it appropriate to hold the buyer liable for the underlying amount of withholding tax that should have been withheld. A buyer would have limited ability to ensure that the seller’s conveyancing agent does the right thing. 125. In addition, we consider that Inland Revenue should be able to inform the relevant professional body of the withholding agent about a failure to withhold where the failure appears to be negligent or fraudulent. 126. We also consider that the buyer should be held liable for the amount of RLWT that should have been withheld, if the buyer and seller are associated persons.

R e c o m m e n d a ti o n : r e c o m m e n d e d . CONSULTATION 127. Treasury and Inland Revenue officials released an officials’ issues paper titled Residential land withholding tax on 31 August 2015. Submissions closed on 2 October 2015 and a total of 16 submissions were received, including from those in the conveyancing industry. 128. In addition to this, a workshop was held on 10 September 2015 with representatives from the Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society, and the New Zealand Society of Conveyancers to discuss the proposals in the issues paper. The intent of the workshop was to inform submitters in compiling their written submissions and to provide officials with an indication of submitters’ views prior to the receipt of written submissions. 129. Support for the proposal was mixed. While some submitters supported the proposal, other submitters submitted that the measure should not proceed if the revenue that would be directly collected by the measure is less than the potential compliance and administrative costs. Officials note that while revenue directly raised from the measure is important, a key objective of the proposed measure is to support the integrity of the bright-line test as part of the wider tax system. 130. Submissions generally focused on whether the buyer’s conveyancing agent or seller’s conveyancing agent should be the withholding agent and the likely compliance impacts associated with both approaches, as was requested in the issues paper. The majority of submitters expressed their preference for the seller’s conveyancing agent to be the withholding agent. This is due to a number of reasons, including the fact that the seller’s conveyancing agent is likely to have more detailed information about their client and that the seller’s conveyancing agent deals with other disbursements at the time of settlement. Submitters raised a number of points as to why the withholding agent should not be the buyer’s conveyancing agent - in particular, it would not be fair to require buyers to bear the compliance cost of withholding when it is the seller who has the ultimate tax liability and sellers may not want to disclose private information (for example, personal details about all beneficiaries of a family trust). While officials note that imposing the obligation on the buyer’s conveyancing agent would not necessarily mean that the compliance costs are borne by the buyer, the points raised in the submissions have informed our analysis on who should be the withholding agent under option 4. 131. The issues paper proposed to give the Commissioner priority over other disbursements made at the time of settlement - that is, for RLWT to be paid before the seller’s other disbursements. This is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach, as it is (in substance) consistent with other withholding taxes and it would be the most effective approach from an integrity perspective. However, submitters did not believe that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements made at the time of settlement, as it could prevent some sales from being completed. 132. To address the concerns raised by submitters to an extent, it is proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements unless the disbursement relates to a mortgage held by a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker. Officials consider that this rule is likely to prevent situations that are particularly problematic from an 25 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 49 of 74 integrity perspective, and should be relatively straightforward for withholding agents to comply with. 133. Many submitters expressed concern about the difficulty of identifying who is an “offshore person”, particularly in the case of non-individuals. This may be impractical and difficult when there are many levels in the structure of a company and it is not immediately clear who the underlying owner is. This concern has been taken into account in the design of the RLWT under option 4(a). In addition, option 4(b) has also been identified and analysed as an alternative approach by subjecting all bright-line sales to the withholding tax. 134. A few submitters also raised concerns about whether Inland Revenue is able to implement a new withholding tax, given the age of Inland Revenue’s current computer system and the limited ability to make changes to it before the completion of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. Some submitters proposed that the implementation of a withholding tax should be delayed until the relevant part of the Business Transformation Programme has been completed and detailed data is available on compliance with the bright- line test. Inland Revenue is able to make the appropriate systems changes to implement the withholding tax, but to address submitters’ other points, we have identified as a feasible option and analysed whether a review in three to four years would meet the objective of optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test (option 3). 135. Submitters also made comments about detailed design features of a withholding tax under option 4. We have taken these comments into consideration in our design of the policy details. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 136. Inland Revenue supports option 4(a). We consider that option 4(a) would optimise the effectiveness and support the integrity of the bright-line test. With the proposed introduction of the bright-line test, it highly likely that overseas sellers who sell residential property within two years will have a tax liability in New Zealand in relation to income from that property. It would be consistent with New Zealand’s broader approach to withholding taxes to withhold tax on the payment received by the seller. 137. Given the general difficulty faced in collecting tax from foreign investors with no physical presence in New Zealand, we consider that options 1-3 would not improve compliance with the bright-line test and could undermine the integrity of the tax system if there is a perception that foreign investors, particularly in the area of residential property, are not paying their “fair share of tax” in New Zealand. Option 4(b) would not optimise the effectiveness of the bright-line test due to the significant additional compliance and administrative costs relative to option 4(a). 138. While option 4(a) involves greater up-front administration costs, compliance costs and is not expected to raise Crown Revenue (as it is simply a collection mechanism), we consider that it would meet the objective of optimising the effectiveness, and supporting the integrity of, the bright-line test. However, the extent to which a withholding tax would meet the objectives is dependent on the key design features we have outlined in this regulatory impact statement. 26 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 50 of 74 IMPLEMENTATION 139. Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required to implement option 4. Any legislative amendments required to implement option 4 could be included in a bill introduced before the end of 2015. 140. The Government has indicated that a withholding tax under option 4 should be effective from 1 July 2016. To ensure that Inland Revenue has the appropriate systems changes in place and that practitioners involved in the withholding process are well informed of their obligations, any legislative amendments should be enacted by the end of March 2016. 141. In addition, Inland Revenue would be required to update forms and communication material that can be distributed to withholding agents and other parties potentially impacted by the withholding tax. One possibility would be to distribute information forms to real estate agents to distribute to their clients. 142. The withholding tax under option 4 would be administered by Inland Revenue. 143. Whilst Inland Revenue has mechanisms in place to collect various taxes, it does not have existing administrative arrangements to collect the proposed RLWT. 144. Where a withholding agent has failed to withhold when required, penalties would apply and where there has been a negligent or fraudulent failure to withhold, Inland Revenue would work closely with the relevant professional body to ensure that appropriate action is taken. 145. In designing option 4, officials sought feedback from representatives on the compliance costs associated with administering a withholding tax. This feedback informed the key design features preferred by officials as set out in the regulatory impact analysis section of this statement. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 146. Inland Revenue is putting in place new systems for administering the bright-line test including a new form to monitor property sales subject to the bright-line test. In addition, further measures have been introduced to provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales. These measures will enable Inland Revenue to have better information about cases where withholding tax should be withheld and whether or not it has actually been withheld. 147. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP). 148. Inland Revenue monitors, evaluates and reviews new legislation under the GTTP. The GTTP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used for tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The implementation and review stage of the GTTP involves reviewing the legislation after implementation and identifying any issues. 149. Inland Revenue officials will continue to make themselves available for discussion with affected parties in the design of a RLWT under option 4(a). 27 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 51 of 74 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 52 of 74 Regulatory Impact Statement GST on cross-border services and intangibles Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to apply Goods and Services Tax (GST) to cross-border services and intangibles consumed in New Zealand (including e-books, music, videos, and software purchased from offshore websites). Currently, GST is not usually collected on cross-border services and intangibles, which results in competition and fairness concerns by New Zealand businesses, as well as a revenue gap in New Zealand’s GST system. This analysis follows submissions received on the discussion document GST: Cross-border sendees, intangibles and goods released on 18 August 2015, which sought public feedback on a proposal to require offshore suppliers of services and intangibles to New Zealand resident consumers to register and return the GST. The analysis also considered international developments to address this issue, including the OECD guidelines on GST and cross-border services and intangibles which are connected with the work on “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). In addition, consideration has been given to approaches adopted in the European Union, and a number of countries including Australia, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, Japan and South Korea. There are three key constraints / caveats on the analysis: 1. Because of data limitations it is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers could be required to register and return GST under the preferred option. Experience in similar countries suggests that around 100 offshore suppliers may register if the preferred approach is adopted. 2. Again owing to data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how much is spent on services and intangibles purchased offshore and consumed in New Zealand. Officials’ best estimate that around $270 million per annum is spent on services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. This estimate means that around $40 million of GST is forgone on these purchases. This amount could be growing at a rate of 10% per annum. 3. The extent to which the GST treatment of services and intangibles purchased from offshore influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is uncertain. Other factors such as product range, availability and price (exclusive of GST) may have a greater impact on consumers’ decision to purchase from an offshore supplier as opposed to a domestic supplier. A range of options has been considered and measured against the objectives of providing certainty, consistency and fairness of GST treatment whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to current practices. There are no environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning this regulatory impact analysis other than those noted above. 1 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 53 of 74 The proposals could impact on the level of competition by discouraging offshore suppliers from entering or continuing to supply to the New Zealand market. However, this impact may depend on the extent to which compliance costs are imposed on offshore suppliers and the extent to which consumers alter their purchasing behaviour in response to the change. The preferred option would likely impose some compliance costs on offshore suppliers as they would be required to register and return GST. These compliance costs are likely to be comparable to (if not lower than) the compliance costs already imposed on domestic businesses associated with registering and returning GST on domestic supplies. The preferred option also contains a number of compliance savings measures to ensure compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers are minimised. The application of GST on services and intangibles purchased from offshore suppliers may also impact New Zealand consumers’ purchasing decisions. As noted above, the impact is likely to be limited as other factors such as product range, availability and price (exclusive of GST) may have a greater impact on consumers’ decisions than the application of GST on these services and intangibles. None of the policy options identified is expected to unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Note that this RIS only considers the application of GST to cross-border services and intangibles. The application of GST to low-value imported goods will be considered at a later time following separate public consultation. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 21 October 2015 2 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 54 of 74 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. In principle, GST should apply evenly to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. However, GST is not typically collected on cross-border services and intangibles (including internet downloads and online services) purchased from offshore websites. 2. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased services from offshore and online digital products were not yet available. Therefore, at that time the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing cross-border services outweighed the benefits of taxation. 3. The growth in online purchases means that the volume of imported services on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. This raises the question of whether the existing tax rules will remain suitable and sustainable in the future. 4. Many domestic providers feel the existing tax settings place them at an unfair disadvantage when compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price. There are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase services offshore, such as overall cheaper prices, product availability, and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 5. It is likely that up to $40 million of GST is forgone on cross-border services and intangibles per year. The growth of imported services is a relatively recent development and the amount is expected to continue to grow - estimates vary but the growth could be around 10 percent per year. International considerations 6. The non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The OECD is in the process of developing guidelines which focus on establishing an international set of principles for determining when countries should have the right to tax such supplies. 7. The guidelines were publicly released on 5 October 2015. The guidelines suggest that, for remotely supplied services and intangibles, the consumer’s usual place of residence is the predominant test for determining which country has the right to tax. They also suggest that offshore suppliers could be required to register and return the GST on remote supplies, as is the case in the European Union. The guidelines are expected to be finalised later this year. 8. The offshore supplier registration model has been adopted in the European Union for cross-border services and intangibles as well as a number of countries, including Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan and South Africa. The countries that have implemented such a system report some success in collecting GST or VAT. 9. Australia also announced plans to introduce the model as part of their 2015 Federal Government Budget. While some of the detail is still subject to consultation, the broad framework of the proposed rules is consistent with the OECD guidelines and the system that operates in Europe. Australia intends to implement its proposed rules on 1 July 2017. 3 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 55 of 74 Establishing New Zealand’s right to tax 10. Before considering the various options, it is first important to determine which cross­ border services and intangibles New Zealand should tax. New Zealand and other countries’ GST systems seek to tax domestic consumption. This is done taxing imports (as well as other goods and services supplied domestically), and not taxing exports. 11. In the case of cross-border goods, the place of consumption will be clear - the consumption occurs in the country of import. There is less certainty when applying GST to cross-border services and intangibles. In many cases it is not clear where the consumption occurs and therefore which country has the taxing right. A number of proxies could be used to determine place of consumption, such as the location of the consumer, location of the supplier, or the residence of the consumer. 12. Without international consensus on taxing rights, it is possible that services could be taxed in multiple jurisdictions or not at all. The OECD has been developing a set of guidelines addressing these issues of double taxation and non-taxation that may arise from inconsistencies in the application of VAT/GST to international trade. 13. The OECD draft guidelines and growing international practice suggest that New Zealand should apply GST to “remote” services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand- residents. Remote services are services where it is not necessary for the supplier and customer to be in the same location when the services are supplied - such as if, for example, a person downloads a song from a website. These services can be distinguished from “on-the- spot” services, where the supplier and the customer are usually required to be in the same location as the supplier in order for the services to be physically performed - for example, the services provided by a hairdresser. 14. In relation to remote services, residence is internationally regarded as a reasonable proxy for determining where a cross-border service or intangible will be consumed. It is recommended that New Zealand follow international consensus to avoid double taxation or double non-taxation in international trade. Therefore, the options considered seek to apply GST to remotely supplied services and intangibles received by New Zealand residents. OBJECTIVES The options outlined in this RIS seek to achieve two main objectives: (a) Address the non-taxation of cross-border services and intangibles 15. New Zealand’s GST is a “consumption tax”. Consumption taxes seek to tax consumer spending on goods and services. The country that has the right to tax this consumer spending is generally the country in which the good or service is consumed. This is known as the “destination principle”. 16. Conversely, goods and services that are exported, and therefore consumed offshore, are generally untaxed - that is, exports are zero-rated, meaning GST is charged at a rate of zero percent and businesses can claim GST back on their inputs. Allowing exporters to claim back GST on their inputs ensures that GST is not a cost on business or offshore consumers. 17. If countries apply the destination principle and also recognise that GST is a tax on consumers and not businesses, double taxation and non-taxation in cross-border trade should 4 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 56 of 74 largely be averted. Services and intangibles that are exported are zero-rated in most jurisdictions so if jurisdictions do not tax incoming services and intangibles this can lead to double non-taxation. This result is inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system which seeks to tax virtually all New Zealand based consumption. 18. Therefore, the options discussed in this RIS seek to address the issue of the non-taxation of cross-border services consumed in New Zealand. As discussed above, around $40 million of GST is forgone on cross-border services and intangibles per year growing at a rate of 10 percent per year. (b) Reduce competitive distortions 19. In principle, GST should apply evenly to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. When GST does not apply evenly it has the potential to distort consumer behaviour. Domestic businesses argue that the fact that no GST is charged on services purchased from offshore businesses but, is charged when services are purchased from domestic businesses, is distorting consumers’ purchasing decisions in favour of offshore businesses. 20. Therefore, the second objective is to reduce any distortive effects that GST may have on consumers’ purchasing decisions. However, any option discussed must also ensure that domestic businesses are not advantaged as compared to offshore businesses as a result of any proposal. Objectives against which the options are to be assessed 21. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The GST rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and then GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. • Neutrality: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Effectiveness and fairness: The option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collects the forgone revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 22. Three policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: Option 1: Require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident customers. 5 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 57 of 74 Option 2: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST on services and intangibles supplied by non-residents (known as a reverse charge mechanism). Option 3: Require financial institutions to return the GST on credit/debit card transactions involving services and intangibles purchased from non-resident suppliers. Option 4: Retain the current GST treatment where no GST is collected on services and intangibles supplied by non-residents. This is the status quo option to which the other options are being assessed against. 23. All of the options (apart from option 4) impact New Zealand resident consumers as they will likely bear the cost of the application of GST on purchases of services and intangibles received from offshore suppliers. The extent to which the resident consumer will bear the cost will depend on the effectiveness and rate of compliance of each option. 24. With regard to option 1, the extent to which New Zealand resident consumers will bear the GST will also depend on whether the offshore supplier passes the cost on to the consumer. This may be industry or firm specific and depend on factors such as business practices and the elasticity of demand for products. Option 1: Offshore supplier registration (officials’ preferred option) 25. Option one involves offshore suppliers or offshore electronic market places registering and returning GST on services and intangibles consumed in New Zealand. This option therefore primarily impacts offshore suppliers and offshore electronic market places. 26. Under this option offshore suppliers and marketplaces would be required to register and return GST if their supplies of services to New Zealand-resident customers exceed a certain registration threshold in a 12-month period. This option is consistent with how GST is collected on domestic supplies of goods and services. 27. The offshore supplier registration model is endorsed by the draft OECD guidelines - Guidelines on place of taxation for business-to-consumer supplies of services and intangibles - which were released December 2014 and are expected to be finalised later this year. 28. This option has been adopted in other countries, for example members of the European Union, and other countries such as Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan and South Africa have also recently adopted this option. Australia has recently proposed to apply GST to cross-border services and intangibles from 1 July 2017 using an offshore supplier registration system. Certainty and simplicity 29. Adopting a system that is widely used internationally and is, therefore, familiar to international suppliers should make this option relatively simple to apply in practice. For example, the European Union has collected VAT on services and intangibles using this option since 2003. Given the European Union is the largest VAT market, many international suppliers will be familiar with this system and already be registered and returning VAT in Europe. 6 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 58 of 74 30. In addition, given New Zealand’s GST system is broad-based, with a single rate and few exemptions, it is expected to be relatively simple for offshore suppliers to comply with as compared to countries with multiple VAT/GST rates and exemptions. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 31. This option is relatively efficient to administer given systems are already in place to register domestic suppliers. Since New Zealand’s GST system is relatively simple, compliance costs should be minimal and consistent with (if not lower than) the compliance cost imposed on domestic businesses in registering and returning GST. 32. Implementing simplified registration processes that are tailored to offshore suppliers will assist in reducing the compliance costs associated with the new rules (see the implementation section for more information on the simplified registration system). 33. As a further compliance cost reduction measure, offshore suppliers would not be required to register in New Zealand unless their supplies exceeded a certain registration threshold. This means that offshore suppliers that supply a minimal level of services to New Zealand residents would not have to register. The rules contain other features that are designed to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers. A discussion of these features is included in further analysis on option 1: Offshore supplier registration model. Neutrality 34. This option is neutral because offshore suppliers will be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. Consequently, for tax purposes consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase a remote service from a domestic or offshore supplier as both suppliers would be required to return GST on that service. Effectiveness and fairness 35. The effectiveness and fairness of this option may depend on the extent to which liable offshore suppliers comply with the rules. Since New Zealand’s tax system is based on voluntary compliance, the system relies on the fact that the vast majority of people do the right thing and comply with their tax obligations. This is largely because our tax system is fair and coherent. It is expected that most offshore suppliers would comply with our rules for the same reasons, albeit there will be some differences in the enforcement mechanisms adopted. 36. When similar rules to those proposed in this document have been applied in other countries, offshore suppliers, particularly large international suppliers that account for the majority of cross-border services and intangibles, have demonstrated a willingness to comply. For many of these suppliers, failure to comply with their obligations would pose a significant risk to their reputation. Furthermore, to generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand, the option adopts similar and consistent rules with the rules that apply in those other countries. 37. There are a number of detailed design issues with this option. These design issues have a significant impact on the degree to which this option meets the objectives. These detailed design issues are considered in the section “further analysis of option 1”. 7 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 59 of 74 Option 2: Reverse charge 38. Under this option, when a New Zealand consumer purchases services or intangibles from an offshore supplier, they would be required to return GST by making a separate payment to Inland Revenue or pay the GST as part of a end of year tax return (as opposed to the GST being included in the price paid). This is known as a ‘reverse charge’. This option therefore primarily impacts New Zealand resident consumers that purchases services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. 39. New Zealand already has a limited reverse charge rule for services purchased by New Zealand businesses from non-residents. It applies to the extent the services relate to 5% or more to non-taxable activities, such as those of a financial institution. 40. Under this option the existing reverse charge would be expanded to apply to individual consumers that purchase services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. 41. Like New Zealand, other countries (particularly in the EU) apply reverse charges as the primary collection method in relation to business-to-business offshore supplies of services and digital goods. Canada also uses this approach to collect GST on offshore supplies of services to non-registered individuals. The tax is due by the end of the month following the calendar month in which the amount for the services was paid or became payable. Certainty and simplicity 42. The main disadvantage with this option is that a large number of taxpayers will be required to return GST, as compared to options 1 and 3 where a comparably small number of offshore suppliers or financial institutions would be required to return the GST. The amount of GST paid by each consumer is likely to be relatively small. 43. Given this option has the potential to impact a large number of consumers that are unfamiliar with returning GST there is likely to be less certainty as to how the GST rules apply. Consumers would also be required to identify whether or not they are purchasing the service from a New Zealand resident supplier and only return GST on services received by non-resident suppliers. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 44. As discussed above, this option would impose compliance costs on a relatively large group of consumers that purchase services from offshore suppliers for relatively small amounts of GST. Given that a large proportion of individual taxpayers are currently not required to file tax returns this option has the potential to require a large number of taxpayers to file returns. 45. Administrative costs are also likely to be significant as this option would involve the development of a new system of receiving GST payments. Either a new tax form would need to be developed or existing end of year tax returns would need to be amended. Resources would also need to be allocated to ensuring consumers complied with their tax obligations, by promoting awareness, providing guidance materials and dealing with enquiries, errors and refunds. Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 60 of 74 Neutrality 46. If applied consistently and successfully, GST would be returned on both services provided domestically and from offshore. However, the method of collection would differ significantly depending upon whether the supplier was offshore or onshore. Effectiveness and fairness 47. When this option has been applied in other jurisdictions its success has been limited. This is likely due to a number of factors such as lack of awareness of the requirement to return GST given that consumers are accustomed to GST being included in the purchase price, and the difficulty of enforcing a reverse charge on such a large taxpayer base. 48. In many cases, the New Zealand purchaser may not realise they are buying from an non­ resident supplier. For example, an offshore supplier could have a New Zealand domain name (.co.nz) or a separate chain of New Zealand retail stores. Option 3: Financial institutions return the GST 49. Option 3 would impact financial institutions (e.g. New Zealand banks) and other payment intermediaries that would be required to add GST to New Zealand issued credit/debit cards at the time that services are purchased from an offshore supplier. 50. How this collection option would apply in practice would need to be determined through consultation with financial institutions. However, one possible approach would be for the financial institution to add GST to the consumers’ credit or debit card when the following conditions are met: • The card is not physically present when the transaction occurs (e.g. instead of swiping the card, the customer supplies the credit card number). • The supplier of the service is not in New Zealand. • The billing address for the card is a New Zealand address. Certainty and simplicity 51. The development of an automated system to apply GST to purchases of remotely supplied services could be complex. The system would need to identify purchases that would not be subject to GST, such as ‘on-the-spot’ services consumed outside of New Zealand (for example, overseas accommodation) and international travel1. It is unclear as to whether financial institutions have the necessary information and therefore there would be a risk that GST would be applied to services consumed outside of New Zealand. 52. Consumers’ use of online intermediary payment systems would have to be considered. Although a credit/debit card is still used, from the perspective of the financial institution it may be difficult to determine who the ultimate supplier of the service is, and therefore, whether GST should be charged. For example, it would be difficult to exclude an industry type (such as overseas accommodation providers) if the payment was made through intermediary payment systems. One solution would be to require the intermediary payment 1 International travel is currently zero-rated because it is a service that is considered to be consumed outside of New Zealand. 9 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 61 of 74 provider (as opposed to the financial institution who issues the credit or debit card) to collect the GST in such cases. 53. Another disadvantage with this option is that it has not been implemented in any other country. There is no international experience on how well this option will work, what practical difficulties could arise and what compliance costs would be involved. The success of this option would also depend on financial institutions agreeing to develop and implement a system. Efficiency o f compliance and administration 54. While there would be some costs involved in setting up the collection system, the collection of GST from credit and debit cards would be an automated process. Automated processes for collection have the potential to significantly lower the cost of collection and the compliance costs. 55. There are only a relatively small number of New Zealand credit and debit card issuers. This should make it easier for the Government to work with those involved to develop practical and realistic processes to address any implementation issues which may arise. Neutrality 56. This collection system would only collect GST on services purchased with a New Zealand issued credit or debit card. Consequently, payment by other means would not be captured under this system. For example, services paid for using overseas bank accounts including overseas domiciled credit/debit cards and consumers could also use online banking to make payments to overseas suppliers. Effectiveness and fairness 57. This option is limited to collecting GST on New Zealand issued credit and debit cards and therefore may not easily respond to future developments in the way consumers pay for services online. Therefore, the longevity of this system could be an issue. 58. As discussed above, if the collection system cannot accurately distinguish between services consumed in New Zealand and services consumed outside of New Zealand, there is a risk that some services will be over taxed or subject to double tax as the overseas jurisdiction may also seek to apply GST/VAT to the services. This would negatively impact the fairness of this option. Option 4: Status quo 59. Under the status quo, GST would not be collected on supplies of cross-border remote services and intangibles received by New Zealand residents. As a result the competitive distortions between domestic and offshore suppliers would continue and the Government would not collect $40 million on services and intangibles that are consumed in New Zealand. Certainty and simplicity 60. As GST is not collected on cross-border supplies of services and intangibles, this option is associated with greater certainty and simplicity when compared to the other options. 10 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 62 of 74 Efficiency of compliance and administration 61. As offshore suppliers are not required to return GST on supplies of services and intangibles to New Zealand resident consumers, there are fewer compliance and administration costs associated with this option. Neutrality 62. This option is the least neutral of those considered, as the tax treatment of a remote service consumed in New Zealand will depend on whether the service is purchased from a domestic or offshore supplier. These differences in tax treatment may distort consumers’ decision making, as purchases of remote services from an offshore supplier are not subject to GST, while those from domestic suppliers are generally taxed. Effectiveness and fairness 63. Many domestic suppliers feel that the current tax settings place them at an unfair disadvantage when compared with offshore suppliers who are not required to return GST on supplies of services and intangibles to the same customers. The perception that the GST rules are ineffective in evenly taxing consumption in New Zealand may undermine compliance with tax rules more generally. 64. Domestic suppliers may also restructure their affairs in order to take advantage of the non-collection of GST on services supplied from offshore. This may further exacerbate the risk to the GST base and the competitive unfairness. Summary of the analysis of the options 65. The table below summarises the impact analysis of the options.

Best meets objective (a) Best meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. This option would result in some additional compliance costs for offshore suppliers. However, this impact is mitigated by several features of the rules that are designed to reduce compliance costs. Estimated net gain in revenue of up to $40m per year. Improves fairness as offshore suppliers will largely be subject to the same rules that apply to domestic businesses. 11 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 63 of 74 Option 2: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST on services and intangibles supplied by non­ residents (known as a reverse charge mechanism). Partly meets objective (a) Partly meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. However, the extent to which this occurs may depend on the extent to which there is widespread compliance with the rules. This option would impose significant compliance on New Zealand resident consumers and would result in additional administrative costs. No estimate of the fiscal impact of this option is available, though it would be expected to result in lower revenue gains than option 1 as a result of non­ compliance with the rules. This option would improve fairness in the system to the extent that neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers can be achieved. Option 3: Require financial institutions to return the GST on credit/debit card transactions involving services and intangibles purchased from non-resident suppliers. Partly meets objective (a) Partly meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. However, the extent to which this occurs may depend on the effectiveness of the system in identifying transactions that should be subject to GST. This option could result in lower compliance costs than option 1, as there are likely to be fewer entities required to return GST and this could be achieved through automated processes. However, significant challenges in implementing the option have been identified, and it has not been adopted in other countries. The revenue impact is likely to be similar to option 1 if the system was effective at identifying transactions that should be subject to GST. This option would improve fairness in the system to the extent that neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers can be achieved. Option 4: Retain the current GST treatment where no GST is collected on services and intangibles supplied by non­ residents. Does not meet objective (a) Does not meet objective (b) This option results in distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions due to differences in the tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. This option is not associated with significant compliance or administration costs. The revenue impact will be neutral, however, the Government will not collect $40 million on services and intangibles that are consumed in New Zealand. This option is perceived to result in significant unfairness, which may undermine compliance more generally. Further analysis on option 1: Offshore supplier registration model 66. Option 1 involves requiring non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident customers. There are a number of design issues for the offshore supplier registration model which require separate impact analysis. The detail design aspects of option 1 are as follows: • zero-rating the supply of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand GST- registered businesses; • adopting a broad definition of remote services and intangibles (including digital services and more traditional services); • requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST if their total supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceed $60,000 in a 12- month period. However, offshore suppliers would not be required to register if they 12 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 64 of 74 predominantly made supplies to GST-registered businesses and their supplies to New Zealand resident consumers were less than $10,000 in a 12-month period; • requiring offshore suppliers to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence, and an alternative method may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue if the offshore supplier does not have the necessary information; • implementing a simplified registration and return process to reduce compliance costs for registered offshore suppliers; • In some situations, requiring an electronic marketplace or intermediary to register instead of the principal offshore supplier. 67. The analysis of these design issues are summarised in the tables below. Zero-rating supplies of services and intangibles to GST-registered New Zealand businesses from the rules 68. One key design issue is whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST on supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, or whether GST should apply only to supplies to New Zealand-resident final consumers. IssueO ptions A dvantagesD isadvantages R ecom m endations Should the rules zero- rate supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses? Exclude supplies to New Zealand GST- registered businesses unless the offshore supplier and GST- registered recipient agree to zero-rate the supply. This option allows the rules requiring tax invoices to be relaxed, as unregistered recipients will not have the ability to claim back GST charged on the services they receive. This would result in lower compliance costs for offshore suppliers. This option is consistent with the approach taken in most other jurisdictions that have adopted an offshore supplier registration model for services and intangibles, and is more consistent with the draft OECD guidelines. The option to zero-rate these supplies will allow non-resident businesses to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making these supplies which ensures GST is neutral for these businesses. This option requires offshore suppliers to determine whether they are supplying to a registered business or an individual customer, which could require the collection of additional information in some cases. However, as other countries have adopted offshore supplier registration systems that do not require offshore suppliers to return GST on business-to-business supplies, it is likely that many suppliers have implemented systems to operate in this environment. Offshore suppliers will also be able to rely on businesses customers GST number to determine their registration status. Additionally, to further reduce compliance costs, an offshore supplier would also be able to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method of determining whether customers are GST- registered businesses. Recommended 13 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 65 of 74 69. It is proposed that if a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST they would need to seek a refund from the offshore supplier. However, if the value of the supply is less than $1,000, the offshore supplier could provide a tax invoice which would allow the GST-registered business the ability to claim back the GST in their normal GST return. This would reduce the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers associated with returning inadvertently charged GST on low-value transactions. At the same time a threshold set at $1,000 reduces the fiscal risks associated with GST-registered businesses claiming back high value amounts of GST charged by offshore suppliers. Scope of the cross-border services and intangibles that are subject to the rules 70. In designing the rules, a broad scope could be adopted that applies GST to all cross­ border supplies of remote services and intangibles. Alternatively, the rules could apply only to certain supplies of digital services and intangibles. IssueO ptions A dvantagesD isadvantagesR ecom m endations What services and intangibles should the rules apply to? Apply the rules to a wide range of remote services and intangibles This option is more consistent with the broad-based GST system in New Zealand, which tends to avoid issues with classifying services into particular categories for fairness and efficiency reasons. Using a broad definition may ‘future-proof the rules, as more prescriptive legislation may need to be frequently updated to reflect changes in the types of services that become available. This option has not been implemented in other countries, though it has been announced to apply in Australia. Therefore unintended consequences could arise from a broad definition of remote services that encompasses traditional cross-border services that are supplied remotely, such as consultancy, accounting or legal services. However, these impacts may be reduced if business-to-business supplies are excluded from the rules, and if the registration threshold is set $60,000. Recommended 14 Require offshore suppliers to return GST at a rate o f 15% on all supplies to New Zealand resident consumers and businesses. This option would mean offshore suppliers would not have to determine whether they were supplying to a business or an individual customer, which may reduce compliance costs for some. This option would have little value from a revenue perspective as GST-registered businesses would be in a position to claim back GST charged. This option would pose a fiscal risk if an offshore supplier charged GST to a New Zealand business but did not pay the GST to Inland Revenue as the New Zealand business would be entitled to an input tax deduction. Not recommended Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 66 of 74 71. An exception to the broad definition of services is the supply of telecommunication services to New Zealand residents, specifically the supply of international mobile roaming services. Currently, if these services are supplied by a domestic telecommunication provider to a New Zealand resident customer abroad the services are zero-rated. At the time these rules were introduced it was considered that these services were consumed outside of New Zealand, and therefore, should not be subject to GST. 72. Under the proposed framework, where residence is used as a proxy for consumption, these services should be subject to GST as they are considered to be consumed in New Zealand. This would be consistent with the treatment of international mobile roaming services in majority of OECD countries (excluding Australia and Japan). 73. Ministers preference is to retain the current zero-rated treatment of international mobile roaming services, which is consistent with the treatment in Australia, and to keep a watching brief on any further developments in Australia. Registration threshold 74. Establishing a registration threshold for offshore suppliers of services and intangibles is intended to reduce compliance costs for small suppliers and suppliers that do not make many supplies to New Zealand residents. A lower threshold (such as NZD $10,000 of supplies to New Zealand residents over a 12 month period) or a threshold based on the domestic threshold (NZD $60,000 of supplies to New Zealand residents over a 12 month period) could be adopted. 15 Apply the rules only toThis option would This option couldNot recommended digital supplies ofapply GST only to distort consumers’ services and intangiblesdigital services that are decisions on whether to electronically delivered. purchase services Offshore suppliers maythrough digital or non- be more familiar withdigital channels.

Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 67 of 74 IssueO ptionsA dvantagesD isadvantagesR ecom m endations What registration threshold should apply to offshore suppliers of remote services? A registration threshold equal to the domestic registration threshold (NZD $60,000) This option is consistent with the registration threshold that applies to domestic suppliers. This will result in competitive neutrality as offshore suppliers and domestic suppliers will be subject to the same registration requiremnts. This option would also result in lower compliance costs for suppliers that make a relatively small volume of supplies to the New Zealand market. Evidence -from other countries suggests that a small number of large suppliers account for a significant proportion of the total revenue collected from offshore registrants. A higher threshold may increase the incentive for some offshore suppliers to break up their supplies into different entities in order to stay under the registration threshold. A higher registration threshold may be associated with less revenue being collected, as fewer suppliers would be required to register and return GST on their supplies. Recommended A registration threshold that is lower than the domestic registration threshold (for example, NZD $10,000) A lower registration threshold would increase the revenue collected, though this may be outweighed by additional compliance costs for offshore suppliers. A lower threshold would be more consistent with the European Union that has no threshold, and other countries that tend to have low thresholds. A registration threshold that is lower than the domestic registration threshold may reduce the competitive neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers. Not recommended Determining whether a customer is a New Zealand resident 75. The discussion document compared the EU approach, where an offshore supplier is required to determine where a customer has their residence based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence (for example, payment information, customer address, and Internet Protocol (IP) address), with the proposed Australian rules, which would require them to take ‘reasonable steps’ to determine the residency status of the consumer. IssueO ptionsA dvantagesD isadvantagesR ecom m endations How should an offshore supplier determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident? A requirement to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. This option has greater certainty and simplicity for offshore suppliers to apply. This option is also consistent with the rules that apply in the European Union and therefore offshore suppliers are likely to have already developed systems to apply this option. Some offshore suppliers may not have access to two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. To address this issue it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be able to prescribe an alternative method to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident. Recommended 16 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 68 of 74 A requirement to take reasonable steps to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident This option allows more discretion for offshore suppliers to determine the residence of their customers. The option creates uncertainty about what would be acceptable as a “reasonable step” to determine a customer’s residence. This could increase offshore suppliers’ compliance costs. Not recommended Simplified registration and return process 76. The discussion document proposed that offshore suppliers could be required to register under the domestic system or have the option of registering under a simplified “pay only” system. 77. “Pay-only” registration systems are tailored for offshore suppliers that have no GST to claim and make payments only. The main benefit of a pay-only system is that the system can be very simple. Since these offshore suppliers are not claiming any GST they are relatively low-risk from a revenue perspective. The usual checks and balances focussed on ensuring that input tax deductions/refimd claims are correct can be relaxed. The processes and information requirements around registering for GST could also be simplified. IssueO ptionsA dvantagesD isadvantages R ecom m endations What registration system should offshore suppliers be required to use. Simplified ‘pay only’ registration system. A ‘pay only’ registration system may lower compliance costs for suppliers that are in a pay only position. This should encourage compliance with the rules. Administrative systems would be required to be developed. However, the development of a ‘pay only’ system can be incorporated into the Inland Revenue business transformation process. Recommended Domestic registration system. Using the domestic registration system would not require any new administrative systems. New Zealand’s domestic registration system is already, by international standards, very simple to comply with. Offshore suppliers are treated in the same way as domestic suppliers. Offshore suppliers who are only required to return GST will be subject to the same requirements and processes that are in place for suppliers who return and claim GST. This may increase the compliance costs imposed on ‘pay only’ offshore suppliers. The domestic registration system will initially be available until a ‘pay only’ system is developed as part of the Business Transformation Programme. Still available for offshore suppliers that want to return and claim GST. 17 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 69 of 74 Electronic market places 78. To further reduce compliance costs offshore suppliers who supply services via an electronic marketplace would not be required to register and return GST. The marketplace (such as an app store) would instead be treated as the supplier and be required to register. The electronic marketplace is generally in a better position to register and return GST on supplies compared with the underlying supplier. Typically, the electronic marketplace would be larger, better resourced and have a closer relationship with the customer. Requiring the electronic marketplace to register therefore may reduce compliance costs as a large number of smaller suppliers may not be required to register. CONSULTATION 79. The discussion document GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods was released on 18 August 2015, and sought public feedback on the proposal to require offshore suppliers of services and intangibles to register and return the GST along with a number of key design features. 80. A number of telephone conferences were held with members of the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD and the Tax Executives Institute (Indirect Tax chapter). This included a number of representatives of offshore suppliers that supply to the global marketplace, and therefore have experience with the offshore supplier registration systems that have been adopted in other countries. 81. A total of 76 submissions were received in response to the discussion document. The proposals in the discussion document were received well, with most submissions supporting the proposed approach for taxing cross-border services and intangibles. A strong theme was the importance of minimising compliance costs for offshore suppliers, to maximise compliance and reduce the risk the rules could restrict the supply of services and intangibles to New Zealand. 82. Of the 76 submissions, 23 were from individuals (30%), 8 were from offshore businesses and professional associations (11%), and 25 were from New Zealand businesses and professional associations (40%). An additional 15 submissions followed a standard form provided by a domestic industry representative. 83. The table below outlines the some of the initial proposals contained in the discussion document, the submissions received on the proposal and the recommend action following consideration of the submissions: Initial proposalSubmissions Preferred approach Basic framework of the rules The discussion document proposed that supplies of remote services and intangibles by an offshore supplier to New Zealand-resident consumers will be subject to GST. A broad definition of “services” was proposed, which includes both digital services and more 78% of submissions agreed with the proposal for services and intangibles, with 92% of submissions on the point supporting a distinction between “remote” and “on- the-spot” services. 81% of submissions agreed with a broad definition of services. The proposal in the discussion document should be retained. 18 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 70 of 74 traditional services. Supplies to New Zealand registered businesses Submissions were sought on whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST when they supply services and intangibles remotely to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. 90% of submissions supported excluding supplies to GST- registered businesses. Supplies of remote services and intangibles to GST- registered businesses should not be subject to GST, unless the supplier and recipient agree that the supply is zero­ rated. Registration threshold The discussion document sought submissions on the level of the registration threshold, specifically whether a lower threshold (such as $10,000) or a threshold based on the domestic registration threshold ($60,000) is preferred. 19 submissions preferred a nil threshold, 1 submission preferred a $10,000 threshold and 20 submissions preferred the domestic registration threshold of $60,000 or higher. 9 submissions considered that the threshold should not count supplies to GST-registered businesses. Offshore suppliers should be required to register when their total supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceed $60,000. Identifying whether a customer is resident in New Zealand The discussion document compared the European Union (EU) rules, where an offshore supplier is required to determine place of residence based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence, with the proposed Australia rules, which require ‘reasonable steps’ to be taken. Offshore suppliers expressed a preference for rules that provide certainty and use commercially available information, including the EU rules. Submissions requested extra flexibility where two non-conflicting pieces of information are not available. It is proposed that offshore suppliers be able to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would also be able to prescribe an alternative method, in cases where two pieces of non­ conflicting evidence are not commercially available. New Zealand GST-registered businesses inadvertently charged GST If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, the business would be required to seek a refund from them, rather than claim a deduction in their GST return. 4 submissions supported this proposal, 6 submissions argued that if a registered business is incorrectly charged GST, they should be entitled to claim an input tax deduction in their GST return. If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, they should seek a refund from the supplier. If the value of the supply is less than $1,000, the offshore supplier could instead provide a tax invoice which would allow the GST-registered purchaser to claim back the GST in their normal GST return. 84. A strong theme was the importance of minimising compliance costs for offshore suppliers, to maximise compliance and reduce the risk that the rules could restrict the supply 19 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 71 of 74 of services and intangibles to New Zealand. This risk has been mitigated by designing the rules to make it as easy as possible for offshore suppliers to comply, which will be complemented by simplified registration and return processes. In addition, the registration threshold would prevent many small suppliers from being required to register under the rules. 85. In response to submissions, several legislative requirements would be relaxed to further reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers, who would: • not be required to issue tax invoices, as supplies of GST-registered businesses would not be subject to GST at the 15% rate; • generally be able to make adjustments in their GST return to take into account refunds of inadvertently charged GST to GST-registered business customers, within two years of the original supply; and • have an automatic exception from the requirement to keep records in New Zealand and to keep records in English. 86. Recent amendments require an offshore supplier to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number, in order to ensure that an offshore person is first subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. Offshore suppliers should be excluded from this requirement in order to reduce the compliance costs associated with registering for GST. 87. Currently, registered businesses are required to express amounts in New Zealand dollars at the time of supply. As offshore suppliers often charge customers in a foreign currency, this would involve significant compliance and transaction costs. Therefore, this requirement would be relaxed, allowing offshore suppliers to elect to convert amounts into NZD at the time of filing their return. A two year Tock-in’ rule would ensure that an offshore supplier could not gain an advantage from switching between these methods. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 88. The recommended option is to implement option one as outlined in this RIS, specifically offshore suppliers or an offshore electronic marketplace would be required to register and return GST on remote services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident consumers. Offshore suppliers would only be required to register if their total supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceeded $60,000 in a 12-month period, unless the offshore supplier is only making supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. 89. A broad definition of services would be adopted that would apply GST to all cross­ border supplies of remote services and intangibles (this would include digital services and more traditional services, such as legal and accounting services). This approach is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. Offshore suppliers would be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence, or to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method. 90. Supplies of remote services and intangibles to GST-registered businesses should not be subject to GST, unless the offshore supplier and GST-registered recipient agree to zero-rate the supply. The option to zero-rate these supplies will allow non-resident businesses to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making these supplies, which ensures GST is neutral for these businesses. 20 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 72 of 74 91. Out of the options considered, option one best achieves the objectives and is consistent with draft OECD guidelines on taxing cross-border services and intangibles, as well as being consistent with international practice. When similar rules have been applied in other countries anecdotal evidence is that they have been relatively successful at collecting the forgone GST. To generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand the recommended option aims to adopt similar and consistent rules with the rules that apply in other countries. 92. Given the simplicity of the New Zealand GST system, the rules should be relatively simply to comply with compared with other countries that have different GST/VAT rates and multiple exemptions. This should further promote compliance with the rules. IMPLEMENTATION 93. Minsters’ preference is to implement the rules on 1 October 2016. Considering legislation is expected to be introduced in November 2015 (and if that legislation is enacted in the first half of 2016), this timeframe should give offshore supplies around 6 months to adapt their systems to comply with the new rules. This timeframe is consistent with submissions that suggested that offshore suppliers would need at least 6 months to adapt their systems depending upon the complexity of the rules. If there is a delay in the enactment of the legislation there is a risk that some offshore suppliers may not have enough time to adapt their system to comply with the new rules. 94. To implement the proposals, Inland Revenue is developing a simplified registration system that will be tailored to the requirements of offshore suppliers, informed by best practice in other countries and the recommendations in the draft OECD guidelines. 95. A simplified ‘pay only’ GST return will be developed as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. The system for processing GST returns is scheduled to be replaced with a new system during the first quarter of 2017. Therefore, it is proposed that offshore suppliers could initially begin with a default six-monthly taxable period, running from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017. This would mean the first return offshore suppliers will file will use the simplified ‘pay only’ GST return. 96. A default six-monthly taxable period would also provide a ‘soft start’ to the new rules, for example, if an offshore supplier is late to register for GST, they would be able to backdate their registration to 1 October 2016 for up to six months without interest or penalties. During this interim period, two-monthly filing could also be allowed as an option as otherwise offshore suppliers may face foreign exchange risk during the longer 6-month period. 97. From 1 April 2017, offshore suppliers would file quarterly. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers as quarterly filing periods align with filing requirements for equivalent rules in other jurisdictions. 98. Compliance costs can be further minimised by releasing clear and helpful guidance as to the operation of the new rules. Inland Revenue resources will be allocated to develop and provide tailored educational material that will be easily accessible to offshore suppliers. 21 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 73 of 74 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 99. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 100. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post­ implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 22 Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill Disclosure Statement and Regulatory Impact Statements Page 74 of 74
Regulatory Impact Statement Implementing the tax provisions for community housing entities Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is what mechanism should be used to set the level of the income threshold for determining whether a person qualifies as an “eligible recipient” of a community housing entity. This is one of the tests for detennining eligibility for the current income tax exemption and donee status for community housing entities in the Income Tax Act 2007. The current tax provisions in question are intended to apply to a small number of housing providers who provide affordable homeownership products aimed at low-income households. These provisions were intended to address the tax treatment of providers considered to be at risk of losing their charitable status by being deregistered by Charities Services. After engagement with the housing sector and individual providers, it is clear the current mechanism for setting the income threshold - which refers to the lower quartile of household income - is considered too restrictive. This will mean the current tax provisions for housing providers are unlikely to apply to those who will potentially be deregistered as a charity by Charities Services. As a result, Ministers asked officials from Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Inland Revenue to provide advice on alternative mechanisms for setting higher income thresholds in order to implement the current tax provisions. Targeted consultation with housing sector representatives including the umbrella organisation, Community Housing Aotearoa, has helped to define the problem and formulate options. In addition, feedback received in submissions to the select committee when it considered the current tax provisions also helped to shape the options discussed in this paper. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been closely involved in the design of the options. Inland Revenue has not been able to determine how many providers are likely to be covered by the options and their eligibility for the current tax provisions. This is because Charities Services has not finalised its decisions on who should be deregistered. Even if we assumed all of the potentially affected providers would be deregistered we do not have sufficient information on the eligibility criteria that providers use to determine their recipients (for example, maximum income levels). We did not contact all potentially affected providers because of the risk of creating confusion around the eligibility of providers’ charitable and tax status. As a consequence, we are unable to quantify the full impacts of the options. The absence of this information is a constraint on our analysis. A time constraint also exists in relation to the legislative vehicle for any of the options requiring legislative amendment. It is preferable that any legislative amendment be included in next available tax bill to enable the Government to implement the current tax provisions and provide much needed certainty of tax treatment for affected housing providers and to reduce their costs. 2 There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Mike Nutsfor/ Policy Mana; Inland Revenue ^Policy and Strategy 10 June 2015 3 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Tax provisions relating to community housing entities 1. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances and Remedial Matters) Act was enacted on 30 June 2014. It conferred income tax exemption and donee status for certain community housing providers (referred to as community housing entities or CHEs). Cabinet’s original intention was to provide a specific income tax exemption (and donee status) for a small number for CHEs that could be deregistered as charities because they provide affordable homeownership products aimed at low-income households. \[CAB Min (13) 37/10 refers\], 2. The policy rationale for granting the income tax exemption and donee status to these entities is set out in a previous RIS entitled Tax Treatment of community housing providers (23 October 2013). That RIS included advice on time-limiting the tax exemption for the affected housing providers. 3. Although the CHE tax provisions have been enacted, a regulation by Order in Council is required to specify the criteria for determining who can qualify as an eligible recipient of a CHE and bring the tax provisions into force. 4. The Minister for Social Housing and the Minister of Revenue are jointly responsible for making recommendations on the persons (or types of person) that CHEs can support in order to be eligible for the income tax exemption and donee status. 5. Section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out that the “eligible recipients” of a CHE can be defined by reference to all or some, or a combination of all or some, of the following parameters: • geographic location. • the composition of the household. • the income of persons or households relative to an “income maximum”, where: o the income maximum should be set by taking into account household income at the lower quartile based on data from the Household Economic Survey (HES), and o the income maximum can be adjusted by any appropriate economic factor, geographic, household composition, or otherwise. • the assets of persons relative to a maximum. 6. To be eligible, providers must ensure that at least 85 percent of their eligible recipients, at the time they first become an eligible recipient, satisfy the qualifying criteria set out in the regulation. 7. Difficulties in agreeing the qualifying criteria stalled the promulgation of the regulation needed to bring the income tax exemption and donee status into force. The main barrier to finalising the regulation to date has been the maximum income threshold. 4 8. Since the CHE tax provisions were enacted in June 2014, we have consulted with the housing sector’s umbrella organisation (Community Housing Aotearoa) and individual housing providers. These discussions identified that affected providers are assisting low to moderate income families. Affected providers have indicated that households they assist can have a gross household income somewhere in the range of 70 percent to 125 percent of Auckland’s Area Median Income (AMI). In 2013, Auckland’s AMI was $75,816 per annum.1 The lower quartile national average income for the same period was $35,700 and the lower quartile of household income in the Auckland region ranged from $21,000 to $64,000 (depending on the size of the household). This means that most affected providers will not qualify for the income tax exemption or donee status if the threshold remains set at the lower quartile of household income. 9. We note that these providers assist people on incomes above the lower quartile of household income because this is the level of income required to sustain a mortgage over the long-term. Households with income in the lower quartile will more than likely require social rental assistance, rather than assistance into homeowner ship. 10. Officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Treasury and Inland Revenue have spent the past 12 months exploring ways to increase the current income threshold within the current regulation-making provision of section 225D, but have concluded that increases are outside the scope of the provision due to the reference to the lower quartile of household income. In order to increase the threshold, legislative change would be required. 11. In addition, Ministers recently revisited an earlier option that would recognise CHEs as having a “charitable purpose” for their housing activities (including homeownership products). However, this option did not proceed \[CAB Min (15) 10/10 refers\]. This option would have meant that providers would have retained their charitable status and eligibility for the existing charities-related income tax exemption, and so the specific CHE income tax exemption would not have been necessary. 12. Following this decision, Ministers asked officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Inland Revenue to report on alternative mechanisms for increasing the income threshold in order to give effect to the current tax provisions. 13. This RIS is concerned with the implementation of the current income tax exemption and donee status for CHEs in the Income Tax Act 2007. Specifically, it deals with the question of what mechanism should be used to set the level of the income threshold for determining whether a person is an eligible recipient of a community housing entity for tax purposes. Affected providers have advised the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment that they work with families with an income range (based on gross household income) of anywhere between $50,000 and $95,000, depending on household size and circumstances. However, the impact of Working for Family tax credits, other tax credits and Government assistance that the banks recognise as income, can mean that large families earn above this. 5 OBJECTIVES 14. The key objectives are: a) Scope - the income threshold should ensure that the CHE tax provisions are appropriately targeted to those providers and eligible recipients that the Government seeks to support. b) Consistency with existing housing assistance mechanisms - as far as practicable, the income threshold should relate to existing mechanisms relating to homeownership assistance to ensure consistency across Government programmes and to help minimise administration costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for providers. c) Housing affordability stress - the income threshold should reflect some measure of housing affordability stress. d) Administrative simplicity - the income threshold should be simple for Inland Revenue to administer and not impose unnecessary complexity and cost. e) Compliance friendly - the income threshold should be easy to comply with by providers and not impose unnecessary complexity and cost. 15. We note there may need to be trade-offs across the objectives. For example, linking the income threshold to housing affordability stress (objective c) may increase both administrative and compliance complexity (objectives d and e). 16. A time constraint exists in relation to the legislative vehicle for any of the options requiring legislative amendment. We understand that many providers, whether they are providing homeownership products or not, are currently seeking expensive financial advice on how they should structure their business if they were to lose their charitable status. It is, therefore, preferable a legislative amendment be implemented as soon as possible so that Ministers can implement the CHE tax provisions and provide much needed certainty of tax treatment for affected housing providers in a timely manner. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 17. Two options and the status quo have been considered for addressing the problem definition and achieving the stated objectives. The options are: • Option 1: Accommodation Supplement (AS) - set income threshold by reference to the AS income levels. • Option 2: KiwiSaver HomeStart - set income threshold by reference to the KiwiSaver HomeStart income levels. 18. A detailed description of each option and their advantages and disadvantages are set out below.2 2 We note also that other options were considered such as using median household income levels but these options lacked a robust basis and did not relate well to the other government housing programmes such as the accommodation supplement or the KiwiSaver HomeStart. 6 Option 1 - Accommodation Supplement 19. Using the AS criteria would set different income thresholds based on household composition and geographic region (see Appendix 1 for further details). Under this approach, a couple with children living in Auckland would be able to earn more than a couple without children living in Gore. This is because the AS income thresholds reflect housing affordability issues in particular regions. 20. The main advantages of this approach are it: • extends the potential coverage of the CHE tax provisions, as the income thresholds are higher; • protects the integrity of the tax system to some extent, as these income thresholds ensure those earning above the specified income thresholds cannot receive assistance; • provides consistency across Government programmes aimed at homeownership assistance; and • is equitable, as it ensures that assistance is targeted to providers working in areas with housing affordability issues. 21. The main disadvantages of this approach are: • it sets income thresholds higher than Cabinet originally intended (i.e., lower quartile of household income); • the sector advises that most affected providers will not qualify under this option as many of their clients earn above these levels (depending on geographic area) and this may in turn: - reduce the number of providers available to support the Social Housing Reform Programme; - displace tenants if providers have to sell houses to cover their tax liability; - force providers to repay capital grants and loans if houses are sold to cover tax debt - Social Housing Fund and HNZ’s Housing Innovation Fund grants and suspensory loans; • although the income thresholds for AS are updated annually, the geographic areas have not been reviewed for some time and do not necessarily accurately reflect current housing affordability issues in particular areas; • it is potentially difficult to administer and determine eligibility as there are different income levels for different family sizes in different geographical areas; and • for large providers that work in different geographical areas, it is resource intensive - they will have to determine which of their clients fall within the 7 income threshold for the area they live in and whether 85 percent or less of their clients are eligible recipients. Option 2 - KiwiSaver HomeStart 22. KiwiSaver HomeStart provides financial assistance to first-home buyers who meet specified criteria, including income thresholds of $80,000 for a single person and $120,000 for two or more borrowers. Adopting this approach would mean using the HomeStart income thresholds to determine the eligible recipients. 23. The main advantages of this approach are that it: • extends the potential coverage of the CHE tax provisions further than option 1 3 and the status quo, as the income thresholds are higher; • protects the integrity of the tax system to some extent, as these income thresholds ensure those earning above the specified income thresholds cannot receive assistance; • provides consistency across Government programmes aimed at homeownership assistance; • is supported by the sector; • sets income thresholds at the minimum level to enable innovation, growth and delivery of affordable homes; and • is easy to implement and administer on an ongoing basis. 24. The main disadvantages of this approach are: • it sets higher income thresholds than Cabinet originally intended; • it does not reflect housing affordability issues. For example, under this option a single person on $80,000 living in Gore would be entitled to assistance, whereas a single parent earning $81,000 with five children living in Auckland would not be; and • there is still a risk that some providers will not qualify for the CHE tax provisions, which may mean: - a reduced number of providers available to support the Social Housing Reform Programme; - potential displacement of tenants if providers have to sell houses to cover their tax liability; J For example, a large household comprised of two adults and six children may have a gross household income of $105,000, including Working for Families and other tax credits, but they face the same barriers to accessing affordable housing as a smaller-sized household, particularly in less affordable markets such as Auckland. This family would still remain within this income threshold, and not threaten the provider’s income tax exemption or donee status. 8 - providers are forced to repay capital grants and loans if houses are sold to cover tax debt (Social Housing Fund and HNZ’s Housing Innovation Fund grants and suspensory loans). Option 3 - status quo 25. If the status quo were maintained, the regulation would be set by Order in Council. This means the income threshold would be based on the lower quartile of household income and most affected providers will not qualify for the income tax exemption or donee status for CHEs. We consider that the status quo is not sustainable. Summary of analysis of the options and status quo 26. Our analysis of the options and status quo is summarised in the table below. 9 Table: Summary of analysis Option Meets objectives a, b, c, d or e? Impacts Net impact Fiscal/economic impact Administrative and compliance impacts Risks 1 - Accommodation supplement Partially meets a. Fully meets b, and c. Tax system Additional fiscal cost o f $500,000 per annum. No additional administrative costs - this option is as complex as the status quo. Medium risk of some affected housing providers being ineligible for the income tax exemption and donee status if the income threshold is linked to accommodation supplement income levels. Does not address the problem definition and meets three o f the five objectives. CHEs Some affected housing providers will have future tax costs because their recipients will be on incomes above the threshold. No additional compliance costs - this option is as complex as the status quo. 2 - KiwiSaver HomeStart Partially meets c. Fully meets a, b, d and e. Tax system Additional fiscal cost o f $500,000 per annum. Administrative savings for Inland Revenue from having fewer income thresholds to observe. Low risk o f some affected housing providers being ineligible for the income tax exemption and donee status if the income threshold is linked to the KiwiSaver HomeStart income levels. Does not take into account housing affordability stress. Addresses the problem definition and meets four of the five objectives. This is the option preferred by officials. CHEsMost if not all affected providers will qualify for the income tax exemption and donee status because their recipients will be on incomes below the threshold. Tax compliance cost savings for eligible CHEs as they will have fewer income thresholds to observe. Improved taxpayer certainty. 3 - Lower quartile of household income (status quo) NoneTax system A fiscal gain o f $2.4 million. See comment on next page. Nil. High risk o f all affected housing providers being ineligible for the income tax exemption and donee status if the income threshold is linked to lower quartile of household income levels. Does not address the problem definition and does not meet the objectives. CHEs Potentially all affected housing providers will have future tax costs because their recipients will be on incomes above the threshold. Nil. 10 Quantifying the impacts 27. Inland Revenue has not been able to determine how many providers are likely to be covered by the options and their eligibility for the CHE tax provisions. This is because Charities Services has not finalised its decisions on who should be deregistered. Even if we assumed all of the potentially affected providers would be deregistered we do not have sufficient information on provider eligibility criteria for their recipients. We did not contact all potentially affected providers because of the risk of creating confusion around the eligibility of providers charitable and tax status. As a consequence, we are unable to quantify the full impacts of the options. The absence of this information is a constraint on our analysis. 28. When agreed to in October 2013, the CHE tax provisions allowed for an annual fiscal cost of $2.4 million \[CAB Min (13) 37/10 refers\]. This estimate included a cost of $2.3 million per year due to income tax foregone under the tax exemption, and $0.1 million per year for tax relief on donations made to eligible CHEs. As we no longer expect any entities to qualify for the tax exemption under a lower quartile income threshold, option 3 (the status quo) is expected to return this $2.4 million tax revenue per year to the Crown. 29. However, the income thresholds for options 1 and 2 are expected to be broad enough to assist the group of entities that were originally intended to be covered, and one further entity who had been deregistered as a charity. As a result, both options 1 and 2 are expected to reinstate the original annual fiscal cost of $2.4 million, as well as incurring an additional fiscal cost of $0.5 million per year. This additional fiscal cost ($0.5 million) relates to the estimated loss in tax revenue from one already deregistered provider that we know of being eligible for the income tax exemption. Social, environment or cultural impacts of all options 30. Providing support to affordable homeownership providers could have the following social benefits: • reduces pressure on the rental market; • households achieve more permanent housing solutions - households that are assisted may have been very transient in their quest to find suitable rental accommodation options. Increased stability through homeownership could mean households are more inclined to become active members of their community, have more permanent access to education and employment options; and • depending on requirements of the CHE, it supports households who are able to sustain a mortgage long-term but are unable to save enough for a deposit. 31. There are no environmental or cultural impacts associated with the options considered above. 11 Additional eligibility criteria - assets cap 32. Part of the eligibility criteria outlined in section 225D is the inclusion of an asset test to provide further protections from the asset rich/cash poor utilising affordable homeownership schemes. We first discussed the merits of an asset cap in the Tax Treatment of community housing providers RIS (23 October 2013). 33. For reasons of consistency and administrative ease we support the use of the KiwiSaver HomeStart asset cap. The KiwiSaver HomeStart asset cap is as follows: • first-home buyers - no asset cap applies; • for those who have previously owned a house, but their financial position means they are now in a similar position to a first-home buyer (and require an affected provider to assist them into homeownership), the asset cap4 are as follows: $110,000 Auckland $90,000 Hamilton City, Tauranga City, W estern Bay o f Plenty District, Kapiti Coast District, Porirua City, Upper Hutt City, Hutt City, W ellington City, Nelson City, Tasman District, W aimakariri District, Christchurch City, Selwyn District, Queenstown Lakes District $70,000 Rest o f New Zealand 34. The asset cap could be included in the primary legislation (section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007) as part of the eligibility criteria for providers to access the current tax provisions. 35. The sector has not been consulted on the asset cap since the legislation enacting the income tax exemption was before the select committee in February 2014. At the time they opposed the use of both an income threshold and an asset test as part of the eligibility criteria. If the asset cap is included in the proposed Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) (see implementation section of this paper), there will not be an opportunity for formal consultation with the sector on this issue. Therefore, we propose to consult informally with Community Housing Aotearoa and other bodies as appropriate on the proposed SOP. CONSULTATION 36. The options considered in this RIS were developed in consultation with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Treasury. In addition, the sector has been closely involved with this process over the last two years. 4 Realisable assets (as defined by HNZC) are: money in bank accounts (including fixed and term deposits); shares, stocks and bonds; investments in banks or financial institutions; any money paid to, or held by, the real estate agent or solicitor as a deposit on a home; boat or caravan (if the value is over $5,000); other vehicles (such as classic motorbikes or cars - not being used as your usual method of transport); and other assets valued over $5,000. 12 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s view 37. MBIE supports raising the income threshold and setting it by reference to the KiwiSaver HomeStart levels (option 2). The sector has been facing uncertainty over their charitable and tax status since the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust decision of the High Court in 2011. They have received a number of promises from Ministers that this issue will be resolved to enable them to fully participate in the Social Housing Reform Programme and assist families into affordable homeownership. There is a level o f expectation on part of providers that these promises will be met. Implementing a tax treatment with an income level less than KiwiSaver HomeStart will not capture all affected providers and is likely to be viewed by the sector as a broken promise. On the ground, this could jeopardise a number of existing housing developments such as Waimahia Inlet. 38. Affected providers offer affordable homeownership schemes to families who may be in a position to transition out of social housing along the housing continuum into a rent- to-buy scheme. This could potentially free-up valuable social houses for other families in high housing need. Treasury’s view 39. Treasury’s first preference is for time-limited assistance to providers that are de­ registered as a charity and registered with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority, as opposed to an extension of the tax exemption. However, given the history and the expectation of providers, Treasury supports an extension of the income threshold to KiwiSaver HomeStart levels (option 2) as a pragmatic solution to resolve the issue. Sector consultation 40. The housing sector’s umbrella organisation is Community Housing Aotearoa (CHA). CHA is strongly opposed to the use of any income and/or asset test as part of the eligibility criteria, because they do not believe that the lower quartile of household income will capture providers that may rely on the income tax exemption. CHA’s first preference is to amend the Charities Act 2005, to confer charitable status on providers offering affordable homeownership. Now that this option is no longer available, CHA has indicated that if an option has to include an income threshold, its preference would be one based on KiwiSaver HomeStart (option 2). 41. CHA wants the income threshold to be set at a level that supports growth and innovation in the sector, which will deliver new entry-level housing supply through projects such as Waimahia Inlet. CHA believes that the KiwiSaver HomeStart income levels are the minimum needed to achieve this. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 42. Of the options discussed in this RIS, Inland Revenue favours using the KiwiSaver HomeStart income thresholds (option 2) on the basis that it is well-principled and represents a pragmatic solution, should Ministers seek to achieve both tax policy and 13 housing policy objectives. Using the KiwiSaver HomeStart income thresholds would mean lower compliance costs for providers and their recipients and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, compared with options 1 and 3. IMPLEMENTATION 43. The status quo (option 3) does not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required if the income threshold is to be raised (options 1 and 2). In addition, a legislative change is required to include an assets cap in the eligibility criteria. 44. Any amendments to give effect to either option 1 or option 2 could be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of Whole stage of the Bill. The Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee and is due to be reported back to the House at the end of August 2015. Although this approach will enable legislative changes to be made quickly to provide much needed certainty for potentially affected providers, there will be no opportunity to consult formally on the proposed changes. 45. Inland Revenue will communicate any legislative tax changes to CHEs and their advisors through its existing channels, such as the Tax Information Bulletin and by updating its guides. 46. Inland Revenue and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment will work together to ensure that there is guidance and information available to affected providers about the legislative changes and to help them transition to the new tax rules. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 47. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes to the Tax Acts to give effect to the specific tax exemption or the donee organisation change. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 48.

Regulatory Impact Statement Addressing child support legacy debt AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The statement provides an analysis of options to strengthen the child support scheme reforms enacted in 2013 (not yet in force) and scheduled for amendment in 2015 to recognise the increased priority of reducing child support legacy debt. Analysis focuses on increasing incentives to pay debt and improving flexibility for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to negotiate payment arrangements and more pragmatically manage the legacy debt book. The decision to introduce the child support reforms was accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) Child support scheme reform of 26 July 2011. A review of the child support reforms in the context of benefits, implementation costs, and child support debt reduction was accompanied by a RIS Review of child support scheme reform of 4 June 2014. The earlier RIS’ contain background information and analysis that is useful to the options considered in this RIS. There was consultation with a range of Government agencies and significant public consultation on child support issues over a long period of time culminating in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. There was limited consultation on the subsequent options in the RIS Review of child support scheme reform given timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the decisions being considered. There has been limited consultation on the options in this statement for the same reasons. Some assumptions have been made on the number of people who may be affected by aspects of the reforms yet to come into force and the likely impact on compliance behaviour, based on existing administrative data. These assumptions affect analysis on the impact on the debt book. ■ A time constraint exists for the recommended option as the option is designed to support the child support reforms scheduled for amendment through the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the Bill) that was introduced on 26 February 2015. The ability for Inland Revenue to deliver the recommended option relies on the option being reflected in the Bill and the scope, timing and drafting of the option remaining unchanged throughout the legislative process. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. . Cl lion Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 07 May 2015 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. As at 31 December 2014, the New Zealand child support scheme was providing financial support for around 201,500 children. There were 134,500 receiving carers and 133,400 liable parents with current liabilities. There are 42,200 liable parents who have no current liability but have debt. Of the liable parents, 120,600 are in debt. 2. The scheme was established by the Child Support Act 1991, which revised the rules relating to child maintenance when agreement between parents proved difficult or when the receiving carer was a beneficiary. The Child Support Act 1991 sets out the requirements for applying for child support, the means of determining liability, and processes for payments and objections. 3. The child support scheme is administered by Inland Revenue, which is responsible for both assessing contributions and collecting payments. The child support scheme is voluntary for parents unless the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit or Unsupported Child Benefit. The majority of people in the child support scheme are beneficiaries. Reasons for the review of the 1991 scheme 4. Although the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents (and therefore children). 5. The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the liable parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving carer is the main care provider. The formula assessment is therefore focused on the liable parent and their ability to pay. However, today when parents live apart, there is an increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and both parents remaining actively involved in their children’s lives. Work participation rates of both parents, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work or seeking paid work. 6. Escalating levels of accumulated child support debt, relating in particular to child support penalties, is increasingly becoming an issue. Child support debt now exceeds $3.2 billion, with 78% of the amount being penalties. 7. The scheme is now, in many cases, out of date and out of line with social expectations. This undermines some parents’ incentives to meet their child support obligations and therefore detrimental to the wellbeing of their children. Original policy problems 8. The child support scheme was reformed in 2013 to address the main policy problems identified at the time. These included: • whether the current child support system accurately reflects the expenditure for raising children in varying family circumstances in New Zealand; • whether greater levels of shared care and other regular care should be taken into account when calculating child support; 2 • whether both parents’ income should be taken into account when calculating the child support to be paid; • whether incentives to make payments can be improved by changing the child support penalty rules and write-off provisions. 9. The main change of the 2013 reforms has been to shift the focus of the child support formula assessment from assessing the liability of the liable parent, to focusing on the level of support that is required from each parent for each qualifying child. In doing so, it considers a greater range of shared care, the income of all parents of the child (including legal step-parents), and the average cost of raising the child (taking into account other children of the parents). At the same time, changes were made to the general administrative processes and rules around payments and debts to improve incentives for liable parents to make timely payments. 10. More information on the background and the reasons for reviewing the 1991 scheme can be found in the earlier RIS Child support scheme reform prepared by Inland Revenue for the original reforms, dated 26 July 2011 and released November 2011 (see http://taxpolicv.ird.govt.nz/publications/tvpe/ris'). The RIS also considered the problems with the 1991 scheme, the consultation undertaken and analysis of the options for addressing the problems. Child Support Amendment Act 2013 11. Following consultation on a range of options, the child support scheme was amended by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (Amendment Act). 12. The Amendment Act comes into effect from different dates. The application, formula assessment and notification process came into effect from 1 April 2015 (first phase of changes). These changes specifically address the first three bullet points of the original policy problems. The changes to the payment process, penalties and debt come into effect on enactment date or on or after 1 April 2016, along with other policy changes (second phase of changes)1. These changes specifically address the last bullet point of the original policy problems. 13. Further detail on the 1991 scheme and the 2013 scheme and the consultation undertaken can be found on Inland Revenue’s websites, including the Tax Policy website (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport/) . Review of child support policy work programme 14. The child support policy work programme was reviewed in June 2014 and Cabinet agreed to re-focus the child support reforms on reducing the size and growth in child support debt. Key changes in the reform include a fairer assessment formula, reducing penalty rates, and providing measures to better manage the debt book. Further information on the review can be found in the RIS Review of child support scheme reform. 15. At that same time, Cabinet also noted that officials would conduct further analysis on the debt book with a view to developing targeted strategies to address the older legacy debt. 1 Changes to liabilities for prisoner and long-term hospital patients came into effect on 1 April 2014. These were small changes that required no system changes to implement. There are also transitional provisions that came into effect from date of Royal assent. 3 Problem definition Child support debt 16. Table 1 below summarises the debt book to 31 December 2014 and shows a debtor split between domestic and international (Australia and other countries) debt and the total debt split across assessed debt and penalty (both 10% initial late payment and 2% monthly incremental) debt. Table 1: Debt book summary to 31 December 2014 Debtors Assessed Child Support $ 10% Initial Late Payment Penalty $ ' 2% M onthly Incremental Penalty $ ‘ Total Debt $ Domestic 91,255 350,281,173 54,427,8061,053,068,2951,457,777,274 Australia 19,138 211,258,26019,523,931570,073,302800,855,494 Other International2 10,160146,289,712 16,942,411 766,076,600929,308,723 Total120,553707,829,145 90,894,1482,389,218,198 3,187,941,490 17. Analysis shows that escalating levels of accumulated child support debt, relating particularly to penalties, is increasingly becoming an issue. 78% of the debt is related to penalties and is 97% impaired (not expected to be collected). 18. There are two types of late payment penalties charged to outstanding debt amounts: • Initial late payment penalties. Imposed on any unpaid balance of assessment immediately following the due date at a rate of 10% (or $5.00, whichever is greater). • Incremental late payment penalties. Imposed monthly (following the initial late payment penalty) on any unpaid amounts (inclusive of existing penalties) at a rate of 2%. ... The penalty regime creates an effective penalty rate of 37% within the first 18 months. 19. Although the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) has a wide range of debt collection tools to apply across the compliance spectrum within the debt book, the inflationary nature of penalties over time has resulted in high levels of debt. While a penalty regime may be an appropriate part of any compliance model it should not unfairly or unreasonably penalise people. Research suggests that when debt reaches certain levels ($10,000 or half as much again as the original amount) the debt level becomes a disincentive to pay and people disengage from their debt. 20. The Amendment Act goes some way to addressing the issue of child support legacy debt by providing some incentive for liable parents to enter into instalment arrangements for their debt and comply with those arrangements. In addition, changes to reduce penalty rates and allow for debt write-offs are expected to reduce debt from 2016. 2 ‘Other International’ includes the collection of debts owed by liable parents residing in New Zealand for the Australian Department of Human Services. 4 21. However, further analysis of the debt book shows that the penalty regime - post­ reform- would not be flexible enough to address the legacy debt. This largely results from legislative constraints on incentives for liable parents to pay their assessment debt and on the Commissioner’s ability to negotiate payment arrangements and pragmatically manage the debt book to address legacy debt. Child support legacy debt remains a problem. 22. Further measures are needed to improve flexibility for the CIR to negotiate payment arrangements for child support debt and more pragmatically manage the older legacy debt. OBJECTIVES 23. The objectives of further measures are to: a) Reduce child support legacy debt; b) Encourage parents to pay their financial support obligations; c) Provide more flexibility for the CIR to negotiate payment arrangements and more pragmatically manage the child support debt book; and d) Promote the welfare of the children, in particular by recognising that children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, or not paid on time. 24. High levels of debt can discourage liable parents from meeting their obligations leading to non-compliance and child support not being paid on time. A more responsive system with a better targeted payment and penalties system would encourage, or at least not discourage, parents to pay their child support, reduce debt and would help improve the well­ being of their children. Constraints 25. A time constraint exists for the recommended option as the option is designed to support the child support reforms scheduled for amendment through the Bill that was introduced on 26 February 2015. The ability for Inland Revenue to deliver the recommended option relies on the option being reflected in the Bill and the scope, timing and drafting of the option remaining unchanged throughout the legislative process. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. 26. This time constraint also impacts on the ability to consult and gather information. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 27. Two options have been considered to meet the objectives and address the policy problem. These options are described and analysed below. Option 1 - Status quo 28. The status quo continues with the reforms focused on reducing child support debt as amended and detailed in the RIS Review of child support scheme reform. 5 29. Under this option, debt would be reduced through changes to penalty rates, incentivising liable parents to enter into payment arrangements and relaxing the penalty rules to provide the CIR with some flexibility to better manage the debt book. 30. The reforms specifically include: • A penalty write-off incentive for liable parents to enter into an instalment arrangement covering assessment debt and initial late payment penalties; • For liable parents who default on their first payment of child support, an initial late payment penalty write-off incentive to enter into and comply with an instalment arrangement (effectively applies to new debt); • Relaxing the circumstances in which the CIR can write off penalties (but still subject to stringent tests). 31. The status quo only partially meets the objectives and addresses the policy problem as further analysis of the debt book shows that the penalty regime - post-reform - would not be flexible enough to address the legacy debt. This largely results from legislative constraints on incentives for liable parents to pay their assessment debt and on the Commissioner’s ability to negotiate payment arrangements and pragmatically manage the debt book to address legacy debt. Option 2 - Additional measures to address child support legacy debt 32. Prior to the child support reforms the high, compounding penalty rates for child support debt combined with the low incomes of many liable parents has resulted in penalties that are disproportionate to the originally assessed debt. The measures below aim to permit a fairer treatment of the accumulated penalties faced by liable parents so as to encourage them to focus on repayment of their obligations to pay financial support for their children. The proposals aim to promote the welfare of children by recognising that children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, or not paid on time. 33. The additional measures would strengthen the second phase of the child support reforms currently being developed, require minimal systems changes and additional resource, and would be funded internally by Inland Revenue. 34. The measures proposed are : • Extension of the mandatory write-off of monthly incremental penalties for payment arrangements subject to 26 week review to payment arrangements where a liable person has not explicitly agreed to the arrangement; • Amendment to the discretionary penalty write-off tests to adopt a more pragmatic test based on “fair and reasonable”. 35. The key principle of these proposals is that if the liable parent takes action to repay their assessment debt then the Commissioner can relieve them on their existing penalty burden. Extension of mandatory write-off of incremental penalties 36. Currently, when a repayment arrangement for debt is negotiated and agreed between the CIR and a liable parent an automatic write-off of monthly incremental late payment penalties is considered at each 26-week period (or at the completion of an arrangement). 6 Liable parents who remain fully compliant with their negotiated repayment arrangement receive an automatic write-off (mandated in child support legislation) of monthly incremental late payment penalties. 37. Repayment arrangements where explicit agreement with the liable parent has not been received do not currently qualify for write-off of monthly incremental late payment penalties as above. The manner in which the repayment is being made, and the rate of repayment, can be the same as an arrangement negotiated with a liable parent, the only difference being no explicit agreement. 38. Currently, there are 27,500 liable parents with child support debt amounts totalling $423 million under payment arrangements that do not qualify for monthly incremental penalty write-off. If this proposal is approved, the debt to be collected under these plans could reduce by $123m. In addition, aligning treatment across arrangements regardless of the liable parent’s agreement would increase equity across liable parents. 39. For example: A liable parent with income from a benefit has child support debt of $52,139 ($17,577 unpaid core assessments, $1,775 initial late payment penalties and $32,787 monthly incremental penalties). As the main source of income is a benefit, the legislation requires Inland Revenue to impose automatic deductions from the benefit income to repay current obligations and debt amounts. The beneficiary is not asked whether they agree with child support being paid in this manner. The automatic deductions continue to be made as expected, and at the conclusion of each 26-week period until full repayment, monthly incremental penalties are automatically written off. If the liable parent does not comply with the arrangement (moving off a benefit for example), Inland Revenue ceases the arrangement and the monthly incremental penalties will begin to accumulate from that point on. Inland Revenue also has the discretion to decline any future payment agreements if the liable parent is non-compliant. Without the proposed extension of the mandatory write-off, the liable parent would be required to pay the monthly incremental penalties of $32,787 even while on a benefit. A pragmatic test for discretionary penalty relief 40. Child support legislation (both current and anticipated reform) contains penalty relief discretions designed to increase flexibility to manage the debt book effectively. The discretions cover both initial late payment and monthly incremental penalties across a range of circumstances where penalty write-off would be appropriate, such as incentivising arrangements and promoting and rewarding positive compliance behaviour. 41. To qualify for penalty relief, some discretions (the upfront monthly penalty write-off and residual penalties write-off) require a liable parent to be in serious hardship or for continued collection to represent an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. In both of these circumstances, write-off is subject to further tests in which the Commissioner must have regard to maintaining the integrity of the tax system, promoting compliance, the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and her duty to maximise revenue within practical boundaries. While the tests were legislated to ensure appropriate consideration is given to debt write-off and that checks and balances are in place, they provide less discretion than originally envisaged. 42. As a consequence, the debt book is inflated with penalties that are unlikely to be collected and unable to be written off. In many cases, the high value of penalty debt (often a result of the inflationary penalty rates over time) implies that the debt value is sufficient to 7 warrant collection. Adopting a “fair and reasonable” test would enable penalty relief to be applied in circumstances where it makes sense to do so but where the “inefficient use of resources” based test would not allow relief. 43. For example: A liable parent receiving NZ Superannuation from the Ministry of Social Development owes $136,958 in penalties for child support. He has paid all his core assessment debt, all his late payment penalties and $943 towards his incremental late payment penalty debt. He is repaying his penalty debt at $25 per week. He will be 89 years old at the conclusion of the arrangement in 2037. As his debt is currently under arrangement, he does not qualify for any penalty write-off. This proposal would allow for the write-off of some or all of the incremental late payment penalty debt. 44. Key risks associated with providing further flexibility for penalty relief include interpretation concerns (for example, misunderstanding could lead to inappropriate penalty relief), potential for inconsistency in treatment of liable parents in similar situations, unintended behavioral change with liable parents not paying assessment on time, and loss of consistent debt treatment across legislation Inland Revenue is responsible for. 45. These risks can be mitigated through development of robust internal guidelines for considering “fair and reasonable”, appropriate training for staff, education for customers, and acknowledgement that child support customers can be differentiated from customers associated with other Inland Revenue Acts. These risks can be further mitigated by ensuring appropriate levels of delegated authority are set to apply this penalty relief. Impact analysis of the options 46. The key impacts of the options, and whether they meet the objectives in paragraph 23, are summarised in Table 2. 47. Both options would continue with changes to debt and penalties as part of the second phase of the child support reforms. Around 120,600 liable parents are in debt, about 70% of liable parents. The total debt exceeds $3.2 billion, an average of $26,550 per person. Around 78% of the debt is the penalty component. Of the penalty debt, about 3% relates to the late payment penalty, with the rest relates to the 2% monthly penalty rate. However, the average debt is not a good indicator of the spread of the impact of the changes. Around half of the 120,600 liable parents have a debt where the penalties are greater than the value of the assessment debt. The older the debt, the higher the proportion of penalties. 48. To the extent that the debt and penalty changes improve the timeliness of payments, and the payment of assessment debt by liable parents, there would be a corresponding impact on the receiving carers and their children. However, receiving carers do not receive penalty payments (78% of all debt), and receiving carers who are beneficiaries do not receive assessment debt as this is retained by the Crown. Around 25% of domestic assessed debt and around 50% of the international assessed debt is owed to receiving carers, the rest is owed to the Crown.

The financial implications of additional measures to address child support legacy debt would depend on debt repayment levels by liable parents and the timing of any penalty relief granted. 50. The proposed Commissioner discretions are expected to result in higher repayments of core assessment debt by liable parents. The ability to relieve penalties will encourage some parents to repay their assessment debt when previously they would not have. The higher repayment of assessment debt will be to both the Crown (where the custodial parent in on a benefit) and directly to custodial parents to help support the children. 51. A high write-off estimate puts the additional core assessment paid (payable to the Crown and receiving carers) as a result of these proposals at $1.5 million in the 2015/16 year increasing to $2.9 million by 2018/19. An additional benefit of the proposals is the ability of the Commissioner to address situations where the penalties faced by liable parents are clearly disproportionate to their original assessment. In addition to the repayment of assessment debt the changes would enable administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue enabling stronger focus on further collection of assessment debt. 52. Table 3 below shows the expected increase in repayments of Crown assessment debt and repayments directly from the liable parent to the custodial parent. Table 3: Increase in repayments of assessment debt by liable parents Financial year Increase in Crown assessment debt $m Increase in assessment debt direct to custodial parent Sm Total $m 2014/15 - -- 2015/16 0.9 0.6 1.5 2016/17 1.5 0.9 2.4 2017/18 1.8 1.1 2.9 2018/19 1.8 1.1 2.9 53. In the Crown accounts the imposition of child support penalties is recognised as revenue when imposed. Any unpaid penalties are treated as a receivable i.e. an asset. From an accounting perspective Inland Revenue is required to impair this receivable. Based on historical information we impair this receivable at 97%, reflecting the low collectability of penalties. 54. Any reversal or relief from child support penalties is treated as a reduction in revenue i.e. a reduction in the Crown operating balance. When a penalty is written off, revenue will decrease and impairment expense will decrease by 97% of the revenue reduction. This results in a net reduction to the Crown operating balance of 3% of the write-off amount. 55. A reduction in administrative costs is anticipated due to payment arrangements being set for lower values and subsequently, shorter durations. Further administrative efficiencies would be achieved if the CIR had ability to take a fair and reasonable approach to penalty 11 only debt. Where liable parents qualify, their debts could be written off and their case exited from the scheme, reducing on-going administration and compliance costs. 56. Table 4 below shows the impact on the Crown operating balance of the proposals assuming a high response to debt repayment incentives and approach to penalty write-off. These impacts are in addition to the status quo as the proposals are designed to complement the already agreed child support reforms. Table 4: Net impact on Crown Operating Balance $m increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2014/15 2015/162016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Non- Tax Revenue: Child Support Collections - (67.7)(326.0)(553.8) (816.8) Non-Departmental Other Expenses: Impairment of Debt Relating to Child Support -65.6 316.2537.1 792.3 Increase in Revenue from child support assessment receipts to the Crown -0.91.5 1.81.8 Net impact on Crown Operating Balance - (1.2) (8.3)(14.9) (22.7) 57. To implement these measures some changes will be required to Inland Revenue’s operational processes which will also be supported by internal communication, guidelines and training. The changes are expected to cost around $500,000 which would be funded internally by Inland Revenue. Administrative impacts 58. Both options have comparable staff and associated administrative costs required for implementation. As phase two of the child support reforms is in the development stage and the timing of some of the penalty and debt changes is anticipated for later in 2015, the administrative impacts to move from option 1 to option 2 would be relatively minor. 59. An increase in administrative costs is anticipated for the development and implementation of internal interpretation guidelines for amended penalty rules under option 2 but these costs are expected to be mitigated by more efficient use of Inland Revenue resources resulting from the new rules. 60. A reduction in administrative costs is anticipated due to payment arrangements being set for lower values and subsequently, shorter durations. This is due to penalties accumulating at a slower rate (through child support reforms changes), the proposal for the Commissioner to have greater flexibility to write off penalty debt where it is “fair and reasonable” (rather than pursuing collection), and all eligible liable parents who enter into a payment arrangement qualifying for incremental penalty write off whether the arrangement is agreed to or otherwise made. 12 61. Further administrative efficiencies would be achieved if the CIR had ability to take a fair and reasonable approach to penalty only debt. Where liable parents qualify, their debts could be written off and their case exited from the scheme, reducing on-going administration and compliance costs. 62. Under both options, administrative efficiencies gained could be reinvested to pursue the collection of more liable parent assessment debt, increasing payments to receiving carers and enabling them to financially support the children in their care. Compliance impacts 63. Both options are designed to encourage payment arrangements, support liable parents to get their child support debt under control and meet their child support obligations. 64. Under both options it is anticipated that compliance costs would decrease for liable parents as payment arrangements were made and the number of and need for interactions with Inland Revenue would decline. Based on greater flexibility to negotiate arrangements and determine penalty levels under option 2, compliance costs are expected to be less than option 1. 65. Positive compliance behaviour is expected to result from both options 1 and 2 but is anticipated to be greater under option 2 given greater incentives for liable parents to repay debt. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 66. There are no environmental or cultural impacts associated with the options considered above. There are social impacts from the options as they are anticipated to impact on the levels of financial support available to families with children, the timeliness of payments, and the level of debt. 67. Under option 2, there will be greater increases in positive compliance behaviour with flow-on effects for receiving carers and their children to the extent that payments are due to carers not the Crown, than under option 1. 68. Option 2 presents a greater opportunity for improved perception of Inland Revenue and the child support system through a less punitive penalty regime than option 1. Other risks 69. There is a risk around the timing with respect to both options as they are designed to support the child support reforms scheduled for amendment through the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the Bill) introduced on 26 February 2015. The ability for Inland Revenue to deliver either option relies on the option being reflected in the Bill and the scope, timing and drafting of the option remaining unchanged throughout the legislative process. 70. Option 1 will continue to limit incentives for parents to pay debt and Inland Revenue’s ability to manage the debt book, meaning debt will continue to climb. Experience indicates that compliance levels fall as debt accumulates and ages, especially when penalty debt begins 13 to exceed the core assessment. This is a risk that debt becomes unmanageable, impacting on perceptions of the child support scheme and ultimately the welfare of associated children. 71. Under both options, but more particularly option 2 with greater payment incentives, there is a risk that receiving carers perceive the changes as inequitable. This perception would be related to any penalty write-off for parents who had not been meeting their child support obligations. However, if penalties have been written off this should be as a result of positive compliance behaviour and increased payments of child support. In all cases, receiving carers do not receive penalty payments as these are payable to the Crown under the child support scheme. 72. Under both options, but greater under option 2 with wider penalty relief, there is a risk that liable parents who have paid penalties in the past perceive that new write off provisions are unfair. CONSULTATION 73. A significant level of public consultation was undertaken on the original options for potential child support reform. There had also been consultation with a range of Government agencies on child support issues over several years. Feedback from these agencies had, wherever possible, been incorporated into the formulation of the original policy options and subsequent legislation. There was a general recognition from these agencies that the various issues with the child support scheme need to be addressed. 74. There was less opportunity to consult on the options in the June 2014 RIS and this RIS given the timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the changes. Treasury were consulted and their feedback is incorporated in the options considered. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 75. Inland Revenue supports option 2. This option will encourage and facilitate parents to make timely child support payments for the benefit of their children, and to reduce debt. While this option has an implementation cost, the cost is expected to be partially offset by shorter term payment arrangements as fewer penalties charges and collected and increased capacity for Inland Revenue to focus on collectible debt. 76. The pragmatic approach for penalty consideration based on “fair and reasonable” enables more flexible negotiation with liable parents, opportunity for liable parents to get debt under control, the CIR to better focus resources on collecting outstanding financial support rather than penalties that are unlikely to be collected and are 97% impaired. 77. Overall, option 2 is recommended as it strengthens the expected benefits to be delivered by the child support reforms. The benefits of option 2 are anticipated to address the older legacy debt through strong incentives for liable parents to repay debt and providing the CIR with additional negotiation levers for making payment arrangements and ability to pragmatically manage the child support debt book. 14 IMPLEMENTATION 78. To enable appropriate processes to be in place and required administrative measures to take place before external communications with child support parents can commence the legislative amendments would need to be considered as part of the Bill that was introduced on 26 February 2015. 79. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will enforce the new legislation as part of its usual business operations. 80. Communications will be prepared for child support families and key stakeholders to ensure they understand the changes. Inland Revenue websites will be updated, and an article included in a Tax Information Bulletin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 81. A programme governance group will oversee the implementation of the changes to ensure the legislative changes are delivered correctly. The changes, once implemented, will be monitored by senior managers to ensure they achieve the objectives. Any issues will be raised through Inland Revenue’s internal processes. Complaints and correspondence will also be analysed to identify any issues with the new legislation or the implementation. 82. In accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP), the legislation will be reviewed and remedial changes may be included on a future tax policy work programme, subject to resources and priority. 83. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the GTPP: a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 15
Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to simplify the collection of tax on employment income an employee receives under an employee share scheme (ESS). Specifically, it explores the idea of changing the way income tax on employee share scheme benefits is collected. None of the options discussed in this RIS are intended to alter the recognition or valuation of tax payable on an ESS benefit or change employers’ ability to deduct for income tax purposes the value of any ESS benefits provided to employees. These issues are part of a separate project that is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. The policy proposals in this RIS have been advanced ahead of this other project on employee share schemes so that it can be included as part of a package of measures in a June 2015 taxation bill that demonstrates the Government’s commitment to delivering tangible change through Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. These measures had to be fiscally neutral, straightforward to administer and implement, and not pre-empt any wider policy reforms scheduled for later stages of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Inland Revenue released an issues paper in April 2015 entitled Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes. The issues paper acknowledged that a number of problems exist with the way that tax is collected from benefits received under an employee share scheme. It sought comment on our definition of the problem with the current system, three options to allow employers to account for tax on employee share scheme benefits on their employees’ behalf, and whether the collection mechanism should be compulsory or apply at employers’ election. A total of 17 submissions were received on the issues paper. Submissions broadly agreed with our problem definition and the reasons for considering legislative change to shift the point at which tax is collected on ESS benefits. The majority of submissions were supportive of the idea of shifting the obligation to collect tax on ESS benefits to the employer. However, this support was conditional on: • Employers having the choice of collecting tax on ESS benefits; or • In the alternative, if employers did not have any choice, existing schemes should be outside the scope of any change - that is, employers with existing schemes should be outside the scope of any obligation to collect tax unless they chose to opt in. If source taxation applied to ESS benefits, submissions expressed a strong preference that the PAYE system be used, rather than the FBT system or a separate withholding tax system. Submissions also recognised that if employers had the choice of whether to collect tax it would be reasonable for them to provide information to Inland Revenue about the employees who received an ESS benefit. However, submissions varied on what information should be disclosed. As a result of submissions and the need to improve the overall efficiency of collecting tax on ESS benefits, our preferred option is to use the PAYE system to collect tax and for employers to have the choice to withhold tax. Allowing the collection of tax to be optional permits employers to evaluate the tax benefits and costs so that the employer’s obligation to collect tax using the PAYE rules applies when, in the employer’s view, it is most efficient to do so. Inland Revenue considers that its information requirements can be met if the value of any ESS benefits is disclosed using the employer monthly schedule (EMS). Including the value of these benefits in the EMS would not automatically create an obligation to withhold tax. We recognise that this disclosure requirement may increase compliance costs for some employers in terms of valuation and funding the payment of tax. These costs, however, are currently incurred by employees. The Treasury and the Accident Compensation Corporation were involved in the policy development of the recommended proposal and agree with conclusions reached. Inland Revenue does not hold comprehensive information on the number of employee share schemes offered in New Zealand or the number of employees involved in such schemes. We are aware that large corporate taxpayers commonly use these schemes as part of their remuneration strategies. Our analysis has been based on comments received from submissions on the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, the expected outcomes under the options considered and contrasted against the status quo, and the current tax law that applies to employment income in the form of ESS benefits. None of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce the incentive for businesses to provide these schemes, or override fundamental common law principles. There are no other significant constraints, caveat or uncertainties concerning the analysis undertaken. Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current policy and law 1. Collecting tax at the source of income earned by a taxpayer is an important feature of modern tax systems. Collection at source ensures there is more accurate reporting of income and reduced collection risk. Collection at source also gives the Govermnent the ability to leverage the tax system to provide social policy outcomes - for example, the various social policy programmes that rely on accurate reporting of individual and household incomes such as child support, student loans and Working for Families tax credits. 2. Benefits1 provided to an employee under an employee share scheme (ESS) are “employment income” under the Income Tax Act 2007. Unlike most employment income or benefits, such as salary and wages or a use of a company car, however, it is not currently subject to tax at source under either the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) or Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) rules. This means that employee recipients of ESS benefits must file an individual tax return to account for the ESS benefits as income and pay the tax on those benefits themselves. Current practice 3. The collection of tax on ESS benefits has not been well understood to date and a number of companies have been accounting for ESS benefits through the PAYE system despite the law not providing for this. To clarify the correct treatment, Inland Revenue released a Large Enterprises Update in November 2013 which advised employers that ESS benefits are not subject to either PAYE or FBT so should not be included in their employer monthly schedule or FBT return. Instead they were advised that any employee receiving an ESS benefit must file an IR 3 tax return for the income year in which they receive it. 4. Following this Large Enterprises Update, stakeholders, including the Corporate Taxpayers Group have requested as a high priority a legislative amendment to permit employers to account for tax on ESS benefits at source, preferably through the PAYE system. The problem 5. The current collection mechanism requiring an employee to file a return and account for the tax on ESS benefits imposes compliance costs on taxpayers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. As no tax is deducted at source, the obligation to return the ESS benefit as income may be unfamiliar territory for employees who may not be used to not filing tax returns with Inland Revenue. Further complications can arise if the employee needs to sell shares to meet any tax obligations and, if the obligation is large enough (the residual income 1 The “benefit” under an ESS is, in the case of an acquisition of shares, the amount by which the value of the shares when they were acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. Share options provided to employees are generally not taxed until they are exercised, at which time the tax treatment in the previous sentence applies. 3 tax is $2,500 or more)2 the employee could find themselves subject to the provisional tax rules and use of money interest (UOMI). 6. These tax compliance costs can also: • act as a barrier to the attractiveness of employee share schemes as a form of remuneration; • affect the likelihood of voluntary compliance by the employee; and • potentially result in lost tax revenue. 7. When contrasted against the collection of tax under the PAYE system or the FBT rules, the current rules for collecting tax on ESS benefits is arguably inefficient for both employees and Inland Revenue. 8. The question to be addressed in this RIS is what improvements can be made to the collection of tax on ESS benefits to help simplify and improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. OBJECTIVES 9. The main objective of this review is to simplify the way tax is collected on ESS benefits in order to improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. 10. The optimum option should: • minimise compliance costs on employees; • minimise administration costs for Inland Revenue; • reduce the risk of non-compliance in connection with the taxation of ESS benefits; and • be fiscally neutral. 11. This review is not intended to pre-empt any wider policy reforms scheduled for later stages of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. It is also not intended to alter the recognition or valuation of tax payable on an ESS benefit or change employers’ entitlements to deduct the value of any ESS benefits provided to employees. These issues are part of a separate project that is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. 12. We also note that the chosen option is not intended to affect the status quo treatment of employee share scheme benefits for student loans, child support, Kiwisaver, Working for Families Tax Credits and the ACC earners’ levy. 2 Residual income tax is the positive amount of tax still owed by an individual after subtracting the amount of any tax credits - such as tax paid by the employee through the PAYE system. 4 13. Trade-offs will inevitably be made across the various objectives. For example, solutions that seek to minimise Inland Revenue’s administrative costs may impose compliance costs on employers. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 14. Four options (including the status quo) are considered in this RIS for the collection of tax on ESS benefits. These options, which were canvased in the April 2015 officials’ paper, are: • Option 1 (status quo) - individuals must declare any ESS benefits in their tax return which is filed at the end of the year and any tax is collected as part of the end-of-the-year annual assessment. • Option 2 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through the PAYE system. • Option 3 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through the FBT system. • Option 4 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through a separate withholding tax system. 15. Options, 2, 3 and 4 will tax ESS benefits at source and shift the tax obligation from employees to employers. 16. The impact of each option is summarised in the attached annex to this RIS. None of the options have: • Social, cultural or environmental impacts. • Fiscal impacts, although it is expected that collection of revenue should be improved by shifting the collection of tax from employees to employers. 17. In addition, we have considered whether the preferred option of collecting tax by employers should be compulsory or elective. This discussion is set out below. Collection of tax options Option 1 (status quo) 18. Option 1 is to retain the status quo as described under the heading “Status quo and problem definition”. We recognise that for some schemes it is more efficient for the employee to retain responsibility for meeting any tax obligations arising from the receipt of an ESS benefit and this is reflected in our comments under the heading “Conclusions and recommendations”. 5 Option 2: PAYE (preferred option) 19. Under this option, the employer withholds PAYE on the value of the ESS benefits and pays this amount to Inland Revenue as part of the employers’ “employer monthly schedule” (EMS). 20. The main advantages of this option are: • PAYE is a very efficient method of collecting tax and an important part of modern tax systems. • Most payroll systems have fully automated the tax compliance obligations for PAYE and so the costs to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer the PAYE system are relatively low. • Despite the concerns about applying PAYE to a non-cash form of employment income (below), submitters generally preferred the PAYE option as it is generally well understood by employers and maintains the economic incidence of tax on the employee. • The PAYE system is also better integrated with the Government’s social policy programmes, subject to legislative modifications to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the Kiwisaver Act 2006 to ensure that amounts subject to PAYE withholding are not taken into account under these Acts. 21. The main disadvantage with this option is one of application. The underlying principle with PAYE is that tax can be readily withheld as the employees’ salary and wages are in cash. However, in the case of ESS benefits (which are shares and not cash) there is an in principle difficulty with applying PAYE. To make PAYE work, employers would have to: • recover the cost of tax from the employee, that is - deducting the tax from the employee’s wage or salary; • sell a portion of the employee’s ESS entitlement on their behalf to fund the tax - assuming the ESS arrangement provided the employer with this power; or • provide a cash gross-up to accompany the ESS benefit to fund the PAYE. Employers raised concerns that in situations where the employee and the employer had reached a bargain in terms of an employee’s remuneration and ESS entitlements, an additional gross-up could make the ESS too expensive for the employer. 22. Employer concerns about funding tax payments are the same faced by employees when they have to account for tax themselves. 6 Option 3: FBT 23. Under this option, employers’ calculate FBT on the value of any ESS benefits received by the employee and pays this tax to Inland Revenue. 24. The main advantages of this option are: • FBT is conceptually a purer method of taxing non-cash benefits. • FBT is designed specifically to tax non-cash benefits and remuneration received by an employee. • FBT is designed with equity in mind by ensuring that non-cash remuneration received by employees is subject to tax at a similar level to cash remuneration. The gross-up aspect described above is built into the FBT rules via the tax rate structure and the cost of FBT and the legal incidence of the tax falls on the employer. 25. This option has a number of shortcomings, including: • All employers have payroll systems that broadly comply with the requirements of the PAYE rules. The provision of fringe benefits, however, is less common and some employers would not have the requisite compliance systems in place to meet their obligations under the FBT rules. Using FBT as a means of collecting tax at source would therefore be unfamiliar to some employers and require them to develop new systems to manage compliance with the FBT rules. This would likely increase employer tax compliance costs over and above those incurred by employees under the status quo and could make it unattractive for employers to provide an ESS. • From an Inland Revenue systems perspective, FBT - being a tax on the employer - is not fully integrated with the systems used to report and manage employees’ child support obligations. • For tax technical reasons, tax collected under the FBT rules means it does not count for the purposes of tax relief for employees in a cross-border context. New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreement network treats FBT as an employer tax. As such, employees cannot claim any credit for New Zealand tax paid. Option 4: Alternative withholding tax system 26. A separate method of withholding, such as using withholding regulations, was initially considered but not advanced due to constraints on Inland Revenue’s ability to implement the change. As noted in the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, we considered there was little justification for developing a new system of withholding tax when alternative well-developed systems such as PAYE and FBT already exist. 7 27. Reactions from tax specialists to this option were mixed. While some considered it an optimal option, others were concerned about the prospect of having to develop new compliance systems. Others did not see the case for duplicating compliance costs under a new withholding system when the PAYE system (option 2) could be used. Implementation: compulsory or elective 28. There are two approaches to implementing the collection of tax on ESS benefits at source. They are the compulsory approach or elective approach. Compulsory approach 29. There are administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue if option 2 applied to all ESS. 30. A compulsory option, however, presents a number of problems for employers and a key theme in submissions was how a source basis of collection was not appropriate for all schemes, see paragraph 48. Employers were also concerned about the impact a compulsory set of rules would have on: • the employer’s working capital - for example, if the employer is a start-up company or funding the payment of tax on the ESS benefit generally; • agreements or understandings that exist for current schemes if it is not possible for the employer to sell shares on the employee’s behalf to meet any tax liability on the ESS benefits, or otherwise affect any contractual agreements about the value of any benefits provided under the scheme; • bargains struck between the employer and the employee and the risk to the employer having to fund the tax payable on ESS benefits; • employee tax entitlements or obligations - for example, if the employee is a short-term tax resident of New Zealand or has tax losses or expenses he or she wishes to use against any tax liability created by the ESS benefit. 31. Submissions argued that existing schemes would need to be removed (grandparented) from the scope of any change as it would be time consuming and costly to renegotiate existing ESS agreements to provide for tax collection at source. 32. Consideration of a compulsory approach to collection of tax on ESS benefits, including grandparenting, was not advanced in recognition that in some situations it is more efficient for the employee to remain responsible for the payment of tax on ESS benefits under the status quo. This conclusion assumed, however, that any elective approach to the tax collection of ESS benefits would be supported by appropriate disclosures from the employer to Inland Revenue about their employees’ (including ex-employees where any legacy entitlement exists) ESS entitlements. 8 Elective approach 33. An elective approach to collecting tax at source was strongly preferred by tax specialists and employers for the very reasons why compulsory rules were considered undesirable. Allowing the collection of tax to be optional permits employers to evaluate the tax benefits and costs so that the employer’s obligation to collect tax using the PAYE rules applies when, in the employer’s view, it is most efficient. 34. An elective approach is an effective way of reducing compliance costs. The risk with flexibility is that it reduces the efficiency of collecting tax at source. Flexibility creates additional administration costs and, by itself, does not deal with Inland Revenue’s concerns in terms of ensuring employee compliance. Submissions argued that the choice should be the employer’s and not the employee’s. Inland Revenue agrees and further notes that any election not to withhold tax should be done on a per-scheme basis as opposed to a per- employee basis. 35. The trade-off for providing the employer with a choice is the need for Inland Revenue to have better information about when an employee receives an ESS benefit. 36. Submissions received on the officials’ paper recognised that if the employer had the choice to collect tax, it was reasonable for the employer to provide information to Inland Revenue about the employees who received an ESS benefit in cases where tax was not collected at source. Submissions varied on what information should be disclosed, however. Those advocating the use of PAYE considered that employers’ payroll system would meet Inland Revenue’s needs. Other employers considered that the information should be separately disclosed by some other means. 37. We considered two means by which the relevant information could be received by Inland Revenue. • The employer monthly schedule (EMS): The data points contained in the employer monthly schedule provides Inland Revenue with the information needed to administer the collection of tax on ESS benefits (irrespective of employers’ election to withhold tax on the benefit). This information can be captured in a timely and administratively efficient manner without any impact on Inland Revenue’s technology platforms and meet the objective that Inland Revenue can implement with minimum cost. This option will create reconciliation errors due to amounts not being counted for Kiwisaver and when the employer chooses not to withhold tax. Inland Revenue considers these errors can be tolerated as the critical information is captured and can be examined as part of any end-of-year square up process. • Other alternatives - information request, letter or new Inland Revenue form '. We considered other means by which the requisite information could be captured - for example, employees’ tax file numbers and the value of the ESS benefit and when it was received. This information could be captured by way of an information request, letter or a new Inland Revenue form. Inland Revenue had 9 concerns about whether, when contrasted against the EMS, the information would be received in a timely manner and how it would be integrated into Inland Revenue’s FIRST system. Resolving these problems would increase implementation costs and raise administration risks in terms of consistent application of the proposal change, retrieval of employers’ decisions about withholding, and enforcing compliance. 38. We recognise that for some employers the requirement to disclose the value of employees’ ESS benefits will involve some cost. Specifically: • the need to value shares received by employees, and • for certain schemes ensure that the receipt of any ESS benefits is appropriately captured by employers’ payroll systems. New Zealand employers whose employees participate in a global ESS may also need to ensure they receive information from their international group about any ESS benefits that vest in their New Zealand employees. 39. These costs are currently incurred by employees under the status quo. CONSULTATION Initial consultation 40. Preliminary consultation was undertaken by officials during the policy development phase of the project and development of an officials’ issues paper. Organisations consulted included the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young. Comments from stakeholders indicated employers and employees would generally prefer that PAYE applied to ESS benefits. Officials’ issues paper 41. In April 2015, officials released the issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, which is available at http://taxpolicv.ird.govt.nz/publications/2015- ip-emplovee-share-schemes/overview. 42. The issues paper discussed changing the collection of tax from ESS using the PAYE system, the FBT rules or a separate withholding tax. Both tax collection systems would shift the collection of tax on ESS benefits to a source basis. The issues paper also discussed whether any change should be mandatory or not. 43. To allow for the possibility that any reforms resulting from the issues paper could be included in a proposed taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015, five weeks were allowed for consultation before submissions closed on 5 May 2015. A total of 17 submissions were received. 10 44. Submissions were broadly supportive of the idea of shifting the point of taxation to source, provided that the employer had the ability to elect to use the rules. Submissions also recognised that any elective use of the rules would need to be accompanied by a suitable disclosures system to allow Inland Revenue to know which employees had received an ESS benefit. Those who supported changing the collection of tax to source, agreed with the problems officials identified with the status quo. The PAYE system was the generally preferred method of collection. 45. Two submissions were strongly opposed to any change from the status quo. 46. The arguments for making any change elective, including not proceeding at all with the changes, were similar. Main submission points 47. The main submission points centred on: • Source basis collection is not appropriate for all schemes • Impacts on employers • Impacts on employees • Interaction with the Government’s social policy programmes Source basis collection is not appropriate fo r all schemes 48. Submitters identified a number of instances when taxing ESS benefits at source would be inappropriate. These instances included: • Executive schemes: Submissions noted that the recipients of shares under an executive scheme were generally sophisticated taxpayers who would be used to meeting their own tax obligations. Shifting the collection point to the employer would therefore not result in a reduction in compliance costs. Submissions also noted concern about situations when the tax payable, due to the size of the benefit, could exceed the taxpayer’s net salary (assuming the employer is unable to sell a portion of the share entitlement on the executive’s behalf to meet the tax liability on the ESS benefit). • International schemes: Global employee share schemes, where the issuer of the shares is a non-resident with no other tax obligations in New Zealand, could be required to comply with the New Zealand PAYE rules for a relatively small number of New Zealand employees. • Schemes offered by start-up companies: Employee share schemes are a cost effective means of remunerating staff in situations when the company does not have substantial working capital to support monetary remuneration and for 11 recruitment reasons need to provide a competitive remuneration package. Imposing source taxation on these schemes would make it more costly for the employer to provide and remove the advantages of including a non-cash component in a remuneration package. 49. A number of submissions noted problems with the way the Income Tax Act 2007 taxes ESS benefits with particular regard to identifying when an ESS benefit is derived and its value. Currently, the employee is responsible for these obligations as part of filing a return of income. If the collection point is moved to a source-basis, these obligations fall on the employer. The valuation of ESS benefits was identified as a particular concern for start-up companies and other non-listed companies whose shares would have to be valued and the cost of such activity would be borne by the employer. Impact on employers 50. Submissions expressed concern at the rework required for existing payroll systems if the obligation to withhold tax was mandatory. 51. Others noted existing schemes would need to be renegotiated and any benefits would need to be re-priced. Specifically, submitters were conscious that changing the point of tax collection could interfere with existing bargains struck between employers and employees. For example, if the employer was required to withhold tax at source on ESS benefits there is a risk that the employer would have to gross-up the benefit to take into account any tax payable to Inland Revenue. Grandparenting of existing schemes, if the collection of tax at source was not optional, was suggested. 52. Others noted concerns about the ability for employers to sell shares to meet employee tax obligations. A number noted that it would not be possible to sell shares if: • the contract under which the ESS benefit is provided did not allow for the employer to sell shares; • the employer may in certain periods be unable to sell shares because of prohibitions under other legislation, for example, the sale of share may be illegal for reasons of insider trading during “black out” (restrictions on trading) periods or other restrictions and covenants applicable in employment contracts; • shares in the company may not be readily sold - “illiquid shares”; this is particularly relevant for start-up companies. 53. The concern underlying these comments is the impact taxing at source would have on the employer’s working capital if the employer had to pay tax on the employee’s behalf. Submissions did not accept that the cashflow effect of collection at source would be adequately remedied by the employer selling a portion of the employee’s share entitlement to meet any tax obligations - assuming this was allowable under the relevant employee share scheme in the first place. 54. A few submissions commented on the information requirements needed to calculate the value of rights and options under an employee share scheme. Some thought the requirement 12 would be difficult to comply with while others noted that in their experience employers will be aware of the option exercise price as it will be specified in the share scheme offer documentation provided to the employee. 55. Other technical matters were raised in connection with how taxation at source would apply to past employees who might have legacy entitlements under an employee share scheme and the interaction of the proposals on employee entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003.3 Impact on employees 56. Submissions noted that some employees could have expenses and losses to use against any tax payable on an ESS benefit. Since these employees would be filing a return in any event, there is no point in the employer also bearing a tax compliance cost. More importantly, other employees, particularly those who are non-residents may have tax obligations in other countries. Imposing tax at source could act as a disincentive. These points argue against the use of the FBT rules. Interaction with the Government’s social policy programmes 57. Submissions generally endorsed the position that ESS benefits are counted towards an employee’s child support and student loans obligations and Working for Families tax credit entitlements. Taxation at source was seen as a way of supporting the integrity of these programmes. It was noted that ESS benefits should not count for the purposes of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the Kiwisaver Act 2006. 58. The officials’ issues paper noted the intention was not to change the status quo treatment of ESS benefits under the Government’s social policy programmes. Consultation with government agencies 59. The Treasury and the Accident Compensation Corporation were consulted and agree with our conclusions. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Ministry for Social Development were also consulted. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 60. The current collection of income tax on ESS benefits presents a number of problems for employers and employees. The current rules are not necessarily well understood and the requirement that the employee must file an individual tax return to account for the ESS benefits as income and pay the tax on those benefits can lead to non-compliance. We ' Inland Revenue notes that shifting the tax collection point to the source of the benefit does not directly impact on employee entitlements under the Holidays Act. Entitlements under the Holidays Act are based on the employee's remuneration package, not the tax treatment of such benefits. 13 consider that there are good efficiency and tax system integrity arguments for shifting the income tax collection point from employees to employers. We considered several options that would achieve this outcome, such as the PAYE rules (option 2), the FBT rules (option 3) or a separate system of withholding (option 4). Options 3 and 4 did not meet most of the required objectives of: • minimising compliance costs on employees; • minimising administration costs for Inland Revenue; • reducing the risk of non-compliance in connection with the taxation of ESS benefits; • be fiscally neutral; • not affecting employees’ entitlements or obligations for student loans, child support, Working for Families tax credits, Kiwisaver and the ACC earners’ levy. 61. Option 2 met most of the objectives but may impose additional compliance costs on employers. Consultation with stakeholders suggested that these compliance costs meant that taxing ESS benefits at source is not always appropriate or efficient. We accept these concerns and adjusted our view about whether option 2 should have compulsory application. 62. We recommend reforming the collection of tax on ESS benefits by: • allowing the employer to choose to withhold tax on any ESS benefits received by an employee using the PAYE system (option 2 using an elective approach). • requiring the employer to disclose the value of any ESS benefits via the employer monthly schedule - this would apply in all cases whether the employer chose to withhold tax or not. 63. We recommend any legislative changes be included in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015 and apply from 1 April 2017. 64. The recommended option takes into account the compliance cost concerns identified in submissions. Using the PAYE system to improve the collection of tax on employee share benefits transfers compliance costs that are currently borne by the employee to the employer. From an employee’s perspective, officials consider that taxation of employee share benefits at source is a better approach to collecting tax. It is a more consistent and coherent approach to taxing employment income. It is also consistent with the general policy of simplifying employees’ tax obligations. Subjecting an employee to a potentially complex filing requirement for what may be a small tax liability when that employee would not otherwise have to file a return is inconsistent with the policy objective of simplicity and reduced compliance costs. 65. For the most part, it is more efficient for the employer to bear the cost of compliance. As submissions have already argued however, where this does not hold true, the employer can elect not to withhold tax under the PAYE system. 14 66. The trade-off for providing the employer with a choice is the need for Inland Revenue to have better information about when an employee receives such a benefit.4 Employers may need to update their payroll systems to capture the requisite information. 67. The disclosure requirement may also create additional compliance costs for employers whose shares are not traded on a market exchange. As noted earlier, these costs exist currently, but they are borne by the employee. As the shares are issued by the employing company (or international group or an entity under the control of the employer), the employer is likely to have better information about the value of any share benefits. IMPLEMENTATION 68. If approved, the preferred option will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Kiwisaver Act 2006 and the Accident Compensation Act 2001. 69. These changes can be included in the next taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015. 70. The legislative changes would apply from 1 April 2017 to allow employers and software developers’ sufficient time to implement the necessary payroll and information systems changes to allow withholding and comply with the disclosure of ESS benefit information to Inland Revenue. 71. When introduced into Parliament, a commentary on the bill will be released explaining the amendments and further explanation of their effect will be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 72. Inland Revenue will administer the proposed changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. 73. The proposed changes largely align with Inland Revenue’s existing systems. It is expected that using the EMS to receive information about ESS benefits may generate return errors if the employer does not withhold tax. These errors would require Inland Revenue to undertake additional manual work to correct. However, this is seen as a reasonable trade-off for the improved information Inland Revenue would receive about employees’ ESS benefits. Inland Revenue is preparing suitable communications materials for employers about the changes. 74. Submissions recognised the importance of counting the value of ESS benefits for determining employee social policy entitlements and obligations and that any changes to the collection of tax should not change the status quo. As noted in the officials’ paper, it is not 4 It is possible that the disclosure requirement would also apply to ex-employees in the rare case when legacy entitlements might exist under an employee share scheme agreement. This may require, if the employer does not already do so under the scheme, additional communications between the employer and ex-employee regarding any entitlements. ~ 15 the intention to change the way ESS benefits are treated for the purposes of child support, student loans, Working for Families tax credits, ACC and Kiwisaver. ESS benefits should not count for the purposes of the ACC earners’ levy and Kiwisaver contributions and changes are required to the Accident Compensation Act 2001, and the Kiwisaver Act 2006 to ensure this outcome. 75. ESS benefits would continue to count toward child support, student loans and Working for Families tax credits. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 76. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of collecting tax on ESS benefits would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi­ stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. 77. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 16 ANNEX SUMMARY OF IMPACTS OF THE OPTIONS (INCLUDING THE STATUS QUO) Option 1: Status quo Description Impacts Employees Employers/payroll intermediariesTax system(by reference to the Society (by reference to social No tax withheld at source. and software developers integrity o f the tax system, impact on Inland Revenue and revenue impact) policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue) Advantages ---- Disadvantages Compliance costs associated with filing returns and payment of tax on any ESS benefits received. If the amount of tax payable exceeds $2,500, the employee faces the prospect of having to comply with the provisional tax rules and accounting for tax in instalments throughout the year. Employees need to have cash resources to meet any tax obligations. Risk to the tax base from employee non-compliance. Inland Revenue incurs higher administration costs associated with processing returns and any necessary enforcement action. Elevated tax collection risk due to employees being uncertain about their obligations under the Income Tax Act 2007. Mitigating factors Employees can sell shares to meet any tax liabilities. ESS benefits counted towards any obligations/entitlements for child support, student loans or Working for Families tax credits. Conclusion: Employee bears the cost of compliance and associated tax risk. Inland Revenue faces increased non-compliance risk. 17 Option 2: Collection using the PAYE system (preferred option) Description Impacts Tax on ESS benefits is collected using the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system Employees Employers/payroll intermediaries and software developers Tax system (by reference to the integrity o f the tax system, impact on Inland Revenue and revenue impact) Society (by reference to social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue) Advantages Employees have more certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits including their obligations. Reduced compliance costs. Increased employee certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits may support the take up of such schemes and inclusion in remuneration packages. All employers have PAYE systems. Improved compliance. Improved tax collection. Reduced revenue risk. Reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue from fewer individual tax returns and follow up enforcement action. ESS benefits counted towards any obligations/entitlements for child support, student loans or Working for Families tax credits. Disadvantages Possible risk that tax payable on ESS benefits could exceed income. Employers need to change payroll systems to include ESS benefits. If compulsory, it may: • affect the employer’s working capital by having to fund the necessary tax payments; • alter agreements or understandings between the employee and employer; • unnecessarily interfere with the employee’s tax entitlements or obligations. Possibility that reconciliation errors are created due to amounts not being counted for Kiwisaver and when the employer chooses not to withhold tax. This will require additional rework of the EMS by Inland Revenue. Mitigating factors Employee and employer can agree to sell part of employees’ ESS entitlement to meet any tax obligations. Grandparenting existing schemes could be considered to mitigate the effects on employers. Additional legislative change to ensure ESS benefits do not count for the purposes of the ACC earners’ levy and Kiwisaver. Conclusion: Transaction costs associated with collecting tax on ESS shifted from the employee and Inland Revenue to the employer. Issue over whether tax payable on ESS benefits can be solved, for the most part, by the employer selling shares to meet tax obligations. 18 Option 3 Collection using the FBT system Description Impacts Tax on ESS benefits is collected using the Fringe Benefit Tax rules EmployeesEmployers/Payroll intermediaries and software developers Tax system(by reference to the integrity o f the tax system, impact on Inland Revenue and revenue impact) Society (by reference to social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue) Advantages Employees have more certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits including their obligations. Reduced compliance costs. Increased employee certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits may support the take up of such schemes and inclusion in remuneration packages. The gross up of tax on the fringe benefit means that any resulting tax obligation will not exceed the employee’s income. Improved compliance. Improved tax collection. Reduced revenue risk. Reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue from fewer individual tax returns and follow up enforcement action. ESS benefits counted towards any obligations/entitlements for student loans and Working for Families tax credits. DisadvantagesProblems with getting appropriate tax relief if the employee is a non­ resident under New Zealand’s Double Taxation Agreement network. May create additional compliance costs on employers. Need to change FBT reporting systems to include ESS benefits. FBT obligations may apply to employers who have limited experience with FBT. Out of step with international practice. For global employee share schemes, the FBT rules would affect employees’ ability to receive tax relief under New Zealand’s DTA network. Out of step with international practice. Systems constraints means that ESS benefits are not counted for child support purposes. Mitigating factorsInland Revenue education programmes to improve employer understanding about their FBT obligations including online calculators. Conclusion: Conceptually purer method for taxing non-cash benefits, but has implementation problems and could apply to employers who are not familiar with the tax obligations arising from providing non-cash benefits. 19 Option 4: Collection using a withholding tax Not considered in depth due to concerns that Inland Revenue would not be able to implement the method. Alternative well-developed systems such as PAYE and FBT already exist. Recommended proposal: Employer election with data capture using the PAYE’s employer monthly schedule (EMS) Description Employer to choose to withhold tax on any ESS benefits received by an employee using the PAYE system Employers disclose the value of any ESS benefits via the employer monthly schedule - this would apply in all cases whether the employer chose to withhold tax or not.

Regulatory Impact Statement Co-location and secrecy Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to remove a significant barrier to Inland Revenue employees co-locating with employees of other state agencies. The analysis involved examining Inland Revenue’s current co-location arrangements in Christchurch and other regional offices. The special circumstances of the co-location arrangements in Christchurch were noted. The analysis was limited to examining options for removing barriers to Inland Revenue sharing call centres and administrative areas with other government agencies. The analysis did not examine secrecy issues with reception and front counter areas. The analysis also did not examine any wider options for co-locating with other government or private sector agencies. The consultation on this proposal involved discussing the secrecy issues with Inland Revenue employees that were involved in the current co-location arrangements. The Privacy Commissioner was also consulted. The policy options will not: • impose additional costs on businesses • impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or • override fundamental common law principles . Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The current secrecy provision in the Tax Administration Act (section 81 of the TAA) does not allow Inland Revenue employees to communicate taxpayer information (including to other government agencies) except in limited, defined circumstances. Further, the provision requires employees to maintain, and assist in maintaining, the secrecy of taxpayer information. There are severe penalties for an Inland Revenue employee who knowingly breaches secrecy provisions. In addition, under section 6 of the TAA every Inland Revenue employee must use their best endeavours at all times to protect the integrity of the tax system (including the rights of the taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential). The effective administration of the tax system relies on voluntary compliance. A critical element of voluntary compliance is taxpayers trusting that Inland Revenue will not disclose their information inappropriately. 2. One of the four key priorities of the Government is to ensure the delivering of better public services. Inland Revenue is investigating co-location opportunities as part of the future direction of service delivery. Co-location is aimed at providing a better service by standardising processes, reducing duplication of effort and delivering prioritised services to meet local needs. Inland Revenue is currently co-locating with other government agencies in some offices and call centres across New Zealand. While some co-locations have been able to be achieved while still maintaining physical separation between agencies (which minimises secrecy risks) such separation is not always possible — for example, in post-earthquake Christchurch co-locations are "open-plan". Specifically, about 370 Inland Revenue call centre and collections staff share an “open-plan” area with 130 Ministry of Social Development staff at Russley Road and 10-12 Inland Revenue staff at Durham Street are surrounded by about 70-80 Ministry of Social Development staff. 3. Under such an approach, Inland Revenue employees are exposed to the risk of inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government agencies at co-located sites. This could arise if the other agency's employees were to overhear conversations (between Inland Revenue staff discussing a case, and conversations with taxpayers themselves), or if they happen to see Inland Revenue correspondence, or as a result of shared office facilities and equipment. 4. Given that further co-location is planned (including in open-plan sites) this gives rise to the issue of proximity with other government employees and inadvertent disclosure of taxpayer information with those employees. Inland Revenue considers that no amount of training or best practice guidelines or adopted behaviour is likely to adequately address the substantial risk of Inland Revenue employees inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government employees in the co-location environment. Inland Revenue considers that architectural changes can be made to open-plan areas to reduce the risks. However, the changes would be costly and would arguably undermine the benefits of co-locating. 5. There is, therefore, a balance between maintaining the integrity of the tax system (including taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system) and delivering better public services through co-location. 6. Maintaining the status quo means the existing risk to employees of inadvertently breaching section 81 will remain, and so being subject to severe penalties. That this risk exists makes employees reluctant to work in an open-plan environment. In addition, given this risk, taxpayers may have concerns about the level of secrecy applying in a co-located environment, which may harm the perception of the integrity of the tax system. The current 2 risks also make Inland Revenue more reluctant to enter into co-location arrangements with other government agencies. Such a result is counter to the Government’s policy of increasing efficiency in the delivery of government services and achieving cost reductions across government. OBJECTIVES 7. The key objectives to facilitate co-location are to: (a) reduce the risks for Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff from other government agencies in a co-location environment; (b) confirm for taxpayers secrecy will be maintained in a co-location environment (bearing in mind the importance of taxpayer secrecy in the administration of the tax system); and (c) enable Inland Revenue to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Four broad options and the status quo (option 5) have been considered for addressing the problems and achieving the stated objectives. These options are: • Option 1: lowering the overall secrecy standard in section 6 of the TAA to reduce the risks from co-locating with other government agencies. The current standard in section 6 for Inland Revenue officers to use “best endeavours” to protect the integrity of the tax system (including ensuring the individual affairs of taxpayers are kept confidential) is a very high threshold. Inland Revenue believes that lowering the general secrecy standard to “reasonable endeavours” could reduce some of the risks from co-locating; • Option 2: deem the co-located staff from the other government agency to be Inland Revenue staff for the purposes of the secrecy provision. Option 2 would apply the same secrecy requirements to the co-located staff as apply to Inland Revenue staff in Inland Revenue open-plan areas and call centres; • Option 3: include a specific provision that sets out the secrecy requirements in a co- location environment. The specific provision would mean that an Inland Revenue employee is deemed to have not breached section 81 by inadvertently disclosing tax secret information to a co-located employee of another government agency. The employee from the other government agency will have signed a secrecy certificate under section 87. The specific provision will only apply when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers that the risk of communication is consistent with her obligation at all times to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system; • Option 4 (preferred option): include a general provision for communications by Inland Revenue employees where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expects them to perform their duties. The employee will not breach the secrecy provision in those circumstances if the employee communicates the information unintentionally to an employee of Inland Revenue or an employee of another state agency subject to section 87 of the TAA; • Option 5: maintain the status quo. 3 9. The impacts of options 1 to 4 and the status quo option, and whether they meet the objectives in paragraph 7, are summarised in the table below. 4 O ption M eets objectives (a), (h), or (c)? F iscal/ econom ic im pact A dm inistrative im pact for In land R evenue C om pliance im pact fo r taxpayers R isks Sum m ary O p tion 1b,c Nil Lowering the overall standard in section 6 would not provide Inland Revenue employees with any clarity as to the required standard of secrecy in a co-located environment because: • the change would not affect the specific secrecy requirements in section 81; and • the employees would have to determine in any environment whether reasonable steps had been taken to protect the integrity of the tax system. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. Reducing the overall standard in section 6 could suggest to taxpayers a decreased focus on maintaining the integrity of the tax system, which could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. The broad-brush approach of reducing the overall standard may have unforeseen consequences in other situations or environments. Option 1 does not meet all of the stated objectives. While it provides increased flexibility to Inland Revenue, it may undennine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. 1 O p tion 2 a, b, cNilOption 2 would seem to provide Inland Revenue employees with clarity because they will be able to apply the same internal secrecy standards to co­ located environments. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. Option 2 would suggest to taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments. However, it would arguably also allow sharing of information between Inland Revenue employees and co­ located staff which could be inconsistent with the limited specific information sharing provisions in the TAA. In other words, the option may sanction more than is intended. If taxpayers consider that there is unlimited sharing of information, this may undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. Section 81 only exempts communications for the purpose of carrying into effect the relevant legislation or performing a duty of the Commissioner. There is a risk that communications between Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff would not satisfy that requirement (even if the co-located staff were deemed to be Inland Revenue employees). This would mean that there is a risk that the option will not remedy the relevant policy problem. Having the co-located staff sign secrecy certificates under section 81 would mean that they were subject to the same sanctions for any secrecy breaches as Inland Revenue employees. However, there has been some level of opposition in the past from other government agencies to having their staff sign Inland Revenue secrecy certificates. As a result, there is a risk that the other agencies will not agree to sign the certificates. Option 2 meets all of the stated objectives, but it arguably allows more information sharing than is intended.

Getting the co-located staff to sign a section 87 secrecy certificate would provide them with clarity as to the extent that they can disclose any information. Further, the relevant co- location arrangement agreement between Inland Revenue and the other government agency could set out any exceptions to the disclosure requirements and the process to be followed in case of any conflicts. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs in a co- location environment. However, the option will not enable the provision of better public services in a broader range of circumstances. not sanction any wider sharing of information. This will suggest to taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments and reinforce taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. O p tion 4 a, b, cNil Option 4 provides clarity to Inland Revenue employees in a broad range of circumstances. It applies wherever the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expects them to perform their duties. This may extend beyond the strict confines of the office to include situations such as where two employees are driving to a location. The employee will not breach the secrecy provision in those circumstances if the employee communicates the information unintentionally to an employee of Inland Revenue or another state agency (eg, where they answer a phone call while travelling in the car). The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs in a broader range of circumstances. The exemption only applies if the person communicated to is subject to section 87. This means that they need to have signed a secrecy certificate. As a result, the same standard of secrecy that applies in Inland Revenue offices will apply to co-located offices. Inland Revenue considers that the option will reinforce taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. While there is no specific reference to the obligation on employees to use their best endeavours at all times to protect the integrity of the tax system, the employees are still subject to section 6. While the more general nature of the provision could suggest more information sharing than is currently the case, this is not intended to be the case. Any sharing of information would have to be unintentional. There is a risk that the other agencies will not agree to sign the certificates. There is a small risk that the general nature of the provision will suggest to taxpayers that Inland Revenue is lowering its overall secrecy standard. This could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. However, the specific requirement in the proposed provision, that the sharing be unintentional, should mitigate any significant risk. Option 4 is the preferred option because it meets all the objectives and allows inadvertent communication of tax secret information in a broader range of circumstances.

This proposal has been discussed with the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner said that it seemed very logical to remove banders to having conversations in the open-plan environment. The Privacy Commissioner noted that the preferred option had to extend the confidentiality requirements to the co-located staff. The Privacy Commissioner also said that she did not have any issues with the proposed options. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 11. Inland Revenue prefers option 4 because it best achieves the stated objectives. Specifically, option 4: • reduces the risks for Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff from other government agencies in a co-location environment; • confirms for taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments, reinforcing taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance; and • enables Inland Revenue to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. IMPLEMENTATION 12. Any legislative amendments will be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. 13. No implementation risks have been identified. No changes need to be made to existing systems and there would be no other significant administrative issues. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 14. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 15. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 1
Regulatory Impact Statement KiwiSaver opt-out for minors Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the incorrect enrolment of minors into the KiwiSaver scheme. This analysis includes a review of the legal rights and obligations granted and imposed on KiwiSaver members, KiwiSaver providers and employers in respect of the enrolment of minors. Statistical analysis of enrolment data since the inception of KiwiSaver has been undertaken to measure the extent of the issue. As there have been no documented cases of complaints from KiwiSaver members who had been enrolled as minors, it was not possible to measure the impacts at an individual level. Workplace Savings NZ, who represent most KiwiSaver providers, were briefed on the issue and the options. In general, feedback received indicated that there was a need for Inland Revenue to take a greater role in verifying the age of new enrolments. Some providers also felt that an open ended opt-out provision that would allow an incorrectly enrolled member to annul then membership at any time would create too much uncertainty in the sector. Such a policy would mean that schemes would have a portion of their members that could, at any time, exit without further notice. These views have been taken into consideration when making the final recommendation. None of the options in this statement would: • impose additional costs on businesses; • impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or • override fundamental common law principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). K P trategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. KiwiSaver is a workplace savings scheme that is open to all New Zealand residents under the age of 65. People can join KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver provider, electing to join through their employer, or through automatic enrolment when they start a new job. 2. Minors (children under the age of 18) can only join KiwiSaver if they have the consent of all of their legal guardians (if under 16 years) or co-sign with a guardian (if 16 - 17 years of age). These restrictions recognise that joining KiwiSaver, which locks in funds until the member is 65, is a serious undertaking and minors should be protected while they are vulnerable and supported as they get older. For this reason, minors are only able to join KiwiSaver by directly contracting with a KiwiSaver provider. As the providers will be processing an application to join KiwiSaver, these providers are best equipped to receive and review the necessary parental consent. 3. When a person enrols in KiwiSaver through their employer, either by electing to join or through auto enrolment, the employer sends the person’s information to Inland Revenue through the existing PAYE system. Inland Revenue then passes that information on to a KiwiSaver provider. Inland Revenue does not perform any checks on the enrolment data to test whether the person is a minor or not. 4. Recent analysis of KiwiSaver enrolments has uncovered that as of April 2015 approximately 56,000 minors have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver through their employers, predominantly via auto-enrolment. Around 10,000 of these minors were under the age of 16 at the time of enrolment. 5. To date Inland Revenue has not received any complaints from minors who have been incorrectly enrolled into KiwiSaver through their employers. Furthermore, approximately 27,000 of the affected members have since transferred their KiwiSaver funds from one provider to another. However, should a member challenge their enrolment there is no remedy available under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 that will allow the member to exit the scheme. 6. Unlike a person over 65 or a non-resident, a minor is entitled to join KiwiSaver, albeit only by contracting directly with a provider. The current provisions available to reverse an invalid enrolment are only applicable to members who are not entitled to join KiwiSaver, not members who are entitled to join, but were enrolled through the wrong mechanism. 7. The Minors’ Contract Act 1969 does provide that a person who has entered into a contract as a minor can apply to the court to have that contract nullified. We are not aware of any minors making use of this provision at this point. While this does provide some protection it comes at considerable cost to the applicant and potentially the provider who may have to argue the application in court. 8. This RIS addresses the question of whether the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to allow minors that have been incorrectly enrolled to annul their membership. 2 OBJECTIVES 9. The key objectives are: a) Provide clearer protection to members who have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver when they were minors and who wish to annul their membership. b) Reduce the compliance costs incurred by KiwiSaver members who were incorrectly enrolled and who wish to annul their membership. c) Prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. d) Minimise disruption for those KiwiSaver members who have been enrolled incorrectly but who do not object to the enrolment. e) Minimise the impact on the key objective of KiwiSaver - to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Four options were considered as alternatives to the status quo. Options 2 and 3 would address future incorrect enrolments only, whereas options 4 and 5 would address historic cases as well. The options are: • Option 1 (status quo): Inland Revenue takes no additional actions to prevent incorrect enrolments. KiwiSaver members who were enrolled as minors cannot annul their membership without applying to the courts under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. • Option 2: Inland Revenue highlights to employers and KiwiSaver providers that minors can only enrol directly with a provider. (Officials’ preferred short-term administrative option) • Option 3: Inland Revenue develops a system to automatically check employer enrolments received and reject enrolments for minors. (Officials’preferred long-term administrative option) • Option 4: A new opt-out provision is introduced so that members who have been enrolled incorrectly can end their membership. • Option 5: A new opt-out provision is introduced so that members who have been th enrolled incorrectly can end their membership at any time before their 19 birthday. (Officials’ preferred policy option) 11. These options are not exclusive, for example options 2, 4 and 5 could be concurrently implemented. 3 Option 1: Status quo 12. Under the status quo: • Inland Revenue does not monitor enrolments for minors. • Employers incorrectly enrol minors into KiwiSaver and providers incorrectly accept those enrolments. • Members who have been incorrectly enrolled have no access to redress under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to annul their membership. • Members who wish to annul their membership must apply to the court under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. 13. While there have been no complaints from incorrectly enrolled minors to date there is also no cost effective remedy should a member wish to exit the scheme. Members and providers in this situation would incur costs should the member wish to take the matter up under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. Option 2 - additional communications to employers and providers 14. Under this option: • Inland Revenue communicates with employers and KiwiSaver providers to highlight their obligations in respect of minors and the KiwiSaver enrolment rules. • Resources and guides are reviewed to ensure these rules are sufficiently explained. • Employers are advised on how minors can enrol so that they can pass this on to their employees who want to join KiwiSaver. 15. The main advantages of this option are that it imposes only minimal additional cost on Inland Revenue, no additional compliance costs on employers or providers and requires no legislative change. 16. The main disadvantages is that it is unlikely to be fully effective (that is some minors would continue to be incorrectly enrolled) and it does not provide an effective remedy for incorrectly enrolled minors wishing to exit the scheme. Option 3 - Inland Revenue checks all enrolments for minors 17. Under this option: • Inland Revenue implements a new system where all enrolments received are checked to ensure the person is not a minor. • If the person is a minor a message would be sent back to the employer advising them that the enrolment is invalid. No information would be sent to the provider. 18. The main advantage of this option is that it would provide the best on-going protection for minors as it would, in the majority of cases, prevent them from being enrolled. 4 19. The disadvantages are: • Inland Revenue would need to invest in system enhancements which would rely on legacy systems. • Inland Revenue would need to release taxpayer confidential information back to the employer (i.e. that their employee is a minor). • Inland Revenue’s date of birth records are not 100 percent accurate so some incorrect rejections would be expected. • No cost effective remedy is provided for the 55,000 already incorrectly enrolled minors if any of them should wish to exit the scheme. Option 4 - Opt out members incorrectly enrolled as minors - no restriction 20. Under this option: • The KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended so that members who have been incorrectly enrolled can opt out of the scheme. • Opt-outs would only be available if the member had not subsequently directly contracted with a provider and given the necessary consent. • If a member opted out then they would have their contributions returned to them, their Government contributions returned to the Crown and their compulsory employer contributions returned to their employer. • There would be no restriction on when this opt out could occur. 21. The advantages of this option are: • Administration costs on Inland Revenue are minimised. The systems for unwinding the member’s enrolment are already in place for incorrectly enrolled non-residents or pensioners. • Members who were incorrectly enrolled are offered a cost effective remedy and can exit the scheme. Members who do not wish to exit the scheme are not disrupted. • Reduces compliance costs by eliminating the need for incorrectly enrolled members to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969 should they wish to exit the scheme. 22. The disadvantages of this option are: • Does not prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. • May encourage members to annul their membership when it is not in their long term interests to do so. 5 23. This last disadvantage is particularly relevant for members that were incorrectly enrolled but have since become adults and may have been contributing to their savings for several years. In these instances they would be able to withdraw all of the contributions they had made but they would lose the benefit of the crown contributions and their employers’ compulsory contributions. This could be attractive in the short term but may be detrimental in respect of longer term objectives such as providing for retirement. Option 5 - Opt out members incorrectly enrolled as minors until 19th birthday 24. Under this option: • The KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended so that members who have been incorrectly enrolled can opt out of the scheme at any time before their 19th birthday. • Opt outs would only be available if the member had not subsequently directly contracted with a provider and given the necessary consent. • If a member opted out then they would have their contributions returned to them, their Crown contributions (i.e. the kick-start payment and member tax credits) returned to the Crown and their compulsory employer contributions returned to their employer. 25. The opt-out would be available until the member has turned 19 so that they have at least one year as an adult to consider their situation. 26. The advantages of this option are • Administration costs on Inland Revenue are minimised. The systems for unwinding the member’s enrolment are already in place for incorrectly enrolled non-residents or pensioners. • Members who were incorrectly enrolled are offered an effective remedy and can exit the scheme up until their 19th birthday. Members who do not wish to exit the scheme are not disrupted. • Reduces compliance costs by eliminating the need for incorrectly enrolled members who have yet to turn 19 to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969 if they wish to exit the scheme. 27. The disadvantages of this option are: • Does not prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. • Members who have been incorrectly enrolled and who wish to exit the scheme but have turned 19 would still have to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. • May encourage members to annul their membership when it is not in their long term interests to do so. 28. This last disadvantage is less relevant for this option as the members do not qualify for Crown contributions until they turn 18 and so at most would have a years’ worth of Crown contributions that could be forgone. 6 29.

Workplace Savings NZ, who represent most KiwiSaver providers, were consulted. Comments received from providers both through Workplace Savings NZ and directly emphasised the need for Inland Revenue to play a more active role in policing the age requirements for employer enrolments. 32. The Treasury and the Ministry of Building, Innovation and Employment were consulted and supported the recommended options. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33. We support option 5. This would address to some extent the number of incorrect enrolments being made and provides a clear but limited ability for incorrectly enrolled members to easily exit the scheme. In the short term we also recommend option 2 be adopted - that is, Inland Revenue should send additional communications to employers and KiwiSaver providers stressing that minors cannot be enrolled through their employer. In the longer term, as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme of systemic change, we recommend that option 3 should be explored as a priority. Other impacts IMPLEMENTATION 34. Options 1 and 2 do not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required to implement options 3, 4 and 5. 35. Any legislative amendments can be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. Additional communications to employers and providers highlighting the current enrolment rules will be made later this year. 36. Inland Revenue will communicate any legislative changes to members, employers and providers through its existing channels, such as www.kiwisaver.govt.nz, the Tax Information Bulletin and by updating its guides MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 37. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review any of the policy proposals in this analysis. The number of incorrectly enrolled minors will continue to be measured and the impact of any additional communications to employers and providers will be monitored. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 9
Regulatory Impact Statement Allowing additional deductions to be made from salary or wages Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is how can Inland Revenue more efficiently use information it already holds about the employment of a defaulter in order to recover outstanding payments of tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. Requiring an employer to make deductions from wages or salary is one o f the most efficient means of debt collection available to Inland Revenue. If deductions are imposed soon after a default is detected, they ensure early recovery o f the debt and limit the growth of late payment interest or penalties. However, when Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to an employer, it is required to issue a notice to the defaulter at the same time. If Inland Revenue does not hold a valid address for the defaulter, it cannot send notification to them and therefore cannot send a deduction notice to the employer. Inland Revenue has considered a range o f options for requiring an employer to make additional deductions from a defaulting employee’s salary or wages when there is no valid address held for the employee. Because o f time constraints, Inland Revenue has not consulted with employers on any o f the options. Even so, we do not consider that our analysis o f the issues is impaired by the lack of external consultation with employers and employees. We note that only a small number of taxpayers are affected (approximately 700 at any time). The Treasury was consulted on the policy proposal. None of the options identified would impair private property rights or reduce market competition. However, two of the options involve some impairment of the common law principle of natural justice by reducing employees’ opportunity to challenge the basis on which the decision to increase wage or salary deductions is made, or to make alternative arrangements to redress any shortfall in PAYE, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. We also note that some of the options (not the preferred option) would impose additional costs on business. Keith Taylor Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Automatic deductions from salary or wages are one o f the most efficient means of debt collection available to Inland Revenue. They help to minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for taxpayers in a debt situation. If the automatic deductions are imposed soon after a default is detected, they limit the growth of late payment penalties or interest and ensure early recovery o f the debt. These deductions are additional to standard PAYE, ACC, child support contributions or student loan repayments. 2. Under current law, Inland Revenue is required to advise a defaulting taxpayer, liable parent, gaming machine operator or student loan borrower of its intention to make automatic additional deductions from salary or wages in order to recover unpaid tax, child support, duty, or student loan repayments. Notification is sent to the individual at the same time as the deduction notice is sent to the employer, giving them a short time (until their next pay day) during which they can contact Inland revenue to challenge the decision or make alternative arrangements to address the debt. 3. The release of the deduction notice to the employer is prevented if a valid address is not held for the defaulter. The system has been designed to protect the right o f the employee to be notified of the intended deductions so they can exercise their right to challenge the decision or make alternative arrangements. 4. As at 11 March 2015, the lack of a valid address is preventing recovery o f $718,044 from 545 taxpayers, across all tax types. In addition 170 student loan borrowers have additional repayment obligations that could be met through increased wage or salary deductions if we had valid addresses. The rate o f growth as penalties are applied will vary across tax types so that numbers and amounts owed will vary from time to time. The rate of recovery through additional deductions is limited by law to 20% of the wages or salary payable to an individual. 5. The current practice in these situations involves administrative costs for Inland Revenue and for employers, as manual intervention is required. This may include an initial phone call to the employer, followed, if necessary, by a written demand to provide the address details. Address records must then be updated before the deduction notice can be issued to the employer and copied to the defaulting employee. 6. Even so, the current practice seeks to preserve the rights o f the employee to be informed about the decision and be able to challenge it or choose how they will redress their non-compliance. 7. Inland Revenue should be able to use information it already holds about a defaulter’s employment to recover debt more efficiently when a defaulter has not only failed to meet payment obligations, but also failed to advise a change of address to Inland Revenue. 8. The question addressed in this RIS is how can Inland Revenue more efficiently use information it already holds about employment o f a defaulter in order to recover outstanding debt. OBJECTIVES 9. The key objectives are: (a) minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue (b) minimise compliance costs for defaulters and employers (c) reduce or limit the growth of late payment interest or penalties and effect full recovery in the shortest possible time (d) ensure that defaulters’ rights to object or make alternative arrangements to redress their default are maintained (fairness). 10. Trade-offs will need to be made across the various objectives. For example, options that seek to minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers may impair defaulters’ rights to object or make alternative arrangements to redress their default. 11. An additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue is its inability to make significant system changes in advance o f the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 12. One administrative and two legislative solutions were considered as alternatives to the status quo. The options are: • Option 1: Inland Revenue obtains contact details for the defaulter from their employer (status quo). • Option 2: Inland Revenue issues notice to the last known address of the defaulter. • Option 3: Inland Revenue issues notice to the employer for pass on to the defaulter. • Option 4: Inland Revenue dispenses with requirement to issue notice to the defaulter when it holds details o f the defaulter’s employer (preferred option). Option 1 — status quo 13. Under the status quo: • Inland Revenue contacts the employer and requests that the employer provide the defaulter’s address details. • Inland Revenue then updates the address details of the defaulter in its system. • Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to the employer and a copy to the defaulter. 14. The current practice creates additional compliance costs for Inland Revenue and for employers and an additional step in the recovery process, slowing the commencement of recovery, but preserves the rights o f the defaulter (for a very limited time) to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance before any action is taken. Option 2 - Issue notice to the last known address of defaulter 15. Under this option, Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to the employer and a copy to the defaulter’s last known “invalid” address. 16. The main advantage of this option is that it avoids imposing additional compliance costs on employers (compared with the status quo), as they are not required to provide Inland Revenue with updated address details for defaulters. 17. There are several disadvantages with this option, including: • The defaulter is unlikely to receive the notice so does not have the opportunity to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance. • The address held for the defaulter remains invalid. • There is potential for a breach of tax secrecy, as someone other than the intended recipient may open the mail (even though it is an offence under the Postal Services Act 1998 for a person to open mail addressed to another). • It could generate complaints from residents who have sent back previous pieces of correspondence, creating resource implications through additional work for call centres. • It would create extra work for Inland Revenue through manual activity in what is intended to be an automated process, with further resource implications. • Employers would be required to bear the compliance cost of dealing with employees who complain about reduction in pay. • There would be some delay in the commencement of debt recovery. • There may also be an increase in contacts to Inland Revenue call centres of complaints about the unexpected deduction from pay. Option 3 - Issue notice to employer for pass on to defaulter 18. Under this option, Inland Revenue takes manual action to issue the notice to the employer and a copy of the notice for the employer to pass on to the defaulter. 19. The main advantage of this option over the status quo is that it would limit growth of late payment interest and penalties and contribute to the earliest possible recovery o f debt. In addition, the defaulter would retain the limited right to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance before any action is taken. 20. The main disadvantages are: • It would impose additional compliance cost on employers. • There would be systems implications, which may be significant and could not be implemented until Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation reaches the relevant stage o f development. Until then, manual intervention would be needed. • The address details o f the defaulter remain invalid unless the defaulter contacts Inland Revenue and updates them. Option 4 -Dispense with requirement to issue notice to the defaulter 21. Under this option, Inland Revenue would issue the notice to employer when there has been a default on payment obligations, even though it is not possible to issue a copy o f the notice to the defaulter. Ultimately, the defaulter can regain the right to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance by re-engaging with Inland Revenue and updating their address records. 22. The main advantages of this option are: • It ensures that growth in late payment interest or penalties is limited by early intervention. • It contributes to the earliest possible recovery o f outstanding debt. • It will ultimately retain the automation o f the process when systems changes are possible. • In the interim, it can be implemented manually on a case-by-case basis with no additional administrative resources over the status quo. 23. The main disadvantages are: • By removing the requirement for formal notification to the employee it further limits the defaulter’s opportunity to dispute the outstanding amounts or make other arrangements for repayment. • Employers would be required to bear the compliance cost of dealing with those employees who complain about the unexpected reduction in their pay. • There may also be an increase in contacts to Inland Revenue call centres of complaints about the unexpected deduction from pay. 24. This is officials’ preferred option. Summary of impact analysis 25. The table below summarises our analysis of the options (including the status quo).

There are no social, cultural or environmental impacts. CONSULTATION AND IMPACT 27. Inland Revenue has not consulted with employers due to time constraints and the preferred option would reduce compliance costs over the status quo for the small number likely to be affected (approximately 700 in March 2015). The Treasury was consulted on the policy proposal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 28. We recommend Option 4 because it offers the biggest administrative cost reduction for Inland Revenue while offering improvements in efficiency o f debt recovery and a reduction in compliance costs for employers. We consider these efficiency gains outweigh the impairment in the defaulters’ right to natural justice because that impairment can be redressed by the defaulters taking action to update their address records. IMPLEMENTATION 29. Options 1 and 2 do not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required to implement options 3 and 4. 30. Amendments will be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. 31. The preferred option would be automated when Inland Revenue’s system changes are at a suitable stage o f development. In the interim, it could be implemented manually on a case-by-case basis. 32. Inland Revenue will communicate any legislative changes to employers through its existing channels, such as its guides and the Tax Information Bulletin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 33. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes to give effect to additional recovery o f outstanding payments of tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process.

It provides an analysis of options to simplify the collection of tax on employment income an employee receives under an employee share scheme (ESS). Specifically, it explores the idea of changing the way income tax on employee share scheme benefits is collected. None of the options discussed in this RIS are intended to alter the recognition or valuation of tax payable on an ESS benefit or change employers’ ability to deduct for income tax purposes the value of any ESS benefits provided to employees. These issues are part of a separate project that is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. The policy proposals in this RIS have been advanced ahead of this other project on employee share schemes so that it can be included as part of a package of measures in a June 2015 taxation bill that demonstrates the Government’s commitment to delivering tangible change through Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. These measures had to be fiscally neutral, straightforward to administer and implement, and not pre-empt any wider policy reforms scheduled for later stages of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Inland Revenue released an issues paper in April 2015 entitled Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes. The issues paper acknowledged that a number of problems exist with the way that tax is collected from benefits received under an employee share scheme. It sought comment on our definition of the problem with the current system, three options to allow employers to account for tax on employee share scheme benefits on their employees’ behalf, and whether the collection mechanism should be compulsory or apply at employers’ election. A total of 17 submissions were received on the issues paper. Submissions broadly agreed with our problem definition and the reasons for considering legislative change to shift the point at which tax is collected on ESS benefits. The majority of submissions were supportive of the idea of shifting the obligation to collect tax on ESS benefits to the employer. However, this support was conditional on: • Employers having the choice of collecting tax on ESS benefits; or • In the alternative, if employers did not have any choice, existing schemes should be outside the scope of any change - that is, employers with existing schemes should be outside the scope of any obligation to collect tax unless they chose to opt in. If source taxation applied to ESS benefits, submissions expressed a strong preference that the PAYE system be used, rather than the FBT system or a separate withholding tax system. Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 3 of 51 Submissions also recognised that if employers had the choice of whether to collect tax it would be reasonable for them to provide information to Inland Revenue about the employees who received an ESS benefit. However, submissions varied on what information should be disclosed. As a result of submissions and the need to improve the overall efficiency of collecting tax on ESS benefits, our preferred option is to use the PAYE system to collect tax and for employers to have the choice to withhold tax. Allowing the collection of tax to be optional permits employers to evaluate the tax benefits and costs so that the employer’s obligation to collect tax using the PAYE rules applies when, in the employer’s view, it is most efficient to do so. Inland Revenue considers that its information requirements can be met if the value of any ESS benefits is disclosed using the employer monthly schedule (EMS). Including the value of these benefits in the EMS would not automatically create an obligation to withhold tax. We recognise that this disclosure requirement may increase compliance costs for some employers in terms of valuation and funding the payment of tax. These costs, however, are currently incurred by employees. The Treasury and the Accident Compensation Corporation were involved in the policy development of the recommended proposal and agree with conclusions reached. Inland Revenue does not hold comprehensive information on the number of employee share schemes offered in New Zealand or the number of employees involved in such schemes. We are aware that large corporate taxpayers commonly use these schemes as part of their remuneration strategies. Our analysis has been based on comments received from submissions on the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, the expected outcomes under the options considered and contrasted against the status quo, and the current tax law that applies to employment income in the form of ESS benefits. None of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce the incentive for businesses to provide these schemes, or override fundamental common law principles. There are no other significant constraints, caveat or uncertainties concerning the analysis undertaken. Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 2 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 4 of 51 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current policy and law 1. Collecting tax at the source of income earned by a taxpayer is an important feature of modern tax systems. Collection at source ensures there is more accurate reporting of income and reduced collection risk. Collection at source also gives the Govermnent the ability to leverage the tax system to provide social policy outcomes - for example, the various social policy programmes that rely on accurate reporting of individual and household incomes such as child support, student loans and Working for Families tax credits. 2. Benefits1 provided to an employee under an employee share scheme (ESS) are “employment income” under the Income Tax Act 2007. Unlike most employment income or benefits, such as salary and wages or a use of a company car, however, it is not currently subject to tax at source under either the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) or Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) rules. This means that employee recipients of ESS benefits must file an individual tax return to account for the ESS benefits as income and pay the tax on those benefits themselves. Current practice 3. The collection of tax on ESS benefits has not been well understood to date and a number of companies have been accounting for ESS benefits through the PAYE system despite the law not providing for this. To clarify the correct treatment, Inland Revenue released a Large Enterprises Update in November 2013 which advised employers that ESS benefits are not subject to either PAYE or FBT so should not be included in their employer monthly schedule or FBT return. Instead they were advised that any employee receiving an ESS benefit must file an IR 3 tax return for the income year in which they receive it. 4. Following this Large Enterprises Update, stakeholders, including the Corporate Taxpayers Group have requested as a high priority a legislative amendment to permit employers to account for tax on ESS benefits at source, preferably through the PAYE system. The problem 5. The current collection mechanism requiring an employee to file a return and account for the tax on ESS benefits imposes compliance costs on taxpayers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. As no tax is deducted at source, the obligation to return the ESS benefit as income may be unfamiliar territory for employees who may not be used to not filing tax returns with Inland Revenue. Further complications can arise if the employee needs to sell shares to meet any tax obligations and, if the obligation is large enough (the residual income 1 The “benefit” under an ESS is, in the case of an acquisition of shares, the amount by which the value of the shares when they were acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. Share options provided to employees are generally not taxed until they are exercised, at which time the tax treatment in the previous sentence applies. 3 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 5 of 51 tax is $2,500 or more)2 the employee could find themselves subject to the provisional tax rules and use of money interest (UOMI). 6. These tax compliance costs can also: • act as a barrier to the attractiveness of employee share schemes as a form of remuneration; • affect the likelihood of voluntary compliance by the employee; and • potentially result in lost tax revenue. 7. When contrasted against the collection of tax under the PAYE system or the FBT rules, the current rules for collecting tax on ESS benefits is arguably inefficient for both employees and Inland Revenue. 8. The question to be addressed in this RIS is what improvements can be made to the collection of tax on ESS benefits to help simplify and improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. OBJECTIVES 9. The main objective of this review is to simplify the way tax is collected on ESS benefits in order to improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. 10. The optimum option should: • minimise compliance costs on employees; • minimise administration costs for Inland Revenue; • reduce the risk of non-compliance in connection with the taxation of ESS benefits; and • be fiscally neutral. 11. This review is not intended to pre-empt any wider policy reforms scheduled for later stages of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. It is also not intended to alter the recognition or valuation of tax payable on an ESS benefit or change employers’ entitlements to deduct the value of any ESS benefits provided to employees. These issues are part of a separate project that is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. 12. We also note that the chosen option is not intended to affect the status quo treatment of employee share scheme benefits for student loans, child support, Kiwisaver, Working for Families Tax Credits and the ACC earners’ levy. 2 Residual income tax is the positive amount of tax still owed by an individual after subtracting the amount of any tax credits - such as tax paid by the employee through the PAYE system. 4 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 6 of 51 13. Trade-offs will inevitably be made across the various objectives. For example, solutions that seek to minimise Inland Revenue’s administrative costs may impose compliance costs on employers. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 14. Four options (including the status quo) are considered in this RIS for the collection of tax on ESS benefits. These options, which were canvased in the April 2015 officials’ paper, are: • Option 1 (status quo) - individuals must declare any ESS benefits in their tax return which is filed at the end of the year and any tax is collected as part of the end-of-the-year annual assessment. • Option 2 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through the PAYE system. • Option 3 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through the FBT system. • Option 4 - employers collect tax on any ESS benefits through a separate withholding tax system. 15. Options, 2, 3 and 4 will tax ESS benefits at source and shift the tax obligation from employees to employers. 16. The impact of each option is summarised in the attached annex to this RIS. None of the options have: • Social, cultural or environmental impacts. • Fiscal impacts, although it is expected that collection of revenue should be improved by shifting the collection of tax from employees to employers. 17. In addition, we have considered whether the preferred option of collecting tax by employers should be compulsory or elective. This discussion is set out below. Collection of tax options Option 1 (status quo) 18. Option 1 is to retain the status quo as described under the heading “Status quo and problem definition”. We recognise that for some schemes it is more efficient for the employee to retain responsibility for meeting any tax obligations arising from the receipt of an ESS benefit and this is reflected in our comments under the heading “Conclusions and recommendations”. 5 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 7 of 51 Option 2: PAYE (preferred option) 19. Under this option, the employer withholds PAYE on the value of the ESS benefits and pays this amount to Inland Revenue as part of the employers’ “employer monthly schedule” (EMS). 20. The main advantages of this option are: • PAYE is a very efficient method of collecting tax and an important part of modern tax systems. • Most payroll systems have fully automated the tax compliance obligations for PAYE and so the costs to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer the PAYE system are relatively low. • Despite the concerns about applying PAYE to a non-cash form of employment income (below), submitters generally preferred the PAYE option as it is generally well understood by employers and maintains the economic incidence of tax on the employee. • The PAYE system is also better integrated with the Government’s social policy programmes, subject to legislative modifications to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the Kiwisaver Act 2006 to ensure that amounts subject to PAYE withholding are not taken into account under these Acts. 21. The main disadvantage with this option is one of application. The underlying principle with PAYE is that tax can be readily withheld as the employees’ salary and wages are in cash. However, in the case of ESS benefits (which are shares and not cash) there is an in principle difficulty with applying PAYE. To make PAYE work, employers would have to: • recover the cost of tax from the employee, that is - deducting the tax from the employee’s wage or salary; • sell a portion of the employee’s ESS entitlement on their behalf to fund the tax - assuming the ESS arrangement provided the employer with this power; or • provide a cash gross-up to accompany the ESS benefit to fund the PAYE. Employers raised concerns that in situations where the employee and the employer had reached a bargain in terms of an employee’s remuneration and ESS entitlements, an additional gross-up could make the ESS too expensive for the employer. 22. Employer concerns about funding tax payments are the same faced by employees when they have to account for tax themselves. 6 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 8 of 51 Option 3: FBT 23. Under this option, employers’ calculate FBT on the value of any ESS benefits received by the employee and pays this tax to Inland Revenue. 24. The main advantages of this option are: • FBT is conceptually a purer method of taxing non-cash benefits. • FBT is designed specifically to tax non-cash benefits and remuneration received by an employee. • FBT is designed with equity in mind by ensuring that non-cash remuneration received by employees is subject to tax at a similar level to cash remuneration. The gross-up aspect described above is built into the FBT rules via the tax rate structure and the cost of FBT and the legal incidence of the tax falls on the employer. 25. This option has a number of shortcomings, including: • All employers have payroll systems that broadly comply with the requirements of the PAYE rules. The provision of fringe benefits, however, is less common and some employers would not have the requisite compliance systems in place to meet their obligations under the FBT rules. Using FBT as a means of collecting tax at source would therefore be unfamiliar to some employers and require them to develop new systems to manage compliance with the FBT rules. This would likely increase employer tax compliance costs over and above those incurred by employees under the status quo and could make it unattractive for employers to provide an ESS. • From an Inland Revenue systems perspective, FBT - being a tax on the employer - is not fully integrated with the systems used to report and manage employees’ child support obligations. • For tax technical reasons, tax collected under the FBT rules means it does not count for the purposes of tax relief for employees in a cross-border context. New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreement network treats FBT as an employer tax. As such, employees cannot claim any credit for New Zealand tax paid. Option 4: Alternative withholding tax system 26. A separate method of withholding, such as using withholding regulations, was initially considered but not advanced due to constraints on Inland Revenue’s ability to implement the change. As noted in the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, we considered there was little justification for developing a new system of withholding tax when alternative well-developed systems such as PAYE and FBT already exist. 7 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 9 of 51 27. Reactions from tax specialists to this option were mixed. While some considered it an optimal option, others were concerned about the prospect of having to develop new compliance systems. Others did not see the case for duplicating compliance costs under a new withholding system when the PAYE system (option 2) could be used. Implementation: compulsory or elective 28. There are two approaches to implementing the collection of tax on ESS benefits at source. They are the compulsory approach or elective approach. Compulsory approach 29. There are administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue if option 2 applied to all ESS. 30. A compulsory option, however, presents a number of problems for employers and a key theme in submissions was how a source basis of collection was not appropriate for all schemes, see paragraph 48. Employers were also concerned about the impact a compulsory set of rules would have on: • the employer’s working capital - for example, if the employer is a start-up company or funding the payment of tax on the ESS benefit generally; • agreements or understandings that exist for current schemes if it is not possible for the employer to sell shares on the employee’s behalf to meet any tax liability on the ESS benefits, or otherwise affect any contractual agreements about the value of any benefits provided under the scheme; • bargains struck between the employer and the employee and the risk to the employer having to fund the tax payable on ESS benefits; • employee tax entitlements or obligations - for example, if the employee is a short-term tax resident of New Zealand or has tax losses or expenses he or she wishes to use against any tax liability created by the ESS benefit. 31. Submissions argued that existing schemes would need to be removed (grandparented) from the scope of any change as it would be time consuming and costly to renegotiate existing ESS agreements to provide for tax collection at source. 32. Consideration of a compulsory approach to collection of tax on ESS benefits, including grandparenting, was not advanced in recognition that in some situations it is more efficient for the employee to remain responsible for the payment of tax on ESS benefits under the status quo. This conclusion assumed, however, that any elective approach to the tax collection of ESS benefits would be supported by appropriate disclosures from the employer to Inland Revenue about their employees’ (including ex-employees where any legacy entitlement exists) ESS entitlements. 8 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 10 of 51 Elective approach 33. An elective approach to collecting tax at source was strongly preferred by tax specialists and employers for the very reasons why compulsory rules were considered undesirable. Allowing the collection of tax to be optional permits employers to evaluate the tax benefits and costs so that the employer’s obligation to collect tax using the PAYE rules applies when, in the employer’s view, it is most efficient. 34. An elective approach is an effective way of reducing compliance costs. The risk with flexibility is that it reduces the efficiency of collecting tax at source. Flexibility creates additional administration costs and, by itself, does not deal with Inland Revenue’s concerns in terms of ensuring employee compliance. Submissions argued that the choice should be the employer’s and not the employee’s. Inland Revenue agrees and further notes that any election not to withhold tax should be done on a per-scheme basis as opposed to a per- employee basis. 35. The trade-off for providing the employer with a choice is the need for Inland Revenue to have better information about when an employee receives an ESS benefit. 36. Submissions received on the officials’ paper recognised that if the employer had the choice to collect tax, it was reasonable for the employer to provide information to Inland Revenue about the employees who received an ESS benefit in cases where tax was not collected at source. Submissions varied on what information should be disclosed, however. Those advocating the use of PAYE considered that employers’ payroll system would meet Inland Revenue’s needs. Other employers considered that the information should be separately disclosed by some other means. 37. We considered two means by which the relevant information could be received by Inland Revenue. • The employer monthly schedule (EMS): The data points contained in the employer monthly schedule provides Inland Revenue with the information needed to administer the collection of tax on ESS benefits (irrespective of employers’ election to withhold tax on the benefit). This information can be captured in a timely and administratively efficient manner without any impact on Inland Revenue’s technology platforms and meet the objective that Inland Revenue can implement with minimum cost. This option will create reconciliation errors due to amounts not being counted for Kiwisaver and when the employer chooses not to withhold tax. Inland Revenue considers these errors can be tolerated as the critical information is captured and can be examined as part of any end-of-year square up process. • Other alternatives - information request, letter or new Inland Revenue form '. We considered other means by which the requisite information could be captured - for example, employees’ tax file numbers and the value of the ESS benefit and when it was received. This information could be captured by way of an information request, letter or a new Inland Revenue form. Inland Revenue had 9 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 11 of 51 concerns about whether, when contrasted against the EMS, the information would be received in a timely manner and how it would be integrated into Inland Revenue’s FIRST system. Resolving these problems would increase implementation costs and raise administration risks in terms of consistent application of the proposal change, retrieval of employers’ decisions about withholding, and enforcing compliance. 38. We recognise that for some employers the requirement to disclose the value of employees’ ESS benefits will involve some cost. Specifically: • the need to value shares received by employees, and • for certain schemes ensure that the receipt of any ESS benefits is appropriately captured by employers’ payroll systems. New Zealand employers whose employees participate in a global ESS may also need to ensure they receive information from their international group about any ESS benefits that vest in their New Zealand employees. 39. These costs are currently incurred by employees under the status quo. CONSULTATION Initial consultation 40. Preliminary consultation was undertaken by officials during the policy development phase of the project and development of an officials’ issues paper. Organisations consulted included the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young. Comments from stakeholders indicated employers and employees would generally prefer that PAYE applied to ESS benefits. Officials’ issues paper 41. In April 2015, officials released the issues paper Simplifying the collection o f tax on employee share schemes, which is available at http://taxpolicv.ird.govt.nz/publications/2015- ip-emplovee-share-schemes/overview. 42. The issues paper discussed changing the collection of tax from ESS using the PAYE system, the FBT rules or a separate withholding tax. Both tax collection systems would shift the collection of tax on ESS benefits to a source basis. The issues paper also discussed whether any change should be mandatory or not. 43. To allow for the possibility that any reforms resulting from the issues paper could be included in a proposed taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015, five weeks were allowed for consultation before submissions closed on 5 May 2015. A total of 17 submissions were received. 10 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 12 of 51 44. Submissions were broadly supportive of the idea of shifting the point of taxation to source, provided that the employer had the ability to elect to use the rules. Submissions also recognised that any elective use of the rules would need to be accompanied by a suitable disclosures system to allow Inland Revenue to know which employees had received an ESS benefit. Those who supported changing the collection of tax to source, agreed with the problems officials identified with the status quo. The PAYE system was the generally preferred method of collection. 45. Two submissions were strongly opposed to any change from the status quo. 46. The arguments for making any change elective, including not proceeding at all with the changes, were similar. Main submission points 47. The main submission points centred on: • Source basis collection is not appropriate for all schemes • Impacts on employers • Impacts on employees • Interaction with the Government’s social policy programmes Source basis collection is not appropriate fo r all schemes 48. Submitters identified a number of instances when taxing ESS benefits at source would be inappropriate. These instances included: • Executive schemes: Submissions noted that the recipients of shares under an executive scheme were generally sophisticated taxpayers who would be used to meeting their own tax obligations. Shifting the collection point to the employer would therefore not result in a reduction in compliance costs. Submissions also noted concern about situations when the tax payable, due to the size of the benefit, could exceed the taxpayer’s net salary (assuming the employer is unable to sell a portion of the share entitlement on the executive’s behalf to meet the tax liability on the ESS benefit). • International schemes: Global employee share schemes, where the issuer of the shares is a non-resident with no other tax obligations in New Zealand, could be required to comply with the New Zealand PAYE rules for a relatively small number of New Zealand employees. • Schemes offered by start-up companies: Employee share schemes are a cost effective means of remunerating staff in situations when the company does not have substantial working capital to support monetary remuneration and for 11 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 13 of 51 recruitment reasons need to provide a competitive remuneration package. Imposing source taxation on these schemes would make it more costly for the employer to provide and remove the advantages of including a non-cash component in a remuneration package. 49. A number of submissions noted problems with the way the Income Tax Act 2007 taxes ESS benefits with particular regard to identifying when an ESS benefit is derived and its value. Currently, the employee is responsible for these obligations as part of filing a return of income. If the collection point is moved to a source-basis, these obligations fall on the employer. The valuation of ESS benefits was identified as a particular concern for start-up companies and other non-listed companies whose shares would have to be valued and the cost of such activity would be borne by the employer. Impact on employers 50. Submissions expressed concern at the rework required for existing payroll systems if the obligation to withhold tax was mandatory. 51. Others noted existing schemes would need to be renegotiated and any benefits would need to be re-priced. Specifically, submitters were conscious that changing the point of tax collection could interfere with existing bargains struck between employers and employees. For example, if the employer was required to withhold tax at source on ESS benefits there is a risk that the employer would have to gross-up the benefit to take into account any tax payable to Inland Revenue. Grandparenting of existing schemes, if the collection of tax at source was not optional, was suggested. 52. Others noted concerns about the ability for employers to sell shares to meet employee tax obligations. A number noted that it would not be possible to sell shares if: • the contract under which the ESS benefit is provided did not allow for the employer to sell shares; • the employer may in certain periods be unable to sell shares because of prohibitions under other legislation, for example, the sale of share may be illegal for reasons of insider trading during “black out” (restrictions on trading) periods or other restrictions and covenants applicable in employment contracts; • shares in the company may not be readily sold - “illiquid shares”; this is particularly relevant for start-up companies. 53. The concern underlying these comments is the impact taxing at source would have on the employer’s working capital if the employer had to pay tax on the employee’s behalf. Submissions did not accept that the cashflow effect of collection at source would be adequately remedied by the employer selling a portion of the employee’s share entitlement to meet any tax obligations - assuming this was allowable under the relevant employee share scheme in the first place. 54. A few submissions commented on the information requirements needed to calculate the value of rights and options under an employee share scheme. Some thought the requirement 12 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 14 of 51 would be difficult to comply with while others noted that in their experience employers will be aware of the option exercise price as it will be specified in the share scheme offer documentation provided to the employee. 55. Other technical matters were raised in connection with how taxation at source would apply to past employees who might have legacy entitlements under an employee share scheme and the interaction of the proposals on employee entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003.3 Impact on employees 56. Submissions noted that some employees could have expenses and losses to use against any tax payable on an ESS benefit. Since these employees would be filing a return in any event, there is no point in the employer also bearing a tax compliance cost. More importantly, other employees, particularly those who are non-residents may have tax obligations in other countries. Imposing tax at source could act as a disincentive. These points argue against the use of the FBT rules. Interaction with the Government’s social policy programmes 57. Submissions generally endorsed the position that ESS benefits are counted towards an employee’s child support and student loans obligations and Working for Families tax credit entitlements. Taxation at source was seen as a way of supporting the integrity of these programmes. It was noted that ESS benefits should not count for the purposes of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the Kiwisaver Act 2006. 58. The officials’ issues paper noted the intention was not to change the status quo treatment of ESS benefits under the Government’s social policy programmes. Consultation with government agencies 59. The Treasury and the Accident Compensation Corporation were consulted and agree with our conclusions. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Ministry for Social Development were also consulted. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 60. The current collection of income tax on ESS benefits presents a number of problems for employers and employees. The current rules are not necessarily well understood and the requirement that the employee must file an individual tax return to account for the ESS benefits as income and pay the tax on those benefits can lead to non-compliance. We ' Inland Revenue notes that shifting the tax collection point to the source of the benefit does not directly impact on employee entitlements under the Holidays Act. Entitlements under the Holidays Act are based on the employee's remuneration package, not the tax treatment of such benefits. 13 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 15 of 51 consider that there are good efficiency and tax system integrity arguments for shifting the income tax collection point from employees to employers. We considered several options that would achieve this outcome, such as the PAYE rules (option 2), the FBT rules (option 3) or a separate system of withholding (option 4). Options 3 and 4 did not meet most of the required objectives of: • minimising compliance costs on employees; • minimising administration costs for Inland Revenue; • reducing the risk of non-compliance in connection with the taxation of ESS benefits; • be fiscally neutral; • not affecting employees’ entitlements or obligations for student loans, child support, Working for Families tax credits, Kiwisaver and the ACC earners’ levy. 61. Option 2 met most of the objectives but may impose additional compliance costs on employers. Consultation with stakeholders suggested that these compliance costs meant that taxing ESS benefits at source is not always appropriate or efficient. We accept these concerns and adjusted our view about whether option 2 should have compulsory application. 62. We recommend reforming the collection of tax on ESS benefits by: • allowing the employer to choose to withhold tax on any ESS benefits received by an employee using the PAYE system (option 2 using an elective approach). • requiring the employer to disclose the value of any ESS benefits via the employer monthly schedule - this would apply in all cases whether the employer chose to withhold tax or not. 63. We recommend any legislative changes be included in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015 and apply from 1 April 2017. 64. The recommended option takes into account the compliance cost concerns identified in submissions. Using the PAYE system to improve the collection of tax on employee share benefits transfers compliance costs that are currently borne by the employee to the employer. From an employee’s perspective, officials consider that taxation of employee share benefits at source is a better approach to collecting tax. It is a more consistent and coherent approach to taxing employment income. It is also consistent with the general policy of simplifying employees’ tax obligations. Subjecting an employee to a potentially complex filing requirement for what may be a small tax liability when that employee would not otherwise have to file a return is inconsistent with the policy objective of simplicity and reduced compliance costs. 65. For the most part, it is more efficient for the employer to bear the cost of compliance. As submissions have already argued however, where this does not hold true, the employer can elect not to withhold tax under the PAYE system. 14 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 16 of 51 66. The trade-off for providing the employer with a choice is the need for Inland Revenue to have better information about when an employee receives such a benefit.4 Employers may need to update their payroll systems to capture the requisite information. 67. The disclosure requirement may also create additional compliance costs for employers whose shares are not traded on a market exchange. As noted earlier, these costs exist currently, but they are borne by the employee. As the shares are issued by the employing company (or international group or an entity under the control of the employer), the employer is likely to have better information about the value of any share benefits. IMPLEMENTATION 68. If approved, the preferred option will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Kiwisaver Act 2006 and the Accident Compensation Act 2001. 69. These changes can be included in the next taxation bill scheduled for introduction in June 2015. 70. The legislative changes would apply from 1 April 2017 to allow employers and software developers’ sufficient time to implement the necessary payroll and information systems changes to allow withholding and comply with the disclosure of ESS benefit information to Inland Revenue. 71. When introduced into Parliament, a commentary on the bill will be released explaining the amendments and further explanation of their effect will be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 72. Inland Revenue will administer the proposed changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. 73. The proposed changes largely align with Inland Revenue’s existing systems. It is expected that using the EMS to receive information about ESS benefits may generate return errors if the employer does not withhold tax. These errors would require Inland Revenue to undertake additional manual work to correct. However, this is seen as a reasonable trade-off for the improved information Inland Revenue would receive about employees’ ESS benefits. Inland Revenue is preparing suitable communications materials for employers about the changes. 74. Submissions recognised the importance of counting the value of ESS benefits for determining employee social policy entitlements and obligations and that any changes to the collection of tax should not change the status quo. As noted in the officials’ paper, it is not 4 It is possible that the disclosure requirement would also apply to ex-employees in the rare case when legacy entitlements might exist under an employee share scheme agreement. This may require, if the employer does not already do so under the scheme, additional communications between the employer and ex-employee regarding any entitlements. ~ 15 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 17 of 51 the intention to change the way ESS benefits are treated for the purposes of child support, student loans, Working for Families tax credits, ACC and Kiwisaver. ESS benefits should not count for the purposes of the ACC earners’ levy and Kiwisaver contributions and changes are required to the Accident Compensation Act 2001, and the Kiwisaver Act 2006 to ensure this outcome. 75. ESS benefits would continue to count toward child support, student loans and Working for Families tax credits. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 76. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of collecting tax on ESS benefits would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi­ stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. 77. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 16 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 18 of 51 ANNEX SUMMARY OF IMPACTS OF THE OPTIONS (INCLUDING THE STATUS QUO) Option 1: Status quo Description Impacts Employees Employers/payroll intermediariesTax system(by reference to the Society (by reference to social No tax withheld at source. and software developers integrity o f the tax system, impact on Inland Revenue and revenue impact) policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue) Advantages ---- Disadvantages Compliance costs associated with filing returns and payment of tax on any ESS benefits received. If the amount of tax payable exceeds $2,500, the employee faces the prospect of having to comply with the provisional tax rules and accounting for tax in instalments throughout the year. Employees need to have cash resources to meet any tax obligations. Risk to the tax base from employee non-compliance. Inland Revenue incurs higher administration costs associated with processing returns and any necessary enforcement action. Elevated tax collection risk due to employees being uncertain about their obligations under the Income Tax Act 2007. Mitigating factors Employees can sell shares to meet any tax liabilities. ESS benefits counted towards any obligations/entitlements for child support, student loans or Working for Families tax credits. Conclusion: Employee bears the cost of compliance and associated tax risk. Inland Revenue faces increased non-compliance risk. 17 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 19 of 51 Option 2: Collection using the PAYE system (preferred option) Description Impacts Tax on ESS benefits is collected using the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system Employees Employers/payroll intermediaries and software developers Tax system (by reference to the integrity o f the tax system, impact on Inland Revenue and revenue impact) Society (by reference to social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue) Advantages Employees have more certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits including their obligations. Reduced compliance costs. Increased employee certainty about the tax treatment of ESS benefits may support the take up of such schemes and inclusion in remuneration packages. All employers have PAYE systems. Improved compliance. Improved tax collection. Reduced revenue risk. Reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue from fewer individual tax returns and follow up enforcement action. ESS benefits counted towards any obligations/entitlements for child support, student loans or Working for Families tax credits. Disadvantages Possible risk that tax payable on ESS benefits could exceed income. Employers need to change payroll systems to include ESS benefits.

Alternative well-developed systems such as PAYE and FBT already exist. Recommended proposal: Employer election with data capture using the PAYE’s employer monthly schedule (EMS) Description Employer to choose to withhold tax on any ESS benefits received by an employee using the PAYE system Employers disclose the value of any ESS benefits via the employer monthly schedule - this would apply in all cases whether the employer chose to withhold tax or not.

It provides an analysis of options to remove a significant barrier to Inland Revenue employees co-locating with employees of other state agencies. The analysis involved examining Inland Revenue’s current co-location arrangements in Christchurch and other regional offices. The special circumstances of the co-location arrangements in Christchurch were noted. The analysis was limited to examining options for removing barriers to Inland Revenue sharing call centres and administrative areas with other government agencies. The analysis did not examine secrecy issues with reception and front counter areas. The analysis also did not examine any wider options for co-locating with other government or private sector agencies. The consultation on this proposal involved discussing the secrecy issues with Inland Revenue employees that were involved in the current co-location arrangements. The Privacy Commissioner was also consulted. The policy options will not: • impose additional costs on businesses • impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or • override fundamental common law principles . Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 1 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 25 of 51 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The current secrecy provision in the Tax Administration Act (section 81 of the TAA) does not allow Inland Revenue employees to communicate taxpayer information (including to other government agencies) except in limited, defined circumstances. Further, the provision requires employees to maintain, and assist in maintaining, the secrecy of taxpayer information. There are severe penalties for an Inland Revenue employee who knowingly breaches secrecy provisions. In addition, under section 6 of the TAA every Inland Revenue employee must use their best endeavours at all times to protect the integrity of the tax system (including the rights of the taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential). The effective administration of the tax system relies on voluntary compliance. A critical element of voluntary compliance is taxpayers trusting that Inland Revenue will not disclose their information inappropriately. 2. One of the four key priorities of the Government is to ensure the delivering of better public services. Inland Revenue is investigating co-location opportunities as part of the future direction of service delivery. Co-location is aimed at providing a better service by standardising processes, reducing duplication of effort and delivering prioritised services to meet local needs. Inland Revenue is currently co-locating with other government agencies in some offices and call centres across New Zealand. While some co-locations have been able to be achieved while still maintaining physical separation between agencies (which minimises secrecy risks) such separation is not always possible — for example, in post-earthquake Christchurch co-locations are "open-plan". Specifically, about 370 Inland Revenue call centre and collections staff share an “open-plan” area with 130 Ministry of Social Development staff at Russley Road and 10-12 Inland Revenue staff at Durham Street are surrounded by about 70-80 Ministry of Social Development staff. 3. Under such an approach, Inland Revenue employees are exposed to the risk of inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government agencies at co-located sites. This could arise if the other agency's employees were to overhear conversations (between Inland Revenue staff discussing a case, and conversations with taxpayers themselves), or if they happen to see Inland Revenue correspondence, or as a result of shared office facilities and equipment. 4. Given that further co-location is planned (including in open-plan sites) this gives rise to the issue of proximity with other government employees and inadvertent disclosure of taxpayer information with those employees. Inland Revenue considers that no amount of training or best practice guidelines or adopted behaviour is likely to adequately address the substantial risk of Inland Revenue employees inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government employees in the co-location environment. Inland Revenue considers that architectural changes can be made to open-plan areas to reduce the risks. However, the changes would be costly and would arguably undermine the benefits of co-locating. 5. There is, therefore, a balance between maintaining the integrity of the tax system (including taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system) and delivering better public services through co-location. 6. Maintaining the status quo means the existing risk to employees of inadvertently breaching section 81 will remain, and so being subject to severe penalties. That this risk exists makes employees reluctant to work in an open-plan environment. In addition, given this risk, taxpayers may have concerns about the level of secrecy applying in a co-located environment, which may harm the perception of the integrity of the tax system. The current 2 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 26 of 51 risks also make Inland Revenue more reluctant to enter into co-location arrangements with other government agencies. Such a result is counter to the Government’s policy of increasing efficiency in the delivery of government services and achieving cost reductions across government. OBJECTIVES 7. The key objectives to facilitate co-location are to: (a) reduce the risks for Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff from other government agencies in a co-location environment; (b) confirm for taxpayers secrecy will be maintained in a co-location environment (bearing in mind the importance of taxpayer secrecy in the administration of the tax system); and (c) enable Inland Revenue to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Four broad options and the status quo (option 5) have been considered for addressing the problems and achieving the stated objectives. These options are: • Option 1: lowering the overall secrecy standard in section 6 of the TAA to reduce the risks from co-locating with other government agencies. The current standard in section 6 for Inland Revenue officers to use “best endeavours” to protect the integrity of the tax system (including ensuring the individual affairs of taxpayers are kept confidential) is a very high threshold. Inland Revenue believes that lowering the general secrecy standard to “reasonable endeavours” could reduce some of the risks from co-locating; • Option 2: deem the co-located staff from the other government agency to be Inland Revenue staff for the purposes of the secrecy provision. Option 2 would apply the same secrecy requirements to the co-located staff as apply to Inland Revenue staff in Inland Revenue open-plan areas and call centres; • Option 3: include a specific provision that sets out the secrecy requirements in a co- location environment. The specific provision would mean that an Inland Revenue employee is deemed to have not breached section 81 by inadvertently disclosing tax secret information to a co-located employee of another government agency. The employee from the other government agency will have signed a secrecy certificate under section 87. The specific provision will only apply when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers that the risk of communication is consistent with her obligation at all times to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system; • Option 4 (preferred option): include a general provision for communications by Inland Revenue employees where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expects them to perform their duties. The employee will not breach the secrecy provision in those circumstances if the employee communicates the information unintentionally to an employee of Inland Revenue or an employee of another state agency subject to section 87 of the TAA; • Option 5: maintain the status quo. 3 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 27 of 51 9. The impacts of options 1 to 4 and the status quo option, and whether they meet the objectives in paragraph 7, are summarised in the table below. 4 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 28 of 51 O ption M eets objectives (a), (h), or (c)? F iscal/ econom ic im pact A dm inistrative im pact for In land R evenue C om pliance im pact fo r taxpayers R isks Sum m ary O p tion 1b,c Nil Lowering the overall standard in section 6 would not provide Inland Revenue employees with any clarity as to the required standard of secrecy in a co-located environment because: • the change would not affect the specific secrecy requirements in section 81; and • the employees would have to determine in any environment whether reasonable steps had been taken to protect the integrity of the tax system. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. Reducing the overall standard in section 6 could suggest to taxpayers a decreased focus on maintaining the integrity of the tax system, which could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. The broad-brush approach of reducing the overall standard may have unforeseen consequences in other situations or environments. Option 1 does not meet all of the stated objectives. While it provides increased flexibility to Inland Revenue, it may undennine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. 1 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 29 of 51 O p tion 2 a, b, cNilOption 2 would seem to provide Inland Revenue employees with clarity because they will be able to apply the same internal secrecy standards to co­ located environments. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. Option 2 would suggest to taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments. However, it would arguably also allow sharing of information between Inland Revenue employees and co­ located staff which could be inconsistent with the limited specific information sharing provisions in the TAA. In other words, the option may sanction more than is intended. If taxpayers consider that there is unlimited sharing of information, this may undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. Section 81 only exempts communications for the purpose of carrying into effect the relevant legislation or performing a duty of the Commissioner. There is a risk that communications between Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff would not satisfy that requirement (even if the co-located staff were deemed to be Inland Revenue employees). This would mean that there is a risk that the option will not remedy the relevant policy problem. Having the co-located staff sign secrecy certificates under section 81 would mean that they were subject to the same sanctions for any secrecy breaches as Inland Revenue employees. However, there has been some level of opposition in the past from other government agencies to having their staff sign Inland Revenue secrecy certificates. As a result, there is a risk that the other agencies will not agree to sign the certificates. Option 2 meets all of the stated objectives, but it arguably allows more information sharing than is intended. O p tion 3 a, b, cNilOption 3 would provide clarity to Inland Revenue employees by setting out the specific secrecy requirements in a co-located environment. It would also specify the requirement on the Option 3 applies the same high standard of secrecy to the co-located staff (including imposing the same severe sanctions for any breaches). The option only applies to inadvertent sharing and does There is a risk that the other agencies will not agree to sign the certificates.

Getting the co-located staff to sign a section 87 secrecy certificate would provide them with clarity as to the extent that they can disclose any information. Further, the relevant co- location arrangement agreement between Inland Revenue and the other government agency could set out any exceptions to the disclosure requirements and the process to be followed in case of any conflicts. The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs in a co- location environment. However, the option will not enable the provision of better public services in a broader range of circumstances. not sanction any wider sharing of information. This will suggest to taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments and reinforce taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 31 of 51 O p tion 4 a, b, cNil Option 4 provides clarity to Inland Revenue employees in a broad range of circumstances. It applies wherever the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expects them to perform their duties. This may extend beyond the strict confines of the office to include situations such as where two employees are driving to a location. The employee will not breach the secrecy provision in those circumstances if the employee communicates the information unintentionally to an employee of Inland Revenue or another state agency (eg, where they answer a phone call while travelling in the car). The option would provide Inland Revenue with significant operational flexibility to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs in a broader range of circumstances. The exemption only applies if the person communicated to is subject to section 87. This means that they need to have signed a secrecy certificate. As a result, the same standard of secrecy that applies in Inland Revenue offices will apply to co-located offices. Inland Revenue considers that the option will reinforce taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. While there is no specific reference to the obligation on employees to use their best endeavours at all times to protect the integrity of the tax system, the employees are still subject to section 6. While the more general nature of the provision could suggest more information sharing than is currently the case, this is not intended to be the case. Any sharing of information would have to be unintentional. There is a risk that the other agencies will not agree to sign the certificates. There is a small risk that the general nature of the provision will suggest to taxpayers that Inland Revenue is lowering its overall secrecy standard. This could undermine taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance. However, the specific requirement in the proposed provision, that the sharing be unintentional, should mitigate any significant risk. Option 4 is the preferred option because it meets all the objectives and allows inadvertent communication of tax secret information in a broader range of circumstances. Inland Revenue considers that the option will reinforce taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance.

This proposal has been discussed with the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner said that it seemed very logical to remove banders to having conversations in the open-plan environment. The Privacy Commissioner noted that the preferred option had to extend the confidentiality requirements to the co-located staff. The Privacy Commissioner also said that she did not have any issues with the proposed options. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 11. Inland Revenue prefers option 4 because it best achieves the stated objectives. Specifically, option 4: • reduces the risks for Inland Revenue employees and co-located staff from other government agencies in a co-location environment; • confirms for taxpayers that the same high standards that apply internally in Inland Revenue would apply in co-located environments, reinforcing taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system and voluntary compliance; and • enables Inland Revenue to deliver better public services in an efficient manner without imposing significant additional administrative costs. IMPLEMENTATION 12. Any legislative amendments will be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. 13. No implementation risks have been identified. No changes need to be made to existing systems and there would be no other significant administrative issues. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 14. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 15. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 1 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 34 of 51 Regulatory Impact Statement KiwiSaver opt-out for minors Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the incorrect enrolment of minors into the KiwiSaver scheme. This analysis includes a review of the legal rights and obligations granted and imposed on KiwiSaver members, KiwiSaver providers and employers in respect of the enrolment of minors. Statistical analysis of enrolment data since the inception of KiwiSaver has been undertaken to measure the extent of the issue. As there have been no documented cases of complaints from KiwiSaver members who had been enrolled as minors, it was not possible to measure the impacts at an individual level. Workplace Savings NZ, who represent most KiwiSaver providers, were briefed on the issue and the options. In general, feedback received indicated that there was a need for Inland Revenue to take a greater role in verifying the age of new enrolments. Some providers also felt that an open ended opt-out provision that would allow an incorrectly enrolled member to annul then membership at any time would create too much uncertainty in the sector. Such a policy would mean that schemes would have a portion of their members that could, at any time, exit without further notice. These views have been taken into consideration when making the final recommendation. None of the options in this statement would: • impose additional costs on businesses; • impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or • override fundamental common law principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). K P trategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 1 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 35 of 51 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. KiwiSaver is a workplace savings scheme that is open to all New Zealand residents under the age of 65. People can join KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver provider, electing to join through their employer, or through automatic enrolment when they start a new job. 2. Minors (children under the age of 18) can only join KiwiSaver if they have the consent of all of their legal guardians (if under 16 years) or co-sign with a guardian (if 16 - 17 years of age). These restrictions recognise that joining KiwiSaver, which locks in funds until the member is 65, is a serious undertaking and minors should be protected while they are vulnerable and supported as they get older. For this reason, minors are only able to join KiwiSaver by directly contracting with a KiwiSaver provider. As the providers will be processing an application to join KiwiSaver, these providers are best equipped to receive and review the necessary parental consent. 3. When a person enrols in KiwiSaver through their employer, either by electing to join or through auto enrolment, the employer sends the person’s information to Inland Revenue through the existing PAYE system. Inland Revenue then passes that information on to a KiwiSaver provider. Inland Revenue does not perform any checks on the enrolment data to test whether the person is a minor or not. 4. Recent analysis of KiwiSaver enrolments has uncovered that as of April 2015 approximately 56,000 minors have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver through their employers, predominantly via auto-enrolment. Around 10,000 of these minors were under the age of 16 at the time of enrolment. 5. To date Inland Revenue has not received any complaints from minors who have been incorrectly enrolled into KiwiSaver through their employers. Furthermore, approximately 27,000 of the affected members have since transferred their KiwiSaver funds from one provider to another. However, should a member challenge their enrolment there is no remedy available under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 that will allow the member to exit the scheme. 6. Unlike a person over 65 or a non-resident, a minor is entitled to join KiwiSaver, albeit only by contracting directly with a provider. The current provisions available to reverse an invalid enrolment are only applicable to members who are not entitled to join KiwiSaver, not members who are entitled to join, but were enrolled through the wrong mechanism. 7. The Minors’ Contract Act 1969 does provide that a person who has entered into a contract as a minor can apply to the court to have that contract nullified. We are not aware of any minors making use of this provision at this point. While this does provide some protection it comes at considerable cost to the applicant and potentially the provider who may have to argue the application in court. 8. This RIS addresses the question of whether the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to allow minors that have been incorrectly enrolled to annul their membership. 2 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 36 of 51 OBJECTIVES 9. The key objectives are: a) Provide clearer protection to members who have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver when they were minors and who wish to annul their membership. b) Reduce the compliance costs incurred by KiwiSaver members who were incorrectly enrolled and who wish to annul their membership. c) Prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. d) Minimise disruption for those KiwiSaver members who have been enrolled incorrectly but who do not object to the enrolment. e) Minimise the impact on the key objective of KiwiSaver - to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Four options were considered as alternatives to the status quo. Options 2 and 3 would address future incorrect enrolments only, whereas options 4 and 5 would address historic cases as well. The options are: • Option 1 (status quo): Inland Revenue takes no additional actions to prevent incorrect enrolments. KiwiSaver members who were enrolled as minors cannot annul their membership without applying to the courts under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. • Option 2: Inland Revenue highlights to employers and KiwiSaver providers that minors can only enrol directly with a provider. (Officials’ preferred short-term administrative option) • Option 3: Inland Revenue develops a system to automatically check employer enrolments received and reject enrolments for minors. (Officials’preferred long-term administrative option) • Option 4: A new opt-out provision is introduced so that members who have been enrolled incorrectly can end their membership. • Option 5: A new opt-out provision is introduced so that members who have been th enrolled incorrectly can end their membership at any time before their 19 birthday. (Officials’ preferred policy option) 11. These options are not exclusive, for example options 2, 4 and 5 could be concurrently implemented. 3 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 37 of 51 Option 1: Status quo 12. Under the status quo: • Inland Revenue does not monitor enrolments for minors. • Employers incorrectly enrol minors into KiwiSaver and providers incorrectly accept those enrolments. • Members who have been incorrectly enrolled have no access to redress under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to annul their membership. • Members who wish to annul their membership must apply to the court under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. 13. While there have been no complaints from incorrectly enrolled minors to date there is also no cost effective remedy should a member wish to exit the scheme. Members and providers in this situation would incur costs should the member wish to take the matter up under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. Option 2 - additional communications to employers and providers 14. Under this option: • Inland Revenue communicates with employers and KiwiSaver providers to highlight their obligations in respect of minors and the KiwiSaver enrolment rules. • Resources and guides are reviewed to ensure these rules are sufficiently explained. • Employers are advised on how minors can enrol so that they can pass this on to their employees who want to join KiwiSaver. 15. The main advantages of this option are that it imposes only minimal additional cost on Inland Revenue, no additional compliance costs on employers or providers and requires no legislative change. 16. The main disadvantages is that it is unlikely to be fully effective (that is some minors would continue to be incorrectly enrolled) and it does not provide an effective remedy for incorrectly enrolled minors wishing to exit the scheme. Option 3 - Inland Revenue checks all enrolments for minors 17. Under this option: • Inland Revenue implements a new system where all enrolments received are checked to ensure the person is not a minor. • If the person is a minor a message would be sent back to the employer advising them that the enrolment is invalid. No information would be sent to the provider. 18. The main advantage of this option is that it would provide the best on-going protection for minors as it would, in the majority of cases, prevent them from being enrolled. 4 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 38 of 51 19. The disadvantages are: • Inland Revenue would need to invest in system enhancements which would rely on legacy systems. • Inland Revenue would need to release taxpayer confidential information back to the employer (i.e. that their employee is a minor). • Inland Revenue’s date of birth records are not 100 percent accurate so some incorrect rejections would be expected. • No cost effective remedy is provided for the 55,000 already incorrectly enrolled minors if any of them should wish to exit the scheme. Option 4 - Opt out members incorrectly enrolled as minors - no restriction 20. Under this option: • The KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended so that members who have been incorrectly enrolled can opt out of the scheme. • Opt-outs would only be available if the member had not subsequently directly contracted with a provider and given the necessary consent. • If a member opted out then they would have their contributions returned to them, their Government contributions returned to the Crown and their compulsory employer contributions returned to their employer. • There would be no restriction on when this opt out could occur. 21. The advantages of this option are: • Administration costs on Inland Revenue are minimised. The systems for unwinding the member’s enrolment are already in place for incorrectly enrolled non-residents or pensioners. • Members who were incorrectly enrolled are offered a cost effective remedy and can exit the scheme. Members who do not wish to exit the scheme are not disrupted. • Reduces compliance costs by eliminating the need for incorrectly enrolled members to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969 should they wish to exit the scheme. 22. The disadvantages of this option are: • Does not prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. • May encourage members to annul their membership when it is not in their long term interests to do so. 5 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 39 of 51 23. This last disadvantage is particularly relevant for members that were incorrectly enrolled but have since become adults and may have been contributing to their savings for several years. In these instances they would be able to withdraw all of the contributions they had made but they would lose the benefit of the crown contributions and their employers’ compulsory contributions. This could be attractive in the short term but may be detrimental in respect of longer term objectives such as providing for retirement. Option 5 - Opt out members incorrectly enrolled as minors until 19th birthday 24. Under this option: • The KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended so that members who have been incorrectly enrolled can opt out of the scheme at any time before their 19th birthday. • Opt outs would only be available if the member had not subsequently directly contracted with a provider and given the necessary consent. • If a member opted out then they would have their contributions returned to them, their Crown contributions (i.e. the kick-start payment and member tax credits) returned to the Crown and their compulsory employer contributions returned to their employer. 25. The opt-out would be available until the member has turned 19 so that they have at least one year as an adult to consider their situation. 26. The advantages of this option are • Administration costs on Inland Revenue are minimised. The systems for unwinding the member’s enrolment are already in place for incorrectly enrolled non-residents or pensioners. • Members who were incorrectly enrolled are offered an effective remedy and can exit the scheme up until their 19th birthday. Members who do not wish to exit the scheme are not disrupted. • Reduces compliance costs by eliminating the need for incorrectly enrolled members who have yet to turn 19 to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969 if they wish to exit the scheme. 27. The disadvantages of this option are: • Does not prevent the incorrect enrolment of minors. • Members who have been incorrectly enrolled and who wish to exit the scheme but have turned 19 would still have to apply under the Minors’ Contract Act 1969. • May encourage members to annul their membership when it is not in their long term interests to do so. 28. This last disadvantage is less relevant for this option as the members do not qualify for Crown contributions until they turn 18 and so at most would have a years’ worth of Crown contributions that could be forgone. 6 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 40 of 51 29.

Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 42 of 51 30. The options have no social, cultural or environmental impacts. CONSULTATION 31. Workplace Savings NZ, who represent most KiwiSaver providers, were consulted. Comments received from providers both through Workplace Savings NZ and directly emphasised the need for Inland Revenue to play a more active role in policing the age requirements for employer enrolments. 32. The Treasury and the Ministry of Building, Innovation and Employment were consulted and supported the recommended options. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33. We support option 5. This would address to some extent the number of incorrect enrolments being made and provides a clear but limited ability for incorrectly enrolled members to easily exit the scheme. In the short term we also recommend option 2 be adopted - that is, Inland Revenue should send additional communications to employers and KiwiSaver providers stressing that minors cannot be enrolled through their employer. In the longer term, as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme of systemic change, we recommend that option 3 should be explored as a priority. Other impacts IMPLEMENTATION 34. Options 1 and 2 do not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required to implement options 3, 4 and 5. 35. Any legislative amendments can be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. Additional communications to employers and providers highlighting the current enrolment rules will be made later this year. 36. Inland Revenue will communicate any legislative changes to members, employers and providers through its existing channels, such as www.kiwisaver.govt.nz, the Tax Information Bulletin and by updating its guides MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 37. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review any of the policy proposals in this analysis. The number of incorrectly enrolled minors will continue to be measured and the impact of any additional communications to employers and providers will be monitored. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 9 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 43 of 51 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 44 of 51 Regulatory Impact Statement Allowing additional deductions to be made from salary or wages Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is how can Inland Revenue more efficiently use information it already holds about the employment of a defaulter in order to recover outstanding payments of tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. Requiring an employer to make deductions from wages or salary is one o f the most efficient means of debt collection available to Inland Revenue. If deductions are imposed soon after a default is detected, they ensure early recovery o f the debt and limit the growth of late payment interest or penalties. However, when Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to an employer, it is required to issue a notice to the defaulter at the same time. If Inland Revenue does not hold a valid address for the defaulter, it cannot send notification to them and therefore cannot send a deduction notice to the employer. Inland Revenue has considered a range o f options for requiring an employer to make additional deductions from a defaulting employee’s salary or wages when there is no valid address held for the employee. Because o f time constraints, Inland Revenue has not consulted with employers on any o f the options. Even so, we do not consider that our analysis o f the issues is impaired by the lack of external consultation with employers and employees. We note that only a small number of taxpayers are affected (approximately 700 at any time). The Treasury was consulted on the policy proposal. None of the options identified would impair private property rights or reduce market competition. However, two of the options involve some impairment of the common law principle of natural justice by reducing employees’ opportunity to challenge the basis on which the decision to increase wage or salary deductions is made, or to make alternative arrangements to redress any shortfall in PAYE, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. We also note that some of the options (not the preferred option) would impose additional costs on business. Keith Taylor Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 June 2015 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 45 of 51 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Automatic deductions from salary or wages are one o f the most efficient means of debt collection available to Inland Revenue. They help to minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for taxpayers in a debt situation. If the automatic deductions are imposed soon after a default is detected, they limit the growth of late payment penalties or interest and ensure early recovery o f the debt. These deductions are additional to standard PAYE, ACC, child support contributions or student loan repayments. 2. Under current law, Inland Revenue is required to advise a defaulting taxpayer, liable parent, gaming machine operator or student loan borrower of its intention to make automatic additional deductions from salary or wages in order to recover unpaid tax, child support, duty, or student loan repayments. Notification is sent to the individual at the same time as the deduction notice is sent to the employer, giving them a short time (until their next pay day) during which they can contact Inland revenue to challenge the decision or make alternative arrangements to address the debt. 3. The release of the deduction notice to the employer is prevented if a valid address is not held for the defaulter. The system has been designed to protect the right o f the employee to be notified of the intended deductions so they can exercise their right to challenge the decision or make alternative arrangements. 4. As at 11 March 2015, the lack of a valid address is preventing recovery o f $718,044 from 545 taxpayers, across all tax types. In addition 170 student loan borrowers have additional repayment obligations that could be met through increased wage or salary deductions if we had valid addresses. The rate o f growth as penalties are applied will vary across tax types so that numbers and amounts owed will vary from time to time. The rate of recovery through additional deductions is limited by law to 20% of the wages or salary payable to an individual. 5. The current practice in these situations involves administrative costs for Inland Revenue and for employers, as manual intervention is required. This may include an initial phone call to the employer, followed, if necessary, by a written demand to provide the address details. Address records must then be updated before the deduction notice can be issued to the employer and copied to the defaulting employee. 6. Even so, the current practice seeks to preserve the rights o f the employee to be informed about the decision and be able to challenge it or choose how they will redress their non-compliance. 7. Inland Revenue should be able to use information it already holds about a defaulter’s employment to recover debt more efficiently when a defaulter has not only failed to meet payment obligations, but also failed to advise a change of address to Inland Revenue. 8. The question addressed in this RIS is how can Inland Revenue more efficiently use information it already holds about employment o f a defaulter in order to recover outstanding debt. Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 46 of 51 OBJECTIVES 9. The key objectives are: (a) minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue (b) minimise compliance costs for defaulters and employers (c) reduce or limit the growth of late payment interest or penalties and effect full recovery in the shortest possible time (d) ensure that defaulters’ rights to object or make alternative arrangements to redress their default are maintained (fairness). 10. Trade-offs will need to be made across the various objectives. For example, options that seek to minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers may impair defaulters’ rights to object or make alternative arrangements to redress their default. 11. An additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue is its inability to make significant system changes in advance o f the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 12. One administrative and two legislative solutions were considered as alternatives to the status quo. The options are: • Option 1: Inland Revenue obtains contact details for the defaulter from their employer (status quo). • Option 2: Inland Revenue issues notice to the last known address of the defaulter. • Option 3: Inland Revenue issues notice to the employer for pass on to the defaulter. • Option 4: Inland Revenue dispenses with requirement to issue notice to the defaulter when it holds details o f the defaulter’s employer (preferred option). Option 1 — status quo 13. Under the status quo: • Inland Revenue contacts the employer and requests that the employer provide the defaulter’s address details. • Inland Revenue then updates the address details of the defaulter in its system. • Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to the employer and a copy to the defaulter. 14. The current practice creates additional compliance costs for Inland Revenue and for employers and an additional step in the recovery process, slowing the commencement of recovery, but preserves the rights o f the defaulter (for a very limited time) to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance before any action is taken. Option 2 - Issue notice to the last known address of defaulter Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 47 of 51 15. Under this option, Inland Revenue issues a deduction notice to the employer and a copy to the defaulter’s last known “invalid” address. 16. The main advantage of this option is that it avoids imposing additional compliance costs on employers (compared with the status quo), as they are not required to provide Inland Revenue with updated address details for defaulters. 17. There are several disadvantages with this option, including: • The defaulter is unlikely to receive the notice so does not have the opportunity to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance. • The address held for the defaulter remains invalid. • There is potential for a breach of tax secrecy, as someone other than the intended recipient may open the mail (even though it is an offence under the Postal Services Act 1998 for a person to open mail addressed to another). • It could generate complaints from residents who have sent back previous pieces of correspondence, creating resource implications through additional work for call centres. • It would create extra work for Inland Revenue through manual activity in what is intended to be an automated process, with further resource implications. • Employers would be required to bear the compliance cost of dealing with employees who complain about reduction in pay. • There would be some delay in the commencement of debt recovery. • There may also be an increase in contacts to Inland Revenue call centres of complaints about the unexpected deduction from pay. Option 3 - Issue notice to employer for pass on to defaulter 18. Under this option, Inland Revenue takes manual action to issue the notice to the employer and a copy of the notice for the employer to pass on to the defaulter. 19. The main advantage of this option over the status quo is that it would limit growth of late payment interest and penalties and contribute to the earliest possible recovery o f debt. In addition, the defaulter would retain the limited right to challenge the decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance before any action is taken. 20. The main disadvantages are: • It would impose additional compliance cost on employers. • There would be systems implications, which may be significant and could not be implemented until Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation reaches the relevant stage o f development. Until then, manual intervention would be needed. • The address details o f the defaulter remain invalid unless the defaulter contacts Inland Revenue and updates them. Option 4 -Dispense with requirement to issue notice to the defaulter 21. Under this option, Inland Revenue would issue the notice to employer when there has been a default on payment obligations, even though it is not possible to issue a copy o f the notice to the defaulter. Ultimately, the defaulter can regain the right to challenge the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 48 of 51 decision or choose how they will redress their non-compliance by re-engaging with Inland Revenue and updating their address records. 22. The main advantages of this option are: • It ensures that growth in late payment interest or penalties is limited by early intervention. • It contributes to the earliest possible recovery o f outstanding debt. • It will ultimately retain the automation o f the process when systems changes are possible. • In the interim, it can be implemented manually on a case-by-case basis with no additional administrative resources over the status quo. 23. The main disadvantages are: • By removing the requirement for formal notification to the employee it further limits the defaulter’s opportunity to dispute the outstanding amounts or make other arrangements for repayment. • Employers would be required to bear the compliance cost of dealing with those employees who complain about the unexpected reduction in their pay. • There may also be an increase in contacts to Inland Revenue call centres of complaints about the unexpected deduction from pay. 24. This is officials’ preferred option. Summary of impact analysis 25. The table below summarises our analysis of the options (including the status quo).

There are no social, cultural or environmental impacts. CONSULTATION AND IMPACT 27. Inland Revenue has not consulted with employers due to time constraints and the preferred option would reduce compliance costs over the status quo for the small number likely to be affected (approximately 700 in March 2015). The Treasury was consulted on the policy proposal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 28. We recommend Option 4 because it offers the biggest administrative cost reduction for Inland Revenue while offering improvements in efficiency o f debt recovery and a reduction in compliance costs for employers. We consider these efficiency gains outweigh the impairment in the defaulters’ right to natural justice because that impairment can be redressed by the defaulters taking action to update their address records. IMPLEMENTATION 29. Options 1 and 2 do not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required to implement options 3 and 4. 30. Amendments will be included in the proposed Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in June 2015, and could be implemented from the date of enactment. 31. The preferred option would be automated when Inland Revenue’s system changes are at a suitable stage o f development. In the interim, it could be implemented manually on a case-by-case basis. 32. Inland Revenue will communicate any legislative changes to employers through its existing channels, such as its guides and the Tax Information Bulletin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 33. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes to give effect to additional recovery o f outstanding payments of tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process.

November 2015 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Bright-line test for residential land This special report provides information on changes contained in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015. The bright-line test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property that is disposed of within two years of acquisition, subject to some exceptions. A remedial amendment will also mean that non-active trusts may be excused from filing returns. Information in this special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a future edit ion of the Tax Information Bulletin. Background As part of Budget 2015, the Government announced plans to introduce a new land sale rule to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. Under those rules, gains from the sale of land are taxable when bought with an intention or purpose of resale and the taxpayer is required to return any gain as income. However, this intention test is difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. The bright-line test instead creates an easy-to-enforce, objective test. The bright-line test is the second of three stages of the Government’s reform package to tighten the property investment rules announced as part of Budget 2015. The first stage – new information requirements for land transfers and offshore persons – came into force on 1 October 2015. Further information on these requirements can be found in the special report New information requirements to improve tax compliance in the property investment sector available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz . The third stage – a withholding tax for offshore persons selling New Zealand residential property – was introduced on 16 November 2015 in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill, following consultation in August 2015. 1 Key features • The gains from the disposal of residential land acquired and disposed of within two years will be taxable, subject to some exceptions. • The two year bright-line period generally starts at the point a person has title for the property transferred to them and ends at the time the person enters into a contract to sell the property. For sales “off the plan” the two-year period runs from the date the person enters into a contract to buy the property to the time when a person enters into a contract to sell the property. • The bright-line test applies only to residential land. Residential land includes land that has a dwelling on it, land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on it, as well as bare land that can have a dwelling erected on it under the relevant district plan. Residential land does not include business premises or farmland. • The bright-line test does not apply to a person’s main home. A person can only have one main ho me. Where a person has more than one home, their main home is the one with which the person has the greatest connection. • The main home exception is generally available to properties held in trust. There are addit ional requirements to ensure that people cannot use the main home exception for multiple properties through the use of trusts. • The bright-line test does not apply to property acquired through an inheritance. There is rollover relief for property transferred as a result of a relationship property agreement. This means that any potential tax liability will be deferred until a subsequent sale. • Taxpayers will be allowed deductions for property subject to the bright-line test according to ordinary tax rules. • Losses arising from the bright-line test will be ring-fenced so that they may only be used to offset taxable gains from other land sales. • There are specific anti-avoidance rules, to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test. Application date The bright-line test came into force on 1 October 2015. The bright-line test will only apply to a person’s disposal of land if the person acquires their “first interest” in the land on or after 1 October 2015. The date a person acquires their “first interest” is the same date as when they acquire land for the purposes of section CB 15B. As a result, guidance on section CB 15B can be used to assist in determining when a person’s “first interest” in land was acquired. Where there is a standard acquisition of land, the date a person acquires their “first interest” will generally be the date of entry into an agreement to purchase the land. This means the bright-line test will only apply to the sale of land if the agreement for purchase of the land was entered into on or after 1 October 2015. 2 Example: Application date The sale by Dave is not subject to the bright-line test. This is because Dave acquired his “first interest” in the land when he entered into an agreement to purchase the land on 2 June 2015. As this is prior to 1 October 2015, the bright-line test does not apply. For non-standard sales of land, the date of “first interest” may be different for different circumstances. For example, for a gift, the date of “first interest” will usually be the date of registration of tit le. The amendments for the non-active trust filing exception, definition of “land”, and clarifying the treatment of land transferred under a resident’s restricted amalgamation came into force on 1 October 2015. Detailed analysis References are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated otherwise. Two-year time period (Section CB 6A) Under the bright-line test any gain a person derives from disposing of residential land is income of the person if the property is disposed of within two years of acquisition. The start and end date for the purposes of this two year period are specifically defined for the purposes of the bright-line test. Start and end dates for different transactions may differ depending on the nature of the transaction. Standard sales of land There are four steps in the land sale process of relevance to the bright-line test: 2 June 2015 Dave enters into an agreement to purchase land 1 November 2015 Dave acquires registered title to the land 1 February 2016 Dave enters into agreement to sell land 1 April 2016 Registration of title for sale Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) Registration of title for purchase Contract to sell (sale and purchase agreement) Registration of title for sale 3 For standard sales of land, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the transfer of the land is registered to the person under the Land Transfer Act 1952. The end date is the date that a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the land. There are a number of situations when land is acquired and disposed of that do not follow the standard land sale process. For these situations, there are separate rules for when the bright- line period starts and ends. Start dates Type of acquisition Start date of bright-line test Standard purchase of land Registration Sales where there is no registration of title Latest date property acquired (according to ordinary rules) Sales “off the plan” (as outlined in section below) Date of entry into a contract to purchase Subdivided land The original date of registration for the undivided land Converting a lease with a perpetual right of renewal into freehold title Date the lease with a perpetual right of renewal is acquired Sale where there is no registration of title Where there is registration of title, generally the start date for the bright-line is the date of registration. However, there are situations where there is no registration of title. In these circumstances, the start date for the bright-line test is the latest date the person acquired the land under ordinary rules. For a sale of a contract to buy land, this will be the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the property. This means that for a sale of a contract to buy, the bright-line period runs from the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the land to the date that a person enters into a contract to sell the land. Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) Contract to sell If two years or under the gain is taxed under the bright-line test Registration of title 4 Earlier start dates than given under standard rules There are three specific scenarios where a person is entitled to an earlier start date than would be the case under the two rules outlined above. These are for: • sales “off the plan”; • subdivided land; and • leases with a perpetual right of renewal converted into freeho ld tit le. Sales “off the plan” A sale “off the plan” for the bright-line test is where a person enters into a contract to acquire a parcel of land that is being developed or subdivided. At the time the person enters into the contract, the title for the land they are agreeing to purchase does not yet exist (as the land needs to be subdivided or developed before separate title can be issued). The person is agreeing to acquire registered title in the land once a separate title exists. In this situation, the person may use an earlier start date than would be the case under the standard rule. The start date in this situat ion is the date the person enters into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the land. Example: Sale “off the plan” Denise is not caught by the bright-line test as the start date for the bright-line is 1 July 2016 (the date she entered into a contract to purchase “off the plan”) and the end date is 1 March 2019 (the date she entered into a contract to sell). 1 July 2016 Denise enters into contract to purchase land “off the plan” 1 September 2018 Denise obtains registered title 1 March 2019 Denise enters into contract to sell 1 April 2019 Registration of title for sale 5 Subdivided land The start date for the bright-line period when land is subdivided is the date the owner originally acquired the undivided land. Example: Subdivision The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 and the end date is 1 May 2022. As a result, Bob’s sale of the second section to Carla is not covered by the bright-line test. Conversion of a lease with a perpetual right of renewal into freehold title When a person has a lease with a perpetual right of renewal which they then convert into freehold land, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the person is granted the lease. This is consistent with other tax provisions that treat a lease with a perpetual right of renewal similar to freehold estates. Example: Lease with perpetual right of renewal The start date for Kelly’s bright-line period is 1 July 2016 (the date the lease with perpetual right of renewal is granted) and the end date is 1 April 2019 (the date she entered into agreement to sell the land). Gains from Kelly’s sale of the land is not taxable under the bright-line test. End date for bright-line period For standard sales of land the end date for the bright-line period is the date a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the property There are several situations where land is disposed of and there is no agreement to dispose of the property. In these situations, the proposed end date for the bright-line period differs from the standard rule. 1 May 2016 Bob acquires registered title to residential land 1 May 2021 Bob subdivides the land into two sections and builds a house on the second section 1 May 2022 Bob enters an agreement to sell the second section to Carla 1 July 2016 Kelly obtains lease with perpetual right of renewal 1 January 2017 Kelly enters into agreement to acquire land 1 March 2018 Registration of title for purchase 1 April 2019 Kelly enters into agreement to sell land 1 May 2019 Registration of title for sale 6 Type of disposal End date of bright-line period Standard purchase of land Date of entry into agreement for sale Gift Date of gift (generally registration of title) Compulsory acquisition Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee sale Date land disposed of by mortgagee Other disposals where no contract to sell Date of disposal according to ordinary rules Gifts For gifts, the end date for the bright-line period is the date the person makes the gift of the residential land. This will be the date when the donor has done everything necessary to be done in order to transfer the property and render the settlement binding. For a gift of a registerable interest in land, this will mean the end date for the bright-line period is the date the interest is registered. Example: Gift The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 (the date Henrietta acquired registered title) and the end date is 1 February 2018 (the date Ingrid acquired registered title). Henrietta will be captured by the bright-line test for her gift of land. Under ordinary tax rules, gifts of land are treated as if they are transferred at market value. As a result, Henrietta will be deemed to have transferred the land to Ingrid at market value and the $50k gain will be taxable. Compulsory acquisition When the land is compulsorily acquired by the Crown, the proposed end date of the bright- line period is the date that the land is compulsorily acquired. This will generally be 14 days after the proclamation taking the land is published in the Gazette. 1 Mortgagee sale When land is disposed of by a mortgagee exercising their right to dispose of the property, the end date for the bright-line period is the date when the land is disposed of by the mortgagee. 1 Public Works Act 1981, section 26(3). 1 May 2016 Henrietta obtains registered title to residential land (purchase price of $400k) 1 December 2017 Henrietta says she will gift land to Ingrid 1 February 2018 Henrietta registers the transfer of land to Ingrid (market value of land is $450k) 7 Other sales If there is another type of disposal of land, the date of disposal is the date that the land is disposed of according to ordinary rules. Example: Standard sale The bright-line period starts on 1 May 2016 (the date registered title is acquired) and ends on 1 December 2017 (the date of entry into agreement to sell the land). Amy receives payment for the property in the 2018–19 income year. This means that Amy is required to return the income in her annual income tax return for the year. Example: Cancelled contract The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Fred falls within the two-year period for the bright-line test. However, because the sale is cancelled, Elizabeth has not derived any income from the disposal of land and will not have any income tax liability. The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Georgina is not covered by the bright-line test because the agreement for sale (1 July 2018) was not entered into within two years of Elizabeth obtaining registered title (1 May 2016). Example: Standard lease (no perpetual right of renewal) The start date for the bright-line test is 1 March 2018 (the date of registration of title for purchase) and the end date is 1 April 2019 (the date she entered into agreement to sell the land). Jo’s proceeds from the sale of the land are taxable under the bright-line test. 1 May 2016 Amy acquires registered title to residential land 1 December 2017 Amy enters into an agreement to sell the land to Bob with final payment and settlement to follow 1 July 2018 Bob makes final payment for the property and registered title to the land is transferred to him 1 May 2016 Elizabeth obtains registered title to residential land 1 July 2017 Elizabeth enters into an agreement to sell the land to Fred 1 December 2017 Fred is unable to obtain the funds to purchase the land and so the sale is cancelled 1 July 2018 Elizabeth enters into an agreement to sell the land to Georgina 1 July 2016 Jo obtains lease 1 January 2017 Jo enters into agreement to acquire land 1 March 2018 Registration of title for purchase 1 April 2019 Jo enters into agreement to sell land 1 May 2019 Registration of title for sale 8 Example: Deed of nomination 2 With a nomination there are two acquisitions and disposals of land. Andrew acquired an interest in the land by entering into a contract to purchase on 1 January 2016 (the date he acquired the right to buy the land). When Andrew entered into a deed of nomination with Bart he transferred this interest (the right to buy the land) to Bart. The start date for Andrew is the date he entered into the contract to purchase the land. This is because this is a sale where there is no registration. The start date is the latest date in which they acquired an interest in the residential land. The latest date Andrew acquired an interest in the residential land is 1 January 2016 when he acquired his right to buy. The end date for Andrew is 1 February 2016, being the date he entered into an agreement for the disposal, of his interest in the land. The deed of nomination is an agreement for the disposal of the land. As a result, Andrew is covered by the bright-line test and any gain he has made will be taxable. Bart’s acquisition and disposal of the land will not be covered by the bright-line test. This is because the start date was on 1 March 2016 (date of registration of title) and the end date was 1 January 2019 (the date he entered into agreement to sell). Residential land (Sections CB 6A, YA 1) The bright-line test only applies if the land disposed of is residential land at the date of disposal. Residential land is land that either: • has a dwelling on it; • the seller of the land is a party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling on it ; or • is bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the rules in the relevant operative district plan. However, even if one of these three criteria is met, land is not residential land if it is used predominantly as business premises or is farmland (as discussed below). 2 The nomination in this example refers to a nomination under a “purchaser or nominee” clause in an agreement for sale and purchase for land. This example does not deal with nominees under section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which have a different tax treatment. 1 January 2016 Andrew enters into agreement to purchase land. Under the agreement, title to the land is to be given to Andrew or his nominee. 1 February 2016 Andrew enters into a deed of nomination with Bart. Under the deed, Andrew nominates Bart as the person to acquire the property. 1 March 2016 Registered title is transferred to Bart 1 January 2019 Bart enters into an agreement to sell land to Carla 9 Dwelling The first criterion includes land that has a dwelling on it. The definition of “dwelling” is the same as that currently used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. However, there are two adjustments to the definition of dwelling for the purposes of the bright-line test. The two adjustments are to include serviced apartments within the definition of “residential land” and exclude all rest homes and retirement villages from the definit ion. The second criterion means that the bright-line test covers land that does not have a dwelling on it at present but there is a plan or understanding to build a dwelling on it. For example, this criterion would apply when the owner of a commercial office has an arrangement to convert it into dwellings. The third criterion means the bright-line test covers bare land that is able to be used for a dwelling. To see whether a parcel of bare land meets this criterion a person will need to look at the relevant rule in the operative district plan to see whether they are able to build a dwelling on it. Example: Development Andrew buys an empty plot of land that is zoned for residential purposes. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into four lots and building houses on each of the lots. Andrew sells lot 1 off the plan to Bob. One month later, Bob sells lot 1 to Carla. Lot 1 would be “residential land” and Bob’s sale would be subject to the bright-line test. This is because there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on the land, and because it is bare land that can have a dwelling erected on it under the relevant district plan. Business premises Residential land does not include land used predominantly as business premises. “Business premises” has its ordinary meaning as within the rest of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will generally require there to be a building on the land and this building to be occupied by a person in the course of running their business. The exclusion does not require that the land be occupied by the owner as their business premises. As a result, properties rented out by the owner to other persons to use as their business premises are covered by this exclusion. However, the exclusion would not apply where a property is rented out for residential purposes (such as a residential rental property). 10 Example: Bed and breakfast Mary owns a bed and breakfast. Mary provides meals to the residents, room service and cleans the rooms she lets out every day. The land has a dwelling on it so meets the first criterion for residential land. However, the land would not be “residential land” as the land is used predominantly as the business premises for the bed and breakfast. Example: Workers’ quarters Steve owns land which contains a factory which is used to process food. The land also has workers’ quarters on it, which Steve provides to his employees to use as residences. The land is used predominantly as business premises and so is entitled to the business premises exception. Example: Empty factory Velma purchases an empty factory which she plans to develop into an apartment building. Before beginning construction and within two years of her acquisition, Velma receives a good offer for the building and sells it to William. Velma has an arrangement to put a dwelling on the land and so meets the first criterion for residential land. The land does not qualify for the business premises exclusion as the factory is empty and not being used as business premises at the time of disposal. As a result, the land is “residential land” and subject to the bright-line test. Farmland Residential land does not include farmland. Farmland means land that either: • is being worked on as part of a farming or agricultural business by the owner of the land; or • because of its area and nature, is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. Determining whether there is a farming or agricultural business on the land requires looking at the same factors that determine whether there is a business under general tax law. This requires looking at the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in undertaking these activities. Even if there is no farming business being run on the land, it can still be considered farmland if the land is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. Determining whether land is capable of being worked requires looking at the capability of the land at the time of the disposal. Land that requires significant investment or modification to be used as a farming business would therefore not qualify. 11 Example: Land that because of its area is not capable of being used as farmland Marama purchases a lifestyle block with a house and a small area of farmland. A small number of sheep are kept on the land to keep the grass down. The land is not farmland as the land is not being worked as a farming business nor is it capable of being worked as a farming business. It is a hobby farm rather than a genuine farming business. If the area of farmland was larger and capable of being used for farming purposes, it would likely be farmland. Example: Land that because of its nature is not capable of being used as farmland Tina owns a 50 hectare plot of land. The land is covered in gorse. The land is not farmland as it is not currently capable of being used for farming purposes. Example: Small plot of land that is farmland Uri has a five hectare plot of land that is suitable for use as a rose farm. This land is farmland as it is currently capable of being used for farming purposes. Main home (Sections CB 16A, YA 1) The bright-line test does not apply to the disposal of a person’s main home. Requirements for the main home exception To qualify for the “main home” exception, the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home of the person or a beneficiary of a trust that owns the property (subject to some limitat ions). Used predominantly as person’s main home To be used predominantly as a main home, means that most of the area of the land must have been actually used for the home. The test is based on a person’s actual use of the property and not the person’s intended use of the property. In some circumstances, a person will be required to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by the owner partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, the relative areas will need to be determined. In many cases, a taxpayer will have determined the relative areas in working out the tax deductions (insurance and rates, for example) that can be claimed. The determination of the areas includes any land used for the relevant purposes (for example, a backyard or garage for the home). The main home exception can only apply where the property is actually used as the main ho me. The exception can only apply in full or not at all, it does not apply on a proportionate 12 basis. As a result, if a property is used less than 50 percent of the time as the main home of the person, then the main home exception will not apply. Used for most of the time as their main home The land must have been used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50 percent of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land. The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on holiday or prior to settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private residential use. The owner, must have resided in the property as their main home. The main home exception will not apply when only a family member and not the owner, has used the property as their main home. More than one home A person can only have one main home. When a person has two houses that they reside in, which property is their main home is determined according to which of the properties that the person has the greatest connection with. The greatest connection test operates only as a tie- breaker when a person has more than one home. The greatest connection test determines, on an objective basis, which property is the person’s main home. The test does not allow a person to elect their main home. Various factors may be relevant in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with, including: • the time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family (if any) live; • where their social ties are strongest; • the person’s use of the dwelling; • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and • whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling. These factors are similar to those used to determine if a person has a permanent place of abode under current tax law. Therefore, existing guidance on the “permanent place of abode” test could assist in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with. Using the main home exception for two properties Under limited circumstances, a person may use the main home exception for two properties sold at the same time. An example is when a person lives in a home for less than one year as their main home, and moves into a new home while trying to sell the original home. The original ho me may sat isfy 13 the requirements to be the person’s main home (as discussed above) for the period before moving into the main home. The new home may also satisfy the requirements to be the person’s main home for the subsequent period. The ownership overlap of the properties will not mean the original home fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the previous period. If the two properties were sold at the same time, the owner would be able to use the main home exception for both properties (if they both satisfied the requirements to be a main home for the different periods). Example: Main home exception for multiple properties The main home exception is available for both properties. Property 1 was the main home for 9 out of the 11 months the property was owned. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time it was owned. Different owners can have different main homes Co-owners of property can have different main homes. For example, a person living in one city may have a different main home from their spouse living in another city. The bright-line test will only apply to the extent the property is not the main home of an owner on disposal. Habitual sellers A person who habitually sells their main home cannot obtain the main home exception. A person is considered a habitual seller if they eit her: • previously used the main home exception twice in the previous two years; or • have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. If either of these apply then the main home exception is not available for this person. Determining whether there is a regular pattern is a question of fact and degree. Examining transactions that occurred prior to and after the disposal of the property in question can help to reveal a regular pattern of similar transactions. January 2016 Purchases property 1 October 2016 Moves out of property 1 Main home December 2016 Sells property 1 October 2016 Purchases property 2 December 2016 Sells property 2 Main home 14 Main home and trusts The trustee of a trust can generally use the main home exception if they dispose of a property that is the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. To obtain the exception the land must be used predominantly as the beneficiary’s main home for most of the time the trust owns the land. A trust cannot use the main home exception when a principal settlor of the trust has another main home. This rule is to ensure that people cannot get the main ho me except ion mult iple times through the use of a trust. Who is a principal settlor? A principal settlor is the person who has provided the most value to the trust (by market value). For the purposes of determining a principal settlor all provisions of value are counted, except for the provision of services at below market value. If there are multiple people who have provided the greatest equal value to the trust, they are all considered principal settlors. In addition, a person is not a principal settlor if they have provided a “no-strings attached” gift to the trust. This means that for the purposes of determining who has provided the most value to the trust, provisions of value transferred by a person if the person is none of the following are disregarded: • a beneficiary; • a trustee; • a person with the power of appointment or removal of trustees; • a person with a contingent interest in the trust property, in the case that the trust fails; or • a decisio n-maker under the trust. Example: Holiday home Lisa rents an apartment in Wellington, where she lives with her son. The apartment is close to her office from which she runs her consulting business fulltime. She is a member of a local tramping club and is on the Board of Trustees of her son’s school in central Wellington. She owns a house on Lake Taupo with views over the lake. She does not let the Lake Taupo property out when she is not using it. She spends four weeks with her son in this property over Christmas and New Year, and also uses the property for about five weekends during the ski season. When Lisa sells the Lake Taupo property, she cannot use the main home exemption because it is not the property with which she has the greatest connection. 15 Example: Multiple dwellings Bill buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Bill sells the apartment block to a third party. Bill cannot use the main home exception because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property. Example: Two properties Mr and Mrs Brown and their children live in a house on a small lifestyle block in Oamaru. Mrs Brown works in Christchurch for three days a week, and works from the Oamaru house two days a week while her husband looks after the children fulltime. Mrs Brown buys an apartment in Christchurch city. She lives in that apartment while she works in Christchurch. Taking into account the fact that the majority of Mrs Brown’s time is spent at the Oamaru house, and her family is located at the Oamaru house, the main home exemption will not apply in relation to Mrs Brown’s Christchurch apartment as it is not the home with which she has the greatest connection. Example: Country store and house Barbara buys a country store that has living quarters attached. She resides in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front half of the property. She estimates that the retail business uses 45 percent of the property and claims expenses (insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Barbara sells the property. Barbara is not able to use the business premises exception as the land is not used predominantly for her retail business (45 percent). However, Barbara can utilise the main home exception because she has used the property predominantly (55 percent) as her main home during the time she has owned the property. She uses her previous estimate for her expenses to prove her actual use of the property. Example: Non-resident Rena is entitled to the main home exception. This is because she has used the property as her main home for the majority of the time she has owned it. January 2016 Rena purchases property October 2016 Rena moves to the UK and puts her property on the market Main home December 2016 Rena sells property 16 Example: Trusts – student flat Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. Dave settles the student flat on a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The trust cannot use the main home exception because the principal settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home. Inheritance (Sections CB 6A(3), FC 9) When a person dies, their property may be sold or transferred to a beneficiary, who may subsequently sell the property. These transfers and disposals will not subject to tax under the bright-line test. How property is transferred through an inheritance When a taxpayer dies, an estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists. A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate (an administrator). The executor or administrator is vested with legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property from the time of death to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not have a legal or beneficial interest in the assets. The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Specific legacies are treated as taking effect from the date of transfer to take effect from the date of death, so income arising from the property is derived by the beneficiary from the date of death. A general or residuary legacy vests in a beneficiary at the time of distribution. Inheritance exception from bright-line test The bright-line test provides rollover relief for all transfers following a death and an exemption for any disposals by the executor or administrator or subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries. The rollover relief is achieved by deeming the transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, as a disposal and acquisition of the property to be at the total cost of the land to the deceased person at the date of transfer (rather than at the land’s market value). The effect of this is that no tax liabilities under the bright-line test arise under the transfers. 17 Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. Example: Inheritance Relationship property (Section FB 3A) When a relationship breaks down, property may be transferred between the spouses or partners. The property may then subsequently be sold. Transfers of property under a relationship property agreement are excluded from the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property will be subject to the bright-line test. How property is transferred under a relationship property agreement During a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the parties hold any property according to the conventional laws relating to property. As a result, the parties are free to deal with their property during the relationship without regard to the provisions of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. When a relationship breaks down, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may be invoked by a court order or an agreement between the parties. When the statutory regime is invoked, new property rights operate from the date of the court order or agreement. The property of the spouses or partners is reapportioned between them under principles from the statutory regime. Each item of property is divided into one of two statutory categories: • relationship property; or • separate property. The fact that a particular item of property is placed within one of these two categories then produces a prima facie result in the way it is treated as between the two spouses or partners. Prima facie, all relationship property is divided in equal shares, while separate property is retained by the owner. 1 May 2016 Mrs Higgins acquires residential rental property ($500k) 1 May 2017 Mrs Higgins dies 1 May 2017 Property transferred to administrator at cost ($500k) 1 June 2017 Property transferred to Henry, son of Mrs Higgins at cost ($500k) 1 July 2018 Peter sells property to Paul for $800k 1 July 2017 Henry sells property to Peter for $600k Transferred for $500k – no gain Transferred for $500k – no gain $100k gain exempted from bright-line $200k gain is subject to the bright-line 18 Rollover for relationship property A transfer of property under a relationship property agreement will be entitled to the current rollover relief that applies to such transfers. This will mean that no tax liability under the bright-line test arises for the transfer of the property under the relationship property agreement. However, the person to whom the relationship property has been transferred may be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. A tax liability will arise if the property is disposed of within two years of the registration date on the acquisition by the person who transferred the property (and the property was not the main ho me of the person disposing of the property). Example: Relationship property Rollover for land transferred under a resident’s restricted amalgamation (Sections FO 10, FO 17) Under the bright-line test there is rollover relief for amalgamations. This rollover relief extends the existing rollover relief for amalgamations to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the new bright-line test. Current amalgamation rules The amalgamation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 contain a rollover provision for property transferred as a result of an amalgamation. 3 The rules provide that when property is held on revenue account by an amalgamating company solely due to the application of a 10-year rule in sections CB 9 to CB 11 and CB 14, the property is transferred to the amalgamated company at cost. If the amalgamated company disposes of the property within 10 years of the original date of acquisition of the property by the amalgamating company, any gain from the sale is taxable. Extending current rules to bright-line test Under the bright-line test this rollover relief is extended to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the bright-line test. 3 That meets the criterion to be a “resident’s restricted amalgamation” under section FO 3. 1 May 2016 Andrew acquires an investment property for $500k 1 May 2017 As part of a relationship property settlement the investment property is transferred to Bert 1 February 2018 Bert sells investment property for $700k Transferred for $500k – no gain Sale is taxable under the bright-line as acquisition and disposal occur within two years 19 Example: Land held on revenue account solely due to bright-line test On 1 May 2018 the property is transferred from A to B at cost ($500k). A does not have a tax liability from the transfer as there is no gain from the disposal. On 1 June 2018, B is taxable on the $150k gain from the sale. This is because B disposed of the property within two years of the original date of acquisition of the property by A (1 May 2017). Deductions For property that is liable for tax under the bright-line test, taxpayers will be able to deduct expenditure according to the ordinary tax rules. The cost of the property can be deducted A person who sells property that is subject to the bright-line test will be allowed a deduction for the cost of the property at the time of sale. The cost of the property includes the amount that was paid to acquire the property (the initial acquisition price of the property). The cost of the property also includes any expenditure related to the acquisition. As a result, the costs of lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agents are deductible. The incidental costs of disposing of the property are also deductible as part of the cost of the property. The cost of the property also includes any capital improvements to the property made after acquisition, such as renovations. Holding costs deductible to the extent sufficient nexus and not private in nature While a property is owned there will be periodic holding costs (of a non-capital nature) such as interest, insurance, rates and repairs, and maintenance expenses. To be deductible as incurred, the holding costs must satisfy the normal deduction requirements. In other words, the holding costs are deductible to the extent they have a nexus with inco me and are not private in nature (or otherwise subject to any of the general limitations on deductions). A deduction will be considered to be of a private nature if it is exclusively related to living as an individual. This will be determined by the specific facts of any given situation. However, interest costs can automatically be deducted if the property is owned by a company (subject to some limitat ions). 1 May 2017 A purchases property for $500k 1 May 2018 A transfers property to B as part of an amalgamation. Market value of property is $600k. 1 June 2018 B sells property to C for $650k Transferred for $500k – no gain Sale for $650k – gain is taxable as disposed of within two years of original acquisition 20 For example, when the property is part of a business or profit-making undertaking or scheme, and there is no private use, it is likely that the nexus would be satisfied. Further, when the property is rented out there would likely be a nexus between the holding costs and the rental income. However, if a person purchases a bach for family use, but sells the bach within two years, the holding costs would not be deductible because of the private limitation. Ring-fencing losses (Section DB 18A) Losses from deductions that are claimable solely against bright-line income (bright-line deductions) are ring-fenced, so they can only be offset against gains on other land sales that are taxable under any of the land sale provisions. The amount of bright-line deductions allowed in any income year is limited to the amount of bright-line income and net land income for that year. Net land income is the amount of net income for the year as if the person’s only income they derived was from the disposal of land under sections CB 6 to CB 14. Any excess deductions not allocated to the income year will be treated as the cost of revenue account property and carried forward to the next income year. However, any excess deductions will not be able to be carried forward if the general continuity requirements for carrying forward tax losses are not satisfied. Example: Ring-fenced loss In June 2017 Zac sells residential land that is taxable solely due to the bright-line test. Zac acquired the land for $600,000 and sold it for $540,000. For the 2017–18 income year, Zac also earned $80,000 in salary. The $60,000 loss for the sale of residential land is ring-fenced so that it may only be used to offset income from other land sales. Zac cannot use the $60,000 loss to offset his income from salary and wages. In August 2019 Zac sells land that he purchased with an intention of resale. Zac made a gain of $100,000 from the sale. Zac may offset his previous $60,000 loss against the $100,000 gain. As a result Zac only has to pay tax on $40,000 of the gain in the 2019–20 income year. Losses from transfers to associated persons (Section DB 18AB) A person cannot recognise a loss arising from a transfer of property to an associated person if that loss is taxable solely due to the bright-line test. However, to avoid genuine losses being denied permanently, the associate may increase the cost base of the land by the amount of the denied deduction. 21 Example: Transfer to associate Steve’s deductions are capped at $400k for the transfer on 1 January 2017. He cannot claim the $100k loss for the year. When Tara sells the land on 1 June 2018, she can deduct $500k. This is made up of the $400k cost of acquisition as well as the $100k of denied deductions. Land-rich companies and trusts (Sections GB 52, GB 53) To address the risk of people using land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright- line test, a specific anti-avoidance rule deems disposals of residential land to have occurred when companies and trusts are used to defeat the intent and application of the bright-line test. Land-rich companies The anti-avoidance rule for land-rich companies applies when the following four requirements are met: • The company is land-rich – this means at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential land. • 50 percent of the shares in the company are disposed of within a 12 month period. • Some of the company’s residential land was acquired within two years of the disposal of the shares. • The disposal of shares had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. Definition of land-rich company A “land-rich” company is one where at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential land either directly or indirectly. This is intended to mirror similar provisio ns contained in international double tax agreements. Residential land can be attributable to a company either through the company owning the residential land in its own name or holding shares in another land-rich company. Deemed disposal When the requirements are met the land-rich company is treated as disposing of residential land that it acquired within two years of the share disposal to the shareholder at cost. The amount of residential land and the price are at the cost proportional to the shareholding of the relevant shareholder. 1 January 2016 Steve acquires residential property for $500k 1 January 2017 Property has decreased in value to $400k. Steve transfers property to his wife Tara. 1 June 2018 Tara sells land to Uri for $ 450 k 22 The shareholder is then treated as immediately disposing of the residential land back to the company at market value. Example: Land-rich company X co. will be treated as disposing of 50 percent of the residential land to Steve for $250k. Steve will then be treated as disposing of the residential land back to the company for $300k. As a result, Steve will have to pay income tax on the $50k gain from the deemed sale. Land-rich trusts Section GB 53 deems a trustee to have disposed of residential land at market value whenever all three of the following apply: • The trust is land-rich – this means that at least 50 percent of the value of the trust is attributable to residential land. • Any of the following changes are made: – the trust deed changes; or – a decisio n-maker under the trust deed changes; or – an arrangement under the trust changes. • The change was made with a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. 1 January 2016 Steve and Tara set up X co. Steve and Tara each own 50% of the shares in X co. 2 January 2016 X co. buys residential land for $ 500k 1 January 2017 The residential land now has a market value of $600k. Steve sells all of his shares in X co. to Uri. 23 Other remedial amendments Non-active trust filing exception (Section 43B Tax Administration Act 1994) An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows non-active trusts (which are currently required to file nil income tax returns) to apply to be exempted from the obligation to file, thereby reducing compliance costs. Requirements for exception Trusts that are non-active will no longer be required to file annual income tax returns if: • throughout the tax year the trust is a non-active complying trust; and • the trustee of the trust has filed a declaration that the trust is non-active (and the trust has not become active since making the declaration). A trust will be non-active if it: • has not derived or been deemed to have derived any income; • has no deductions; and • has not been a party to, or perpetuated or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust in the tax year, which give rise to income in any person’s hands, or fringe benefits to any emplo yee or to any former emplo yee. Certain minimal amounts of income or deductions can be ignored in determining whether a trust is non-active. This includes: • reasonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust; • up to $200 of bank charges or other minimal administration costs; • up to $200 of interest earned on trust assets in a bank account during the tax year; and • insurance, rates, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. The amendment sets out the process by which a non-active trust may make application for exemption from filing income tax returns. This process entails the completion of a declaration – first, that the trust is a non-active trust and secondly, that a trustee of the trust will inform the Commissioner if it ceases to be so. The trustees of the trust are thereby placed under a statutory obligation to inform the Commissioner upon the cessation. The Commissioner will retain the power to request the trustees of a trust to file a return of income even if it holds an exemption under the amended provision. The amendment is based on a similar provision for non-active companies in section 43A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 24 Definition of “land” (Section YA 1) As a result of the rewrite of income tax legislation, there was an unintended change to the definition of “land”. This change created uncertainty over whether it included an interest in land. To resolve this, the definition of “estate” and “interest” in land are replaced with a definition of estate and interest in land that clearly includes interests in land. The definition of land clearly included an interest in land prior to the rewrite of the definition. In addition, the new definition clarifies that an interest in land includes the right to possession of land. Clarifying treatment of land transferred under a resident’s restricted amalgamation (Section FO 17) The new Act clarifies the treatment of revenue account property transferred as a result of a resident’s restricted amalgamation when, at the time of the amalgamation, it is unclear whether the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue or capital account. Current amalgamation rules When two companies merge under an amalgamation, the transfer of assets between the companies is generally exempt from tax. However, the transfer is not exempt from tax if the property leaves the tax base. The amalgamation rules achieve this result by transferring property either at cost or at market value, depending on whether the amalgamating and amalgamated company hold the property on revenue or capital account. This is illustrated in Table 1. Table 1 Amalgamated company Amalgamating company Holds on capital account Holds on revenue account (except if solely due to 10-year rule) Holds on revenue account solely due to 10-year rule Holds on capital account Cost Market Market Holds on revenue account (except if solely due to 10-year rule) Market Cost Cost Market Holds on revenue account solely due to 10-year rule Cost Cost Cost 25 However, when the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue account, if it disposes of the property within 10 years, it is unclear for the amalgamating company whether they transfer the property at cost (and have no tax liability) or at market value (and have a tax liability). Deemed market value transfer The amendment applies so that property is deemed to be transferred at market value when: • the land is held on revenue account for the amalgamating company; and • the land is, or may be, revenue account property of the amalgamating company solely because of the 2-year bright-line test or a 10-year rule in any of sections CB 9 to CB 11, and CB 14. When the two criteria above are met the property is deemed to be transferred at market value. 26
September 2015 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue New information requirements to improve tax compliance in the property investment sector Sections 2AA, 156A, 156B, 156C, 156D, 156E, 156F, 156FA, 156G, 156H, 156I, 164B, 236, and schedule 1AA of the Land Transfer Act 1952; section 23 of the Land Transfer (Computer Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002; sections 3, 24BA, and 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This special report provides information on changes contained in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 enacted on 22 September 2015. From 1 October 2015, the changes will require transferors and transferees of land to provide certain tax information, including a New Zealand IRD number, when land is transferred unless an exemption applies to them. The changes will also require “offshore persons”, as defined, to provide a New Zealand bank account number when they apply for an IRD number. Information in this special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a future edit ion of the Tax Information Bulletin. Background The Income Tax Act 2007 contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions, and also on rental or other income earned from property. Current tax rules include provisions which tax gains from property bought with the intention of disposal, and provisions which tax land acquired for the purposes of dealing in land. The Government is concerned that compliance with these provisions may be relatively low. It is recognised that enforcing tax rules on non-residents is very difficult, especially those with only limited engagement with New Zealand. In order to investigate compliance with the income tax legislation relating to property transactions, Inland Revenue has the ability to access records of land transfers in New Zealand. But this process is historic, rather than in real-time. Information received might also not give a complete picture of the activities or identity of a particular taxpayer. 1 To address these concerns, the Government announced a package of measures as part of Budget 2015 aimed at providing clearer rules and providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of the rules, including increased funding to Inland Revenue to investigate property compliance. Three legislative measures, which are not aimed at a New Zealand person’s main home, will apply from 1 October 2015: • Information will be required to be supplied to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) upon transfer of property as part of the usual land transfer process. In particular, persons transferring any property (other than New Zealand individuals transferring their main home) must provide: - their New Zealand IRD number; and - their tax identification number from their home country if they are currently tax resident overseas. • To ensure that New Zealand’s full ant i-money laundering rules apply to non-residents before they buy a property, offshore persons must have a New Zealand bank account before they can get a New Zealand IRD number. • A new “bright-line” test will be introduced for sales of residential property, to supplement Inland Revenue’s current “intentions” test. Under this new test, gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement. The first two measures, which are discussed in this special report, were contained in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill, introduced on 22 June 2015. The bill was divided into two bills at the committee of the whole House stage. The resulting Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 were enacted on 22 September 2015. The bright-line test, which is not covered by this special report, was included in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill which was introduced on 24 August 2015 and had its first reading on 9 September 2015. To further ensure overseas property buyers meet both existing tax requirements and those of the new test, as part of Budget 2015, the Government also announced that it would investigate introducing a withholding tax for offshore persons selling residential property. An issues paper seeking feedback was released on 31 August 2015. 2 Key features • Transferors and transferees of property will need to provide the following information: - Whether the land has a home on it. - Whether the person or a member of their immediate family is a New Zealand cit izen or visa-ho lder. - If the person is a transferee and they or their immediate family has a work or student visa, whether they intend living on the land. • The following tax information must also be provided unless an exempt ion (such as the main home exemption) applies: - The person’s IRD number. - If the person is a tax resident in another jurisdiction at the time of transfer, the name of that jurisdiction and the equivalent of an IRD number (the “tax identification number”, or TIN) from that foreign jurisdiction. • A person who is not an “offshore person” as defined and who is purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home, or selling a property that was their main home, will not have to supply the tax information. The main home information exemption is not available where the person is an “offshore person”, where the property is to be or was owned by a trust, or if the person is selling their main home for the third time in a two-year period. • This information will be provided to LINZ as part of the transfer documentation and then passed on to Inland Revenue, to help compliance with New Zealand’s tax legislation. It could also be provided to overseas tax authorities by Inland Revenue in accordance with existing information-sharing legislation. • Aggregate data that does not identify any person may also be used for the purposes of housing policy. • Second, an “offshore person” (as defined) will be required to provide evidence of a fully functional New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person seeking to obtain an IRD number has first been subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. • An individual is not an offshore person if: - they are a NZ citizen and have been in New Zealand within the past 3 years; or - they hold a NZ residency class visa and have been in New Zealand within the past 12 months. All other individuals will be offshore persons. • For a non-individual (such as a partnership, trust or company), in general an offshore person is an entity or arrangement which is: - incorporated outside New Zealand; or - 25 percent or more owned (legal or beneficial) or controlled by an offshore person. 3 Application date The new rules apply from 1 October 2015. However, the new information requirements for transfers of land do not apply for transfers where both the following two conditions are satisfied: • the contract for the transfer is entered into before 1 October 2015; and • the transfer is registered on or before 1 April 2016. Detailed analysis References are to the Land Transfer Act 1952 unless stated otherwise. Supplying information when transferring land Requirement to provide a tax statement Section 156B provides that all transferors and transferees of real property who are transferring a “specified estate in land” must provide a “tax statement” before the transfer can be registered. The tax statement must be provided to LINZ, or to a certifier who will provide it to LINZ, in accordance with existing conveyancing processes as specified in section 156B(2) and (3). The definition of a specified estate in land is contained in section 156A, and includes freehold estates, leasehold estates, and certain unit titles and licences to occupy, as well as any other estate in land that is declared to be a specified estate in regulations. Section 156C states that a tax statement must contain the following: • full name, date and signature of the transferor or transferee; • whether the land has a home on it; • whether the person or a member of their immediate family is a New Zealand citizen or visa-ho lder; • if the person is a transferee and they or their immediate family has a work or student visa, whether they intend living on the land; and • either: - the category of exemption that applies (if the transfer is a “non-notifiable transfer” for the person as defined in section 156A(2) and therefore exempt from the requirement to provide tax information); or - the tax information set out in section 156C(2) if the person’s transfer is not exempt from the requirement to provide tax information. 4 Information required for persons for whom transfer is non-notifiable Transferees and transferors must provide the information contained in section 156C(2) unless the transaction is a “non-notifiable transfer” as defined in section 156A(2) (and therefore exempt for the purposes of section 156(2)). The exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that the tax information will still be required by the other party to the transfer unless the transaction is a non-notifiable transfer for that person also. In all cases, the non-exempt person must supply their IRD number. This applies regardless of whether they are tax resident in New Zealand or not. If the person does not currently have an IRD number, they must obtain one from Inland Revenue before they can complete the transfer. If they are currently a tax resident of another jurisdiction, the person must state the name and country code of that jurisdiction. The list of country codes is available on Inland Revenue’s website. The person must also provide the equivalent of their IRD number in that jurisdiction – that is, the unique identifier that they use in their dealings with the tax authority in that jurisdiction. In some cases, where a person is a tax resident of more than one jurisdiction under the law of those jurisdictions (dual resident), a double tax treaty may provide that a person is a tax resident of only one jurisdiction for the purposes of the double tax treaty. In such cases the person would have to provide their tax identification numbers of both jurisdictions. Persons acting in different capacities Where a non-exempt person must supply information about their IRD numbers (and where applicable, their foreign equivalent of an IRD number and relevant country code), section 156C(3) provides that a person who is acting in a different capacity must provide the information as it relates to the capacity in which they are acting. For example, where trustees of a trust are buying or selling trust property, they must provide the trust’s IRD number, not their own personal IRD numbers. Similarly, partners in a partnership who are buying or selling partnership property should provide the partnership’s IRD number, not their own IRD numbers. Nominees must provide the IRD number of the person for whom they are acting as nominee. Exemptions from requirement to provide information There are certain exemptions from the requirement to provide information. As noted above, these are “non-notifiable transfers” as defined in section 156A(2). The first is for individuals who are not “offshore persons” who are transferring their main ho me. The second is for particular transfers or parties to transfers that have been specified in regulations to the Act. 5 Having to supply an IRD number does not necessarily mean that tax must be paid on the sale of property. Conversely, while a person who does not have to provide their information will generally not have to pay New Zealand tax on their gain, in some circumstances this might not be the case. Main home information exemption This exemption is intended for New Zealand individuals who are transferring their main ho me. This is provided for by section 156A(2)(a)(i) and (ii). The definition of “main home” contained in the Land Transfer Act 1952 is very similar to the definition of “main home” contained in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill which was introduced on 24 August 2015. The policy intent was for the definitions to be broadly consistent with each other. For the main home exemption to apply for a transferee, the land must be intended to be used predominantly for a dwelling that will be the transferee’s main home. For the main home exemption to apply for a transferor, the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the transferor owned the land, as a dwelling that was the transferor’s main home. The owner must intend to reside (or have resided) in the property as their main home. Accordingly, the exemption will not apply when only a family member will use or has used the property as their main home (and not the owner themselves). Section 156A(2)(b) provides that the information exemption is not available where any one of the following applies: • the person is an “offshore person”; • where the property is to be owned via a trust (in the case of a transferee); • where the property was owned via a trust (in the case of a transferor); or • for the sale of a property where the main home exemption has been used twice or more in the past two years immediately preceding the date of transfer. Transferor must have used the land for “most of the time” as their main home In the case of a transferor, the land must have been used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50 percent of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land. The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on vacation or prior to settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private resident ial use. 6 Mixed use properties Where a property is used as both a main home and for other commercial, investment, or farming purposes, the main home information exemption will be available where most of the land is used for the home. When less than 50 percent of the property is used for the main home of the person then the main home exception will not apply. For example, where the person’s home is on a farm that is being run for profit, it is unlikely that the main home information exemption will apply because most of the land is used for commercial farming. However, if the home is on a small lifestyle block, it is likely that the main home information exemption will apply as the land is mostly used for the person’s ho me. Where a property is used for commercial premises (for example, a shop above a house), the main home information exemption will apply if most of the premises are being used for the person’s home. If most of the property is being used for the shop, the main home information exemption will not apply. In some circumstances this may require an estimation to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by the owner partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, the relative areas will need to be determined. For transferors, a taxpayer will have determined the relative areas in working out the tax deductions (insurance and rates, for example) that can be claimed. The determination of the areas includes any land used for the relevant purposes (for example, a backyard for the home). Another mixed- use situation can arise where a property is being used partly as a home for the transferor or transferee, and partly as rental accommodation for other people. For example, a person owning a two-bedroom house who has one flatmate could potentially use the main home exemption, as they are likely to be using the majority of the house as their main home. However, a person who owns and lives in a boarding house with eight rooms is not able to claim the main home exemption because the property is not used predominantly as their main ho me. Multiple homes Where a person resides in multiple homes, only one of those properties can be their main ho me. Where a person has more than one place of residence, their “main home” would be determined according to which property a person has the greatest connection with. The factors that determine these connections would include: • the time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family (if any) live; • where their social ties are strongest; • the person’s use of the dwelling; 7 • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and • whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling. The greatest connection factors are similar to those used to determine if a person has a permanent place of abode under current case law. Therefore, existing guidance on the “permanent place of abode” test should assist in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with. Time at which test is applied The time that the test should be applied is at the date of transfer. Occasionally this will mean that a person can use the main home information exemption for two properties sold at the same time. An example is when a person purchases a house intending to live in it and then moves into a new home while trying to sell the original home. The ownership overlap of the properties will not mean the original home fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the previous period. If the two properties were sold at the same time, the owner will be able to use the main home exception for the purchase and sale of the original house, and also for the purchase and sale of the second property (if each transaction satisfied the requirements to be a main home at the date of transfer). Example – Main home exception for multiple properties January 2016 Purchases Property 1 October 2016 Moves out of Property 1 and into Property 2 Main home December 2016 Sells Property 1 October 2016 Purchases and moves into Property 2 December 2016 Sells Property 2 Main home The main home exception is available for both properties. Property 1 was the main home for the majority of the time that person owned Property 1 was owned. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time it was owned (October to December 2016). 8 Different co-owners can have different main homes The test applies for each transferor or transferee. This means that different co-owners can have different main homes. For example, a person living in one city could potentially have a different main home from their spouse living in another city. Offshore persons Section 156A(2)(b)(iv) will provide that the main home exemption is not available to “offshore persons” (defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). This means that the main home exemption will be available to a person only if one of the following applies: • they are a New Zealand citizen or permanent visa holder who is currently present in New Zealand; or • they are a New Zealand citizen who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than three years; or • they are a permanent resident visa holder who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than one year. All other persons who are transferring a property must supply their IRD number, and if they are a current tax resident of another country, their equivalent of an IRD number and the country code of the other country. Trusts Where the property being transferred was or will be trust property, section 156A(2)(b)(i) and (ii) provides that the main home information exception will not be able to be used. This means that the trustees of a trust will need to provide the trust’s IRD number (and foreign equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) when transferring trust property. Persons selling their main home a third time within two years Section 156A(2)(b)(iii) provides that a person who has transferred their main home at least twice in the past two years must provide their IRD number (and foreign equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) if they transfer their main home a third time within that two-year period. This is to address the situation where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling a property in which they live, for profit. Such a person may be taxable under existing law on gains from the sale of these properties. Collecting information in relation to those who have sold their home for the third time within two years is intended to help Inland Revenue identify those situations. 9 Examples of main home information exemption Example 1 – Main home George buys his first home in Seymour Street in 2016. However, his neighbours complain about the noise when he plays his drum kit, so he decides to sell it and buy a new home with better soundproofing. When he puts his Seymour Street house on the market he is pleasantly surprised to discover that his house has risen in value. He has an offer accepted on a new house in Taradale Street. George does not need to provide his IRD number for the sale of the Seymour Street property, which he lived in as his main home, or the purchase of the Taradale Street property, which is to be his main home. Example 2 – Holiday home Lisa rents an apartment in Wellington, where she lives with her son. The apartment is close to her office from which she runs her consulting business fulltime. She is a member of a local tramping club and is on the Board of Trustees of her son’s school in central Wellington. She owns a house on Lake Taupo with views over the lake. She does not let the Lake Taupo property out when she is not using it. She spends four weeks with her son in this property here over Christmas and New Year, and also uses the property for about five weekends during the ski season. When Lisa sells the Lake Taupo property, she cannot use the main home exemption because it is not the property with which she has the greatest connection, taking into account the factors listed on pages 7–8. Example 3 – Two properties Mr and Mrs Brown and their children live in a house on a small lifestyle block in Oamaru. Mrs Brown works in Christchurch for three days a week, and works from the Oamaru house two days a week while her husband looks after the children fulltime. Mrs Brown plans to buy an apartment in Christchurch city. She will live in that apartment while she works in Christchurch. Taking into account the fact that the majority of Mrs Brown’s time is spent at the Oamaru house, and her family is located at the Oamaru house, the main home information exemption will not apply in relation to Mrs Brown’s Christchurch apartment as it is not the home with which she has the greatest connection, and she will have to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property. However, if Mr and Mrs Brown were to sell their Oamaru property, they would not need to provide their IRD numbers in relation to that sale because that property was their main home. 10 Example 4 – Offshore person Sarah is a New Zealand citizen who has been living in the United Kingdom (UK) for the past 10 years. Prior to returning to New Zealand, she decides to buy a house in Te Awamutu to live in. As she is an “offshore person” at the time she purchases the house, she cannot use the main home information exemption for this property and she will need to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property. Because she is a tax resident of the UK at the time that she purchases the property, she will also need to supply her UK National Insurance number (which is the equivalent to a New Zealand IRD number), and the UK country code. Example 5 – Investment property Tom and Barbara are selling their property, which they used as their main home, to Jerry and Margo, who are buying it to use as an investment property. The transfer is a non-notifiable transfer for Tom and Barbara. They are both New Zealand citizens and have been present in New Zealand within the last three years, and are selling their main home. However, the transfer is not a non-notifiable transfer for Jerry and Margo. Jerry and Margo live in the UK but are New Zealand citizens, and have visited New Zealand within the last three years. However, they are not buying their main home. They must therefore supply the tax information required under section 156C(2). Jerry and Margo must supply their New Zealand IRD numbers. Because they are both tax residents of the UK, they must also supply their UK National Insurance numbers. Jerry is also a tax resident of France under France’s domestic tax laws because he owns a holiday home there. He therefore also needs to provide his French tax identification number. (Although there is a double tax treaty between France and the UK, and that double tax treaty provides that Jerry is a resident of the UK only, he still needs to provide both his French tax identification number and his UK National Insurance number). Example 6 – Multiple dwellings Tom buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Tom sells the apartment block to a third party. Tom will have to provide his IRD number on the sale of the apartment block because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominately as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property. Example 7 – Lifestyle block Paul purchases a two hectare block of former farmland and builds a house on it. Paul lives in the house as his main home with his family. The remaining land is used by the family to keep some family horses to ride and to run a handful of sheep to keep the grass down. The main home exception will apply and Paul will not need to supply his IRD number when he purchases or sells the land. 11 Example 8 – Mixed use: apartment attached to factory Melissa intends to purchase a large factory with a small apartment attached. Melissa intends to live in the apartment as her main home. Melissa must supply her IRD number at the time she acquires the property because she does not intend to use the land predominately as her main home. Example 9 – Mixed use: country store and house Judy owns a country store that has living quarters attached. She lives in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front half of the property. She estimates that the retail business uses 45 percent of the property and claims expenses (for example, insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Judy sells the property. She does not need to provide her IRD number because she has used the property predominately (55 percent) as her main home during the time she has owned the property. Example 10 – Mixed use: purchase of fish and chip shop Brandon intends to buy a fish and chip shop with an attached dwelling. Brandon will need to determine the total area of the different parts of the property to determine whether he intends to use the property predominately for his main home, and so whether he needs to supply his IRD number as part of the purchase. (Brandon will need to make an estimation of the total area in the future in any event to determine the deductions that can be claimed against his retail income.) Brandon estimates that he will use the property (building and surrounding land) 60 percent for the fish and chip shop. He will, therefore, need to provide his IRD number on purchase of the property. Example 11 – Purchase of lifestyle block (change in use) Amy and Chris decide to move from the city to the country. They buy a 15 acre (six hectare) block. They intend to purchase some livestock to keep the grass down and the freezer full. At the time of acquisition, they would not need to supply their IRD number as the main home exemption would apply. After three years, the couple decide to supplement their income by leasing out all but one of the paddocks for horse grazing. As a result, the area that they use for their own purposes does not exceed the area of the leased paddocks. They continue to lease out most of the paddocks for horse grazing for the next five years, at which point they decide to sell the property. When they sell the property, the main home exemption will not apply to them because the majority of the land was not used for their main home for the majority of the time that they owned it. Information exemptions (non-notifiable transfers) under regulations Sections 156A(2)(iii) and 236(l)(ha)(ii) provide that particular types of transfers or parties to transfers can be “non-notifiable” transfers under regulations to the Act. In these cases the IRD number, and where applicable, a tax ident ificat ion number and country code are not required. 12 In order for a type of transfer, or party to a transfer, to be specified in regulations, section 236(4) provides that the Minister for Land Information must be satisfied that the type of transfer or party to a transfer meets the following criteria: • collecting this information would be impractical or involve high compliance costs; or • the transfer would represent a low tax avoidance risk. The exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that the tax information will still be required by the other party in the transfer unless the transaction is a non-notifiable transaction for them too. Cabinet has approved regulations that will exempt transfers in the fo llowing situat ions. Mortgagee sales Where a transfer is the result of a mortgagee sale, a rating sale under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002, a court-ordered or statute-ordered sale, the transferor does not need to provide an IRD number. This is because the transferor in this circumstance is the mortgagee or creditor and there is a low risk of tax avoidance in this context. Transfers from executors In the case of death, the executors of the person’s estate are exempted from the requirement to provide an IRD number. The rationale for this exemption is that estate sales will not be taxed under the proposed bright-line test, and requiring all executors to get an IRD number would also add compliance costs in a situation where there is no choice about the vehicle used for transferring property. Public and local authorities Tax-exempt public authorities and tax-exempt local authorities, as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, would not need to provide an IRD number when transferring land. This definition includes departments and departmental agencies and local authorities but not wider Crown Entit ies or Council Controlled Organisations. It will include any land held by the Crown. As they are tax-exempt there is no need for tax information. Offence to supply misleading or false tax information Section 156E provides that a person who knowingly, or with intent to deceive, gives false or misleading tax information, commits an offence. A person who commits such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $25,000 if the conviction is a first time offence, and a fine of up to $50,000 for every subsequent offence. A person who provides information that they genuinely believe to be true but which is not in fact correct will not be committing an offence. 13 Correction of errors or omissions Section 156D provides a procedure for an omission or error that was contained in a tax statement provided to LINZ to be corrected. Such omissions or errors do not affect the validity of any registration of transfer instrument. Information disclosure and retention Section 156H provides that tax information must not be disclosed unless authorised or required by law. Section 156F requires LINZ to supply Inland Revenue with the tax information and the details of the related property transaction that it collects. Section 156I of the Land Transfer Act and section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permit tax information to be disclosed between authorised persons in specified circumstances, which is intended to allow for information matching between Inland Revenue and LINZ in relation to the information collected by LINZ. Section 156F also permits the chief executive of LINZ to release or to give tax information to any person who requests it, provided that the information is given in aggregate form only and in a manner that prevents any person, estate in land, or transaction from being identified. Under section 156G, certifiers and LINZ must hold tax statements for 10 years. A copy of a statement must be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue if requested in writing. Regulations providing for exemption from requirement to provide tax statement As noted above, section 156B provides that all transferors and transferees of real property must provide a tax statement before the transfer can be registered. Section 236(1)(ha)(i) provides for regulations to be made to exempt certain types of transactions from the requirement to complete a tax statement if it would be impractical or involve high compliance costs, or where there is a low risk of tax avoidance. Cabinet has approved regulations to exempt transfers of Māori Land as defined by Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (Māori customary land and Māori freehold land) for practicality reasons. There are often many owners and contacting them all is difficult, if not impossible. Cabinet has approved regulations to exempt transferees from the requirement to complete a tax statement where the transfer is a part of the Treaty settlement process. Again, in many cases it would be impractical to collect information from owners. Except in the case of Māori land, the exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that a tax statement will still be required by the other party in the transfer unless they too are exempted by regulation. 14 Regulations providing for other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement Regulations will be able to be made to include transfers of other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement, where these are economically equivalent (see section 236(l)(hb)). No such regulations are currently under consideration. New Zealand bank account requirement Section 24BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner must not allocate a tax file number (commonly known as an IRD number) to an offshore person unless she first receives a bank account number for that person. The main features of the rule are: • the definition of “offshore person”; and • the definition of “bank account number”. The amendments come into force on 1 October 2015. Offshore person The definition of “offshore person” applies both to individuals and non-individuals (for example, trusts and companies). For individuals, a New Zealand citizen or person that holds a residence-class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009 will generally not be classed as an offshore person unless: • in the case of citizens, they have not been in New Zealand within the last three years; and • in the case of residents, they have not been in New Zealand within past 12 months. A non-individual will be an “offshore person” if they would be an overseas person under section 7(2)(b) to (e) of the Overseas Investment Act 2005 (modified to include the test for individuals described above). This test looks through structures that are New Zealand-tax resident and looks at their underlying ownership or control. The test is necessary to prevent offshore individuals avoiding the rule by interposing a New Zealand-resident structure. Generally speaking this means a non-individual will be treated as being “offshore” if: • It is a body corporate (such as a company) and: - it is incorporated outside New Zealand; or - 25 percent or more of its shares are owned by a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand; or - an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) 25 percent or more of:  any class of securities; 15  the power to control the composition of its governing body; or  the right to exercise or control the voting power. • It is a partnership or other unincorporated body of persons (other than a trust) and: - 25 percent or more of its partners or members are offshore persons; - an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) a beneficial interest in or ent it lement to 25 percent or more of the profits or assets (including on winding up); or - an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) has the right to exercise or control the exercise of 25 percent or more of the voting power at a meeting. • It is a trust and an offshore person (or offshore persons) - constitute 25 percent or more of its governing body; or - has or have a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the trust property; or - are 25 percent or more of those that have the right to amend or control the amendment of the trust deed; or - are 25 percent or more of those having the right to control the composition of the trust’s governing body. • It is a unit trust and an offshore person (or offshore persons) and: - is or are the manager or trustee, or both; or - has or have a beneficial interest in, or entitlement to, 25 percent or more of the trust property. Bank account number A “bank account number” is an identifying number of an account at either a “registered bank”, as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989, 1 or a “licenced non-bank deposit taker”, as defined in the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. The Reserve Bank publishes lists of both types of entity on its website. The bank account must be one for which customer due diligence (under the AML rules) has been completed. This is to ensure that the relevant identity checks have actually been performed on the person applying for the IRD number. The account must be a current account (a person cannot use the details of a closed account). The account number submitted to the Commissioner must be an account held by the IRD number applicant. The bank account requirement applies only in instances where a person has applied for an IRD number. This is so that the current practice of the Commissioner allocating IRD numbers as an administrative matter in some cases will continue. 1 This definition is already contained in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and so is incorporated in the Tax Administration Act through the operation of section 3(2) of that Act. 16 Becoming an offshore person Section 24BA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is intended to prevent the bank account requirement being circumvented by, for example, a New Zealand company being established, obtaining an IRD number and then being sold to an offshore person. The proposed section requires a person to give their bank account number to the Commissioner immediately upon becoming an “offshore person”. However, this requirement to provide a bank account number at this later time applies only to non-individuals. This means that, for example, a New Zealand citizen who emigrates will not be obliged to provide a bank account number after being away for three years. A person who has already provided a current bank account number to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue does not need to do so again if they become an offshore person. Penalties for non-compliance No new penalties are included as part of these amendments. If an offshore person does not provide a bank account number they will not be issued an IRD number. Existing penalties may apply in certain instances, such as for the requirement to provide a bank account number upon becoming an offshore person. In such cases, failing to provide information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when required to do so by a tax law is an offence under sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 17

Hon Michael Woodhouse  
Minister of Revenue

26 February 2016

Speech

### Opening address at the International Fiscal Association Conference

Good morning and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you today.

This is my first speech in the Revenue portfolio and I am still in the process of getting my head around all that is happening. Officials have been giving me in-depth briefings and I feel that it is a portfolio in great shape for which I am grateful to my predecessors for their work.

I’m also very aware of, and grateful to you for your valuable contribution in ensuring that our tax system runs as efficiently as we can make it.

That is an ongoing focus and I urge you and other tax professionals to continue to engage in dialogue with my officials and to bring matters forward for consideration to fine tune tax policy.

#### Business transformation

But a good tax system is not just sound tax policy, but also a strong tax administration to implement those policies and I take over this portfolio at a time when big changes are coming in for administration.

Inland Revenue will of course continue to be the organisation that gathers the bulk of Crown revenue and administers social policies such as child support and working for families, but how it performs its functions and the way that the department sees itself is evolving.

There are two aspects of the transformation programme that I want to mention to you today: the need to boost tax compliance and a desire to ensure that taxpayers’ compliance costs are minimised.

Let’s consider minimising compliance costs first. I understand that you will be hearing from Joel Slemrod today.

He points out that across the world, compliance costs tend to be many times larger than the cost to the Government of administering the tax system.

Joel has suggested compliance costs in the United States may be 10% of tax collections whereas the costs to the Government of administering a tax collection agency are, of course, much smaller than that.

In New Zealand total tax collected over the 12 months to September 2015 by Inland Revenue was about 25% of GDP. The costs of administering Inland Revenue are about 0.3% of GDP.

If New Zealand’s overall compliance costs were similar to what Joel has estimated for the United States, we would be looking at 2.5% of GDP.

So that would mean companies were spending $5-6b on tax compliance alone. I’m sure that's not correct; I think NZ has a leaner and more efficient tax administration regime but we also shouldn't be complacent or think this is as good as it gets.

In New Zealand where we have lots of SMEs, compliance costs for SMEs is a particular concern.

So making an improvement here could have a substantial benefit for our economy.

Boosting compliance is also a huge issue. It’s not a matter of getting the last drop of juice out of the orange.

Instead we want high levels of compliance to be encouraged by good and accurate information and tying in tax reporting and payment with normal business processes.

For instance, we know that compliance with tax rules is high for withholding taxes such as PAYE so we’ll be exploring what other payments could be subject to withholding taxes.

The IRD needs to be much better and smarter at using information.

That information could provide early warnings of potential policy problems as well as helping the department identify who to audit and who should be left alone.

The key that unlocks all of this is a greater use of digital technology, but that’s not simply about replacing a paper form with an online version.

It is re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings.

And even more than that, it’s a transformation in the way the department views as the best way to perform its functions.

Behind all of this is a strong determination from IRD to be a customer-focused organisation with the interests of the customer at heart.

#### Customer focus

It marks a new focus on customer service.

Interactions will increasingly move to proactive assistance to help taxpayers get it right from the start, with less time spent reactively remediating.

If people are to a greater degree self-managing their tax affairs online, then for the IRD there will be less process-driven work allowing the department to become a more professional workforce, capable of providing the kind of information that the public and business really need.

For instance – the tax laws are complex and from time to time people need information from Inland Revenue. They are trying to do the right thing and they need certainty.

You should be able to deal with confidence with Inland Revenue and be confident that an answer you get from Inland Revenue represents the IRD’s view.

That’s an important point. Embarking on this programme means that the IRD will transform itself from a backroom service provider to an organisation that provides higher value services.

This is fundamental to a successful transformation.

But the transformation is not limited to just the IRD’s business.

To varying degrees, it is a transformation of business in New Zealand.

Henri Eliot, who chairs the independent Simplification panel advising Inland Revenue on the transformation project, made an important point when he said that the changes would also affect accountants as there would be less routine transactional work for tax agents.

He said "the 'shoe boxes of receipts' will disappear completely and there will be more work around advising businesses how to grow."

So the IRD will move to providing more professional services and tax agents will be able to move to providing more end to end services, and perhaps also more complex work.

#### International tax

Turning now to policy matters, a second focus for us will continue to be international tax and NZ’s response to the OECD’s work on base erosion and profit shifting or BEPS.

There will be a continuing focus on maintaining tax treaties with other countries and co-operation with other countries on a range of tax issues.

An important example is the Automatic Exchange of Information (or AEOI) which is aimed at increasing the transparency of international financial transactions to increase tax compliance and reduce money laundering.

An officials’ issues paper setting out AEOI implementation questions was released for public feedback last week.

#### BEPS

On the BEPS front, I’m happy to say that New Zealand is starting from a better place than most countries because it has reasonably robust rules which limit the scope for BEPS.

We want our tax system to be fair and seen to be fair want but we also want New Zealand to be a good place to base a business and invest. There is a balance to be struck.

A key focus is how we tax inbound investment.

Questions have been raised about our framework for taxing such investment.

There is a concern that the current treatment has the effect of raising the cost of capital.

Tax policy officials at IRD and Treasury will be engaging on this issue with officials from MBIE, MFAT and the wider Treasury.

This will be followed with a dialogue with the tax community on the tax settings for inbound investment and officials will consider the impact of tax settings for the cost of capital.

But the issue of how we should best tax inbound investment is a much broader issue than the cost of capital.

I expect that the dialogue between yourselves and officials should take place in the first half of the year.

Those discussions will help inform decisions about what tax changes to make in two areas: hybrids and interest limitation.

#### Applying our BBLR framework

Maintaining and improving our tax settings within a BBLR tax framework continues to be another important focus.

A number of measures that have already been consulted on will be part of the first omnibus tax bill in April or May this year. These include:

*   NRWT on related party debt
*   related parties debt remission – correcting an anomaly which could lead to over-taxation when debt was remitted between related parties;
*   changes in tax rules for closely held companies;
*   interaction of loss grouping and imputation rules.

Announcements on the details of this legislation will be made shortly.

There will be work in other areas as well. This includes providing certainty on the tax treatment of employee share schemes. This will be included in a second omnibus tax bill I intend to introduce in late 2016.

#### The tax policy work programme

And the final matter I will mention today is the tax policy work programme.

Officials have briefed the Minister of Finance and me on what is being worked on this year. This very largely involves work on issues included in the tax policy work programme that was released a year ago.

It is planned that the work programme will be refreshed for the next 18 months in the middle of this year. 

At that stage we will be seeking feedback from key stakeholders including, for example, CTG the Law Society and CAANZ on what they see as the highest priority issues. It is a busy time and it is obviously critical to ensure that attention is focused on the highest priority tasks.

#### Conclusion

The changes to our tax administration which are coming in will help improve our tax system by making it easier for people to comply.

Meanwhile our broad-base, low-rate tax system where taxes are evenly and neutrally applied over a broad range of forms of income and expenditure provides a very good tax policy framework.

It helps ensure that taxes are fair and efficient, that costs of administering and complying with the tax system are kept to a minimum and that the tax system is coherent.

In the past, we have looked to you for your input which has been immensely valuable in shaping tax policies.

Now as we start bringing in the big changes to tax administration, we will be needing your help once again.

Thank you.

### Budget 2016: Pre-Budget Speech to Business New Zealand event Wellington

It’s good to be back here for my annual pre-Budget speech and I want to thank Business New Zealand for hosting me once again.

This year’s Budget will be delivered against a backdrop of a growing economy, supported by strong levels of tourism and migration, a large pipeline of construction projects and low interest rates.

Notwithstanding challenges in the dairy industry, most New Zealand forecasters are predicting growth of around 3 per cent on average over the next few years.

That’s a good position for the country to be in.

In fact, over the last five years New Zealand has had one of the fastest growth rates in the OECD.

However, nothing is guaranteed.

There are always risks, and at the moment these revolve around issues like the ability of China to smoothly negotiate its economic challenges.

On the other hand, the economy could do better than forecast.

That’s why the Government takes a medium-term approach to fiscal policy, looking through ups and downs and focusing on the overall path of the Crown’s finances.

That path shows increasing surpluses and government debt falling below 20 per cent of GDP, in line with the Government’s objectives.

Every year at this event I try to talk about an aspect of the Budget that’s relevant for Kiwi businesses and I’m going to do so again today.

Last year you might recall I announced an increase in Callaghan Innovation’s co-funding budget.

Our efforts to raise business innovation are paying dividends, with a Statistics NZ survey last week reporting a 15 per cent lift in business R&D activity in just one year.

Today I’m going to announce some tax changes that will be positive for businesses, and especially for smaller businesses.

But before that I want to run through some of our other activities in the business space.

The first point I want to make is that government is a big business in its own right.

We own and operate hospitals and schools, for example, provide law enforcement and defence services, and run transport, electricity and housing businesses.

Excluding transfers, we are a quarter of the economy.

Our biggest contribution to New Zealand’s productivity is in running our 25 per cent better.

And by keeping our spending in check we reduce some of the burden on taxpayers and provide more space for the internationally competitive sectors of the economy to grow.

So the Government is continuing to get its own house in order – making sure we are good providers of services and good owners of assets.

In our welfare and social housing reforms, for example, we are promoting more competition, using more commercial tools like actuarial valuations, and focusing on getting our customers back to independence.

A private sector business needs to understand its customers because they drive its revenue.  
We need to understand our customers because they drive our costs.

We are digging into these costs and the information is leading to important changes in the public sector.

Alongside other programmes, this approach is helping to reduce government spending as a proportion of GDP, as well as getting better results for New Zealanders.

The Treasury has calculated that in structural terms – so not including cyclical factors like whether the economy is in a boom or a recession – government spending increased by eight percentage points of GDP between 2004 and 2009.

That increase was simply unaffordable and would have seen a blowout in government debt.

In response, our approach has been to reduce Budget operating allowances, make efficiency savings across the public sector, and shift the focus of government agencies onto working together to achieve results under an assumption of limited new funding.

As a result, we have reversed most of that increase in spending from the mid-2000s and got the operating balance back into surplus.

So an important role for the Government in supporting business activity is to keep its own house in order.

Another is to provide an environment where businesses can be flexible and resilient.

The business growth agenda is the master list of hundreds of government initiatives in this area.

Let me mention just a few.

New Zealand’s future is in being an open, outward-facing country, welcoming of people and ideas from other countries, and part of wide-reaching global supply chains.

It’s worth reminding ourselves that 99.9 per cent of the potential customers for our products live overseas.

Many of these are in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region that surrounds us.

That’s why the TPP agreement is so important – it puts a crucial piece into the jigsaw.

When TPP comes into force, New Zealand will have free trade relationships with China, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, the ten ASEAN countries, Australia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, the United States and Canada.

That’s pretty much the entire Pacific Rim.

In particular, our TPP partners the United States and Japan are the biggest and third-biggest economies in the world.

A quarter of all household consumption in the world happens in America.

So we need to be in TPP – it keeps us connected to the world.

So too does ultra-fast broadband.

It makes the world smaller for New Zealand businesses, helps their productivity and makes them more competitive.

Our ultra-fast broadband programme has businesses as one of its top priorities, alongside schools and hospitals.

Our goal was to have 90 per cent of businesses in UFB coverage areas able to connect to faster, more reliable broadband by the end of 2015.

We exceeded that target.

In fact, 97 per cent of businesses in these areas – more than 200,000 firms – can now connect to UFB.

Technology is changing the way New Zealand firms do business.

It should also change the way they interact with the Government.

One of the Government’s 10 key result areas, alongside things like reducing welfare dependency and increasing educational attainment, is to ensure that New Zealanders can complete their transactions with the Government easily in a digital environment.

Two areas we are focusing on are ACC and tax.

Both are going through big transformation programmes.

Improvements to ACC have also led to significant levy reductions.

In total, employers, workers and motor vehicle owners are now paying $2 billion a year less in levies than they were five years ago – the equivalent of a sizeable tax cut.

In 2011/12, employers paid $1.47 in work account levies for every $100 of their payroll. Now they pay 80 cents.

Back then, the average ACC levy per motor vehicle was $335. Now it’s only $130 – a reduction of over 60 per cent.

ACC also launched a five-year transformation project, with a focus on improving the service it provides to business customers.

The programme includes digital services that will provide businesses with real-time information on injury rates and trends in their workplaces, and support them to develop more effective injury prevention initiatives.

Technology is also affecting the way businesses interact with Inland Revenue.

Around 30 to 40 per cent of businesses currently use cloud-based accounting software but this is expected to grow to 85 to 90 per cent in the next 10 years.

We want the tax system to fit in with how businesses operate, not the other way around.

That’s the idea behind Inland Revenue’s business transformation project.

The intention is for businesses to see information and interact with Inland Revenue through an on-line account.

Compliance costs will be reduced by using a business’s normal processes and systems – especially accounting systems – to meet tax obligations.

This will make it easier for businesses to get things right and harder to get things wrong, allowing them to focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration.

The move to a new information system provides an opportunity to revisit New Zealand’s business tax rules.

We have grasped that opportunity.

So what I want to announce today is a new SME-friendly tax package that I think will be welcomed by all businesses, and especially by smaller ones.

The package will make paying tax easier and more certain, reduce the burden of interest and penalties, and help smaller businesses tailor payments to their own circumstances.

I think everyone acknowledges that meeting tax obligations is a particular challenge for smaller businesses.

Among other things, businesses tell us that provisional tax is hard to get right and expensive to get wrong.

Perfect accuracy can sometimes be costly in a way that doesn’t seem justified.

And some penalties are seen as punitive and discourage compliance.

So we have developed this tax package to make it easier for smaller businesses, in particular, to comply with their tax obligations and therefore reduce costs and distractions.

There are three main parts to this package.

The first relates to provisional tax.

Among other things, we are going to eliminate or reduce use-of-money interest for the vast majority of taxpayers.

And we are going to give small businesses – those with a turnover of less than $5 million – the opportunity to choose a new “pay-as-you-go” option for provisional tax.

The way provisional tax currently works is that people, by one method or another, estimate their likely tax bill for the coming year and pay that amount in three instalments.

This new option drops the estimation part and instead works out your tax payments on an ongoing basis throughout the year.

Every two months your accounting software will calculate your taxable income for that period.

You’ll be prompted to make the right tax payment directly through your accounting system, and generally at the same time as you pay GST.

Under this new “accounting income method”, provisional tax payments will more accurately match income as it is earned, be made more regularly and be integrated into normal business practices.

Use-of-money interest won’t apply to taxpayers who choose this method and who pay their tax on time.

Up to 110,000 small businesses could be eligible to use the accounting income method, starting from 1 April 2018 when Inland Revenue’s new computer system is up and running.

I welcome this initiative because it means small business owners and managers can get on with running their businesses rather than being tied up in tax compliance.

That’s what we want and what businesses want, so it’s a win-win.  
I mentioned use-of-money interest a moment ago.

This, as you know, is paid, or received, on the difference between a business’s actual tax liability for the year and what they paid in provisional tax.  
This is only known at the end of the year.

We want to get a lot more businesses out of the use-of-money regime because interest charges are often burdensome and frustrating for taxpayers who are simply following the rules.

The accounting income method will help do that for many small businesses.

In addition, taxpayers who continue to use what is currently the most common method for calculating provisional tax – the standard or “uplift” method – won’t be subject to use-of-money interest if their tax liability for the year is under $60,000 and their tax is paid on time.

That includes companies, as well as individuals, and will take up to 67,000 taxpayers out of the use-of-money interest regime altogether.

For taxpayers with a tax liability above $60,000, and again who use the uplift method, use-of-money interest will only apply from the third and last instalment of provisional tax.

This change potentially benefits a further 19,000 taxpayers.

It will also give bigger taxpayers the chance to do a “square up” in their last instalment, since by then they’ll have a good idea of their actual tax position for the year.

In that case, they will have paid the right amount of provisional tax so won’t be subject to interest.

The combination of all these changes means that the vast majority of taxpayers either won’t pay use-of-money interest or will pay significantly less than they do now.

That’s the first part of the package – provisional tax.

The second part of the SME-friendly tax package I’m announcing today gives more flexibility for contractors to choose a withholding rate that suits their individual circumstances.

Payments to around 130,000 contractors each year have withholding tax deducted from them.

Many of you will have seen the form that says if you are a shearer you’ll have payments withheld at 15 per cent, if you’re a freelance journalist they’re withheld at 25 per cent, cleaning contractors at 20 per cent, and so on down the list.

You may well have scratched your head at these differences.

We are going to make the system more flexible.

From 1 April 2017, it will be easy for contractors to choose their own withholding rate, subject only to a minimum of 10 per cent.

This means contractors can take into account their individual circumstances, which of course they know better than anyone else.

If an accurate rate is chosen, contractors may no longer be forced into an “over-withholding” situation or an “under-withholding” situation that could see them liable for provisional tax.

It’s in their interest to get it right.

Contractors who aren’t currently subject to withholding tax rules will also be able to elect into this system, with the payer’s agreement.

And withholding tax rules will be extended to contractors engaged through labour hire firms.

The third part of the business tax package is about late payment penalties.

For new debts after 1 April 2017, the 1 per cent ongoing monthly penalty will be scrapped for income tax, GST and some other payments.

The immediate penalty that applies to late payments, and the 4 per cent penalty after a further week, will remain.

So will use-of-money interest on overdue tax.

But a 1 per cent monthly penalty on top of all this, as we have at the moment, makes the combination of penalties and interest very burdensome.

We need to be realistic.

Building up a very large debt to Inland Revenue is often an ineffective way to get individuals and businesses to resolve their tax situation.

And a large portion of penalties is uncollectable and is simply written off.

The Government encourages compliance and wants to give taxpayers more opportunity to talk to Inland Revenue and work out a way to repay their tax debts before they become too big to resolve.

So these are the new measures we’re introducing for provisional tax, withholding tax and penalties.

There are a few more parts to the package but those I’ve talked about today are the main ones.

Inland Revenue is releasing an issues paper today that goes through everything in the package in great detail, as you’d expect.

Your feedback is welcome.

The whole package will cost $187 million over four years and comes out of the new spending allowance for this year’s Budget.

Some of the more complex measures will be implemented through Inland Revenue’s new IT system in 2018, but most of the changes will begin on 1 April next year.

Ladies and Gentlemen.

This is just one of the many measures you will see in the Budget on May 26.

That Budget will continue the National-led Government’s track record of responsible fiscal management.

It will contain initiatives to help build a more productive and competitive economy and to deliver better public services.

And it will show how the Government is continuing to support the rebuild of Christchurch.

Forecasts will show a growing economy, rising employment and higher wages.

New Zealand is in good shape.

The Government has a busy programme ahead of it.

Providing we stick with that programme, I’m confident we can deliver the opportunities and security New Zealanders and their families deserve.

Thank you.

Media statement

### Budget 2016: SME-friendly tax package

An SME-friendly tax package announced by the Prime Minister today will reduce compliance costs and make tax simpler for small businesses, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse say.

“The package will make paying tax easier and more certain, reduce the burden of interest and penalties, and help small businesses tailor payments to their circumstances,” Mr English says.

“We want the tax system to fit in with how businesses operate, not the other way around.”

Key measures in the proposal are that:

*   Provisional tax is being reformed, with a new pay-as-you-go option giving up to 110,000 small businesses a way to pay tax as they earn income from 1 April 2018.
*   Use-of-money interest will be eliminated or reduced for the vast majority of taxpayers.
*   Contractors will be able to choose a withholding tax rate that suits their needs, rather than one being set for them.
*   The ongoing 1 per cent monthly penalty will be scrapped from 1 April 2017 for new debt – although immediate penalties and interest charges for late payments will continue to apply.

Mr Woodhouse says the changes are part of a wider business transformation programme which will support the use of new technology to make it easier to deal with Inland Revenue.

“Around 30 to 40 per cent of businesses currently use cloud-based accounting software. This is expected to grow to 85 to 90 per cent in the next 10 years.

“This package allows small businesses to pay provisional tax through their accounting software, rather than having a separate process for their taxes.

“Small businesses are the backbone of the New Zealand economy. We want to help them spend more time focused on their business, not their taxes.”

The package is expected to cost $187 million over four years.

### General questions

#### Q Why has the Government focused on tax reform for small business?

A The reforms will benefit all businesses, however small businesses are expected to benefit to a greater degree. Research shows that the costs of complying with tax obligations are proportionately greater for smaller businesses as they often don’t have systems to deal with them efficiently. This package will reduce the compliance burden on small businesses, and enable third parties to provide innovative services to support small businesses.

#### Q Will there be further business tax reform?

A Yes. There is an on-going focus on reducing the costs of tax compliance on all businesses, including larger businesses. Reform will be more challenging for these businesses as they often have more complex tax issues and bespoke IT systems.

#### Q What is in the package for taxpayers more generally?

A While the focus is on businesses, it is important to remember that behind those businesses are people. This package of reforms provides certainty, reduces stress and makes new opportunities available for business owners to better manage their tax affairs. Further, the removal of the incremental late payment penalty will significantly help those with Working for Families debt.

#### Q Are there measures supporting larger businesses?

A Yes. All businesses, including larger businesses, paying provisional tax based on last year’s tax liability will not be charged interest before the final instalment (which is due shortly after year’s end). In addition, greater sharing of information about people who avoid their obligations will better protect successful businesses from being unfairly disadvantaged by those who do not comply.

#### Q Why is an Issues Paper being released by Inland Revenue and Treasury?

A The Issues Paper, “Making Tax Simpler - Better Business Tax”, seeks feedback on the implementation of these reforms to ensure that the policy works effectively. The paper was released on the day of the Government’s announcement, 13 April 2016, with submissions closing on the 30th of May.

#### Q How do these reforms relate to Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme?

A The business transformation programme will simplify how services are delivered and re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings. Businesses have told us they want simplicity and certainty when dealing with tax, particularly provisional tax, and for government to make it easier for them to meet their obligations. These reforms meet those needs. They will remove significant sources of stress for businesses and will reduce the time and effort they need to spend on tax, providing them with more opportunities to run and grow their businesses.

#### Q How much will the Government’s reforms cost?

A The package has an estimated total fiscal cost of $187 million over four years. The majority of these costs relate to changes in the use of money interest rules for provisional tax (this creates a one off cost due to money that would have been paid in one year being received in a later year) and the repeal of the incremental late payment penalty.

### Simplifying tax paid during the year

#### Q Why is the Government changing provisional tax?

A Being able to pay provisional tax during the year in a simple, stress-free way is a major concern for businesses of all sizes. A substantial amount of feedback was received in submissions on the Government’s Green paper about the difficulties businesses face with provisional tax. The changes being made will reduce stress for businesses around tax payment time.

#### Q Who will benefit from the changes to provisional tax?

A All taxpayers will benefit from the changes to provisional tax. For the smaller taxpayer the risk and uncertainty around the total payments required for provisional tax are substantially reduced. Larger taxpayers who commit to standard payments based on last year’s tax liability plus an uplift will also benefit from a reduction in the application of use of money interest.

#### Q What impact will the reforms have on tax pooling intermediaries?

A Taxpayers can continue to use tax pooling intermediaries to make tax payments. While Inland Revenue’s transformation programme will mean change, there will still be a role for professionals in helping businesses manage their provisional tax payments and tax payments more generally.

### Sharing information to improve markets

#### Q How will sharing tax information with the Registrar of Companies help businesses?

A Businesses will have greater confidence that they are not dealing with individuals with a track record of significant management issues. For example, Inland Revenue will share information with the Registrar where it sees a banned director still running a company.

#### Q Does sharing tax information with the Companies Office extend Inland Revenue’s role beyond tax collection?

A No. Inland Revenue will only share information it finds as part of its day to day duties. Those who commit serious offences against the Companies Act are often also a tax compliance risk, and a risk to the wider business community and their employees. Better enforcement of the Companies Act will help to maintain the integrity of the tax system. The Government considers that looking at non-compliance as a whole will achieve better outcomes for businesses and their employees.

#### Q Why is the Government providing information on significant tax debts to credit reporting firms?

A Businesses will be able to make better informed decisions about those they choose to do business with. Currently, tax debts are an invisible risk. What looks like a viable business may actually represent significant risk once tax debt is taken into account. If an indebted business fails, other businesses may be put at risk. Making significant tax debts public through credit reporting firms helps to mitigate this risk.

#### Q Is the Government introducing credit reporting of tax debt to raise more revenue?

A No. This reform is designed to protect compliant businesses from those who do not meet their obligations. The business community will have greater visibility of a previously unknown risk.

#### Q Why use credit reporting agencies?

A The Government wants to make sure that taxpayers who may be reported to credit agencies are treated professionally. Credit reporting agencies provide safeguards such as well-established processes and compliance with an industry code of practice.

### Making the system fairer

#### Q How does removing the incremental late payment penalty of 1% each month on outstanding debt help struggling businesses?

A Some businesses struggle from time to time to pay their tax. The removal of the incremental late payment penalty will help them resolve their tax debt sooner and more easily, as more of their debt repayments will go towards their outstanding tax, rather than financial penalties.

#### Q How much will the change to incremental late payment penalties cost?

A In the next four years Inland Revenue estimates it will not impose $260 million of incremental late payment penalties. Most of this would ordinarily end up being remitted and, as a result, the net effect is that $87 million of incremental late payment penalties will not be paid by already stressed and financially struggling businesses.

#### Q Why is the incremental late payment penalty being removed in stages?

A Inland Revenue’s new technology is coming on stream progressively as part of the Business Transformation programme. The removal of the incremental late payment penalty broadly matches the expected migration of products and services to the new technology, and enables the Government’s fiscal position and the need for equity for all taxpayers to be taken into account.

### Paying tax based on income to date (AIM)

#### Q What is the Accounting Income Method (AIM)?

A AIM moves tax from being an extra process to being part of the accounting work a business already does to keep on top of its finances. AIM leverages improvements in technology and software, such as cloud based accounting, to reduce compliance costs on smaller businesses.

#### Q Will AIM change the way businesses use accounting professionals?

A AIM simply uses the new opportunities technology is providing. AIM will allow accountants to reduce their focus on individual business transactions and the preparation of end of year tax accounts, and focus more on key transactions, exception management and providing business and tax advice throughout the year.

#### Q Why is AIM limited to business with under $5 million turnover?

A Above this turnover level businesses tend to have in-house professional advice and bespoke accounting systems. The Government will consider how AIM could be applied to larger businesses in future work. The Issues Paper invites submissions from larger businesses on whether they would consider using AIM.

#### Q Will Inland Revenue have access to all my business information?

A No. Inland Revenue will not be able to access your source data. A pre-agreed and transparent set of summary information will be provided to Inland Revenue when payment is made. The information is a subset of that currently provided on a business tax return. There is an opportunity to also simplify the end of year tax return for users of AIM.

#### Q Are you forcing businesses to buy expensive software?

A No. AIM will be voluntary. However, the goal of AIM is to significantly reduce compliance costs for businesses, and the Government considers it will be an attractive option. New technology is providing new options for businesses in the tax area as well as in business generally.

#### Q How was AIM developed?

A The Government has worked with key software developers, such as MYOB and Xero, to test concepts and identify opportunities. The Government would like to thank both MYOB and Xero for their support.

#### Q How did you work with Xero and MYOB?

A Their key role was helping officials understand software capabilities and identifying opportunities for reducing businesses’ compliance costs. The parties used some highly aggregated anonymous data in order to analyse the fiscal impact.

#### Q Has a commercial advantage been given to any software developers?

A No. Consistent with normal tax policy consultation processes, public consultation is taking place now that a viable approach has been identified. Nearly two years has been set aside for the development and implementation of AIM. Inland Revenue will work with all interested developers.

#### Q Is this the first step to move away from annual tax returns?

A The arrival of accounting software has meant that businesses have access to updated accounting information throughout the year. This created the opportunity for AIM by providing opportunities to review traditional year-end activities. The Government will consider further reform in this area in the future.

#### Q What public consultation have you done?

A Inland Revenue has followed its standard practice of consulting with small groups of relevant stakeholders in the development of any policy. The reforms contained in this package are now available to the wider public to provide comment on. Submissions can be made to Inland Revenue until 30 May 2016. Final policy decisions on these reforms will be made after submissions are received.

#### Q Why is the online forum only consulting about AIM?

A AIM is the most technical measure in the package, and Inland Revenue and Treasury are seeking more detailed information about how it should work to ensure that it is implemented effectively. AIM needs to closely align with current accounting practices so that it can be easily integrated into natural business processes.

### Paying tax as agent

#### Q What are the benefits of paying tax as an agent?

A A number of shareholder-employees will be able to remove themselves from provisional tax if they choose to. It will not be compulsory. Like other provisional tax methods, most shareholder-employees (alongside their companies) can choose to use this method if it suits them.

#### Q Will this be compulsory?

A No. Taxpayers will be able to choose to use this option where their circumstances suit one entity paying tax on behalf of shareholder-employees.

#### Q Is this method too complex?

A This creates an opportunity for a number of shareholder-employees to remove themselves from provisional tax. However, some rules and safeguards are necessary to ensure that those who use this method don’t gain an unfair advantage.

#### Q Can it be extended to more income and entities?

A Extending the paying as agent option to other types of shareholder income including rent and interest and to other types of entities such as partnerships could be looked at in the future if taxpayers see this as a benefit. At this stage it will only be introduced for the largest group of shareholder payments (shareholder-employee salaries).

### Self-management and integrity for contractors

#### Q Why have you extended withholding tax to cover labour hire firms?

A The current withholding tax rules for contractors have not been comprehensively reviewed since 1979. Growth in labour-hire firms since then has been significant and the withholding rules have not kept pace. Inland Revenue has identified issues with contractors working in this industry, including their relatively higher compliance costs and areas of non-compliance.

#### Q How does this affect contractors?

A The current withholding tax rules for contractors require a fixed, flat rate of withholding. This will often not accurately match their actual income tax liability. Contractors are better placed to know what the right withholding rate for them is as they will have better information about their income and expenses. This measure provides greater flexibility for contractors and allows them to pick the withholding rate that works for them.

#### Q Is there a risk that contractors will simply not pay their tax?

A No. A minimum withholding rate will be required and Inland Revenue will be able to prescribe a rate if a contractor is non-compliant.

#### Q Why do labour-hire firms have to withhold tax on payments made to companies?

A The use of a company structure should be made for business rather than tax reasons.  Contractors working through companies should have similar rules applied to them as contractors who don’t work through companies. The ability for companies to choose their own withholding rate provides flexibility and reduces the risk of over-deduction of tax.

#### Q Do other countries have a withholding tax for those earning income through labour hire firms?

A Yes. Australia currently requires withholding on contractors working through labour-hire firms. The rules are based on those in force in Australia.

#### Q Does this measure apply to clerical/management type work?

A Yes. This applies to all labour-hire firms regardless of the industry they work in.

### Before and after examples

#### Simplifying tax paid during the year

##### Increasing the current residual income tax limit before use of money interest is imposed from $50,000 to $60,000, and extending it to non- individual taxpayers

Stanchion Tech Ltd (Stanchion) is a small company that makes modelling software to calculate the load bearing potential of different kinds of foundations. They pay provisional tax on the standard method (last year’s tax bill plus 5%) and their business is growing.

Stanchion employs an accountant at the end of the year to file their tax return but do not have time to calculate what their tax is likely to be during the year. Instead they simply pay what is required for their provisional tax on each of the three instalments.

Before

Because Stanchion is a company they are liable for use of money interest if the amount they pay through their provisional tax is not enough to cover their end of year tax bill for 2016. This year their provisional tax assessment was $30,000 and they made the following payments, which were all on time:

*   $10,000 on 28 August 2015
*   $10,000 on 15 January 2016
*   $10,000 on 7 May 2016.

When the accountant files their tax return they find that their residual income tax bill is $45,000 which means that have another $15,000 to pay. This amount isn’t due until their terminal tax due date (7 April 2017) however use of money interest is charged and backdated to the three provisional instalment dates:

*   $5,000 from 28 August 2015
*   a further $5,000 from 15 January 2016
*   a final $5,000 from 7 May 2016.

Use of money interest continues to accrue from those dates until the full amount is paid.

After

Under the existing rules if Stanchion did not pay the remaining $15,000 until 7 April 2017, when it is due, they would be charged $1,727.85 in use of money interest.

Under the proposal Stanchion would not be charged any use of money interest.

Impact

Taxpayers who have residual income tax of less than $60,000 and who use the standard method can pay their provisional tax instalments and do not have to worry about being charged use of money interest if their instalments are less than their end of year bill.

##### Removing use of money interest for the first two provisional tax instalments for all taxpayers who use the standard method to calculate and pay provisional tax

Enterprise Revolution Ltd (Enterprise) is a large company that provides consulting, project management and strategic services. They pay provisional tax on the standard method (last year’s tax bill plus 5%) and their business is growing.

Enterprise has a finance team that tracks the company’s expected residual income tax for the year; however their income fluctuates during the year.

In the 2016 tax year, Enterprise competed for and successfully won a large contract in February 2016. This contract included a substantial payment that dramatically increased their expected profits.

Before

Because Enterprise is a company they are liable for use of money interest if the amount they pay through their provisional tax is not enough to cover their end of year tax bill for 2016. This year their provisional tax assessment was $120,000 and they made the following payments, which were all on time:

*   $40,000 on 28 August 2015
*   $40,000 on 15 January 2016
*   $40,000 on 7 May 2016.

When Enterprise files their tax return they find that their residual income tax bill is $180,000 which means that they have another $60,000 to pay. This amount isn’t due until their terminal tax due date (7 April 2017) however use of money interest is charged and backdated to the three provisional instalment dates:

*   $20,000 from 28 August 2015
*   a further $20,000 from 15 January 2016
*   a final $20,000 from 7 May 2016.

Use of money interest continues to accrue from those dates until the full amount is paid.

After

Under the existing rules if Enterprise did not pay the remaining $60,000 until 7 April 2017, when it is due, they would be charged $6,911.34 in use of money interest.  If instead they paid the $60,000 with their third provisional tax instalment payment on 7 May 2015 they would still be charged $1,845.04.

Under the proposal Enterprise would be charged $5,066.30 in use of money interest if they made their payment on 7 April (a saving of $1,845.04 over the current rules).  If instead they paid the $60,000 with their third provisional tax instalment payment on 7 May 2015 they would not be charged any use of money interest

Impact

Taxpayers with residual income tax of more than $60,000 and who use the standard method will be able to factor in any unexpected increases in profit when they make their final provisional tax payment and thereby reduce or eliminate use of money interest charges.

#### Paying tax based on income to date

##### Introducing a new method for taxpayers with a turnover of $5 million or less that uses accounting results to determine provisional tax payments (to be known as the “Accounting Income Method” or AIM)

Hollyhocks Piggery Ltd (Hollyhocks) is a small farming business that raises, butchers and smokes their own pigs. Lisa owns Hollyhocks and doesn’t like spending time thinking about tax. She uses an accounting software package and has an accountant file her return at the end of the year.

Hollyhocks pay provisional tax on the standard method in three instalments.

Before

Hollyhocks would be required to pay their provisional tax in three equal instalments on 27 August, 15 January and 7 May. Lisa finds this frustrating as most of the farm’s income is received around the Christmas period and she doesn’t understand why she is asked to pay tax during periods that the farm isn’t earning income.

Lisa is also unhappy that when the business does well she is faced with an end of year tax bill – she would rather have it sorted out during the year, preferably when the money is coming in.

After

Lisa decides to use the Accounting Income Method which calculates her provisional tax instalments based on her actual profit and loss. While she now calculates her tax payments every two-months, she only needs to pay tax when Hollyhocks is earning income. Her accounting software helps her calculate how much tax is due each period.

When the accountant files the return at the end of the year there is very little, if any, additional tax to pay as her accounting software has already factored in all of the income Hollyhocks has earned during the year.

Impact

Taxpayers who use the accounting income method can pay their provisional tax as their business earns income, even if that income is irregular or seasonal. When their end of year return is filed there will only be a small difference between what has been paid and their residual income tax.

#### Paying tax as agent

##### Allowing a closely held entity to pay provisional tax as agent of the shareholders, and removing them from provisional tax

Autoshop Services 2014 Ltd (Autoshop) is a family business of panel beaters comprising Darren Hemopo and his two daughters Tanya and Cheryl who are all co-owners of the company. The company is successful and the Hemopo family work full time for the business.

In the 2016 tax year Autoshop makes a profit of $180,000. This profit is split equally between Darren, Tanya and Cheryl as an untaxed shareholder salary.

Before

The income allocated to the three shareholders is untaxed. This means that Darren, Tanya and Cheryl all become provisional taxpayers and each of them needs to make three instalment payments during the year.

After

Autoshop is able to pay provisional tax on behalf of the three shareholders. When the income is allocated to Darren, Tanya and Cheryl it comes with a tax credit which means they do not need to pay provisional tax in their own right.

Impact

Shareholder-employees will be able to elect to have the company they own pay provisional tax on their behalf. This could mean that the total number of people having to pay provisional tax will reduce as one company makes payments for several shareholders.

#### Self-management and integrity for contractors

##### Allowing contractors to select their own withholding rate

Salesi and Tepora both work as contractors for a number of New Zealand television production companies.

Salesi works as a set designer and does not have many expenses.

Tepora works in post-production as a visual effects artist and has high expenses as she has invested in the hardware and software needed to do her job.

Before

As contractors in the television production industry, both Salesi and Tepora are subject to a withholding tax of 20% on their gross payments.

Salesi’s income after his expenses is very similar to his gross income. The 20% withholding tax does not cover his end of year tax bill entirely and he has to make provisional tax payments during the year to cover the shortfall. He does not like this as he would rather have everything deducted at source.

Tepora’s income after her expenses is much lower than her gross income. The 20% withholding rate is more than enough to cover her end of year tax bill and she has a large tax refund when she files her return. She does not like this as she would rather pay the right amount of tax during the year.

Both Salesi and Tepora could apply to Inland Revenue for a special rate however if this rate needed to change during the year (because their income or expenses changed from what they had estimated) they would need to reapply.

After

Salesi and Tepora can both tell the companies they contract with to deduct a higher (for Salesi) or lower (for Tepora) rate of tax. This means that they do not have a tax bill or a tax refund at the end of the year. For Salesi this means he does not need to pay provisional tax; for Tepora this means she does not need to wait for a refund.

Impact

Contractors have more flexibility to manage their tax affairs during the year based on their individual circumstances and can do so without needing to apply to Inland Revenue.

#### Extending the withholding rules to cover labour-hire firms

Simon works as a contractor through a labour hire firm. This means the businesses that he works for pay the labour-hire firm who deduct a fee and then pay the remainder to Simon.

Before

Under the withholding rules the business paying Simon’s invoices is not required to deduct any withholding tax as his services are being supplied via the labour-hire firm. This not only means that no tax is deducted, but also that there is no reporting to Inland Revenue of how much income Simon has been paid.

If Simon is a compliant taxpayer then he will declare the income and will likely pay provisional tax over three instalments.

However if Simon is non-compliant he may suppress some or all of his income and avoid paying tax. He may then also seek to access income related payments such as Working for Families or benefits. He may also avoid paying any child support obligations he has for children no longer in his care.

After

The labour-hire firm is required to deduct withholding tax from Simon’s contracting income before it is passed on to him. They pay this to Inland Revenue and report how much income has been earned and how much tax has been withheld through the existing employer monthly schedule.

Simon’s income is now part of his account and will be automatically included in any assessments made.

Similar to allowing contractors to select their own rates, Simon will be able to select a withholding rate that best meets his individual circumstances.

#### Sharing information to improve markets

Disclosure of significant tax debt to credit reporting agencies and sharing information regarding serious offences with the Companies Office

Timbernail Importers 2002 Ltd (Timbernail) supplies the building industry with building supplies and machinery. They are approached by Nine Inch Screws 2004 Ltd (Screws) who wants to enter into a long term supply agreement and set up a line of credit.  
Before entering into the agreement Timbernail wants assurance that Screws is not a credit risk and seeks a credit report from one  
of the credit reporting agencies.

Before

Unbeknownst to Timbernails, Screws has accumulated several hundred thousand dollars of debt with Inland Revenue. When the credit report is provided there is no record of the tax debt as the tax secrecy laws prevent Inland Revenue from disclosing this information. There is a risk for Timbernails that this tax debt may cause Screws to default on any credit agreement.

In addition the Director of Screws has previously been prosecuted under the Companies Act and has subsequently been banned as a director. Inland Revenue are aware of this after it came to light during a recent audit. However the department is unable to bring this to the attention of the Companies office due to the secrecy laws.

After

Once Inland Revenue discovers that the Director of Screws has previously been banned they advise the Companies Office who can then instigate proceedings. This helps to ensure that people who shouldn’t be running businesses are not able to.

Inland Revenue also notifies credit reporting agencies if Screws debt and compliance behaviour meet a certain standard.

Impact

The Companies Office will be better able to act against people who have committed serious offices against the Companies Act or have been banned from acting as a Director. This will reduce the risk of businesses entering into agreements with businesses that are potentially being mismanaged.

Businesses will be able to make better decisions when entering into credit or lending agreements with other taxpayers as significant tax debts will be disclosed to credit reporting agencies.

### Tax Bill to improve, strengthen tax rules

A wide-ranging tax Bill introduced today proposes technical changes to improve, strengthen and update our tax rules so they continue to work well for taxpayers, says Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse.

“The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill continues the Government’s work in making sure our tax system remains fit for purpose,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“Changes in the economic environment and business practices can result in unintended consequences such as unfairness, inefficiencies, complexities or uncertainty for taxpayers.

“That is why it is vital to ensure that tax rules continue to be responsive to change, work well in practice and that compliance costs are minimised.”

The first suite of measures in the Bill proposes changes to the ‘look-through’ company rules and the dividend rules as they apply to closely held companies.

These measures aim to simplify the current rules to reduce compliance costs and ensure that the rules remain robust and true to their intended purpose.

“While closely held companies typically have just a few shareholders, they are also a significant proportion of the total number of companies in New Zealand.  It is important that the tax rules apply as intended and that the decision to convert a small business to a company is not driven by tax considerations,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The result will be a much more workable set of rules.”

The second suite of measures in the Bill proposes changes to bolster the rules around the tax treatment of interest earned in New Zealand by non-residents.  Proposed changes to the non-resident withholding tax rules (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL) rules will ensure the rules apply consistently.

The third suite of measures proposes various changes to the GST rules to ensure the rules continue to work as intended.  They include taxpayer-friendly changes such as enabling businesses to deduct GST associated with the costs of raising capital, and allowing partially exempt businesses to use an alternative apportionment method.

The Bill also adds 14 charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 and sets the annual rates of income tax for the 2016–17 tax year.  The new charitable organisations to be added to schedule 32 can be found at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](#schedule-32)

### Govt releases foreign trusts inquiry and steps to strengthen international tax rules

The Government today released tax expert John Shewan’s independent Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, and the steps it is taking to strengthen tax rules as part of its work with the OECD to clamp down on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

Mr Shewan’s inquiry noted that foreign trusts are legitimate vehicles and that New Zealand’s tax treatment of foreign trusts is appropriate. However, it also recommends disclosure arrangements should be strengthened, including by:

*   Strengthening the initial registration requirements for foreign trusts, and allowing regulatory agencies to search the register.
*   Requiring foreign trusts to file an annual return, including their financial statements and details of distributions.

It also recommended a number of changes to anti-money laundering rules.

“I want to thank Mr Shewan for conducting such a thorough investigation into foreign trusts. His recommendations look sensible and well-reasoned and, as we’ve always said, we are open to making improvements to New Zealand’s already strong tax settings,” Finance Minister Bill English says.

“The Government will look to implement the recommendations after officials have examined the inquiry in detail and reported back to Ministers. A formal response to the Inquiry will therefore be issued in the coming weeks.”

Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse says that improvements to foreign trust disclosure rules are part of a significant work programme to strengthen New Zealand’s tax laws and keep them in line with international best practice.

“New Zealand has been working intensively with the OECD to develop a global response to BEPS tax strategies, which allow multi-nationals to pay little or no tax by exploiting discrepancies in different countries’ tax rules and shift profits to places where tax rates are lower.”

In October the OECD set out an [international action plan](http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-2015-final-reports.htm)
 to help address this.

“The Government is today releasing the changes New Zealand will make to address profit shifting, based on the OECD action plan, as well as the significant steps we have already taken as part of this global effort,” Mr English says.

Mr Woodhouse says a lot of work has already gone into strengthening New Zealand’s tax rules – meaning that many of the OECD’s recommendations are already implemented.

“Our tax settings are already sound, but there is always room to improve,” he says.

“We have already strengthened our controlled foreign company rules, thin capitalisation rules, bank minimum equity rules, and, more recently, I introduced legislation to improve our non-resident withholding tax rules.

“The next steps include stronger rules preventing excessive payments from a New Zealand company to its foreign parent, greater disclosure requirements for multi-nationals, and further sharing of tax data with foreign authorities.”

Mr English says stopping illegitimate profit shifting is a global issue.

“The BEPS problem stems from mismatched legislation between countries – which is why we are working with the OECD towards a coordinated, global solution,” he says.

### Government to adopt Shewan recommendations

The Government is acting on all recommendations from the Shewan Inquiry into foreign trust disclosure rules, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse announced today.

The Inquiry made a number of recommendations which propose improvements to registration and disclosure of information, anti-money laundering rules and increased information sharing between government agencies.

“The Government has always been open to making improvements to New Zealand’s already strong tax settings if that was warranted,” Mr English says.

“The Shewan Inquiry’s recommendations are sensible and well-reasoned and by acting on all of them, we will ensure that our foreign trust disclosure rules are strengthened and New Zealand’s reputation is protected.

“The changes to the foreign trust rules are a matter that the Government intends to move quickly on.

“The Government intends to introduce legislation to require a register that is searchable by Internal Affairs and the Police, and annual disclosure requirements in the coming months.”

Mr Woodhouse says that while the Government agrees with all of the recommendations from the Shewan inquiry, the way in which a small number are implemented will be tweaked.

“We have already committed to a course of action for strengthening New Zealand’s anti-money laundering rules, which will bring in more comprehensive requirements for lawyers, accountants, real estate agents and others,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“For example, lawyers and accountants will be included in AML/CFT requirements as soon as practicable, However due to issues around legal privilege and regime supervision this will form part of the more substantial AML/CFT reform programme already underway, which is being expedited.”

For discretionary trusts, 1- any class of beneficiary not listed on the trust deed must be listed, and 2- each class of beneficiary be described in sufficient detail to enable identity to be established at the time of a distribution or when vested rights are exercised (the naming of discretionary beneficiaries being impractical). The trust deed be required to be filed with the registration form. Agree Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 2 Issue Inquiry’s recommendation Government’s response When will the proposal be actioned? Sanction for non-compliance: when worldwide income of foreign trust is taxable The exemption from New Zealand tax on foreign source income apply only to a foreign trust that has registered and fulfilled the associated disclosure obligations at that time. Agree, with modification. The exemption will still be available if the non- registration or lack of disclosure was unintentional and remedied immediately. Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 Annual returns Foreign trusts be required to file an annual return with IRD that includes:- • any changes to the information provided at registration • the trust’s annual financial statements • the amount of any distributions paid or credited and the names, foreign address, Tax Identification Number and country of tax residence of the recipient beneficiaries. Agree, with modification. 1. Annual returns will also include the amount of any settlements on the trust in the relevant period and the names, foreign address, TIN and country of tax residence of that settlor. 2. The balance date will be 31 March or a date nominated by the trust. The trust should have 3 months after their balance date to file. Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 Application date of new annual return requirements The annual return requirement to apply to foreign trusts formed after the enactment date and to all foreign trusts from the income year commencing 1 April 2017. Agree Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 Grace period for new migrants No recommendation There will be a grace period of the same time (2 years) before a trustee who is a new migrant individual and who is not in the business of providing trustee services is required to register or file. Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 Sanction for non-compliance: Safe harbour for qualifying resident foreign trustees The basis for foreign trusts that have a qualifying resident foreign trustee being exposed to lesser sanctions than other foreign trusts (“the qualifying resident foreign trustee safe harbour”) be reviewed to determine whether it should remain. Agree. Officials have reviewed this issue and the safe-harbour for qualifying resident foreign trustees will be removed. Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 Registration and annual filing fee Foreign trusts be required to pay a registration and annual filing fee to recover the costs to the Crown of administering the foreign trust regime. The Inquiry considers a fee of $500 at registration and an annual fee of the same amount would be reasonable. Agree, with modification. The registration fee will be $270 with an annual filing fee of $50, because of the cost to the Crown of administering the foreign trust regime. The level of fees will be able to be modified by Order in Council to reflect future changes in costs. Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 3 Issue Inquiry’s recommendation Government’s response When will the proposal be actioned? AML: Early revocation of current exemption for lawyers and accountants from AML/CFT reporting requirements For services provided to foreign trusts, consideration be given to the removal by Order in Council in the short term (prior to 31 December 2016) of the regulation that excludes lawyers and accountants from AML reporting requirements. The proposed removal of this exclusion when phase 2 of the AML regime is implemented, as announced by the Government in May 2016, will address this recommendation but may not be effective until towards the end of 2017 or later. Lawyers and accountants will be included in AML/CFT requirements as soon as practicable, but there are issues surrounding legal privilege and regime supervision that can only be dealt with through primary legislation and not regulation. Removal of the exclusion for lawyers and accountants will therefore be progressed as part of the more substantial AML/CFT reform programme underway. The revocation of the exemption will occur as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. Legislation will be introduced later in 2016, and is expected to be passed in the first half of 2017. AML: Mandatory requirement to verify in all cases the underlying source of funds The AML legislation or regulations be revised to include a mandatory requirement to verify in all cases the underlying source of funds or wealth settled on a foreign trust. Agree Consider as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. AML: guidelines for customer due diligence Expanded guidelines be issued explaining the scope of customer due diligence required in establishing and verifying beneficial ownership, effective control and source of funds in complex multi-layered trust structures. These should include a series of detailed worked examples. Agree Currently drafting. Note impact of FATF and the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. AML: Suspicious transaction reporting not through a New Zealand bank The legislation or regulations that govern suspicious transaction reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police be revised to facilitate the reporting of actual or proposed transactions that have not or will not necessarily go through a New Zealand bank. Agree Consider as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. AML: Greater profile for suspicious transaction reporting Greater profile, coupled with training recommendations, be given to the obligation on trust service providers to report suspicious transactions. Agree On-going 4 Issue Inquiry’s recommendation Government’s response When will the proposal be actioned? Review of current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between New Zealand government agencies A review be undertaken of the current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between the three agencies (IRD, Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police and Department of Internal Affairs) with supervisory responsibility for disclosures by foreign trusts (and other entities). The purpose of the review, which could coincide with the introduction of phase 2 of the AML regime, would be to determine the financial and efficiency gains and other implications (including secrecy considerations) of sharing strategic intelligence and other information between agencies. Agree. Note that it may be appropriate to also include other relevant agencies in the review. No immediate legislative change required. This review to be undertaken after the initial changes to the disclosure rules have bedded in and possibly coincide with phase 2 of the AML regime/ reform of tax secrecy rules. 5

### Speech to the NZ Payroll Practitioners Conference announcing changes to PAYE processing

Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. This is my first address to you as Revenue Minister and it’s a great opportunity to meet some of the people who help implement government policies.

As the people who ensure that wages are paid correctly and on time, you are a very important group for the government and for the economy. A lot rides on you being able to do your jobs accurately and efficiently.

So I’d like to spend a bit of time today telling you about how the Government aims to help you in your important work.

I’d like to build on what my predecessor, Todd McClay said to you last year about the Government’s major modernisation of tax administration called Business Transformation.

At that time he outlined some of the main points of proposals in a consultation document released for public feedback aimed at making tax a less onerous part of the payroll process.

The proposals focussed not on what you do for PAYE, but how you do it – process improvements. Tax is just one component of your role, but we can make that part as simple as possible by taking advantage of technological advances. Technological advances that many, if not most businesses are already using every day in their normal day to day business operations.

The Government’s objective is for businesses to spend more of their time focusing on growing their business rather than fulfilling tax requirements. The key to this is smarter use of software — integrating the tax process into your normal day-to-day business operations.

What we are aiming to do is to further integrate the tax process into your normal operations. We’re already well down the track with GST.

We know from a recent survey that people who use accounting software to prepare and send their GST returns to Inland Revenue are experiencing a significant compliance cost reduction. This is a pretty strong indication to me that integrating tax processes into normal business processes is the way to go and the Government wants to achieve those benefits for employers.

It was on this basis that the Government issued those proposals last year for public feedback. I’d like to thank all those who provided feedback on the proposals. There were over 1000 online comments received as well as 87 written submissions.

That feedback has helped shape the Government’s decisions and it gives me great pleasure to announce those decisions to you here today.

The thinking behind the main proposals I’m announcing today can be explained pretty simply:

*   Employers currently pay their employees on a timetable that suits their business, so let’s make the PAYE information part of that rather than making it a separate process to suit IRD’s timetable.
*   Employers are already using software for their payroll, so let’s give the employer more value out of their system by enabling the software to do more

I’ll give you some of the highlights of the finalised recommendations that will go into a tax bill to be introduced next year, as well as update you on some of the proposals that didn’t make the final cut because of public feedback.

Of course this remains subject to the parliamentary process, so at this stage, they remain as proposals, but my intention today is to provide employers and their software developers with a good indication of the shape of upcoming changes.

Firstly, we’re proposing that from 1 April 2019 businesses will begin payday reporting of PAYE information.

You’re already in the system at that point managing the payroll so why not integrate the next step, the provision of PAYE information to Inland Revenue, and do it all at once?

Making the filing of PAYE information part of the sequence will help to make providing PAYE information less time consuming and therefore less costly for employers. It also has wider benefits for the community. Providing that information at that time will help provide the IRD with better information which they can use to improve how they administer things such as Working for Families, child support and student loans.

This will help get employees on the right deduction to ensure that people get the benefits they should and their liabilities are calculated correctly.

The intention is that PAYE information from employers who are over the electronic filing threshold, payroll intermediaries and small employers using payroll software would be required as close as possible to payday.

Details as to precisely when payday information will be required are still being worked through but it is likely to be to be around two working days.

Although the proposal is that payday reporting of PAYE information will be required from 1 April 2019, Inland Revenue is working on providing payday reporting for early adopters who are keen to use the system sooner.

The changes from Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation will open up a fully digital system for those who want to eliminate paper interactions with Inland Revenue.

You will also have better access to your already filed information and better processes for error correction and adjustments.

Another proposal we asked you for feedback on was paying PAYE at the same time you pay your staff.

While some commented that paying PAYE as well as filing PAYE information at the one time would reduce compliance costs, a number of businesses were concerned about cash flow.

Following this feedback, the Government has decided not to require employers to pay their PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue on payday. If employers want to take advantage of doing everything at the same time including paying Inland Revenue on payday they will be able to do so.

However the current payment obligations, either twice monthly for the largest employers and payroll intermediaries or monthly for the rest, will remain the same.

A number of small businesses voiced their concern about all employers being required to use payroll software. We agree with those concerns.

The objective is to help businesses and if a business is not currently using payroll software, then we’re not going to require them to invest in such technology.

But we do believe that we can offer an improvement on traditional paper filing, so employers who don’t want to use software will be able to file their PAYE information through the Inland Revenue website, using an improved version of myIR.

And of course the smallest organisations will still be able to file their PAYE information on paper if they prefer.

Payday information from small employers not using payroll software will have a due date of 7 working days after payday.

All of what I have outlined for you is representative of how business practices have changed. Less than twenty years ago, electronic filing was largely the domain of large employers. That’s no longer true.

In 1999, a threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT was set for electronic filing. That hasn’t changed since, but business practices certainly have.

Today, most organisations are connected to the internet and do their banking or find a phone number or a multitude of other normal business activities online.

So in keeping with current business practice, we are proposing to reduce that threshold to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT from 1 April 2019.

The new thresholds exempt the smallest organisations but will require an employer with four full time employees at the average wage or ten at the minimum wage to file through Inland Revenue’s website or through payroll software.

There will be an exemption from electronic filing for any employers who cannot access digital services.

And in line with the more widespread use of electronic services, the Government has also decided to end the current payroll subsidy from 1 April 2018.

In the early days of electronic filing, the subsidy helped improve the quality of PAYE information transmitted to the IRD, by encouraging employers to use listed payroll intermediaries. But time and technological advances have overtaken the subsidy and we believe there is no longer a case to subsidise one type of payroll service over others.

The Government has also decided to make some minor changes affecting the calculation of PAYE and related deductions and contributions, with effect from 1 April 2018.

For the purposes of calculating PAYE deductions, employers will be given the option to treat holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates, rather than treating the payment as an extra pay.

Several submitters wanted employers to be able to use this more accurate withholding method. While the Government has agreed to allow employers to use this method, we are not making it mandatory due to concerns that it may increase compliance costs for employers without payroll software.

To reduce complexity and confusion for employers, the rules in tax legislation about how legislated rates or threshold changes are applied will be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related initiatives such as KiwiSaver contributions and student loan deductions.

The rates and thresholds to be applied will be those in force on the date the payment is made. This alignment of the rules will simplify the transitional process for employers when a legislated rate or threshold change occurs.

So, these are the main PAYE proposals arising from last year’s public consultation which will be included in a Bill that I intend on introducing in the House early next year.

What I’ve outlined today is intended to help make the PAYE component of your jobs a little easier and a little smoother.

In doing that it also helps businesses by making their processes a little less costly and helps individuals by helping to make their tax affairs more accurate as well as any child support, KiwiSaver and student loans deductions.

The finalised proposals were shaped thanks to the many people, including many of you here today, who took the time to consider the proposals and provide expert advice on how to make the proposals work better.

Thank you again for that, and for inviting me to speak to you today. Keep up the great work.

Speech

### Opening Address to the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand annual conference

Thank you for inviting me to give the opening address today.

Your organisation plays an influential role on New Zealand’s tax policy settings through your input into the work programme and through your submissions to public consultation so I value the opportunity to come and speak to you all.

Today I would like to share with you some of the main points contained in the recently updated tax policy work programme.

The work programme has been agreed to by Cabinet as the Government’s tax focus to the end of 2017.

What I am going to discuss today is not a completely new work programme, but an update to take into account recent developments and to ensure that tax policy officials are working on the highest priority items for the remaining period of the programme to the end of 2017.

As always, this iteration of the policy work programme has not been developed in isolation.

Various items originated with the private sector.

I appreciate the input that CA ANZ has provided to Inland Revenue, including advice on the work programme on items of highest concern to you and those you represent.

While it is not possible to include all of the issues you have raised on the work programme, we are listening and some of those issues are planned to be addressed in the busy period ahead.

I appreciate the commitment that your organisation has demonstrated towards maintaining and improving New Zealand’s tax policies.

It is this commitment that has contributed to New Zealand having an effective and well regarded tax system.

However, I am aware that the number of different measures that are being consulted on as well as limited times to respond creates real pressures.

In the busy upcoming months I will be asking Inland Revenue officials to, as much as is reasonably possible, communicate and sequence consultation to spread this workload.

To help you plan, the tax policy website will show details of the work programme and will include a calendar of 2017 indicating general timings.

Of course sometimes it is simply not feasible to conduct full consultation.

For instance, it would not be possible to move quickly to close a recently identified loophole and, at the same time engage in wide consultation to address that loophole.

But the Government remains completely committed to GTPP because it is very important and strive as much as possible to maintain open dialogue for our mutual benefit.

Good consultation involves officials and the tax community being prepared to listen to each other.

It involves officials explaining reasons for possible changes and listening to concerns and suggestions for improvement.

At the end of the day, even the best consultation will not necessarily lead to agreement on everything.

It will however, expose reasons for disagreement and make sure that final decisions are well informed.

And GTPP is a vital part of developing good tax policy by allowing frank dialogue between government and the private sector.

That dialogue is essential in running our tax system which collects the revenue needed while minimising the effect on business.

In part, this is a function of the GTPP consultation process. But another key reason is our clear and coherent broad-base, low-rate tax settings.

New Zealand taxes a very broad definition of consumption under its GST and a very broad definition of income under its company and personal income taxes.

It helps in ensuring that people are not discouraged from making sensible decisions working longer or harder or about upskilling or taking on higher pay but more demanding jobs.

A broad base also helps the tax system to be as fair as possible and minimise the chance that the well advised can step around the tax system and obtain a tax break that is not intended.

And keeping taxes broad, also allows tax rates to be kept as low as possible, promoting fairness, efficiency and economic growth.

It is important that we maintain our BBLR framework to minimise pressure for increasing tax rates or the introduction of new but inefficient taxes.

In recent times there have been some significant pieces of work in this area.

On 1 October new rules for applying GST to cross border services including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from overseas websites came into effect.

I understand that so far there have been over 80 offshore suppliers of remote services register for GST.

This is the latest evolution of our broad-based tax and is an example of the government working with the private sector to produce sound tax policy which is fair for all.

Similarly, changes are before Parliament that will assist closely held companies. These include simplifying the look through company rules and a number of changes to the dividend rules.

Generally, some matters in the work programme are raised by the private sector.

A number of taxpayers for instance, have raised concerns about how the current dividend rules can apply to demergers by Australian-listed companies.

The Government tends to agree with that view.

I’m sure you are all familiar with the issue, but in brief, demergers involve the division of a corporate group rather than a distribution of income – a shareholder’s economic ownership does not change.

Demergers, which do not involve the distribution of income to shareholders, should not in principle give rise to a dividend for tax purposes.

Although the current dividend tax treatment raises issues for all demergers, in practice problems mainly arise with demergers by Australian-listed companies.

That is why we will be introducing an exclusion from the dividend taxation rules for certain demergers by Australian listed companies.

The main benefit of the proposal is to prevent the inappropriate taxation of New Zealand shareholders in Australian listed companies that are involved in a demerger.

I have asked that this item be fast-tracked and officials will consult with stakeholders on the detail of the proposed amendment before its introduction in the tax bill scheduled for introduction early next year.

Also in that bill will be something else raised by the private sector.

Two recent High Court cases on the application of the voting interest test for corporate trustees could result in overreach when it comes to measuring the ownership of companies including their association.

This overreach is a particular problem for professional firms including accountants who are acting as independent trustees for their clients’ companies.

We are proposing to reinstate the previous policy position to ensure these companies are not associated.

Officials are planning to consult with stakeholders shortly on these proposals.

Moving onto the second major theme of work, international taxation issues have also been a recurring feature in tax policy work programmes over the years and we have already made considerable progress.

I think that it places us ahead of the game in some key areas.

We’ve progressively tightened our thin capitalisation rules and non-resident withholding tax rules and introduced minimum bank equity rules.

New Zealand has signed an agreement for increased sharing of information between revenue authorities — the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports.

It’s one of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan recommendations.

So countering BEPS strategies is not a new-found enthusiasm for the Government.

It’s something we’ve been working away at steadily to strengthen.

While we are starting from a very strong position in comparison with a number of other countries, we still have work to do in this area and I will just run you through some of those.

New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation was first introduced 21 years ago and at the time was fit for purpose. It was needed to protect our tax base and ensure any payments between associated entities are at an arm’s length rate.

While I believe our transfer pricing rules are robust, there’s no denying that the ground has shifted somewhat with practices having evolved since then. That is why it’s important to take another look and see whether our rules can be made even stronger.

The OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines are now considered to be the benchmark and will prevent companies reducing their tax by using artificial transactions between associated parties which would not normally occur between third parties.

Transfer prices and conditions that don’t align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities will be modified by the rules.

Another area of work relates to the question of permanent establishments.

For cross-border transactions, our basis for taxing activity occurring here, like those of tax jurisdictions around the world, depends on whether the company has a physical presence here.

We are aware of some multinationals that try to structure their affairs so they do not have taxable presence in New Zealand, despite being involved in significant economic activity here.

Engaging in disputes with multinationals can be a long and protracted affair – not a good use of taxpayer dollars.

Instead we are considering measures that will make it harder for multinationals to avoid having a taxable presence in New Zealand if they are involved in significant economic activity here.

We are also looking at measures to make it easier to assess and collect tax from multinationals that do not cooperate with Inland Revenue.

We are also closely watching what Australia and the UK are doing in regards to Diverted Profits Tax. Officials have provided some advice to the Government and we will look to say more on this in the near future.

One of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another is by loading a foreign-owned firm with excessive debt.

New Zealand has thin capitalisation rules that limit the amount of debt foreign-owned firms can have in New Zealand.

Overall, I consider that our rules are serving us well. However, a small number of foreign-owned firms appear able to take excessively high interest deductions.

For example, the interest rates on some related-party loans appear to be unreasonably high.

We are therefore considering measures that would bolster our rules, to ensure that foreign-owned firms cannot shift excessive profits out of New Zealand using debt.

I expect to release proposals on these matters early in the new year. I acknowledge the extra effort it will place on you, but I am intending to release these as a single package so that the various aspects can be viewed together as a cohesive whole.

Another part of the OECD/G20 project on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) involves a series of recommendations made in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements.

The Government believes that the problem of hybrid mismatches requires a globally co-ordinated response.

For this reason, the Government released its discussion document on hybrids in September proposing that New Zealand adopt the OECD BEPS recommendations on hybrid mismatches.

We are closely monitoring the progress of the UK and Australia in this area, as well as the developing EU approach to hybrid mismatches.

Officials will consider carefully the submissions that have come in and we expect to take further steps in this area next year.

The last thing I want to mention with regard to international tax issues is the fact that many BEPS techniques rely on abuse of tax treaties, so the BEPS Action Plan recommended a number of changes to strengthen them.

It would be very time consuming for individual countries to implement these amendments on a treaty-by-treaty basis, so the OECD has developed a multilateral tax treaty that will amend a worldwide network of several thousand bilateral tax treaties all at once.

Ninety-six countries (including New Zealand) have been involved in the development of the multilateral instrument and we expect to be able to sign it next year.

The final major strand of work in the work programme is of course the Government’s modernisation programme of tax administration.

In the business transformation work, the Government is continuing to progress the business tax package announced in Budget 2016.

One of the Government’s objectives is for businesses to spend more of their time focusing on growing their businesses rather than fulfilling tax requirements.

Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme is vital in achieving this goal and the key is the smarter use of software – integrating the tax process into normal day to day business operations.

We know from a recent survey that the median time SMEs spent within their business on tax compliance was 25% less than in 2013, while the cost of doing the work had reduced by 24%.

This follows similar reductions in the 2013 survey, when compared with the 2009 survey and is a great validation of the work IR continues to do to make tax obligations easier for businesses.

That same survey also tells us that people who use accounting software to prepare and send their GST returns to Inland Revenue are experiencing significant a compliance cost reduction. The Government is proposing a similar approach for employers and PAYE proposals will be developed for inclusion in a tax bill expected to be introduced early in 2017.

The Bill will also contain investment income information proposals.

Meanwhile, a discussion document on changes to the Tax Administration Act is due to be released next month. It will address a range of issues that I think may be of particular interest to you. Those include the care and management provision to allow the Commissioner some greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances, significantly reducing the fees for obtaining a binding ruling at least for SMEs, allowing post-assessment binding rulings, and extending the scope of the rulings regime.

And proposals for changes to the administration of social policy and the administration of individuals’ taxation are likely to be released later in 2017.

I’ll wind up my speech now by saying that New Zealand’s tax system is up there with the best, but it cannot be static and must keep up with societal and economic changes.

This work programme has been updated to focus on the priority projects. I know there is a lot to get through, but I hope you will take the opportunity to review the full details of the policy work programme on IR’s policy website and that you will continue to engage in the consultation process in a productive way.

I hope you have an enjoyable conference. Thank you.

| --- | --- |
| Review of the tax framework for employee share schemes | Reforming the tax treatment of employee share schemes to ensure appropriate and balanced outcomes. |

| Review of bank account requirement for offshore persons’ IRD numbers (**new**) | The bank account requirement for an offshore person to obtain an IRD number continues to cause issues in practice. In particular, it is an obstacle in a number of cases to people being able to comply with their tax obligations. |

| Financial arrangement issues (**new**) | There are a variety of financial arrangement taxation issues ranging from remedial to policy enhancements to ensure these rules work as intended. |
| Taxation of non-bank securitisation vehicles (**new**) | Extending the current securitisation regime to beyond banks. |
| Impact of case law on the ”voting interest” test for corporate trustees (**new**) | Considering the impact of recent case law on the application of the voting interest test in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to corporate trustees. |
| Repeal adverse events income equalisation deposit regime (**new**) | This regime is, in practice, little used, because the main scheme offers more flexibility. However, its existence can cause some confusion. |

The amendments to DTAs will address certain aspects of the BEPS project that have a treaty dimension e.g. treaty shopping or permanent establishment avoidance. |
| Foreign trust disclosures | Policy recommendations arising from the Government Inquiry into foreign trust disclosure requirements. |
| Inbound investment framework | An officials’ paper outlining New Zealand’s approach to taxing foreign investment income has been prepared. It has been used as the basis for targeted consultation with private sector representatives, and has also been published on the tax policy website to facilitate a wide understanding of the trade-offs the Government faces in responding to BEPS. |
