Smart business A guide for businesses and not-for-profit organisations IR320 July 2024 INSIDE FRONT COVER For more information about taxable supply information go to page 49 of this guide, or ird.govt.nz/gst ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ requirements replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit note requirements to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with requirements to provide and keep supply correction information. Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to page 51 or ird.govt.nz/gst GST adjustments for business, private or exempt use From 1 April 2023, • When you acquire goods or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. • The number and the value of the adjustment periods have changed. Fewer adjustments are required for land, as well as goods and services $20,000 or less. • You can elect to treat goods as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. Being your own boss and going into business for yourself can be an exciting challenge. So can taking responsibility for running a not-for-profit organisation such as a kohanga reo or sports club. Being in business or running an organisation also carries certain responsibilities. The rules applying to businesses generally also apply to not-for-profit organisations. The term ‘business’ in this guide includes not-for-profit organisations as well as businesses. Certain tax rules only apply to not-for- profit organisations. For more information about running a not-for-profit go to ird.govt.nz/running-your-nfp This guide has information on: • records you need to keep and suggestions on how to organise them • cashflow forecasting and time management • your basic tax responsibilities • how to use your records to save you time and money meeting those responsibilities. Important changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns.

We also discuss record keeping in general and explain what sort of records you should keep. Before going any further, you first need to establish whether you're actually in business. You need to be sure because the tax laws are different for individuals and businesses. How do I know if I'm in business? Generally, you're in business when: • you start charging others for the goods or services you produce • you supply these goods or services on a regular basis • you intend to make a profit from selling your goods or services. We look at the following to decide if you're in business: • the nature of the activity • how much time, money and effort you put into the activity • how long you've been running or are intending to run the activity • how much you make from the activity • whether you run the activity in a similar way to most businesses in the same trade • if you intend to make a profit. If you are not sure whether your activity fits our definition of a business, we can help you. Your profit is the amount you're left with after deducting expenses from all your sales and income for a certain period. When you're in business you'll have to pay income tax on the profits. 5 General ird.govt.nz Business types The chart below gives a brief description of different business types and basic facts about how they're run. While we can explain the tax responsibilities of each of these business types, you may like to talk to an accountant or lawyer about the most appropriate business type for your needs. Business typeWhat it isHow it works Sole traderA sole trader is a person trading on their own. The business is controlled, managed and owned by that person. There are usually no formal or legal processes to become a sole trader. The owner or manager is personally entitled to all profits but is also personally responsible for all business taxes and debts. PartnershipA partnership is where 2 or more people run a business together. Each partner contributes something to the business and, in return, each share in any profit or loss. Each partner is also responsible for any debt within the partnership. A formal partnership agreement can be prepared. Partners share responsibility for running the business, and share the profits and losses equally unless the agreement says otherwise. The partnership does not pay income tax. It distributes the partnership income to the partners who pay tax on their own share. CompanyA company is a formal and legal entity in its own right, separate from its shareholders (or owners). It's formed when a group of people exchange money and/or property for shares in an enterprise registered under the Companies Act. To register a company go to companies.govt.nz There is a legal registration process you will have to pay for. More money can be raised with more owners. The company owns the assets and liabilities of the business and is responsible for any debts. The shareholders' liability for losses is limited to their share of ownership in the company. Not-for-profit organisations A not-for-profit organisation is any society, association or organisation: • not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property, or any other benefits to be distributed to any of its members. Some not-for-profit organisations may be incorporated, by being registered with the Ministry of Economic Development. Not-for-profit organisations can have profit-making activities taxed as business income in the normal way. These organisations must have written rules to get an income tax exemption. 6 SMART BUSINESS General Getting an IRD number You can apply for a personal IRD number on our website at ird.govt.nz/irdnumber or you can complete an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form.

Mereana and Jo Moera Janet Wi s eman 7 General ird.govt.nz Basic tax responsibilities Here are some of the basic tax responsibilities most businesses will have. • You'll need to get an IRD number if you do not already have one. If you're a sole trader, you can use your personal IRD number. • If you're in business as a company or partnership, you'll need a new IRD number. This number will be used for GST (goods and services tax) as well. • You may have to complete financial accounts and various tax returns each year, such as income tax and GST returns. • If you're an employer, you may have to tax PAYE, student loan, child support and KiwiSaver deductions and pay these to us. See page 55. • Businesses and some organisations must work out their profits, so they can calculate how much income tax to pay. This is explained in Part 4. • You may have to pay provisional tax during the year. See page 33. • You have to register for GST if your turnover is over $60,000. See page 45. • If you're a sole trader you must pay your student loan repayments direct to us. This is because no repayment deductions are made from income as you earn it. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/se-repay-student-loan Our tax system relies on people meeting their tax responsibilities voluntarily, and there are penalties if you do not comply. Our guide Penalties and interest - IR240 has full details. Paying your tax before the due date It's important to pay your tax by the due date to avoid penalties and interest being charged. You can do this by: • making payments to us before the due date, either regularly or as money is available • arranging an automatic payment for the whole amount by the due date • putting money aside in a special bank account for tax and paying in one lump sum before the due date - that way, you may get interest on the money. How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: • direct debit • credit or debit card • internet banking Keeping records is important No matter what sort of business you're running, you need to be able to see what you've paid and what you're owed so you can budget. Your bank manager, accountant or investors may also need to see your business records at some time to keep track of your progress and help plan your business's future. Several government departments also require you to keep records by law, especially for statistics and tax reasons. Record keeping All records must be in English or Māori unless you have written approval from us to use another language. For tax records kept in Māori numerals must be 1, 2, 3 etc. How long to keep your records Keep all your business records (including those in electronic form) for at least 7 years from the end of the tax year or the taxable period they relate to. Even after you stop operating your business you still have record keeping responsibilities. If you or your accountant send your tax returns to us electronically, they must be kept for 7 years, either electronically or paper based. If you complete your employment information return electronically, you do not have to keep a paper copy, but you’ll need to ensure you can reproduce the schedules you’ve sent us. 8 SMART BUSINESS General Your payroll records are a base for the data on the schedules and you must keep these records for 7 years. Reducing the time records must be kept You may apply to us to destroy certain business records 4 years after the return period they relate to. Benefits of keeping accurate records As soon as you decide to go into business, it's important you start keeping accurate records, because it's much harder to work backwards later. There are legal reasons for keeping accurate records, as well as good business reasons. Better control of your business or organisation Accurate records will help you determine whether your business is making enough money to meet its expenses. They'll show you what you're spending money on and where the money is coming from. This will help you in budgeting and decision making. Not-for-profit organisations will find accurate records help them keep track of grants or members' fees and how funds are being spent. Increase your chances of getting finance or funding Good record keeping makes it easier for others to know whether to invest in your business or project. It's much easier to put a good case together when applying for loans or grants if you've got accurate records to support your intentions. Keeping accurate records is good evidence a business is being run professionally, which makes it a better prospect for investment. This is also true if you're thinking of selling the business. Potential buyers can check your performance by looking at your records. Save time and money You'll find that the more up-to-date your records are, the quicker you'll get through your tax returns and other paperwork. If you're doing the day-to- day bookkeeping, your accountant will not have to spend valuable time (that you're paying for) getting your books in order. You'll be able to use the accountant's services for more specialised tax and financial advice instead. Audits will take less time If you're in business, you can expect to be audited by us at some stage. There will be less time spent on the audit if your records are well kept. What records to keep You must keep enough records to be able to calculate income, expenses, and tax liabilities and to enable us to confirm your accounts if required. Some records you must keep are: • invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you are GST registered) • debit and credit notes (supply correction information if you are GST registered) • bank statements • wage records for all employees, including employer superannuation contribution tax records (see page 22) • interest and dividend payment records • account books, such as your cashbook, journals, and ledgers • worksheets showing tax return calculations • your cashbook and petty cash book • depreciation calculations (see page 42) • details of travel expenses • entertainment expenses (see page 40) • motor vehicle logbooks, telephone and power bills and other such records (see pages 38 to 40) • legal statements, such as purchase or sale agreements of a business and leases • any disposal or donation of trading stock at below market value. You must also keep records for all your business assets and liabilities at the end of the year, including: • lists of debtors and creditors • stocktake figures • a fixed asset register (see page 41) • final profit and loss statements and balance sheets. 9 General ird.govt.nz These are some more records different types of organisations must keep. Partnershipsa partnership agreement (if you have one) Companiesthe certificate of incorporation, minute books Truststhe trust deed and minute books Incorporated organisations the certificate of incorporation It’s important to keep all this information, as we routinely audit business records. There are penalties if you have not been keeping full records. Personal records It's a good idea to keep all personal records and transactions separate from business records. This is best achieved by using separate cheque and savings accounts for the business. As with business records, you must keep all private records (including private bank account records) for 7 years. 10 SMART BUSINESS General Part 2 - Source documents Source documents show details of money coming in or going out of a business. They show money you've received or expect to receive, and money you've paid or expect to pay. These documents carry all the information you need to put into your bookkeeping system and include banking, income and expense records. Banking records Starting up a business account It's a good idea to keep separate bank accounts for personal and business purposes. When opening a business bank account, use your registered business, trust or organisation name to give a clear indication that it's not a personal account. You may want to open a separate bank account for large bills and taxes and transfer money from your main account throughout the year to cover these. 11 Source documents ird.govt.nz DrawerBankAmount F.

In your deposit book write down: • the date of the deposit • the payer's name (the person you got the funds from) • the amount of each deposit. The deposit book will usually have columns for recording information about the deposit type, for example credit card or cash.

It's a good idea to have the statement issued on the last day of the month - it may assist you in preparing your GST returns and will make it easier to complete your bank reconciliation. There is more information on bank reconciliation on pages 18 and 19. Keep all your business and private bank statements and file them in date order. You will not be able to complete your end-of-year business accounts until you have them all. Most banks will charge you for replacement statements. Managing your banking • All business transactions should go through the business bank account. • Bank all business income you receive into your business bank account. • Charge all purchases to the business, and keep a record of them. The easiest way is to pay for them electronically so a permanent record of each payment will appear in your bank statement. • Transfer money to a separate account for large bills and taxes. • If you take money out of the business for personal use, clearly identify it as ‘personal drawings’. • If you need to put some of your own money back into the business, clearly identify it as ‘personal funds introduced’. • If you want to make purchases for the business on a credit card, you should use a separate card for business expenses only. Income records It's good business practice to send invoices to your customers. Invoices help you to keep track of money coming in and going out. If you are not GST registered there are no special requirements for what an invoice should show, if it can help prove a particular transaction took place. An invoice will generally show: • the seller's name • the purchase date • the amount paid or to be paid • a description of the goods or services being sold. If you’re registered for GST, there are requirements to provide and hold taxable supply information, see pages 49-51. EFTPOS and credit card sales Keep all copies of the vouchers and voucher schedules from your EFTPOS and credit card sales. Make sure you include your EFTPOS and credit card sales when working out your total sales for the month. Debit and credit notes/supply correction information You must provide your customers a debit note if the price of goods or services has increased after the original invoice was issued. If the price has decreased, you must send your customer a credit note. Debit and credit notes must show the words ‘debit note’ or ‘credit note’ in a prominent place, in addition to the details required for an invoice For GST registered businesses, you must provide customers with supply correction information when the taxable supply information included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. 13 Source documents ird.govt.nz Cash register tape Some businesses, such as dairies, have a number of cash sales. These businesses do not have to record the name of each customer in a cashbook or issue invoices for every sale. It's more appropriate for such businesses to use a cash register tape. Make sure all your cash sales are recorded on the tape. Keep these tapes in a daily order by highlighting the date on each one and store them with your other sales records. The amount you deposit as cash sales in your cashbook should equal the total on your cash tape. Expenses records You need to keep records of all your expenses for income tax purposes. Invoices for purchases If you buy goods or services on credit for the business, you'll usually be sent an invoice requesting and recording payment. Make sure you keep your invoices for purchases. Do not send them back to the supplier with your remittance advice and payment. If you receive regular supplies from a supplier, it's a good idea to tick off all the invoices you've received against the supplier's monthly statement. That way you can make sure you're not paying an invoice twice. It's helpful to sort your expenses invoices into those you've paid and those you have not paid yet. You can store those that have been paid with any paid monthly statements in date paid or reference number order. To tell the difference between paid invoices and those still to be paid, put them into separate files. Store the paid invoices and statements in a file called ‘accounts paid’. Store the invoices yet to be paid in a separate file, until they are due for payment, and call this file ‘creditors’ or ‘accounts payable’. Credit card purchases When you make purchases using a credit card for the business, make sure you keep: • your credit card vouchers • payment receipts • monthly statements. It's good practice to attach your credit card vouchers and receipts to the monthly statement, so they are all in one place. When you get your credit card statement from the bank listing your credit card expenses, go through it and write down what each expense was for. Note If you’re registered for GST, your credit card purchases should be claimed in the period the purchase was made (do not claim against the actual payment you make to your credit card company). 14 SMART BUSINESS Source documents Bookkeeping is transferring the information from your source documents, such as invoices and receipts, into: • cashbooks for recording payments in and out • petty cash books for smaller purchases • wage books for employees' pay records. With these 3 types of record books you can run your business as well as meeting most of your tax responsibilities. We'll take you through setting up and using each book. Many businesses use computerised bookkeeping systems. There are several accounting and bookkeeping packages available built on the basic principles of manual bookkeeping. Part 3 - Bookkeeping 15 Bookkeeping ird.govt.nz Cashbooks A cashbook is a record of all payments (for example EFTPOS, credit card and direct credit). It shows different types of sales and income, purchases and expenses under the appropriate headings. The headings you'll use depend on the type of business or organisation you run. The headings should describe the type of transactions you make most often. A well-kept cashbook allows you to: • keep track of how much money is coming in and how you are spending money • prepare a cashflow budget of future income and expenses (see page 26 for cashflow budgets) • prepare end-of-year financial accounts • complete various tax returns.

A 14- or 16-column cashbook is best. This is particularly important in your first year of business, when your income and expenses may not be as expected. Leave a couple of pages at the back of the cashbook for your monthly bank reconciliations • Start each month on a new page. • Choose expense and income titles in your cashbook that are relevant and common to your business. • Record references for paid expenses, for example EFTPOS, credit card, direct debit. This makes it easy to check your entries against the bank statement. • Unusual items can be put into a ‘sundry’ column - this is especially useful for one-off payments and receipts. It's a good idea to give these items a written description in the reference column or near the sundry amount for easier identification. • If you're GST-registered, set up separate columns for GST paid on purchases and expenses and GST received from sales and income. Remember, the totals in your expense and income columns will be the amount banked, less the GST portion. • Remember, if you are GST-registered, add GST to the selling price of your goods and services. To calculate GST, multiply the selling price by 15% (0.15). For more information on GST see Part 6. • To separate the GST portion from your purchases and expenses, and sales and income, multiply the amount by 3 then divide the answer by 23. • Some items do not include GST, such as wages, drawings, bank fees and interest. • Add up all columns at the end of the month, ensuring all other total columns equal the bank column total. • Reconcile the cashbook with your business's bank statement each month. • Rule off each tax year. Reconciling your cashbook with your bank statement It's good business practice to reconcile your bank statement and your cashbook on a regular basis (at least monthly). It means balancing your bank account against the amounts of money you've noted down in your cashbook as paid or received. Before you can reconcile your bank statement with your cashbook, you'll need to have your bank statements for the period you're trying to reconcile. Use your bank statements to record items into your cashbook such as automatic payments, bank fees and interest charges and anything else not shown in your cashbook in the month you paid or received them. To make it easier, ask your bank to send bank statements to you as soon as possible after the end of the month so you can keep your cashbook up-to-date, or use internet banking. 17 Bookkeeping ird.govt.nz 8 steps for reconciling your bank statements Complete your bank reconciliation following the example on these 2 pages. 1. Make sure all your payments and deposits over the last month have been recorded in your cashbook. 2. Get a copy of all bank statements for the month you are reconciling. 3. Tick off the payments on your bank statement with those recorded in your cashbook. Make sure the amounts are the same. 4. If you have made any non-electronic payments (for example cash), tick off the deposits in your bank statement with those recorded in your cashbook. Make sure the amounts are the same. 5. Make a list of unpresented cheques from those recorded in your cashbook without ticks. 6. Make a list of outstanding deposits from those recorded in the cashbook without ticks. 7. Make sure all automatic payments, bank fees and electronic transactions are included in your cashbook. 8. Add up the cashbook columns of your sales and expenses and make sure all expense columns match the expenses' ‘bank’ total and all sales columns match the sales' ‘bank’ total.

A petty cash book allows you to: • keep track of small expenses • avoid paying for smaller items from personal funds. To start using your petty cash system: • Keep petty cash separate from your personal funds. • Make sure you receive a receipt for each petty cash purchase. If a receipt is not issued, make sure you record the details. • Record the purchase, with the type of expense, in a petty cash book. • Keep a running total, when your petty cash gets low, withdraw more cash to bring the petty cash back up to the original amount. 2013 Petty cash book DatePurchaseAmountBalance 4/4 Opening balance 100.00 4/4 Milk 2.6097.40 8/4 Taxi 22.5074.90 8/4 Coffee 10.9563.95 8/4 Te a 3.7560.20 10/4 Stationery 15.0045.20 11/4 Milk 2.6042.60 11/4 Te a 5.3537.25 15/4 Cash withdrawal from bank account (62.75)100.00 15/4 Taxi 22.5077.50 16/4 Drinks 35.0042.50 16/4 Afternoon tea 25.0017.50 17/4 Milk 2.5015.00 22/4 Cash withdrawal from bank account (85.00)100.00 20 SMART BUSINESS Bookkeeping Claiming petty cash expenses It’s important to remember that the first petty cash withdrawal cannot be claimed for income tax and GST - it just opens the petty cash book. You can only claim the second and subsequent withdrawals. If you’re GST registered, you need to keep taxable supply information to claim GST on your purchases and expenses relating to your taxable activity. For supplies costing more than $200 (including GST) you’ll need to keep taxable supply information, such as invoices, receipts, or other documentation for your GST records. When you buy supplies for $200 or less, you must keep your own records of the transaction for GST record keeping requirements. If any small expenses are paid straight from the cash register, remember to write out a petty cash docket or write out the details on the receipt and put this in the cash register. Petty cash alternative Some small businesses, especially those that do not employ staff, may find a petty cash system does not suit their business needs. An alternative method is for the owner or manager to pay for small items using their own personal funds and reimburse themselves from the business account once the total reaches a suitably large value. Keep all receipts or written details relating to the reimbursement. Staple them together, with the total value and proof of payment from the bank account recorded on a separate piece of paper, at the front of the receipts. 21 Bookkeeping ird.govt.nz Wage books Whenever you employ someone, you must keep their wage records for 7 years. A good way to do this is to use a wage book. Each payday, you must complete these details for each employee: • total gross earnings, including taxable allowances (this is the amount before PAYE is deducted) • the amount of PAYE deducted • any child support deductions • any non-taxable allowances • any student loan deductions • any extra student loan deductions requested by your employee or us • any KiwiSaver deductions • any gross KiwiSaver employer contributions • any ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) • any net KiwiSaver employer contributions • any tax credits for payroll donations • the net wage. Non-taxable allowances will include actual expenses employees have incurred on behalf of the employer, for example meals, mileage, tools and telephone expenses. See Part 8 for more on your responsibilities as an employer.

This will give you their IRD number and tax code. • As an employer you’ll have to complete an Employment information - IR348 form each payday. • If you complete paper returns, you can choose to send us your employment information twice monthly, for paydays between: - the first and the 15th of the month, and - the 16th and the end of the month. If you choose this option you will still need to show each pay separately. Page 57 shows you how to use the information in your wage book to help you fill in these forms. Time management • Make bookkeeping part of your regular routine. When you've established a routine you'll find you work through your books quicker. • Before starting, make sure you have all the information and documents you need. • Avoid interruptions when doing your bookkeeping. You should set aside a time just for bookkeeping. • Try to complete each bookkeeping task in one sitting. For example when filling in your PAYE forms, make sure you finish them before doing something else. • Keep your books in an organised manner. You'll work quicker if you can find the information you need easily. • Always try to find better ways to keep your books and records. • If you're a not-for-profit organisation, once you've set up a good system, write down a clear description of how it works. This will save the next treasurer time and effort trying to work this out. 23 Bookkeeping ird.govt.nz Recording methods Your records should be organised enough to allow you or anyone else to work through them quickly and efficiently. The paper-based method Paper-based record keeping simply means keeping all your invoices for sales and purchases as well as all your bank statements. You'll probably also use a cashbook to record all your sales, income, purchases and other expenses. There are many ways to organise paper records. Choose a filing system that's simple so others can quickly and easily get the information they need. When you find a system that suits your business, stick to it. Remember, it's important to keep it up-to-date and well organised. If you use an accountant, try to ensure your record keeping gives them the information they require. Remember, when you're in business time is money. Time wasted looking for records that have not been put away in some order is money wasted. This is because bills are not paid on time and money coming in may not be accounted for. Your business advisor will spend more time doing basic bookkeeping rather than giving financial advice. The electronic method There are a number of accounting and bookkeeping packages available that you can use on personal computers. The major software manufacturers also provide standardised business software that includes spreadsheets, databases and word processing packages. These packages build on the basic principles of manual record keeping, so it's essential to understand a manual system first. Note If you keep your records on computer, you still need to keep invoices, taxable supply information (if registered for GST), bank statements and any other documentation to prove your income, purchases and expenses. Keeping all your records on computer without backups can be disastrous if your system breaks down. If this happens you could lose all the information you've stored on your computer. A ‘backup’ is a copy of the information you have on your computer, either electronically or copies of vital information printed out regularly. Keep this backup somewhere else - in another building if possible. Conducting business on the internet You're required to keep business records of all business-related internet transactions. More information For more information on keeping records electronically, you can refer to our Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 13/01: Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in Māori. You'll find this on our website. 24 SMART BUSINESS Bookkeeping Making your bookkeeping system work for you Using your cashbook for budgets and cashflow Having set up a cashbook and organised your books into a system, you can now use your cashbook to monitor and plan your business's performance. Many not-for-profit organisations, which rely on members' fees, grants or donations, run out of cash after starting up because they may not have a regular source of income from sales or investments. Cash management is essential for organisations as it is for businesses. A cashflow budget is basically a summary of the financial future of your business for the next 6 months to a year. Cashflow budgets are sometimes also called cashflow forecasts. The term ‘cashflow’ is used to describe the movement of money in and out of a business. One of the most important ways to manage your finances is by checking actual cashflow figures (from your cashbook) with your cashflow budget. A cashflow budget shows: • forecast monthly cash in (from sales, loans, your own money, grants and other income) • forecast monthly cash out (for purchases and expenses). A cashflow budget can show you how well your business is doing so you can plan ahead. That way you'll be able to tell when you can afford new equipment, hire more staff, pay bonuses or arrange finance for the future, if necessary. You'll be in better control of the business if you know from month to month how the business is doing rather than waiting till the end of the year. Monitoring your cashflow budget At the end of each month, enter actual figures into the cashflow budget. Highlight those items that were significantly over or under forecast amounts. Update the forecasts for the following months as you go. From there you can decide whether you'll be able to invest more in the business or talk to your bank or business advisor if funds are going to be low. Comparing actual against forecast figures helps you control finances and prevent many problems before they happen. Forecasting figures When you've been in business for 6 months or more, you'll be able to forecast monthly sales and expense figures. These are based on your actual results for that period, plus or minus a little for changing prices. For new businesses, sales and income are based on what you think others are making in similar businesses. If you do not have any competitors and know you'll have the customers, you may be able to say for sure what cash sales might be by researching what customers might be prepared to pay. Base your purchases and expenses figures on last year's costs, adjusted for any price changes. Otherwise, make some enquiries about costs from people who supply the goods and services you'll need. 25 Bookkeeping ird.govt.nz How to do a cashflow budget This example is for a not-for-profit organisation that receives income and pays expenses using cash only. If you buy or sell on credit, you'll need to prepare sales and stock purchase budgets. 1. Prepare a cashflow sheet with months along the top. Divide each month into forecast and actual. 2. Down the left-hand column list appropriate headings, including opening bank balance, cash in and cash out, a total of the difference and a closing balance for the month. 3. The opening balance is the closing balance from the previous month. For a new business this may be $0 unless you've put money in to get started. 4. Enter cash from sales and all other funds you expect to receive. Add in all other sources of income, including grants, loans, members' fees, tax refunds and your own funds introduced. 5. Total cash in for each month. 6. Enter cash out for purchases and other cash items you expect to pay. 7. Total cash out for each month. 8. Calculate the closing bank balance for the month by adding the opening balance to total cash in and deducting the total cash out. 9. The closing balance will be next month's opening balance. Do this for each month of the cashflow budget. Example For Nga Tamariki Mokopuna, Janette’s cashflow budget showed that in June, parent fees were more than expected because parents paid their fees on time plus any overdue amounts.

Income Business income is earned from the goods and services you sell (including invoices you've issued but have not yet received payment for). You can claim expenses against your income to arrive at a net profit. You pay income tax on your net profit. Your first year in business is not tax-free If you make a profit at the end of your first year in business you will have tax to pay. So, although you may not be making tax payments on your profit during your first year, that year is still taxed. You'll have to pay this tax by 7 February in the following year, or if you have a tax agent with an extension of time by 7 April. There may be instances where you may be liable for interest although you do not have to make a tax payment. Please refer to our Provisional Tax Guide - IR289 for more details. If you do not want to have a tax bill at the end of the first year you can make voluntary payments at any time. In some situations, small businesses which make voluntary payments towards their end-of-year tax liability may qualify for an ‘early payment discount’ against their end-of-year tax liability (see opposite). In your second and subsequent years of business you may be required to pay income tax in instalments during the year. This is called provisional tax. You'll find more on provisional tax on page 33. If you are a sole trader and have a student loan you may also have a student loan repayment to make. After your first year you may be required to make interim payments. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/se-repay-student-loan. Part 4 - Income tax Early payment discount We'll give a discount to qualifying individual taxpayers who make voluntary payments of income tax either in their first year of business, or the year before they start paying provisional tax. You qualify for the discount if you: • are either self-employed or a partner in a partnership or as owner of a look through company • are not operating as a company or trust • derive gross income predominantly from a business (not being interest, dividends, royalties, rents or beneficiary income) • are not required to pay provisional tax in the income year or has not been liable to pay provisional tax in the previous 4 years • make a voluntary payment of income tax before the end of the income year (for example 31 March if you have a March balance date) • elect to receive the discount in the period for filing a return of income for that year (you can do this on your income tax return) • have not received an early payment discount unless you come within the 4-year rule outlined on page 28. Once you've made a voluntary payment, you must keep a credit balance in your income tax account until the end-of-year tax date. The credit balance must be more than or equal to the lesser of the following: • the amount paid as voluntary payment before the end of your income year, or • the amount of end-of-year tax. 27 Income tax ird.govt.nz 4-year rule You may qualify for early payment discount again if your income from a partnership, self- employment or a look-through company stops, and you start a new business 4 or more years later. Calculation The discount is calculated by applying the discount rate to the lesser of: • the amount of any voluntary income tax payments made for the income year • 105% of the residual income tax for the income year. For the current and historic early payment discount rates and for information as to how the early payment discount is calculated and claimed please refer to ird.govt.nz/first-year-tax Election You can elect to receive the discount before the date your return is due to be filed for your first year in business. To claim it, tick the box in your Individual tax return - IR3 after confirming that you meet the criteria in the return guide. If you do not claim the discount in your return, you can apply to us to amend the return and claim the discount but you must do so before the last day for filing your tax return for the income year the discount is claimed in. More information You can find out more about the early payment discount, including whether you can claim it, at ird.govt.nz/first-year-tax Drawings Remember that you pay income tax on your profits. This includes any drawings you take from the business. ‘Drawings’ is the money you take out of the business to live on and pay any personal expenses. It's easier to reconcile your accounts if you take regular cash drawings weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Balance date For most businesses, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. This means you need to have your accounts up-to-date, so you can work out the profit you've made and the amount of tax you need to pay. If you want a balance date other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, giving sound business reasons for the change. You cannot use another balance date until you have written approval from us. Paying income tax Whether you're in business or running an organisation, you'll need to complete a tax return each year and send it to us. Include income from all sources and work out the tax on your total taxable income. If you've any tax credits (such as PAYE or RWT (resident withholding tax)) these are deducted from your tax in your return. You'll also need to send us either a copy of your financial accounts or a summary of your income and expenses. When is my tax return due? • If you have a balance date between 1 October and 31 March inclusive, you must send your tax return to us by 7 July. • If you have a balance date between 1 April and 30 September inclusive, you must send your tax return to us by the 7th day of the 4th month after your balance date. 28 SMART BUSINESS Income tax Rental income IR3R March 2023 • Complete all questions on pages 1 and 2. • Read our booklet Rental income – IR264 to help you fill in this form. • Attach this form to your income tax return and keep a copy for your records.

These requirements make reporting quick and easy for small and medium businesses, and give us the tax information we need. Even if you're not legally required to prepare financial accounts, there are good reasons for all businesses (including sole traders, partnerships and trusts) to prepare them. You'll find more information about our minimum financial reporting requirements at ird.govt.nz/records. Income tax rates Different tax rates apply to companies, individuals and partnerships. These rates can change if the legislation changes. Sole traders A sole trader manages their own business and is responsible for all the business's income and debts. If you're a sole trader you do not pay yourse lf a wage - you withdraw money from the business when you need it for personal use. These takings are called ‘drawings’. Drawings must not be included as a deductible business expense when calculating your profit. Make sure you record your drawings in your cashbook (see page 16) so you can reconcile your cashbook with your bank statements, ensuring there's enough money in the business to cover any bills owing. Example For the year ended 31 March 2024, income tax would be calculated as follows: Sales $ 187,000 Less all deductible expenses $ 108,500 Net profit $ 78,500 Tax on the net profit of $78,500 is $16,825 Net profit up to and including $14,000 is taxed at a rate of 10.5% ($14,000 × 10.5% = $1,470) Net profit from $14,001 to $48,000 inclusive is taxed at a rate of 17.5% ($34,000 × 17.5% = $5,950) Example (continued) Net profit from $48,001 to $70,000 inclusive is taxed at a rate of 30% ($22,000 × 30% = $6,600) Net profit from $70,001 to $180,000 inclusive is taxed at a rate of 33% ($8,500 × 33%= $2,805) Tax payable on a net profit of $78,500 is $1,470 + $5,950 + $6,600 + $2,805 = $16,825 Partnerships The partnership itself do not pay tax on its income or profit, nor do the partners pay tax on any regular drawings they take. Instead, at the end of each year the net profit (without allowing for partners' drawings) is shared in full between the partners. The partners then pay income tax on their share of the profit in their individual tax returns, along with any other income they have. As with a sole trader, the amount the partners take as drawings can be more than their share of the profit. If we consider that the payment, salary or wages, share of profits or other income paid to a relative or associated person is unreasonable or excessive, any salary or wages, or share of profits or losses can be reallocated for tax purposes. To consider whether the payment or share in the profit or loss is reasonable we look at: • the nature and extent of the services provided • the value of the partners' contributions made by way of services or capital • any other relevant matters. We cannot reallocate partners' share of income or losses if there's a bona fide contract. A partner who works for the partnership can be paid a salary with PAYE deducted if there's a contract of service. The contract must be written and agreed to by all partners. See our Employer’s guide - IR335 for more information. Wages paid to this partner would then be a deductible expense in the partnership's IR7 return. The partner must include the wages and PAYE in their IR3 return along with their share of any profit or loss. 30 SMART BUSINESS Income tax Companies Any profits made belong to the company, which must pay tax on them. Companies can distribute money in 3 ways. • Shareholder-employees can periodically draw money from the company. At the end of the year, the company calculates a salary amount on which the shareholder will have to pay income tax. • Shareholders who are also employees of the company can be paid a salary with PAYE taken out in the normal way. These salaries are deductible as a business expense for the company. • The company can pay dividends to shareholders out of the profits that remain after tax. It may have to attach tax credits to these dividends - see page 33. Not-for-profit organisations Unless your organisation has been approved by us as being fully exempt from income tax, you must file an income tax return each year. A deduction of up to $1,000 per year is available for some not- for-profit organisations. By deducting this amount from the organisation's net income you reduce the amount of tax to pay. There are a number of income tax exemptions your organisation may be entitled to, as long as none of its income or funds can be distributed to any of its members. The organisation's main aims and activities must meet the requirements of the particular exemption. Income tax exemptions are not automatic. You'll need to apply to us in writing, stating the exemption you're applying for, and include: • a copy of the organisation's written rules, constitution or founding documents • a copy of the certificate of incorporation, if your organisation is incorporated • details of how the organisation will operate. An incorporated organisation (that is, registered under a specific Act) is taxed at the company rate. Unincorporated organisations not entitled to an exemption are taxed at the same rate as individuals. If the organisation has profit-making activities, it must pay income tax. You may use an IR10 to show account information or send in a set of financial accounts with the return. Charities register Charitable organisations are eligible for various tax benefits. A charity must register with the Charities Commission to receive tax exemptions. For more information go to charities.govt.nz Sale and purchase of assets When 2 or more assets are sold together, they are mixed supplies, meaning they involve a mixture of: • revenue (taxable) assets like trading stock, property held on revenue account or patents • depreciable assets like plant or machinery • capital (non-taxable) assets like goodwill. When sold, the allocation of the sale price determines the seller’s tax liability from the sale, and the buyer’s cost base for calculating depreciation or deductions. Generally, the allocation must be based on market values. From 1 July 2021 for any transaction such as a sale or purchase of a business or property involving mixed supplies of certain assets, the seller and buyer should document and use the same allocation price for different classes of assets in their returns. The agreement should be made and documented before either the seller or buyer files their income tax return which includes the tax position for the sale. Notification of the agreement to Inland Revenue is not required. If we consider the agreed amounts do not reflect the asset’s market value, we may allocate amounts subject to certain thresholds for low value depreciable assets. 31 Income tax ird.govt.nz If they do not agree on an allocation amount and the total purchase price is $1 million or more, or where the only assets are residential land (including land and chattels) with a total purchase price of $7.5 million or more the seller has 3 months from the settlement date to: • determine and notify both the buyer and Inland Revenue the allocation amount. The allocation amounts should be the greater of the relative market value or for depreciable property, the tax book value. If the seller does not make an allocation and valid notification, then the buyer has a further 3 months (within 6 months of settlement) to: • determine and notify the seller and Inland Revenue the allocation amount. The allocation amounts cannot be less than the market value for the assets. Once a valid notification is made by either party the amounts must be used by both the seller and buyer for income tax purposes. If the buyer does not make a notification within the further 3-month timeframe then: • we may allocate amounts to each asset, and • any tax deduction that the buyer is entitled to may be denied until the following years tax return. The parties may still make and notify allocations after the 3 or 6 month timeframes, but we will be able to choose which allocation is used, or decide the allocation based on market values subject to certain thresholds for low value depreciable assets. Notification Notification to Inland Revenue can be made through myIR as a web message or in writing. In the notification use the subject line ‘Purchase Price Allocation’ and include: • Both parties name and IR/GST number • Date of agreement to the transaction • Date of settlement • Global/total sale price • Price allocation at the level of asset classes that are subject to particular income or deduction rules. Tax on interest and dividends RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest If you receive interest from a person or organisation, RWT (resident withholding tax) is usually deducted from those interest payments before they are credited to you. This might be interest from financial institutions (for example banks, finance companies, building societies or credit unions). 32 SMART BUSINESS Income tax Rates from 31 July: RWT rates Rates where an IRD number has been provided 10.5%• Individuals with annual income $15,600 or less\* • Testamentary trusts 17.5%• Individuals with annual income $15,601 to $53,500\* • Individuals, M āori authorities and trusts who have not chosen a rate if they have not opened a new account since 31 March 2010. • Trusts and testamentary trusts 28%• Companies 30%• Individuals with annual income $53,501 to $78,100\* • Trusts and M āori authorities 33%• All interest recipients can use this rate, for example individuals with annual income $78,101 to $180,000\* • Use this rate for interest recipients who open a new account and do not choose a rate 39%• Individuals whose annual income is $180,001 or more\* Rate where no IRD number has been provided 45%• Use this rate for all interest recipients who have not provided an IRD number. \* You are not required to confirm an individual's income level; you can accept the rate they provide. Individuals and others Make sure your interest payer has your IRD number. Some people or organisations can apply for a resident withholding tax exemption. This means you get the full interest payment with no tax deducted. You can find out more about the exemption register, eligibility and how to apply at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption or see the RWT on interest - payer’s guide - IR283. Interest payers If investors other than banks or other financial institutions have money invested in your business or organisation, and the business pays more than $5,000 interest a year to these investors, you'll need to register as a payer for RWT. Our RWT on interest - payer’s guide - IR283 has the information you'll need if you pay interest and deduct RWT. Dividends and imputation If you're running a company, you may attach imputation credits to dividends you pay to shareholders. Shareholders can then be credited with the amount of tax paid by the company. This ensures tax is not paid on the dividend by both the company and the shareholder. The company paying the dividend also has to deduct 33% RWT from any part of the dividend that does not have imputation credits attached. For more information on dividends and imputation, read our Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - IR284 and Imputation - IR274. Provisional tax Provisional tax is not a separate tax but a way of paying your income tax as you receive income through the year. Provisional tax is paid in instalments throughout the year. For more information, read our Provisional tax guide - IR289. Are you liable for provisional tax? If your residual income tax is more than $5,000, you will have to pay provisional tax for the following year. 33 Income tax ird.govt.nz Residual income tax (RIT) RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families). You will know what your RIT is from your last tax return. Paying provisional tax There are 4 options for working out your provisional tax: • Accounting Income Method (AIM) • standard • estimation • ratio. AIM option The Accounting Income Method (AIM) bases your provisional tax instalments on your cash flows during the year. You need AIM-capable accounting software that will calculate your provisional tax payments for you (if any) at each instalment date using your accounting records. Standard option Your payments are calculated from either your: • last year’s residual income tax + 5%, or • residual income tax from 2 years ago + 10% if you have not completed last year’s return yet. Estimation option Another way to work out your provisional tax is to estimate what you think your RIT will be. To get the right rate, add up all your estimated income, work out the tax on the total, then subtract any tax credits (such as PAYE). Note If the amount you estimate is less than your actual RIT for that year, you may be charged interest on the underpaid amount. Ratio option You can only use this option if you're GST-registered and file either monthly or 2-monthly GST returns. Under this option, provisional tax is based on your GST turnover. We'll calculate the ratio based on your previous year's RIT and the total GST taxable supplies for the same year. The ratio calculation is: GST ratio percentage = RIT from your latest income tax return × 100 total GST taxable supplies from the same tax year (less ratio percentage adjustments) 1 To calculate provisional tax payments, you multiply the ratio percentage by your total taxable supplies for the 2-month period. If you file monthly, add (the taxable supplies for 2 return periods). You'll need to: • Let us know if you want to use the ratio option at the beginning of the tax year. You must meet all these criteria to use it: • You’ve been in business and registered for GST, for the whole of the previous tax year, and part of the tax year before that. • Your RIT for the previous year is greater than $5,000 and up to $150,000. • You file your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly. • You’re not a partnership. • Your ratio percentage that we calculate for you is between 0 and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not). 34 SMART BUSINESS Income tax Due dates for provisional tax Number of instalmentsPayments due 228 October and 7 May 328 August, 15 January and 7 May 628 June, 28 August, 28 October, 15 January, 28 February and 7 May 12 15 January, 28 January, 28 February, 28 March, 7 May, 28 May, 28 June, 28 July, 28 August, 28 September, 28 October, 28 November Example Leonie is a kiwifruit grower in Te Puke. She files 2 monthly GST returns. On 20 February 2019, she applies to use the ratio option to work out her 2020 provisional tax. We approve this and review her latest returns, which are for the 2018 year. Her 2018 RIT is $51,000, and her taxable supplies are $2,114,723, broken down as follows: GST return periodTaxable supplies ($) April - May 2017690,025 June - July 2017580,121 August - September 2017145,859 October - November 201790,412 December 2017 - January 2018152,681 February - March 2018455,625 Total taxable supplies$2,114,723 Leonie’s ratio percentage is: $51,000 × 100 = 2.4% $2,114,723 1 \*Your ratio percentage is rounded down to 1 decimal place. If you elect to use the ratio option, you'll need to either write to us or call us on 0800 377 774. Provisional tax instalments The number of provisional tax payments you'll need to make depends on how often you file GST returns and which provisional tax option you're using. If you're not registered for GST, you'll need to make 3 provisional tax payments. If you file your GST returns 6-monthly, you'll need to make 2 provisional tax payments. If you file your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly, and use the standard or estimation option for provisional tax, you'll need to make 3 provisional tax payments. If you use the ratio option, you'll need to make 6 provisional tax payments. If you use the AIM option your due dates for provisional tax are generally the same as your GST due dates: • monthly (if you're registered for monthly GST filing) or • 2-monthly (if you're registered for 2 or 6-monthly GST filing). If you're not registered for GST, your dates would be the 2-monthly GST due dates that align to your balance date. The table below shows when your provisional tax is due, if you have a 31 March balance date. We can tell you when your payments are due if your balance date is other than 31 March. You'll have to pay a late payment penalty and interest if you pay late or do not pay the full amount. 35 Income tax ird.govt.nz How do I pay provisional tax? Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about making payments by: • direct debit • credit or debit card • internet banking Provisional tax and GST If you're GST-registered and pay provisional tax, you make a combined payment on your GST provisional tax return. Budgeting for provisional tax Like all other business expenses, you have to budget ahead for your taxes, so it's important to know when the provisional tax payments are due and how much they will be. It's a good idea to use a separate bank account to put aside income to cover provisional tax payments. Provisional tax in your first year If you have not been budgeting and putting money aside in your first year, you'll have to pay all first year income tax in February, as well as paying provisional tax instalments for the coming year. Your end-of-year tax could be a significant amount if you do not have any voluntary payments to deduct. Voluntary payments will help and may entitle you to an early payment discount (see page 27). Provisional tax paid is deducted from the following year's residual income tax. The balance is either tax to pay or a refund. Interest In some circumstances you can be charged interest if the provisional tax you paid is less than your RIT. If the provisional tax you pay is more than your residual income tax, we may pay you interest on the difference.

Most of these expenses can be deducted from your sales and income to arrive at a net profit, and you pay income tax on this. Examples of deductible expenses are: • rent paid on business premises • repairs and maintenance on business items • stationery and supplies for the business • purchases of raw materials or trading stock • any FBT you've paid (see page 63) • electricity and telephone costs • business vehicle and transport costs • interest on money borrowed for the business • interest on underpayments of tax • gross wages paid to employees • employer superannuation contributions • insurance of business assets or premises • premiums paid for accident insurance • ACC levies • 50% of business entertainment costs (see page 40 for the tax rules on entertainment expenses) • for the 2010 income year and beyond, legal expenses incurred when buying capital assets used to derive taxable income, provided your total legal expenses for an income year are equal to or less than $10,000 • depreciation. Some business expenses paid for out of business income cannot be claimed as an income tax deduction. Examples of non-deductible expenses are: • the cost of plant and machinery • loan principal repayments • improvements to equipment (apart from repairs and maintenance) • private expenses, such as life insurance, interest on money borrowed for private purposes • drawings from the business • for the 2010 income year and beyond, legal fees for capital assets used to derive income when your total legal expenses exceed $10,000 • prior to the 2009-10 income year, any legal fees associated with the cost of buying capital assets for the business. Capital expenses It's important to be able to tell the difference between capital and revenue expenses. This is because revenue expenses are deductible while capital expenses are generally not. Capital expenses are usually one-off payments to buy assets that will be used to run the business. If you're unsure whether something you've bought is a capital expense, contact your business advisor or us. You cannot claim the full cost of capital items in the year they were purchased. Instead, their cost must be written off over a number of years. This is called depreciation and you'll find more information on page 42. 37 Expenses ird.govt.nz Using your own vehicle in the business If you're a sole trader or in a partnership and you use your own vehicle in the business, you can claim the running costs for income tax. If you use the vehicle strictly for business only, you can claim the full running costs, without making any adjustments. If you use it to travel from home to work, or any personal travel, you'll need to separate the running costs of your vehicle between business and private use. To do this, you must keep a logbook for at least 3 months, every 3 years, to work out the business share of the running costs. You'll need to record the distance, date and reason for the trip in the logbook. You can use the difference between the odometer readings at the start and end of the 3 months to work out the percentage of vehicle expenses you can claim. Example Sometimes Ross needs his own car for his plumbing business. The details Ross recorded in his logbook are shown below. Total distance travelled in 3 months: 2,610 km Distance travelled for business: 360 km 360 =13.8% 2,610 Ross can claim 13.8% of his vehicle expenses as a business expense. You can use the result of your 3 months' recording to claim the business share of your vehicle expenses over the next 3 years, provided your business use of the vehicle do not change by more than 20%. You should still keep records of the total vehicle running costs and record the total distance travelled for the income tax year. If you do not keep a vehicle logbook you may claim up to 25% of the vehicle running costs as a business expense. However, you could be asked to verify the percentage claimed. Alternatively, you may use the New Zealand Automobile Association Inc. or Inland Revenue mileage rates to make a claim on your vehicle. You can view these at ird.govt.nz/vehicle-expenses or call us on 0800 377 774 for more details. When a company owns a car, it claims all the expenses without making a private use adjustment. However, the company must pay FBT if the vehicle is available for employees' or shareholder- employees' private use. The company will also have to calculate GST on the fringe benefit. See page 63 for more information on fringe benefit tax.

You do not have to have an area specifically set aside for the business. If you're doing this, you can make a claim for the area so long as you keep a full record of all expenses you wish to claim. If there is not a separate area used for the business, the apportionment will need to take into account criteria such as the amount of time spent on income-earning activities and the area used at home. No deduction is permitted for any private or domestic expenditure. The responsibility for keeping invoices and records for a home office is the same as for any other business expenses you're claiming. You can claim a portion of the household expenses, such as the rates, insurance and power. You can also claim a portion of the mortgage interest and depreciation, if you own the house. You must keep invoices for these expenses. You can only claim the expenses that relate to the area used for business. Work out the percentage of the work area, compared to the total floor area of the house, then apply this percentage to the total house expenses. You may claim a proportion of the mortgage interest (not principal) paid during the year. From 1 April 2011 you're no longer able to claim depreciation on the house itself. If you've claimed depreciation on the house in the past, depreciation recovery will still apply. For more information on depreciation recovery see page 42. You can claim the depreciation on capital items such as a computer, office furniture and fittings, or shelving, used for business purposes in your home. See page 41 for more information on depreciation. Example In a house of 100 square metres Mereana uses 10 square metres as an office (10% of the total floor area). House expenses (GST- inclusive) for the full year were: Rates $ 2,100.00 Insurance (house) $ 700.00 Power $ 1,680.00 Total costs (including GST) $ 4,480.00 Multiply total costs by 3 and divide by 23 to get the GST content $ 584.35 Total costs (excluding GST) $ 3,895.65 If Mereana is not registered for GST, the amount to claim is 10% of the total costs including GST: $4,480 × 10% = $448 If Mereana is registered for GST, the amount to claim is 10% of the total costs excluding GST: $3895.65 × 10% = $389.56 Mereana can also claim 10% of the GST content on these items in the business’s GST returns. This is claimed throughout the year as the bills are due or paid. Square metre rate option Instead of working out how much of your household expenses will be apportioned to your business, you can use the square metre rate option. This uses a rate that is set each year based on the average cost of utilities per square metre of housing for the average New Zealand household. The rate for the current year can be found on ird.govt.nz This rate does not include premises costs of mortgage interest, rates or rent. You can also claim a portion of these based on the percentage of floor area used for the business. 39 Expenses ird.govt.nz The equation for the square metre rate option is: (a × b) + (c × d) Where: a is the total amount of mortgage interest, rates and rent you have paid during the year b is the area calculated by c, divided by the total floor area c is the total area (in square metres) of your home that is separately identifiable and used primarily for the business d is the square metre rate that is published by Inland Revenue. Claiming home internet used for business purposes Home internet costs will generally be a private expense of the household and not claimable. However if you run your business from home you may sometimes need to use the internet as part of carrying on your business. The portion of the expenditure relating to business usage may be claimable as a business expense. You cannot claim any part of the internet expense relating to the household's private usage. How the proportion of business-related internet expense is calculated will depend on the type of internet plan you have. You must calculate the business proportion you claim by a method that ensures a fair and reasonable result. You must also meet normal record keeping requirements. Telephone costs You may claim a deduction for telephone rental if you run your business or organisation from your home. If your home is the centre of operations or management for the business, you may claim a deduction of 50% of the telephone rental. Identify those toll calls that are business related and highlight them on your phone bill. If you have a separate commercial and domestic line rental, you can claim the full cost of the commercial line for both income tax and GST, but none of the domestic rental. If you make any private calls on the business line, you'll have to make an adjustment for them. Travel expenses If you spend time travelling as part of your business, you can claim business travel as an expense. A good way to prove the business portion of your travel expenses is by keeping a diary of your travels. In addition to invoices and tickets you should also keep details of: • the reasons for the trip • the date of the trip • your itinerary • the cost of car hire and air, bus and taxi fares • the cost of accommodation, meals and incidentals • the time spent on business and non-business activities. Note The cost of travelling from home to work is not a tax-deductible expense. Entertainment expenses If you provide entertainment for staff or clients, some of these business entertainment expenses are fully tax deductible and some may only be 50% deductible. Some examples of fully deductible entertainment expenses that are completely business related and not liable for FBT include: • meals an employee buys while travelling on business (unless it is with an existing or potential business contact, or the meal is a celebration, reception or similar event – in these situations it would only be 50% deductible) • food and drink provided at a conference, education course or similar event that lasts at least 4 hours (unless the conference is mainly for entertainment – in which case it would only be 50% deductible) • light meals provided in a dining room for senior managers and consumed as part of their duties (such as sandwiches provided during a board meeting) 40 SMART BUSINESS Expenses • entertainment that promotes your business publicly (the public must have the same access to this as your employees, business contacts or people associated with the business – if the public has less access it would only be 50% deductible) • entertainment that is only a secondary part of either a function that is open to the public, or any trade display (for example serving coffee at your business’s trade display) • freebies promoting your business (such as branded stationery, but excluding any given to employees or people associated with you – these are only 50% deductible) • entertainment provided to someone who is going to review it for publication (such as giving a free meal to food critics) • entertainment provided at a discount, if your business regularly provides entertainment at market prices (for example offering half-price meals at your restaurant) • entertainment enjoyed outside of New Zealand. Some entertainment expenses are only 50% deductible if they are not completely business related and not liable for FBT. This includes entertainment that is away from work or out of usual working hours, so that it has a ‘significant private element’. The expense will be 50% deductible even if you think the private element was more or less than 50%. Examples of this include: • entertainment at sports or cultural events (for example a corporate box) • business use of a holiday home • hiring a boat, and providing food and drink to people on it • food and drink you provide for social events (such as parties) or in an area set aside for senior employees (though there is an exception for ‘light meals’ consumed as part of the manager’s duties, which are 100% deductible) • gifts of food and drink that benefit your business and are enjoyed privately by the person who receives them (for example if you give a bottle of wine to each customer who buys a car off you) • ‘supporting expenses’ for other entertainment that’s 50% deductible (such as hire of wine glasses and wait staff for a party). Other entertainment expenses will be 100% deductible and liable for FBT if they are received by employees because of the work they do. Examples of this include rewards for good performance, such as a restaurant gift voucher or a weekend away. To support your claims for business entertainment expenses you should keep invoices and receipts. For more help, refer to our booklet Entertainment expenses IR268. Website expenses In general a website is a capital asset and the costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Ongoing costs of updating or adding to the information on a website are of a revenue nature, and are deductible when incurred if they meet the general test of deductibility. For more help Go to ird.govt.nz/business-expenses Fixed assets records An asset is something the business owns. A fixed asset is an asset you generally expect to use in your business for more than a year. You cannot deduct the full cost of purchasing these assets from your taxable income in the year of purchase. You can, however, claim depreciation. You need to prove the purchase and sale of any fixed asset with a taxable supply information. If you start using a private asset for business purposes or if you keep business assets for private use after you stop operating, you must confirm that the asset is valued at market value. This may mean getting an independent valuation. Using a fixed asset register is a good way to keep track of these assets. Note The cost or value excludes GST if you are registered for GST. 41 Expenses ird.govt.nz Depreciation Depreciation allows for the wear and tear on a fixed asset and must be deducted from your income. You must claim depreciation on fixed assets used in your business that have a useful lifespan of more than 12 months. However, not all fixed assets can be depreciated - for example land. You'll have to keep a fixed asset register to show assets you'll be depreciating. This should show the depreciation claimed and adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is the asset's cost price, less all depreciation calculated since purchase. Depreciation rates The depreciation rates for various assets are set by us, and are based on the cost and useful life of the asset being depreciated. Depreciation methods In most circumstances you can choose between the diminishing value and straight-line methods of calculating depreciation. You do not have to use the same method for all your assets, but you must use whatever method you choose for an asset for the full year. You can change methods for any asset from year to year. Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards is not entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you've entered into a contract to purchase an asset prior to or on 20 May 2010, then you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance.

This value is the original cost, less any depreciation already claimed in previous years. If you're registered for GST, the original cost price should not include GST you've already claimed in your GST return. Example A New Zealand-new car was purchased on 1 April 2009 using the depreciation rate of 24% diminishing value. The cost (excluding GST) was $30,000. Year 1Year 2Year 3 Cost price$30,000$30,000$30,000 Less depreciation already claimed $ 0$ 7,200$12,672 Adjusted tax value $30,000$22,800$17,328 Depreciation rate 24%24%24% Claim this amount $ 7,200$ 5,472$ 4,159 Straight line depreciation Depreciation is calculated on the original cost price of the asset, and the same amount is claimed each year. If you're registered for GST, the cost excludes any GST you've already claimed in your GST return. Example The car in the previous example is depreciated using the straight line method, at a rate of 16.2%. The GST-exclusive cost is $30,000 so the depreciation to claim each year is: $30,000 × 16.2% = $4,860 Pooling assets You may use a pool system to depreciate low-value assets collectively rather than individually and depreciate them as though they were a single asset. You must use diminishing value depreciation rates for pooled assets. You can pool assets that: • individually cost $2,000 or less, or have been depreciated so the adjusted tax value is $2,000 or less, and • are used 100% for business, or are liable for FBT if the business use is less than 100%. Each pool is depreciated using the diminishing value method, at the lowest rate applying to any asset in the pool. Electing not to depreciate Although it's mandatory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you do not want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when that depreciation was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. Let us know if you're making an election by notifying us in your tax return for the income year when: • you purchase your asset • you change the use of your asset from non-business to business • you elect not to depreciate an asset that you have never claimed depreciation on. The election for this asset will apply for each year after the asset was purchased. The focus is on an asset-by-asset election as to whether to depreciate each item or not. Once you have notified us of your election not to depreciate an asset you cannot claim depreciation on it in future years. An example of where you may not want to claim depreciation is where you work from home and you have a small area set aside for business purposes, such as an office. Where depreciation has been claimed and the asset is then sold If you claim depreciation on an asset, you must include the depreciation recovered in your tax return when you cease using the asset for business purposes, or you sell the asset. This also applies to buildings that were previously depreciated. 43 Expenses ird.govt.nz Where depreciation has been claimed on the business area of your home If you claim depreciation on the business area set aside in your home, you must include the depreciation recovered in your tax return when you cease using your home for business purposes, or when you sell your home. The following example is based on a house owned between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 2005. Using the straight line method, 3% depreciation was claimed on a home office for 5 years. The business uses 10% of the total floor area of the house. Example Original purchase price of house (excluding land value) $250,000 Total depreciation claimed (over 5 years) $ 3,750 Adjusted tax value$246,250 Sale price$440,000 Gain on sale$193,750 Depreciation recovered $ 3,750 When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the lesser of: • the original cost price of the building, minus the adjusted tax value, or • the sale price, minus the adjusted tax value. Computer software The cost of software is a capital expense and must be depreciated. The cost includes paying for rights to use, purchasing upgrades and developing inhouse packages. For more help If you'd like more information about depreciation, or you need a full table of rates, see our booklets Depreciation - IR260 and General depreciation rates - IR265. We also have an interactive depreciation rate finder and calculator available at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators 44 SMART BUSINESS Expenses GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. GST registration You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. A business must have a taxable activity to register for GST. A ‘taxable activity’ is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services to another person for consideration. If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR. The GST registration confirmation we send you includes your: • GST number (this may be the same as your IRD number) • registration start date • accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • your taxable period and filing frequency (how often you need to file returns). If you register voluntarily for GST, and later decide this was a mistake, you can cancel your registration in myIR. Part 6 - GST (goods and services tax) Using myIR or accounting software to file GST returns Filing online in myIR or your accounting software makes it easier for you to meet your GST requirements. It’s simple, secure, and immediate. myIR myIR is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and provides instant confirmation you’ve filed and faster processing of your returns: • Convenience: by completing your GST return online, you can avoid postage costs and delays. When combined with electronic banking, the entire online process gives you greater certainty. • Confidence: you’ll get a time stamped receipt confirming your return has been successfully filed for us to process. You can save and/or print the confirmation page for your reference. • Fixing mistakes: if you make a mistake you can easily fix the error in myIR to correct it. • Faster refunds: it’s quicker to file in myIR and there are no post delays associated with paper- based returns. Using accounting software You can file GST returns using accounting software. Accounting software benefits include: • your GST return is pre-populated, so you do not need to copy figures into your myIR or paper return • instant confirmation your return is filed. Confirm with your software provider if this filing feature is available as part of their software package. 45 GST ird.govt.nz Charging and claiming GST If you’re registered for GST, you’ll need to charge GST at 15% on most taxable supplies you make. This means you pay 15% of the price you charge for your goods and services to us. You can claim back the GST you have been charged on goods and services used in your taxable activity. • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. GST on grants and subsidies GST is often included in grants and wage subsidies from the government and public authorities. If you’re registered for GST and you receive a grant or subsidy, you will usually need to pay the GST to us. For more help Our booklet Grants and subsidies - IR249 provides more help for not-for-profit organisations in working out their GST. What GST is not charged on Some goods and services do not have GST added to them. These are: • sales by an unregistered person • sales of private property (for example a car or home not used for business) • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they’re not included in your GST return. These include: • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • donated products and services which are sold by not-for profit organisations • rent paid on a private home • penalty interest. You cannot claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You do not show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services are not exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • exported goods • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • sale of land. If you make zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. For more information on exempt and zero-rated supplies go to ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst or the GST guide - IR375 and GST plus guide - IR546. Filing GST returns If you’re GST registered you’re required to file regular GST returns. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you’ve collected and the amount of GST you’ve paid. • If you’ve paid out more GST than you’ve collected, you’ll receive a GST refund. • If you’ve collected more GST than you’ve paid, you’ll need to pay the difference to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you’re registered. Choosing your filing frequency You can choose your GST return filing frequency (how often you file) – monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Your taxable period for 2 or 6 monthly returns must align to your balance date. If you do not choose a taxable period when you register, we’ll put you on the 2-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this does not suit. Send a message in myIR telling us which taxable period and filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we’ll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - do not change until we confirm this with you. 46 SMART BUSINESS GST If you’re registering for GST and you’re also liable for provisional tax, you’ll need to match your GST taxable period with your balance date. For example if you file your GST returns 2-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April-May, June- July, August-September, October-November, December-January, February-March. Monthly • You must file monthly returns if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period. • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you’re entitled to frequent GST refunds. 2-monthly • Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period. • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months aligned to your balance date. Filing returns every 2 months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements and in touch with your business’s progress. 6-monthly • Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period. • For a GST group the $500,000 applies to the group as a whole. You can apply for this option if your business has just a few transactions. You only need to file 2 GST returns a year, but it can be a big job for 6 months’ worth of trading in one go. When to file your returns We’ll send you a reminder in myIR your GST return is ready for you to file. The reminder includes the due date for filing and making any payment. The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: • 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year • 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Remember, file and pay on time to avoid late filing penalties, late payment penalties and interest. Late filing penalty If you do not file your return by the due date you may have to pay a late filing penalty. These are: • $50 for each return filed on the payments basis • $250 for each return filed on the invoice or hybrid basis. Late payment penalties and interest are charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? There are 3 ways of accounting for GST—payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. You can change your accounting basis after you’ve registered in myIR. Payments basis Under the payments basis you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps you manage your cash flow because you only pay us GST after you’ve received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you’ve paid for. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you provided an invoice to your customers or received an invoice from your supplier. 47 GST ird.govt.nz Accounting basisWho is eligibleWhat you need to do Payments basisIf your total sales are: • $2 million or less in the last 12 months • likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of a month. In your GST return for the period include: • amounts you’ve been paid by customers • amounts you’ve paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basisAnyoneIn your GST return for the period include: • amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet • the full sale price if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them • amounts you’ve been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Even if you have not paid them yet. Hybrid basisAnyone Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. In your GST return: • use the invoice basis for your sales • use the payments basis for your expenses. Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. Note The hybrid method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). 48 SMART BUSINESS GST Taxable supply information The requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as ‘taxable supply information’. Taxable supply information refers to the minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply. In the past, you needed to keep tax invoices, credit and debit notes as records of sales or purchases. But now, you can use a combination of several records to support the figures in your GST returns. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Taxable supply information includes invoices, but it can also include information held in other forms, such as supplier agreements, contracts, and bank statements. Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer’s and seller’s software, for example PEPPOL eInvoicing. You should provide taxable supply information such as an invoice, receipt or other documentation when you sell goods or services. If the sale is $200 or less (including GST), you can issue a receipt instead. You need to keep taxable supply information to claim GST on your purchases and expenses relating to your taxable activity. 49 GST ird.govt.nz Taxable supply information buyers and sellers must keep Taxable supply amounts $200 or lessMore than $200 and up to $1,000 More than $1,000 Seller’s details• Name or trade name of the seller • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number Buyer’s details• Not required• Not required• Name, and 1 or more of the following: - address (physical or postal) - contact phone number - email address - trading name if different to the buyer’s name - New Zealand business number or website URL address Date• Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date • Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date • Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date Information on the goods or services • Description of the goods or services • Description of the goods or services • Description of the goods or services Payment information • The consideration for the supply. Consideration can be a • payment • act • holding back from using a legal right - for example, forgiving debt instead of enforcing payment. An unconditional gift paid to a not-for-profit organisation is not consideration for a supply. Either • GST exclusive amount, • GST amount, and • GST inclusive amount Or • GST inclusive amount and • a statement GST is included, charged at the standard rate for all the goods and services listed Either • GST exclusive amount, • GST amount, and • GST inclusive amount Or • GST inclusive amount and • a statement GST is included, charged at the standard rate for all the goods and services listed 50 SMART BUSINESS GST Taxable supply information must be provided to GST registered buyers within 28 days of a request (or by an alternative date agreed to by the parties) for supplies more than $200. Invoices must be in New Zealand currency. Taxable supply information should only be provided once. If the buyer loses theirs, you can provide a copy. You do not need to mark it as a copy. GST and secondhand goods If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there is no invoice or GST charged. If the purchaser is GST-registered and buying the goods to use in their taxable activity, they can make a secondhand goods GST claim after payment has been made. To do this the purchaser must record: • the name and address of the supplier • the date of the purchase • a description of the goods • the quantity of the goods • the price paid. Note Special rules apply if you purchase secondhand goods from an associated person. For more information see our GST guide - IR375. Supply correction information Supply correction information (formerly known as debit and credit notes) must be provided when the taxable supply information included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a supply they have made. It does not matter whether the buyer has already paid for the goods or services. Examples of when corrections may be required: • the supply is cancelled • all or some of the goods are returned to the seller • some of the goods were not delivered to the buyer • there is an incorrect description of the goods or services • incorrect seller information included • incorrect buyer details included • the date is incorrect • GST is calculated at the wrong rate • an incorrect GST amount is charged. You can include supply correction information for a previous supply in the same document as taxable supply information, for a new supply. The seller must include the supply correction information in the GST return for the period it was provided in. For more information about supply correction information go to ird.govt.nz/gst For more help with GST Visit our website ird.govt.nz/gst or read our GST guide - IR375 for full information on GST obligations and adjustments. 51 GST ird.govt.nz Part 7 - More information Accident compensation The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) invoices you directly for levies, based on your self-employed income. We’re required to give ACC information about your self-employed income. Income tax, GST and ACC levies Your ACC levies are deductible for income tax purposes. This means you can claim them as a deduction from your business profits. If you’re registered for GST, you can also claim the GST component of the levies as an expense. Independent earner tax credit (IETC) IETC is a tax credit for individual New Zealand tax residents whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $70,000. You’ll qualify for it if: • you or your partner are not entitled to Working for Families • you or your partner do not receive any overseas equivalent of Working for Families • you are not receiving an income-tested benefit, NZ Super, a veteran’s pension, or an overseas equivalent of these. Entitlement to IETC is determined monthly. If you do not meet the criteria for any part of a month, you will not qualify for that whole month. If your annual net income is between $24,000 and $66,000 inclusive you’ll receive a tax credit of $520 ($10 per week). If you’re eligible but earn over $66,000 your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every additional dollar earned. If you’re an employee, you can receive the IETC as part of your regular pay. You’ll need to select a new tax code by completing a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to your employer. You can only choose a new tax code for your main, or highest, source of salary/wage income. If you’re unsure if you will qualify for the IETC you can continue to use the same tax code. Any IETC entitlement will be calculated in your income tax assessment at the end of the tax year. The new tax codes are: • ME for non-student loan borrowers who qualify • ME SL for student loan borrowers who qualify. If you’re self-employed you can claim the IETC when you complete your Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of the year. Student loan repayments Self-employed people may have to repay their student loans by making interim payments throughout the year. Interim payments are generally due in 3 instalments. The instalment due dates are: • 28 August • 15 January • 7 May. You pay 12 cents for every dollar of your income over the repayment threshold. If you’re self- employed or you have other income, you’ll need to file an IR3 tax return, and we’ll send you an end-of-year repayment obligation notice once we process your return. The interim payment amount you have to pay will be calculated at the same time as your end-of-year repayment obligation and will be shown on your student loan end-of-year repayment obligation notice. \* Net income means your total income from all sources less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). If your only income is from salary or wages (and you do not have any allowable expenses, for example income protection insurance) your net income will be your annual salary or wages before tax. 52 SMART BUSINESS More information Budgeting for student loan repayments When you’re self-employed it’s important to budget for your student loan repayments. If you do not budget and/or put money aside for this, you could end up having to pay all your repayments in one go in February, and you may be required to make interim payments for the coming year. Note Interim payments are based on your previous year’s end-of-year repayment obligation. Some ideas to help you budget for student loan repayments include: • setting up a separate bank account and putting money aside for student loan repayments (and taxes) • making voluntary repayments. You’ll pay your loan off faster and you’re less likely to have to pay a lump sum at the end of the year. For more help If you’d like more information, go to ird.govt.nz/se-repay-student-loan Working for Families Working for Families (WfF) is an entitlement for families with dependent children 18 years or under. There are different types of payments and you may qualify for one or more, depending on your family situation. How much you can get depends on: • how many dependent children you have (children who are 18 years or younger who you support financially) • the age of the children in your care • your family income - how much you and your spouse or partner earn • where your family income comes from, for example, salary or wages, business, a student allowance or a benefit • any shared care arrangements • the number of hours you work each week. The payment types are: Family tax credit The most widely received payment, paid regardless of your source of income. The amount you receive depends on how much you earn, the number of children you have and any shared care arrangements. In-work tax credit In-work tax credit is for families who are in paid work. You cannot get in-work tax credit if you get an income tested benefit or student allowance. From 1 April 2021, you will keep receiving the in-work tax credit payments for up to 2 weeks during an unpaid break from work. For example changing jobs, leaving employment, or unpaid time such as school holidays. If you or your partner start receiving an income- tested benefit or student allowance, your payments will stop. Minimum family tax credit Minimum family tax credit is a payment made to families with dependent children aged 18 or younger, so they have a set minimum income each week after tax. If their annual family income is below a set amount after tax, they may be able to get the minimum family tax credit. The rates change every year, go to ird.govt.nz/new-to-wff for the current rates. A single parent must be working at least 20 hours a week as an employee. In a 2-parent family, the parents must be working at least 30 hours a week between them as an employee. If you and/or your spouse or partner would normally work the required weekly hours but are injured and are paid accident compensation instead, you can still qualify for the minimum family tax credit. Best Start tax credit You can get this payment for up to 3 years after a new child arrives. Best Start tax credit is not adjusted for income levels in the child’s first year but is adjusted for income levels in the second and third year. Go to ird.govt.nz/working-for-families for the current rate and income adjustment levels. 53 More information ird.govt.nz You can use our calculator ‘Estimate your Working for Families Tax Credits’ on our website to get an estimate of what your entitlement will be. How to register The quickest and easiest way to register for WfF is in your myIR account at ird.govt.nz otherwise, you can call us on 0800 227 773 to register over the phone. Make sure you have your IRD number handy. If you have business income you’ll need to include details, for example a set of accounts to support your estimate, when you register. Note If you register for Best Start tax credit only, you will not need to provide your income details until just before your child turns one. Once we process your registration, we’ll work out the amount you’re entitled to receive. If you asked to be paid weekly or fortnightly you’ll get a letter showing how much you’re entitled to receive. This letter is your notice of entitlement. If you’ve chosen the lump sum option, we’ll send you a letter acknowledging your application and work out your lump sum entitlement after the end of the tax year. If you’re in business, you’ll need to file an IR3 to allow us to calculate your entitlement based on your income. Research and development (R&D) loss tax credit For income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015, you may be able to ‘cash out’ (have refunded) up to 28% of any tax losses associated with an eligible research and development (R&D) activity, if your business is a company. You may be eligible to apply for the credit if your business is: • a loss-making company, • a tax resident in New Zealand, and • your expenditure on R&D salary and wages is 20% or more of your total salary and wage expenditure.

You can get a First-time employer’s guide - IR333 from our website. It tells what you need to know before you register, and how to register. Once you’ve registered we’ll send you all the information you need. You can view or download the Employer’s guide - IR335 and KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4, which explains all your responsibilities as an employer, at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Main responsibilities • You must deduct PAYE from your employees’ wages and pay the deductions to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of PAYE deducted by the business. • Make your payment by the due date either electronically through your bank, or by credit or debit card through our website. • Get new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330. This tells you the tax code to use. If any employees do not give you a completed IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at a higher rate (the non-notified rate - see the IR335). • Get new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. This tells you the tax rate to use. If any contractors do not give you a completed IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at a higher rate (the non-notified rate - see the IR335). If they have completed the IR330C but have not chosen a tax rate to apply to their schedular payments on page 1, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. • Give new employees a KiwiSaver information pack. This includes our factsheet Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3, KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 and the New employee opt-out request - KS10 form within 7 days of their starting work. • Deduct KiwiSaver from employees’ wages, if required. • Make KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions, if required. • Calculate and deduct any ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax), if required (see page 61). • Deduct child support from employees’ wages, if required. • Deduct loan repayments from any student loan borrowers who work for you. • Deduct extra student loan deductions if requested by your employee or us. • Provide new and departing employees’ address information, along with their date of birth – if they have provided it to you. • Complete an Employment information - IR348 with the details of each employee’s income and deductions (see pages 57 and 58). • Pay FBT on any fringe benefits (perks) you give to your employees (see page 63). • Deduct employee donations for payroll giving, if required. • Include the value of any employee share scheme benefits in a separate line on your Employment information - IR348 (see the IR335 for more information). Is your worker an employee or a contractor? The tax laws are different for employees and self-employed people, so it’s really important you know whether the people working for you are your employees or are self-employed contractors. Generally, if you control what the person does and how and where the work is done, that person is your employee. If you treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax, you could be prosecuted and fined and still have to pay the PAYE you should have deducted. 55 Employer responsibilities ird.govt.nz If you hire a self-employed contractor to do a job for your business, that contractor is not your employee. However, if the job done is one of those listed in the PAYE deduction tables or on the back of the IR330C, you must deduct tax and pay this to us. The contractor must fill in an IR330C form. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption - IR331 or is a company (except a company that is a non-resident contractor or non-resident entertainer or involved in agriculture, horticulture or viticulture), you do not have to deduct tax. Generally, a COE cannot apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. Similarly, if the type of work done is not listed in the PAYE deduction tables, you do not need to deduct tax. In these cases, the contractor is responsible for paying their own tax. The exception to this is if you have a written agreement with the contractor stating their payments will be treated as schedular payments. For more help Our pamphlet Self employed or an employee? - IR336 can help you work out whether your worker is an employee. Deducting PAYE New employees must fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330. This involves filling in their personal details and choosing a tax code. Employees need to fill in a new IR330 if they want to change their tax code. You must keep all IR330s with your business records for 7 years after the last wages paid to the employee. The tax code is important because you work out how much PAYE to deduct from the worker’s wages, based on the tax code they’ve chosen. Most employees use a primary tax code (M or ME) because they have one regular job. If an employee is already using the primary code for another job, they must use a secondary code (SB, S, SH, ST or SA) or a tailored tax code for their job with you. If they have a student loan to repay, they will need to use M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL, or SA SL. Working out the PAYE Your employee gives you an IR330 with their personal details and a tax code. The employee will need to read the notes on the IR330 to work out the correct tax code. Using our online calculator or the PAYE deduction tables, work out the PAYE and any KiwiSaver and student loan deductions from the employee’s gross earnings.

Use the PAYE tables to work out how much to deduct, then transfer this figure into your wage book. You need to show extra student loan deductions, either requested by us or your employee, separately in your wage book. If we’ve requested the deductions we’ll tell you how much to deduct. If your employee has requested them, they’ll tell you how much they want deducted. If any of your employees are liable for child support, we’ll work out the amount to be deducted and contact you. Completing your employment information Each payday you must complete your employment information return (IR348) with details of your employees’ gross wages and deductions. Electronic filing You must file electronically if your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is $50,000 or more unless you have an exemption from us. You must complete your employment information electronically within 2 working days of the payday. To file your employment information electronically you have 3 options: • onscreen in myIR, • file transfer in myIR, or • direct from payroll software using our Gateway services. Paper return filing If your annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $50,000, you can choose to file by paper. You’ll need to complete your employment information return within 10 working days of the payday, or the 15th and end of the month if you choose to send us information twice a month. Paying PAYE If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $500,000 in the previous year ended 31 March, PAYE is due on the 20th of the month following the month of deduction. If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is $500,000 or more, you are required to pay PAYE: • from wages paid between the 1st and the 15th of the month by the 20th of the same month • from wages paid between the 16th and the end of the month by the 5th of the following month, except for the second period of December, which is due 15 January. It’s a good idea to put PAYE aside from all other funds until it’s time to pay it. There are penalties if you do not deduct or account for PAYE properly. Penalties and interest are charged for any late payments. For more information see our Employer’s guide - IR335. Employees’ ACC earners’ levy The PAYE deductions you make from employees’ salaries and wages have 2 components - a tax deduction and an ACC earners’ levy deduction. The PAYE deduction includes the ACC earners’ levy amount, so you do not need to make a separate calculation. We pay the earners’ levy to ACC. Most earnings you deduct PAYE from are liable for earners’ levy. The main exceptions are redundancy and retirement payments - how to correctly tax these is covered in the Employer’s guide - IR335. Earners’ levy is deducted from income earned up to a threshold specified in the PAYE deduction tables. 58 SMART BUSINESS Employer responsibilities Income tax You can claim a deduction for the total gross wages paid. Student loan deductions When an employee has a student loan they must use the M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL tax code on their IR330. You must then start deducting student loan repayments. The amount to be deducted is included in the PAYE tables. Student loan extra deductions Your employee may ask you to make extra deductions to pay off their loan faster. We may also ask you to make compulsory extra deductions to catch up on an underpayment. These deductions are in addition to the amount you normally deduct using the tax code they’ve given you. You must show extra deductions separately on your employment information return in either: 1. SLBOR - employee requests voluntary extra deductions 2. SLCIR - we request you to make compulsory extra deductions. You’ll need to keep records of PAYE and student loan repayments separately in your wage books. See page 22 for an example of a wage book. Note You do not have to deduct student loan repayments from schedular payments to contractors. Child support deductions We assess and collect child support from parents not living with their children. We then pass on payments to the person caring for the child or children, or the government, if that person receives a benefit. If you are required to deduct child support payments from an employee’s pay, we’ll send you a notice advising you of the amount to deduct. Protected earnings If an employee pays their child support through employer deductions, 60% of their wage is protected. This means that Child Support can take up to, but no more than, 40% of an employee’s wage or salary. However, if a paying parent has more than 1 source of income, they can have more than 40% of their wage or salary deducted. We’ll advise you how much to deduct. Your employees’ child support information and commitments are confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone except our child support staff and the employee. If you have any questions please call us on 0800 220 222. Deducting arrears We may send you a notice asking you to deduct tax and/or student loan arrears from salary or wages paid to an employee or schedular payments to a contractor. • You’re required to make the deductions requested in the notice. • Child support payments (if applicable) must be deducted before tax or student loan arrears. • Arrears must be paid to us by the end of each calendar month, separately from PAYE. • Do not include deductions for arrears in your employment information return. Instructions on how to pay these deductions are included in the deduction notice. 59 Employer responsibilities ird.govt.nz KiwiSaver You must make KiwiSaver available to all employees (unless you have an exemption). As an employer you’re required to: • check whether new employees are eligible to join KiwiSaver • check whether new employees should be automatically enrolled • give the KiwiSaver information pack to: - new employees who qualify for automatic enrolment, and - existing employees who want to opt in • provide information to us about: - all new employees who qualify for automatic enrolment, and - eligible employees who want to opt in to KiwiSaver • provide new employees with a written statement if you have an employer-chosen scheme, and the scheme’s investment statement. KiwiSaver employee deductions If your employees are enrolled in KiwiSaver you’ll need to: • make deductions from your employee’s gross pay at the rate they have specified (either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) or at the default rate of 3% if they do not choose a rate • pay the deductions to us by the due date along with your PAYE payments • action opt-out requests and savings suspension notification • stop or start deductions when we advise you to make compulsory employer contributions. KiwiSaver employer contributions You must make compulsory employer contributions to all employees enrolled in KiwiSaver (or any other complying superannuation scheme) at the rate of 3%. Note You can find more information about KiwiSaver at ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver or in the KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you provide employee share scheme (ESS) benefits you can choose whether to deduct tax from them. Deducting tax is optional because it will not suit all employee share schemes. If PAYE is withheld then student loan and child support amounts must also be deducted (if applicable). Employee share scheme benefits are not liable for ACC earners’ levy or KiwiSaver deductions. You can choose whether or not to deduct tax on an employee by employee basis and on a benefit basis for each employee. Whether you choose to deduct taxes from the ESS benefit or not, you’re still required to list the value of the shares on the employment information return unless it arises from an exempt employee share scheme. You will need to report the taxable value of any ESS benefit based on the 20th day after the share scheme taxing date. There are 2 methods you can use to determine when the taxable value of an ESS benefit needs to be reported. Option 1 • If the 20th day falls between the 1st and the 15th of a month the information must be reported treating the 15th as the payday • If the 20th day falls between the 16th and the end of the month the information must be reported treating the last day of the month as the payday. Option 2 • The employer can treat the 20th day as the payday and report the value of the ESS benefit to us more regularly. 60 SMART BUSINESS Employer responsibilities Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support chosen approved donee organisations. You choose whether to set up payroll giving and how it will run. It is your employee’s choice to participate. To offer payroll giving, you'll need to complete your employment information return electronically. For more information see our Payroll giving - IR617 guide. Employer’s superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer's contribution is a monetary amount paid made to a superannuation fund, by an employer, for the benefit of their employees. A superannuation fund is a scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. All employer contributions paid to a superannuation fund, including KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, are liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax). The exception to this is if you and your employee have agreed to treat some or all the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. If your employee asks you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. ESCT There are 2 options for calculating tax on employer contributions: • If you and your employee agree, the amount of employer contribution can be treated as the employee’s salary or wages and PAYE must be deducted. • In all other cases ESCT must be deducted. ESCT is calculated at a rate based on the employee’s total annual salary or wages, plus gross employer contributions for the previous tax year (1 April to 31 March). If employees have not worked for you for the full previous tax year, the rate is based on the employee’s total salary or wages, plus gross employer contributions you estimate they will receive in the current year ESCT is being calculated for. Note Employer contributions to a defined benefit fund can choose to apply ESCT at the flat rate of 39%. If you’re not treating the employer contributions as part of the employee's salary or wages, you must deduct ESCT at the time of making any employer contributions. If you do not do this, the ESCT is worked out on the grossed-up amount of the employer's superannuation contribution. Pay any ESCT with your PAYE deductions by the due date. ESCT rate based on employee salary or wages The ESCT rate is based on the employee’s total annual salary or wages, plus gross employer contributions received in the previous standard tax year (1 April to 31 March). The tax rate is used for all employer superannuation contributions made in the current year. Employee's salary or wage income for year ended 31 March ESCT from 1 April $0-$16,80010.50% $16,801-$57,60017.50% $57,601-$84,00030.00% $84,001 - $216,00033.00% $216,001 upwards39.00% \* This includes gross superannuation employer contributions. ESCT is calculated on the whole dollar and is deducted from the gross employer contribution. 61 Employer responsibilities ird.govt.nz Example Regan's Trucks Ltd employs John and makes employer's contributions on his behalf. John is not a KiwiSaver or complying fund member. He worked at Regan's Trucks Ltd for the full year 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, receiving a salary of $36,400 and employer contributions of $1,820. For the 2025 tax year, Regan's Trucks Ltd elected to tax the employer's contributions using a rate based on John's previous year's salary and employer contributions. Because his salary, plus gross employer contributions, was between $16,801 and $57,600, the ESCT rate is 17.5%. John's salary is now $39,000, or $750 per week. Regan's Trucks Ltd's contribution to John's superannuation is $37.50 (5%) of his salary a week. The amount paid to John's superannuation is not shown in the employment information return. If the superannuation contribution amount includes ESCT, the ESCT calculation is: $37.50 x 17.5% = $6.56 The amount passed to John's superannuation scheme is $30.94 ($37.50 - $6.56) and ESCT of $6.56 is shown in the employer information return. If the superannuation contribution amount excludes ESCT, the ESCT calculation is: $37.50 x 17.5% = $7.95 82.5% The amount passed on to John's superannuation is $37.50 and the ESCT amount of $7.95 is shown on the employment information return. If the employee did not work for the employer for the full year 1 April to 31 March, the employer must: • estimate the amount of salary or wages and gross superannuation employer contributions that will be earned by the employee in the current year, and • base the ESCT rate on the estimate. Example Regan's Trucks Ltd employs Matt on 1 October 2024. Matt's on a contract for salary of $30,000 and employer contributions of $1,500 a year. The company estimates Matt's ESCT rate based on the amount of salary or wages plus gross employer contributions he will earn in the remainder of this tax year (1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025)\*. Salary $ 30,000 Employer contributions $ 1,500 Total $ 31,500 $31,500 ÷ 12 months $ 2,625 $ 2,625 × 6 months $ 15,7500 Because the estimate of $15,750 is between $0 and $16,800 the ESCT rate is 10.5%. \* There are only 6 months left in the tax year. If an employee is only employed for 3 months the employer would estimate how much the employee would earn in those 3 months and base the ESCT rate on the estimation. Note As the employee started part-way through the current tax year, the employer must make a second estimation of the employee’s earnings as the basis for the ESCT rate at the beginning of the following tax year (1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026). There is no requirement to adjust the rate during an income year if an employee’s salary or wages increases or decreases. If they do change during the year, affecting the applicable rate, a new rate will be set the following year based on this change. Paying ESCT Pay the ESCT deducted with your PAYE by the due date. Taxing contributions at the employee’s personal tax rate If employers agree, employees can elect to have all or part of the value of the employer contribution included in their gross salary or wages and taxed at their personal tax rates. The actual employer contribution is paid into the superannuation fund - the employee does not receive the contribution in the hand. 62 SMART BUSINESS Employer responsibilities The value of the employer contribution will be added to the employee’s gross wages for the pay period and taxed at the appropriate rate using the PAYE tables. The rate will depend on the employee’s tax code. For more information on taxing employer contributions see our Employer’s guide - IR335. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Most benefits given to employees on top of their salary and wages are fringe benefits (perks) and are liable for FBT. There are 4 main groups of fringe benefits liable for FBT: • motor vehicles • free, subsidised or discounted goods and services • low-interest loans • employer contributions to superannuation schemes (excluding KiwiSaver and complying superannuation schemes that have already had ESCT deducted from them) and specified insurance policies. You’ll have to pay FBT on any of these benefits given to your employees or shareholder-employees. You have 3 options to calculate FBT payable on the total value of benefits: • a flat/single FBT rate of 63.93% on all benefits provided • the alternate calculation process, or • a short form of the alternate calculation process. For more information, see our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409. Filing FBT returns There are 3 types of FBT returns: • Fringe benefit tax - annual return - IR422. This return is for employers who have elected to file annual returns for the year to 31 March. It’s due on 31 May. • Fringe benefit tax - income year return - IR421. This return is for companies with shareholder- employees. It covers the same period as the company’s accounting year.

Business Ngā Ūmanga IR322 | August 2021 For salary and wage purposes, you're an employer if you: hire someone to work as part of your business or organisation, and control the manner in which the person works, and supply any equipment for that person to use when working for you. It's important that you know whether the people who work for you are your employees or are self-employed. In most cases it will be quite clear, but if you need help, check our publications Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 or First-time employer’s guide - IR333. You can get them from ird.govt.nz or by calling 0800 257 773. If you're an employer you'll need to register with us. You can register online at ird.govt.nz/employers. Once you're registered with us, we'll send you an introductory letter with more detailed information about your tax obligations. What employers must do You need to deduct PAYE (pay as you earn) from your employees' wages each payday, and send them to us by the due dates. These are either once or twice a month, depending on the amount of your gross annual PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $500,000, your payments are due by the 20th of the following month. If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is $500,000 or more you must send your payments to us twice a month—on the 20th of the same month for deductions made during the 1st to the 15th of the month, and the 5th of the following month for deductions made during the 16th to the end of the month. If you provide your employees with fringe benefits (perks), you'll need to register and pay FBT (fringe benefit tax). You'll also need to contribute to your employees' KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund. Some exceptions apply—see the KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4 or ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver for more details. Taking on staff Every employee who starts work for you must fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 and give it to you. Keep this form with your business records, do not send it to us. If you are employing contractors, they'll need to provide you with an IR330C and you'll need to deduct tax from any schedular payments to them. Your employee's tax code tells you which rate to use when deducting PAYE from their wages. If your employee does not fill in a tax code declaration, or leaves out some details, you must deduct PAYE at the higher "non-notified" rate. An ACC earners' levy is included in your employee's PAYE. This levy is payable by all employees and covers the cost of non-work-related injuries (except for motor vehicle accidents). You'll need to give new employees a KiwiSaver information pack within seven days of their starting work. This includes includes our factsheet Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employer information - KS3, KiwiSaver deduction - KS2 form and the KiwiSaver opt- out request - KS10 form. You'll also need to start making KiwiSaver deductions and making employer contributions from their first pay, if they're subject to automatic enrolment. Go to kiwisaver.govt.nz for more information about your employer obligations. Other deductions you need to make Student loan deductions – if an employee's tax code includes "SL", you must deduct student loan repayments as well as PAYE and send them both to us. Your employee may ask you to make extra deductions or we may ask you to make compulsory extra deductions. These are in addition to the normal student loan deductions. Child support deductions – you may receive a notice from us instructing you to deduct child support payments from an employee's wages. Send these deductions to us along with the PAYE. KiwiSaver deductions – if you're making any KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions, send these to us along with the PAYE. ESCT – any monetary contributions an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of their employees are liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. Employer obligations This factsheet explains your tax obligations as an employer including how to register, what deductions to make and what forms you must complete. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Payroll giving – if you choose to offer payroll giving to your employees, you must show the amount of tax credits for payroll donations on your Employment information. You need to be filing your IR348 electronically to offer payroll giving. Deduction Notices – you may receive a deduction notice from Inland Revenue to make extra deductions from an employee’s salary and wages. You must make these deductions and send them to Inland Revenue as a separate payment from your PAYE. Instructions on how to pay these deductions will be included in the deduction notice. You do not need to show these deductions in your IR348. Forms and returns you must complete For examples on filling out these forms see our Employer's guide - IR335. File your employer forms online and access a range of online services when and where you want. To register go to ird.govt.nz/myIR You'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form for each new employee and send it to us either: before their first pay day; or with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You'll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. Employment information - IR348 Every payday you must complete and file an IR348, with the details of your employees' gross wages, deductions and their employment information. For new employees you'll need to show their employment start date. For all employees, their end date if applicable, the pay frequency, the pay period start and finish dates, their gross earnings, PAYE or tax on schedular payments, earnings not liable for ACC earners' levy, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver employee deductions and net KiwiSaver employer contributions and ESCT deductions. Include any benefits received under an employee share scheme separately from any other earnings your employee receives. For the correct codes to use and instructions on how to enter the extra deductions see our Employers guide - IR335. Note: You must also show student loan extra deductions separately on your IR348 in either: SLBOR – employee requests voluntary extra deductions SLCIR – we request you to make compulsory extra deductions. Employers with gross annual PAYE and ESCT of less than $50,000 can file their IR348 electronically or they can choose to file by paper. For the first six months of employing staff, you can choose to file your returns on paper. If after six months you have exceeded the $50,000 threshold, you will need to file your returns online. Employers with gross annual PAYE and ESCT of $50,000 or more in the previous year, must file their IR348 electronically. If you are filing electronically the due date is within two working days after the payday. Paper returns must be received within 10 working days after the payday. KiwiSaver forms KiwiSaver employee details - KS1 - this form provides Inland Revenue with the name, IRD number and address of a new employee who is eligible to join KiwiSaver. You can send us this form separately or with your IR346 and IR348 you file, IR348, you file after the employee gives you their KiwiSaver deduction - KS2 form. FBT returns If you provide fringe benefits (perks) to your employees, shareholder-employees or other people associated with your business, you will generally pay FBT on their value. Fringe benefits can be: the use of a motor vehicle low-interest or interest-free loans free, subsidised or discounted goods or services employer contributions to some accident and health insurance policies. FBT returns are filed quarterly or yearly, depending on your filing option. To find out more about FBT returns and rates go to ird.govt.nz/fringe-benefit-tax Paying and filing returns on time Make sure you pay all your deductions and send all your forms to us on time. Remember, the deductions you make are actually your employees' taxes or KiwiSaver deductions, and you're responsible for passing them on to us. Penalties may apply if you do not pay the deductions or do not send the EI to us by the due date. Read our factsheet Late payment and late filing penalties - IR741 for more information.

Business Ngā Ūmanga How GST works Most goods and services supplied in New Zealand have GST added to the price. The exceptions are goods and services supplied by businesses not required to register for GST, and exempt supplies. • You must charge GST on your sales and income if you’re GST registered. You can also claim back the GST on your purchases and expenses. You cannot do either of these if you’re not registered. • You’ll need to file GST returns to claim GST you’ve paid and/or charged. • If your return shows you have charged more GST than you have paid, you must pay the difference to us. • If your return shows you have paid more GST than you’ve charged, we’ll refund you the difference. Registering for GST You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. You can choose your GST return filing frequency (how often you file) - monthly, 2-monthly, or 6-monthly and your taxable period for 2 or 6 monthly returns. You must align your taxable periods to your balance date. If you do not choose a taxable period when you register, we’ll put you on the 2-monthly option matching your balance date. You can register even if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? Register for myIR. It is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can register for GST in myIR. When you’re GST registered You’ll need to: • charge GST on all your sales, except those exempt from GST • provide taxable supply information and supply correction information to your customers • keep records of all your sales and income including taxable supply information and supply correction information • keep taxable supply information and supply correction information for your purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents • complete and file your GST return in myIR or through your accounting software and make any payment by the due date If you want to keep your records outside of New Zealand, contact us or send a message in myIR to request approval. What taxable supply information do I give my customers? You’ll need to provide your customers with taxable supply information. This can be an invoice or provided in other documents. The amount of detail you need to include in your taxable supply information depends on the value of the goods or services being sold. • If a sale is $200 or less, you do not need to provide taxable supply information, but you must keep records. • If you make a sale of more than $200, you’ll need to provide taxable supply information. For more details on what you need to include, use our GST record keeping requirements tool. These requirements also apply to taxable supply records you’ll need to keep, to claim GST on your purchases and expenses. Supplies exempt from GST GST cannot be charged on some goods and services— these are called exempt supplies. The most common ones are: • letting property as a private dwelling • interest you receive • the sale of donated goods and services by a not-for- profit organisation • certain financial services. Go to Exempt supplies to find out more. GST – quick reference GST is a tax on goods and services supplied in New Zealand by GST-registered persons. It may also apply to imported goods and certain imported services. It is generally charged and accounted for at a rate of 15%. Anyone who carries on a taxable activity, or who intends to do so from a definite date, may register for GST.

You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you want to change your accounting basis after you’ve registered, you can do this in myIR. Payments basis—claim GST when you pay for your purchases and expenses and account for GST when your customers pay you. This basis can only be used if the total value of your taxable supplies in any 12-month period is $2 million or less, or the nature, value and volume of your supplies makes this basis the most appropriate one for you. Invoice basis—claim GST when you receive taxable supply information such as an invoice, and account for GST when you provide an invoice or receive a payment, whichever comes first. Hybrid basis—claim GST when you pay for your purchases, account for GST when you provide an invoice or receive a payment, whichever comes first. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). How often do I file GST returns? The period covered by the GST return is called the taxable period. The 3 taxable periods are: Monthly—if your annual turnover is over $24 million in any 12-month period, you must file your returns monthly. This taxable period benefits registered persons such as exporters who regularly get GST refunds but is also available to all registered persons. 2-monthly—if your turnover is up to $24 million in any 12-month period, you can choose this option. This is the standard option for filing GST returns. 6-monthly—you can choose this option if your turnover is under $500,000 in any 12-month period. Due dates We’ll send you a reminder in myIR when your GST return is ready for you to file. The reminder includes the due date for filing and making any payment. The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Remember, file and pay on time to avoid late filing penalties, late payment penalties and interest. Working out the GST in a price Depending on whether the total price includes or excludes GST, use the following methods. • For a single GST-inclusive amount, multiply the total by 3, then divide by 23 to get the GST portion. If an item or service costs $100 including GST, multiply $100 by 3, then divide by 23 = $13.04. This is the GST portion. • To add GST to a single GST-exclusive amount, multiply the total by 15% (0.15). If an item or service costs $50, excluding GST, $50 x 0.15 = $7.50. The GST-inclusive amount is $57.50. Cancelling your GST registration You can cancel your GST registration if: • you dispose of your business, or • scale it down so your annual turnover is less than $60,000. You can cancel your registration in myIR. You have certain obligations when you cancel your registration. For more information go to Cancelling your GST registration

IR325 | April 2022 This factsheet explains your income tax obligations in your first year of business. Find out here about filing your income tax returns and what expenses you can claim. We'll also explain when and how you can pay your income tax. Income tax is payable on your net profits from your business. This is all the income that comes into your business, less allowable business expenses. Business income is income earned from the goods and services you sell (including invoices you've issued but have not received payment for). What income is taxable? The way your business is managed will determine how you manage your cash flow and pay your income tax. If you're a sole trader or partnership If you're in business in your own name, or in a partnership, you'll usually be managing it and be responsible for all its income and debts. Usually you will not get a wage but will take money from the business when you need it - called drawings. You pay income tax on your net profits. The taxable income is the net profit the business makes after deducting all allowable expenses and before any drawings. In a partnership, the net profit is shared between the partners and included in their personal income tax returns. If you're a company If your business is a limited liability company and pays you a salary, you'll be taxed on your salary individually. The company must pay tax on its profits, which are the gross takings less all the business expenses (including your salary). Any profits belong to the company and are taxed at the company rate. Incorporated societies and some savings vehicles are also taxed at this rate. Completing your tax return You (or your tax agent) will need to complete a tax return each year for the business. You can complete it online in myIR. Register for myIR at ird.govt.nz/myIR When are tax returns due? If you're filing your tax return yourself you must send it to us by 7 July. If an accountant or other tax agent completes it for you, they may be able to file it later. To help with your end-of-year tax return keep your accounts up to date so you can work out the profit and the amount of tax you may have to pay. Income tax in your first year of business What expenses can be claimed? All businesses have expenses and most expenses that are part of the cost of running your business are tax-deductible. These are some examples of tax-deductible expenses: • accident compensation levies • salary and wages • rent and rates • stationery and supplies • accountants' fees • purchase of trading stock • repairs and maintenance on business items • power and phone costs • interest on money borrowed for the business • insurance of business assets or premises • business vehicle and transport costs. For the 2010 income year and beyond, legal expenses incurred when buying capital assets used to derive income are tax deductible, provided your total legal expenses for an income year are equal to or less than $10,000. Some business expenses paid out of business income can't be claimed as an income tax deduction: • If your business borrows money, the capital part of the loan repayments is not a deductible expense (but the interest probably will be). Likewise, the loan is not taxable income. • Income tax that the business pays is not a deductible expense, and tax refunds are not taxable income. • Drawings are not a deductible expense, and money you bring into the business is not taxable income. Examples of other non-deductible expenses include: • the cost of plant and machinery • legal fees for capital assets used to derive income when your total expenses exceed $10,000 for the 2010 income year and beyond • any legal fees associated with the cost of buying capital assets prior to the 2010 income year • improvements to equipment apart from repairs and maintenance • private expenses such as life insurance. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Go to ird.govt.nz/contact-us and select Request a business advisory visit Find a seminar or workshop near you at ird.govt.nz/seminars Capital expenses and depreciation It's important to be able to tell the difference between capital and revenue expenses because revenue expenses are deductible while capital expenses generally are not. Capital expenses are usually one-off payments to buy assets that will be used in the business. You can not claim the full cost of capital items in the year they were bought. Instead, their cost may be written off over a number of years. You can claim deprecation on the cost of capital assets to allow for their decline in value. New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings until 2010. From the 2011-2012 income year depreciation was removed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Legislative changes enacted on 25 March 2020, as part of a wider economic recovery package in response to COVID- 19, reintroduces building depreciation but only for non- residential buildings (those that are not primarily used for residential accommodation). For more information on depreciation go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation Planning for and paying income tax It's a good idea in your first year of business to put money aside for tax. This will ease the cash flow in your second year of business. The table below shows how much tax may be payable on your profit for the income years from 1 April 2011 (assuming your only income is from your business and you're self employed) and the amount you should save to cover it. If you have other income as well, the tax rate on your business income will probably be different.

Provisional tax After your first year in business you may be required to pay income tax in instalments during the year - called provisional tax. Provisional tax is not a separate tax but a way of paying your income tax as the income is received through the year. There is a discount if you receive self-employed or partnership income and make voluntary payments of income tax either in your first year of business or the year before you start paying provisional tax. You must meet certain criteria to qualify. For more information about early payment discount go to ird.govt.nz/early-payment-discount For more information about provisional tax go to ird.govt.nz/provisional-tax Paying your income tax If you have a March balance date any tax you have to pay is due the following year by 7 February, or 7 April if you have a tax agent or accountant who has an extension of time.

It also tells you how to register with Inland Revenue as an employer. This guide covers: different types of workers when and how to register as an employer deductions you need to make how and when to file employer returns a glossary to help you understand the tax terms we use. Why paying tax matters Everyone who earns money in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. Here’s how the Government spent our taxes in 2018-19. The government uses taxpayers’ money to pay for services we all need. 4 ird.govt.nz Are you an employer? The following table shows you each type of worker, and whether you need to register as an employer, make deductions and keep records. Type of worker Register as an employer? Make deductions? Keep records? Employee Workers receiving schedular payments Self-employed contractors IR56 taxpayers Volunteers What sort of workers do you have? It’s important you know if the people who you employ are your employees or if they’re self-employed, because this will determine whether you need to register as an employer and make deductions. Deductions can include pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), student loan, child support, KiwiSaver and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). See more information on deductions on page 9. You’ll find a list of the tax terms we use on page 17. Our guide Self- employed or an employee? - IR336 will help explain the tax differences between the two. You can find this at ird.govt.nz/forms- guides First-time employer’s guide 5 Employees An employee is someone who works for you and you determine when, where and how they do their work. You need to make deductions from payments you make to employees. Workers receiving schedular payments Some workers are employed under a contract for services and receive schedular payments. These workers are commonly known as contractors and use the WT tax code. The types of work covered by schedular payments are on the back page of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. You need to deduct tax from payments you make to workers receiving schedular payments, unless they have a certificate of exemption and aren’t being paid under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business\*, or they have a 0% special tax rate certificate. You don’t need to make any other deductions like KiwiSaver or student loan deductions from their pay—this is their responsibility. Self-employed contractors Self-employed contractors are workers who don’t receive schedular payments and aren’t employees. They control how they work, provide their own tools and invoice you for their services. You don’t need to make deductions from payments you make to self-employed contractors, but you must still keep records of the person or company and how much you paid them. However, if you have a written agreement with the contractor stating you will treat their payments as schedular payments and deduct tax on their behalf, you’ll need to register as an employer and treat them as a worker receiving schedular payments. Common types of schedular payments are honoraria, and payments made to models, company directors and entertainers. Common types of self- employed contractors include mechanics and plumbers. For more information about workers with a certificate of exemption read our Employer’s guide - IR335. \* Non-resident contractors can use a COE for payments they receive under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. 6 ird.govt.nz IR56 taxpayers The term “IR56 taxpayer” is used to identify workers who are responsible for paying their own tax, can be an employer, but are not self-employed contractors. The most common IR56 taxpayers are private domestic workers, who work part-time, eg: home-helpers caregivers nannies gardeners domestic odd-jobbers. You don’t take deductions from any payments you make to them, but you must still keep records of the person and how much they were paid. Volunteers A volunteer is someone who works voluntarily and doesn’t get paid for it. Even though you didn’t pay them, you should keep records of the person who volunteered and when they worked. For more information on IR56 taxpayers, go to ird.govt.nz/ir56 First-time employer’s guide 7 How to register as an employer If you’ve now decided you’re an employer, you must register with Inland Revenue as soon as you start employing. If you know in advance that someone will be working for you, you can register before they actually start. Step 1: Get an IRD number You need an IRD number to register as an employer. If you’re an individual and want to start employing workers, you can register as an employer under your own personal IRD number. If your business is a partnership, company, trust or other organisation, and doesn’t already have an IRD number, you’ll need to apply for one using an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form or Non-resident offshore business IRD number application - IR744. Step 2: Complete an Employer registration - IR334 form You can register as an employer online at ird.govt.nz/employers If you don’t have access to the internet, you can call us on 0800 257 773 and we’ll post you the IR334. You’ll receive a confirmation letter and an employer pack within 10 working days of registering. The pack tells you what you have to do and by when. Companies can automatically apply for an IRD number, and register as an employer, when they register with the Companies Office. 8 ird.govt.nz Now you’ve registered, let’s get started Make sure new employees fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 form. The IR330 will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their salary or wages and any other deductions to make, eg, student loan repayments. If your worker doesn’t give you a completed IR330, you must deduct tax at the non-notified rate. This is 45 cents in the dollar plus ACC earner’s levy. Make sure new contractors receiving schedular payments fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. The IR330C will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. Note: there are minimum tax rates that must be used, refer IR335. If they’ve completed the IR330C and haven’t selected a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor doesn’t give you a completed IR330C you must deduct at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies and 45% for all other contractors. When you start employing, you’ll need to start a record- keeping system. Records need to be kept in New Zealand for seven years. These include: wagebook information PAYE payment receipts completed IR330 and IR330C forms letters from us asking you to change your employee’s tax code or rate. See our Employer’s guide - IR335 for a full list of the records you need to keep. First-time employer’s guide 9 Deductions you need to make You need to make deductions from payments made to employees and from workers receiving schedular payments. Self-employed contractors and IR56 taxpayers don’t have tax deducted. PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) As an employer, you must deduct PAYE from all payments you make to people working for you. The amount you deduct will depend on the code the employee puts on their Tax code declaration - IR330 form. Some employees may have a special tax code which tells you to deduct PAYE at a different rate. Workers receiving schedular payments (WT tax code) have a flat rate of tax deducted. Student loan and child support deductions You may also need to make deductions for student loan and/or child support from your employee’s wages or salary. Some of your employees will use a tax code with “SL” on the end, eg, M SL or S SL. This means they’ll need to have student loan deductions made from their salary or wages together with PAYE. If anyone working for you needs child support deducted from their salary or wages, we’ll send you a child support deduction notice. It will tell you how much to deduct each pay because this depends on their personal circumstances. For employees, PAYE is made up of tax and ACC earners’ levy (which covers the cost of non-work related injuries). For more information on tailored tax codes read our Employer’s guide - IR335. 10 ird.govt.nz KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based savings scheme to help New Zealanders save for their retirement. KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand residents and people entitled to live here permanently. You’ll need to give each new employee a copy of Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3. If your employees decide to enrol in KiwiSaver, you’ll need to make deductions from their gross salary or wages at their chosen rate (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%). You’re also required to contribute a minimum 3% to their KiwiSaver account. These are called compulsory employer contributions. All KiwiSaver deductions need to be paid to us at the same time as PAYE and any other deductions. You shouldn’t give financial advice to your employees. If they have questions about their KiwiSaver options, tell them to talk to an independent advisor or go to the “Sorted” website at www.sorted.org.nz For more detail about your KiwiSaver employer responsibilities, employee enrolment criteria and deductions, see our KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4. Employer’s superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) and ESCT All contributions you make to your employees’ superannuation funds, including KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, need to have ESCT (employer’s superannuation contribution tax) deducted. The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. For more information on ESCT and employer contributions read our Employer’s guide - IR335. First-time employer’s guide 11 Any other contributions that employers make to other funds are not liable for ESCT, but are liable for FBT (fringe benefit tax). These funds include: sickness, accident or death benefit funds life, pension, personal accident and sickness insurance policies an insurance fund of a friendly society funeral trusts superannuation schemes that aren’t registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 or haven’t had ESCT deducted. Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can have donations made directly from their salary or wages to support approved donee organisations and receive an instant tax credit. You can choose whether to set up payroll giving and how it will run. If you do, it’s up to your employees whether they participate. If you choose to set up payroll giving, you must send your employer returns electronically. Read our Payroll giving - IR617 guide for more information. To see a full list of approved donee organisations go to ird. govt.nz/donee For more information on electronic filing, see page 15. 12 ird.govt.nz Fringe benefit tax (FBT) FBT is a tax on benefits or perks that employees receive on top of their salary or wages. All employers who provide benefits must pay FBT. The common types of fringe benefits are private use of work cars, low-interest loans, and free, subsidised or discounted goods or services. If you don’t intend to provide any fringe benefits, you need to select “No” on the Employer registration - IR334 form. If you start providing fringe benefits later on, you’ll need to tell us. Read our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information about FBT. How you calculate deductions To calculate PAYE, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions, use our online PAYE/KiwiSaver deductions calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators The calculator tells you exactly how much to deduct from your employees’ wages. You can personalise it for each employee, which makes it easier to keep deductions separate. You can download and/or print a copy of the results for your records. The PAYE calculator doesn’t calculate the amount of child support to deduct. We’ll send you a child support deduction notice with the amount. If you don’t have access to the internet you can order printed copies of the Weekly and fortnightly PAYE deduction tables - IR340 or Four-weekly and monthly PAYE deduction tables - IR341. First-time employer’s guide 13 Forms you need to complete and send to us You’ll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay, or earlier. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number and tax code. Include their address and date of birth if they have provided you with this information. The Employment information - IR348 form shows all the people who worked for you in a pay cycle, what they earned and what was deducted from their earnings. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. If you file by paper and have more employees than fit on the IR348, use the IR349 for any remaining employees. For examples on completing these forms see our Employer’s guide - IR335.

It also tells you how to register with Inland Revenue as an employer. This guide covers: ••different types of workers ••when and how to register as an employer ••deductions you need to make ••how and when to file employer returns ••a glossary to help you understand the tax terms we use. Why paying tax matters Everyone who earns money in New Zealand must pay their share of tax. Here’s how the Government spent our taxes in 2020-21. The government uses taxpayers’ money to pay for services we all need. 4 ird.govt.nz Are you an employer? The following table shows you each type of worker, and whether you need to register as an employer, make deductions and keep records. Type of worker Register as an employer? Make deductions? Keep records? Employee Workers receiving schedular payments Self-employed contractors IR56 taxpayers Volunteers What sort of workers do you have? It’s important you know if the people who you employ are your employees or if they’re self-employed, because this will determine whether you need to register as an employer and make deductions. Deductions can include pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), student loan, child support, KiwiSaver and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). See more information on deductions on page 9. You’ll find a list of the tax terms we use on page 17. Our guide Self- employed or an employee? - IR336 will help explain the tax differences between the two. You can find this at ird.govt.nz/forms- guides First-time employer’s guide 5 Employees An employee is someone who works for you and you determine when, where and how they do their work. You need to make deductions from payments you make to employees. Workers receiving schedular payments Some workers are employed under a contract for services and receive schedular payments. These workers are commonly known as contractors and use the WT tax code. The types of work covered by schedular payments are on the back page of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. You need to deduct tax from payments you make to workers receiving schedular payments, unless they have a certificate of exemption and aren’t being paid under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business\*, or they have a 0% special tax rate certificate. You don’t need to make any other deductions like KiwiSaver or student loan deductions from their pay—this is their responsibility. Self-employed contractors Self-employed contractors are workers who don’t receive schedular payments and aren’t employees. They control how they work, provide their own tools and invoice you for their services. You don’t need to make deductions from payments you make to self-employed contractors, but you must still keep records of the person or company and how much you paid them. However, if you have a written agreement with the contractor stating you will treat their payments as schedular payments and deduct tax on their behalf, you’ll need to register as an employer and treat them as a worker receiving schedular payments. Common types of schedular payments are honoraria, and payments made to models, company directors and entertainers. Common types of self- employed contractors include mechanics and plumbers. For more information about workers with a certificate of exemption read our Employer’s guide - IR335. \* Non-resident contractors can use a COE for payments they receive under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. 6 ird.govt.nz IR56 taxpayers The term “IR56 taxpayer” is used to identify workers who are responsible for paying their own tax. A person cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if they are self- employed. The most common IR56 taxpayers are private domestic workers, who work part-time, eg: ••home-helpers ••caregivers ••nannies ••gardeners ••domestic odd-jobbers. You don’t take deductions from any payments you make to them, but you must still keep records of the person and how much they were paid. Volunteers A volunteer is someone who works voluntarily and doesn’t get paid for it. Even though you didn’t pay them, you should keep records of the person who volunteered and when they worked. For more information on IR56 taxpayers, go to ird.govt.nz/ir56 First-time employer’s guide 7 How to register as an employer If you’ve now decided you’re an employer, you must register with Inland Revenue as soon as you start employing. If you know in advance that someone will be working for you, you can register before they actually start. Step 1: Get an IRD number You need an IRD number to register as an employer. If you’re an individual and want to start employing workers, you can register as an employer under your own personal IRD number. If your business is a partnership, company, trust or other organisation, and doesn’t already have an IRD number, you’ll need to apply for one using an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form or Non-resident offshore business IRD number application - IR744. Step 2: Complete an Employer registration - IR334 form You can register as an employer online at ird.govt.nz/employers If you don’t have access to the internet, you can call us on 0800 257 773 and we’ll post you the IR334. You’ll receive a confirmation letter and an employer pack within 10 working days of registering. The pack tells you what you have to do and by when. Companies can automatically apply for an IRD number, and register as an employer, when they register with the Companies Office. 8 ird.govt.nz Now you’ve registered, let’s get started Make sure new employees fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 form. The IR330 will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their salary or wages and any other deductions to make, eg, student loan repayments. If your worker doesn’t give you a completed IR330, you must deduct tax at the non-notified rate. This is 45 cents in the dollar plus ACC earner’s levy. Make sure new contractors receiving schedular payments fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form. The IR330C will tell you what rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. Note: there are minimum tax rates that must be used, refer IR335. If they’ve completed the IR330C and haven’t selected a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor doesn’t give you a completed IR330C you must deduct at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies and 45% for all other contractors. When you start employing, you’ll need to start a record- keeping system. Records need to be kept in New Zealand for seven years. These include: ••wagebook information ••PAYE payment receipts ••completed IR330 and IR330C forms ••letters from us asking you to change your employee’s tax code or rate. See our Employer’s guide - IR335 for a full list of the records you need to keep. First-time employer’s guide 9 Deductions you need to make You need to make deductions from payments made to employees and from workers receiving schedular payments. Self-employed contractors and IR56 taxpayers don’t have tax deducted. PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) As an employer, you must deduct PAYE from all payments you make to people working for you. The amount you deduct will depend on the code the employee puts on their Tax code declaration - IR330 form. Some employees may have a special tax code which tells you to deduct PAYE at a different rate. Workers receiving schedular payments (WT tax code) have a flat rate of tax deducted. Student loan and child support deductions You may also need to make deductions for student loan and/or child support from your employee’s wages or salary. Some of your employees will use a tax code with “SL” on the end, eg, M SL or S SL. This means they’ll need to have student loan deductions made from their salary or wages together with PAYE. If anyone working for you needs child support deducted from their salary or wages, we’ll send you a child support deduction notice. It will tell you how much to deduct each pay because this depends on their personal circumstances. For employees, PAYE is made up of tax and ACC earners’ levy (which covers the cost of non-work related injuries). For more information on tailored tax codes read our Employer’s guide - IR335. 10 ird.govt.nz KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based savings scheme to help New Zealanders save for their retirement. KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand residents and people entitled to live here permanently. You’ll need to give each new employee a copy of Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3. If your employees decide to enrol in KiwiSaver, you’ll need to make deductions from their gross salary or wages at their chosen rate (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%). You’re also required to contribute a minimum 3% to their KiwiSaver account. These are called compulsory employer contributions. All KiwiSaver deductions need to be paid to us at the same time as PAYE and any other deductions. You shouldn’t give financial advice to your employees. If they have questions about their KiwiSaver options, tell them to talk to an independent advisor or go to the “Sorted” website at www.sorted.org.nz For more detail about your KiwiSaver employer responsibilities, employee enrolment criteria and deductions, see our KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4. Employer’s superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) and ESCT All contributions you make to your employees’ superannuation funds, including KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, need to have ESCT (employer’s superannuation contribution tax) deducted. The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. For more information on ESCT and employer contributions read our Employer’s guide - IR335. First-time employer’s guide 11 Any other contributions that employers make to other funds are not liable for ESCT, but are liable for FBT (fringe benefit tax). These funds include: ••sickness, accident or death benefit funds ••life, pension, personal accident and sickness insurance policies ••an insurance fund of a friendly society ••funeral trusts ••superannuation schemes that aren’t registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 or haven’t had ESCT deducted. Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can have donations made directly from their salary or wages to support approved donee organisations and receive an instant tax credit. You can choose whether to set up payroll giving and how it will run. If you do, it’s up to your employees whether they participate. If you choose to set up payroll giving, you must send your employer returns electronically. Read our Payroll giving - IR617 guide for more information. To see a full list of approved donee organisations go to ird. govt.nz/donee For more information on electronic filing, see page 15. 12 ird.govt.nz Fringe benefit tax (FBT) FBT is a tax on benefits or perks that employees receive on top of their salary or wages. All employers who provide benefits must pay FBT. The common types of fringe benefits are private use of work cars, low-interest loans, and free, subsidised or discounted goods or services. If you don’t intend to provide any fringe benefits, you need to select “No” on the Employer registration - IR334 form. If you start providing fringe benefits later on, you’ll need to tell us. Read our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information about FBT. How you calculate deductions To calculate PAYE, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions, use our online PAYE/KiwiSaver deductions calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators The calculator tells you exactly how much to deduct from your employees’ wages. You can personalise it for each employee, which makes it easier to keep deductions separate. You can download and/or print a copy of the results for your records. The PAYE calculator doesn’t calculate the amount of child support to deduct. We’ll send you a child support deduction notice with the amount. If you don’t have access to the internet you can order printed copies of the Weekly and fortnightly PAYE deduction tables - IR340 or Four-weekly and monthly PAYE deduction tables - IR341. First-time employer’s guide 13 Forms you need to complete and send to us You’ll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay, or earlier. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number and tax code. Include their address and date of birth if they have provided you with this information. The Employment information - IR348 form shows all the people who worked for you in a pay cycle, what they earned and what was deducted from their earnings. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. If you file by paper and have more employees than fit on the IR348, use the IR349 for any remaining employees. For examples on completing these forms see our Employer’s guide - IR335.

You must pay these amounts to us by the due dates. Who is an employee? It's very important you're sure the people who work for you are your employees, or if they're self- employed. This is because tax, KiwiSaver, student loan and accident compensation laws treat the 2 groups of people differently. You're responsible for your employees' tax deductions. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you do this, you may be prosecuted, fined, and you will still have to pay the amount of PAYE (pay as you earn) you should have deducted. In most cases it’s clear if someone is an employee. Generally, if you control how and when the person's work is done, the person is your employee. If you answer yes to all or most of the following questions, the worker is probably your employee. • • Do they have to do the work, rather than being able to hire someone to help? • • Can you tell them what to do on the job, and when and how to do it? • • Do you pay them at a set rate (for example, hourly, weekly, monthly, or by unit of production)? A person paid by commission or on a piece-work basis may still be an employee, especially if there are other employees who work on the same basis. • • Can they get overtime or penal rates? • • Do they work set hours, or a given number of hours, each week or month? • • Do they work at your premises, or at a place you specify? • • Do you set the standards for the amount and quality of their work? A person can be self-employed in one line of work and still work for someone else as an employee. Note For more help If you need more help to decide whether your worker is an employee, see Self-employed or an employee? - IR336. If you're still not sure, call us on 0800 377 772. If you decide someone is not an employee, you may still have to deduct tax from any schedular payments you make to them (see page 10). Minimum employment rights and obligations It's important to know what the minimum employment rights and obligations are. Minimum employment rights include the following: • • Every employee must have a written employment agreement. • • Every employee is entitled to 4 weeks paid annual holidays at the end of each year of employment. • • Every employee aged 16 and over must be paid at least the applicable minimum wage. • • Every employee is entitled to 11 public holidays off work on pay if they’re days the employee would normally work. • • Every employee is entitled to 10 paid sick days after 6 months of employment. Employer's obligations include: • • keeping accurate records of the employees' time worked, payments, and holiday and leave entitlements • • keeping signed copies of employment agreements • • taking all practical steps to ensure employees' safety • • providing personal protective equipment for employees • • ensuring the person they're employing has the legal right to work in New Zealand. For more information on the minimum employment rights and obligations go to www.employment.govt.nz/minimum-rights- of-employees or call the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on 0800 209 020. Responsibilities 6 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Amounts you'll need to deduct PAYE is the basic amount of income tax you take out of your employees' wages whenever you pay them. PAYE includes an ACC earners' levy - see page 11. Besides PAYE, there are other amounts you may have to deduct from your employees' pay - these include student loan repayments, child support and KiwiSaver deductions. Deducting PAYE You can use the PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz to calculate the amount of tax to deduct from an employee's gross wages. You can also work out how much PAYE you'll have to account for, if you've paid the employee a net amount. Tax codes Tax code declaration All new employees must complete a Tax code declaration - IR330 when they start working for you. Employee's need to read the notes on the IR330 to work out their correct tax code. If an employee’s tax code changes while they are employed by you, they must fill out a new IR330 for you to apply the new code. If you are paying contractors schedular payments, they will need to complete the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. See page 7 for more details on contractors and schedular payments. You must keep the tax code declarations for 7 years after the last wages payment is made to the employee. If you need extra forms, you can print them from ird.govt.nz photocopy them or order them - see page 58. Employees on the wrong tax code It's important the right tax code is used because it helps your employee avoid a tax bill and or student loan underpayment at the end of the year. We regularly check the details on your Employment information - IR348 to make sure the right amount of tax and student loan repayments are deducted from employees’ salary or wages. When we identify an employee using the wrong tax and/or student loan repayment code, we'll ask you to change it. We'll tell you if employees are using incorrect tax codes and let you know the code they should be on. You'll need to change their tax code to the correct code starting the next pay period, to make sure they pay the correct amount of tax or student loan repayments as quickly as possible. We'll also let the employee know they’re using an incorrect tax code for their circumstances and we've asked you, as their employer, to change it from their next pay period. If any of your employees disagree with this change, ask them to contact us. However, if they provide a new IR330 after receiving the letter, you'll need to deduct according to their elected code. Main employment Most employees have 1 main or highest source of salary or wage income. This includes taxable pensions, benefits and student allowance. An employee can use only 1 main tax code, M or ME for their salary or wage income at any time. Employees repaying their student loan should use the M SL or ME SL tax code - see page 12. The IR330 explains how to select a tax code. When you have the employee's tax code, use the PAYE tables or our online PAYE calculator to work out how much PAYE to deduct from each pay. Secondary employment If an employee is already using a M or ME, M SL or ME SL tax code for their main source of income from a job or a benefit) and has another job, the other job is secondary employment. The employee must complete another IR330 for secondary employment, using one of the secondary tax codes: SB, S, SH, ST or SA. Employees with student loans must use the SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL code. Responsibilities 7ird.govt.nz See the PAYE tables for the current secondary tax rates. Employees can choose to have their secondary income taxed at a higher rate than would be deducted if they used the SB or S codes, by selecting SH, ST or SA codes on their IR330. Using the correct secondary tax code reduces the possibility of a tax bill at the end of the year. Unlike the main tax codes, an employee can use the secondary tax codes on more than 1 IR330 at the same time. Example Belinda has one full-time job and 3 part-time jobs. She uses a main tax code for her full-time job and a secondary tax code for her 3 part-time jobs. If an employee works for you using a main tax code and does different work for you outside normal working hours, add the payment for the unrelated work to the normal pay and calculate PAYE on the total payment. However, if the unrelated work covers a different period from the normal pay period, or separate wage records are kept (for example, the work is undertaken in a different department), use the secondary tax code. The employee must fill in a separate IR330 if the secondary code is used. Example Amy works in the spray-painting division of Cars & Cars Ltd between 8 am and 5 pm, Monday to Friday, and is paid fortnightly. She also works between 6 pm and 10 pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, in the glass division of Cars & Cars Ltd, and is paid monthly. Amy has completed 2 IR330s - the 1 for the spray- painting division using tax code M, and the S tax code for the glass division. Non-notified rate - ND tax code Employees receiving salary and wages If an employee does not give you a completed tax code declaration, deduct PAYE at the non-notified rate. The IR330 must include their: • • name • • IRD number, and • • tax code. You must also deduct tax at the non-notified rate if they do not give you an IR330 at all. The non-notified rate is 46.6% (includes ACC earners' levy). If an employee does not fill in an IR330 form or complete it fully, enter ND as the tax code on your Employment information - IR348. How to calculate PAYE at the non-notified rate 1. Take gross earnings 2. Add the value of taxable allowances if any 3. The total is earnings for PAYE. 4. Work out PAYE at the rate of 46.6% on whole dollars only. Example Basic weekly pay is $385.75. The PAYE on whole dollars is $385 × 46.6% PAYE to be deducted is $179.41. Contractors receiving schedular payments If a contractor does not give you a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, you’re required to use the non-notified rate. You must also use this rate if they give you the IR330C without their name and IRD number. The rate you deduct is 45% unless the contractor is a non-resident contractor company where the rate is 20%. You still show the tax code as WT on your Employment information - IR348. If they give you a completed IR330C but have not provided a tax rate, use the standard rate for their activity located on page 3 of the IR330C. For more information on schedular payments see page 10. Responsibilities 8 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE People who receive wages or schedular payments may apply to us for a special rate authorising you to deduct: • • PAYE using a specified code • • tax at a certain rate • • ACC earners’ levy only, or • • student loan repayments at a specified rate. Tailored tax codes, rates and student loan special deduction rate certificates For some employees or other workers, you may have to deduct tax at a special rate, or not deduct tax at all. The employee or worker will give you a certificate showing the rate you should use. If you do not get a certificate, you must deduct the normal rate of tax and other deduction If the certificate authorises you to deduct earners' levy only (no PAYE) the ACC earners’ levy amount should be shown in the PAYE tax column of your employer information. Note \[IN CONFIDENCE\] E xample Responsibilities 9ird.govt.nz Checking the certificate Check the name on the certificate is the person working for you and the IRD number is the same as their IR330 or IR330C. The certificate must: • • be for the current tax year • • show the deduction rate • • show the period it applies for If the employee's tailored tax code/rate certificate expires and it is not replaced by another certificate or an IR330 or IR330C: • • if the employee previously gave you a completed IR330 or IR330C, use the tax code or rate specified • • if the employee has not previously given you an IR330 or IR330C then use the non-notified tax rate until an IR330 or IR330C or new certificate is provided Making deductions Calculate the tax by multiplying the employee's gross pay by the special rate shown. Example An employee's certificate shows the following: PAYE deducted at the rate of 24.6% (includes ACC earners' levy of 1.6%). Gross earnings for pay period are $1,000. PAYE is $246 ($1,000 x 24.6%) If a certificate includes a student loan special deduction rate, use this to calculate the amount to deduct. This replaces the standard student loan deduction. Example An employee's certificate shows the following: PAYE deducted under tax code S SL. Student loan repayments at the rate of 5% Fortnightly gross earnings are $1,000 Student loan deduction is ($1,000 × 5%) = $50. PAYE deduction is $191.00 If the certificate does not include a special deduction rate for an employee with a student loan, continue to deduct these repayments on gross pay over the student loan threshold of $464 per week at 12%. What to show on your Employment information form: • • If the certificate has a tailored rate for PAYE, use STC tax code. • • If the certificate has a special deduction rate for student loans, use the tax code shown on the certificate. • • If the certificate has a tailored rate for PAYE and a rate for student loans, use STC for the tax code. • • If the certificate shows a tailored tax rate for schedular payments, use tax code WT. If you pay a bonus to an employee who has a tailored tax code, you need to deduct tax at the rate shown on the certificate. Note Responsibilities 10 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Schedular payments Schedular payments are payments made to people who are employed on a contract-for-service basis - see page 5 for information to help you work out who is an employee or a contractor. Most contractors can choose the rate of tax to be deducted from their payments if they do not use the standard rate for their activity. The rate they can choose is subject to a minimum rate of: • • 15% for non-residents and those on a temporary entry class visa, and • • 10% for everyone else. Non-resident entertainers and professional sportspeople visiting New Zealand must use 20%. They cannot choose a different rate. The main activities and the standard tax rates are listed on the back of the IR330C. If you're paying someone to do the types of work listed, you must deduct tax from the payments using the rate for the activity. Tax is deducted even if the worker is registered for GST. The only exception is if they provide you with a Certificate of exemption - IR331 - see page 11, or a 0% tailored tax rate certificate. Some types of schedular payments - such as commissions, directors' fees and payments to non- resident contractors - are covered in more detail in Part 5. If the type of work you've hired your contractor to do is not listed on the back of the IR330C you do not need to ask them to complete an IR330C or deduct tax from payments you make to them. Voluntary schedular payments Contractors who otherwise would not be required to have tax deducted from their payments can opt to have tax deducted. They must discuss this with you first and if you agree you must have this agreement in writing. It's recommended the agreement include: • • your name and the name of the contractor • • agreement that all payments made to the contractor will be treated as voluntary schedular payments • • the period this applies to, and • • signature of both you and the contractor. They must also provide you with an IR330C. If they do not choose a tax rate use the standard rate of 20%. Do not deduct ACC earners’ levy, KiwiSaver deductions or student loan repayments from schedular payments – this is the worker's responsibility, not yours. Note Do not deduct tax from schedular payments made: • • to a company, except a company that is: - a non-resident contractor - a non-resident entertainer - receiving payments made to it under certain labour hire arrangements - involved in agriculture, horticulture or viticulture whose work or services are provided under a contract or arrangement for the supply of labour, or substantially for the supply of labour, on land in connection with fruit crops, orchards, vegetables or vineyards. This does not include: • post-harvest facilities for work or services provided • a management entity under a formal management agreement under which the entity is responsible for payment for the work or services provided. • • to a non-resident contractor who is eligible for total relief from tax through a double tax agreement, and/or is present in New Zealand for a total of 92 days or less in any 12-month period • • to or for the contract activities of a non-resident contractor who has been paid $15,000 or less in total from all payers in any 12-month period • • for work or services completed by a public, local or Māori authority • • to a holder of a current certificate of exemption. A worker who is GST-registered will charge GST on goods and services supplied. This means the worker's gross earnings will increase by the GST charged. If the worker gives you taxable supply information, work out and deduct tax on the amount, excluding GST. Responsibilities 11ird.govt.nz Example You receive taxable supply information showing: Cost of labour $ 500.00 Plus GST (15% of $500) $ 75.00 $ 575.00 Calculate tax on GST-exclusive amount: GST-exclusive amount $ 500.00 Less tax (20% of $500) $ 100.00 $ 400.00 Plus GST $ 75.00 Net payment $ 475.00 You deduct tax from the $500. Show the $500 as the gross payment and $100 PAYE in your employment information return. Show WT tax code in your employer information return for a contractor receiving schedular payments. If a worker has a Certificate of exemption - IR331 People who are in business for themselves, and who receive a schedular payment can apply for a certificate of exemption from PAYE. A certificate of exemption may also be held by a non-resident contractor undertaking contract activity in New Zealand. See page 53 for further information. If a worker has a certificate of exemption, you can make payments without deducting tax. It cannot be used to exempt an employee's salary or wages from deducting PAYE. A certificate of exemption cannot be used for payments made to a contractor who is receiving schedular payments under certain labour hire arrangements. Checking the IR331 When someone shows you a certificate of exemption, you must check it is valid and current. If the certificate is valid and current, do not deduct tax from payments you make to them. If the certificate is not valid or current, the worker must complete a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. You must deduct tax from payments you make. You do not need to include tax-exempt payments in your employment information return. However, you must keep a record of these payments. You should keep a record of the certificate number in case we review your records. ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work-related injuries. We collect this on behalf of the ACC. The ACC earners’ levy is built into the PAYE tables and is deducted along with the tax, so no extra calculations are needed. Almost all employee earnings for PAYE are liable for the levy. They include: • • salary and wages • • overtime pay • • backpay and holiday pay • • long-service leave pay • • bonuses or gratuities • • taxable allowances • • shareholder-employee salaries that have PAYE deducted • • salaries to partners in a partnership • • salaries to working owners of a look-through company. The main exceptions are schedular payments, retirement payments, redundancy payments, benefits from an employee share scheme (if they are provided in shares), jury fees, witness fees, taxable and non-taxable pensions, and tax-free allowances. ACC will invoice close company employers for ACC earners’ levy on shareholder-employee remuneration that does not have PAYE deducted. The levy is based on the shareholder-employee remuneration declared in the company's IR4 income tax return. Responsibilities 12 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Student loan pay period repayment thresholds FrequencyThreshold Weekly$464 Fortnightly$928 Three-weekly$1,392 Four-weekly$1,856 Monthly$2,010.66 Student loan deductions are calculated as: 1. gross earnings for the pay period (regular pay plus any extra pay) 2. minus pay period repayment threshold 3. multiply by 12% Example An employee has a student loan and is paid $1,700 fortnightly. Student loan deductions are calculated as follows: Pay$1,700 Threshold$928 Liable income$772 $772 × 12%$92.64 Student loan deductions on this pay are $92.64. You can also use the PAYE deduction tables for student loan repayments to be deducted from each pay. The student loan repayments must be paid to us together with the PAYE deducted. If your employee tells you part-way through the year they should have been using one of the tax codes with SL, deduct the repayments only from the time you get the new code. It's important the right tax and/or student loan repayment code is used because it helps your employee avoid a tax bill or underpayment of their student loan - see page 6 for more details. Student loan special deduction rates Sometimes the tax code your employee must use will mean they pay more than they need to for their student loan. For example, if your employee's tax code is SB SL or S SL, the 12% standard student loan deduction rate for their secondary earnings may be too high. Your employee may give you a student loan special deduction rate certificate to lower the amount of student loan deductions required from their earnings. KiwiSaver You must make KiwiSaver available to all employees. You are required to provide the KiwiSaver status for all employees. As an employer you're required to: • • check whether new employees are eligible to join KiwiSaver • • check whether new or returning employees who had previously opted out should be automatically enrolled • • give the KiwiSaver employee information pack - KS3 to: - new or returning employees who qualify for automatic enrolment, and - existing employees who want to opt in • • give us information about: - all new employees who qualify for automatic enrolment, and - eligible employees who want to opt in to KiwiSaver • • give new employees a written statement and product disclosure statement if you have an employer-chosen scheme • • contribute to your employee's KiwiSaver scheme or complying fund (some exceptions apply). Please read our KiwiSaver employer guide - KS4 for more information. Note Student loan deductions As well as deducting PAYE, you may need to make deductions for student loans. If your employee has a student loan, they'll use a tax code with the SL student loan repayment code (M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL) on their Tax code declaration - IR330. Student loan repayment deductions are required to be made from each pay if the employee's gross earnings for the pay period is over the repayment threshold for their pay frequency: Responsibilities 13ird.govt.nz The certificate shows the rate to deduct student loan repayments at, and the length of time it's valid for. Only the employer named on the certificate is authorised to make the student loan deductions at the special deduction rate shown. The certificate may authorise you to do one of the following: • • deduct no student loan repayments at all or • • deduct student loan repayments at a rate lower than standard rate. Student loan repayment deduction exemptions Employees who study full-time and expect to earn under the annual repayment threshold ($24,128 for the 2025 tax year) may be exempt from having student loan repayments deducted from their salary or wages. You do not have to make student loan deductions for an employee who gives you a student loan repayment deduction exemption certificate. The certificate specifies the period covered by the exemption. Do not use an SL repayment code when you calculate their pay during this period. As soon as the exemption period ends add the SL repayment code back into your employee's tax code, and start making student loan deductions from their pay. If you do not do this, they may end up with a significant under-deduction. Student loan extra deductions Your employees may ask you to make extra deductions to pay off their loan faster or we may ask you to make compulsory extra deductions to catch up on an underpayment. These deductions are in addition to the amount you normally deduct using the student loan repayment code they've given you. You must show extra deductions separately on your employment information return as either: 1. SLBOR - employee requests voluntary extra deductions 2. SLCIR - we request you to make compulsory extra deductions. You'll need to keep separate records of PAYE and student loan repayments. By law, you cannot discriminate in any way against any employee because of their student loan responsibilities - see page 50 for more details. Do not deduct student loan repayments from schedular payments - see page 10. Note Child support deductions We assess and collect child support from parents who do not live with their children full-time. The payments we collect are paid to the receiving carer of the child. If they are a beneficiary, the payments are passed on to the government. If we’re assessing and collecting a person’s child support, it is compulsory for them to pay their child support by having deductions made from their employment income. If we ask you to deduct child support from any employee's wages, you're required to do this by law. We work out how much child support to deduct from a paying parent each pay. We use the employer information you provide about how often you pay your employees and their regular pay day, so it is important this information is correct. If an employee asks you to stop or start deducting child support, you should refer them to us. Child support deduction notice When we have all the information, we'll send you a child support deduction notice. This tells you to deduct child support payments from your employee's pay. The notice shows: • • your employee's name and IRD number • • the frequency and payday when you must start deducting child support • • the amount to deduct from each pay • • whether the notice replaces any earlier child support deduction notice. Do not make any deductions before the start date on the notice. Responsibilities 14 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE If the payday or pay frequency specified on the notice is different from your actual payday or pay frequency, it’s important you contact us so we can change our records. If our information is not correct it could mean the deductions we calculate for the employee may not cover the amount of child support they need to pay, or your employee may be charged unnecessary late payment penalties. When we need you to stop deducting child support, we will send you a notice with the date to make the final deduction If the amount changes during the year, we'll send you another child support deduction notice. This will show the new amount of child support and when you must start deducting it. If you have more than 1 employee you need to deduct child support for, we will send you a deduction notice with the details of all the employees you need to start, stop or change child support deductions for. These deduction notices are sent to your myIR account. If you do not have myIR we will post them to you. Child support has priority over any other deductions from an employee's net pay. This means after you have deducted PAYE, you must deduct child support before you deduct anything else (such as student loan repayments, insurances, KiwiSaver and other superannuation deductions, or union fees). We might ask you to deduct child support from payments to someone who is not your employee, such as a contractor or a commission agent. These should not be added to your employment information returns. The notice we send you explains how to make and pay the deductions. We will send you a deduction notice with the details of all the employees you need to start, stop or change child support deductions for. These deduction notices are sent to your myIR account. If you do not have a myIR account, we will post them to you. Protected net earnings All employees must be allowed to keep 60% of their net pay, after PAYE (but not the ACC earners’ levy) and child support is deducted. This is the employee's protected net earnings, to cover their living expenses. Example Weekly gross pay $1,250. Tax code M PAYE including earners' levy $245.40. ACC earners' levy ($1,250 × 1.60%) $20. Net earnings $1,250 − $245.40 + $20 = $1,024.60. Maximum child support that could be deducted is 40% of $1,024.60 = $409.84 Protected net earnings apply to child support only. You must still make other deductions such as student loan repayments, KiwiSaver deductions, insurances, superannuation and union fees from the protected net earnings. Protected earnings are usually only affected if your employee receives less pay than usual for some reason. If you're asked to deduct more than 40% of your employee's net pay, you must not deduct the full amount of child support. If you're not deducting the full amount of child support, do not make up the difference from future pays. We'll arrange with the employee to pay the balance owing. Example 1 - Full wages paid John is liable for payments of $70 child support each week. John's weekly wage $ 420.00 PAYE deducted (M tax code) $ 52.50 ACC earners' levy $ 6.72 Net earnings $ 360.78 40% of $360.78 is $ 144.31 Because $70 is less than 40% of John's net pay ($144.31) the full amount of child support can be deducted. h Responsibilities 15ird.govt.nz Example 2 - Less than full wages John had 3 days leave without pay in a week. John's reduced wage $ 168.00 PAYE deducted (M tax code) $ 17.64 ACC earners' levy $ 2.69 Net earnings $ 147.67 Protected net earnings (+$2.69) $ 150.36 40% of $150.36 is $ 60.14 Because $70 is more than 40% of John's protected net pay ($60.14) the full amount of child support cannot be deducted, as John would be left with less than 60% of his net pay. Deductions for student loan or KiwiSaver are still taken out of John's remaining pay if these apply. Paying child support deductions Show the amount deducted each pay day on your employment information return. You’ll need to tell us if you stop employing a person or if the amount you deduct is different from what we requested by using one of the child support codes on page 26. For help completing your Employment information - IR348 see pages 23-26. You must keep records of child support deducted along with your normal wage records. Child support deductions are paid at the same time as you pay the PAYE and other tax deductions. It's important your employer information returns show all deductions made in each pay period, no matter whether you pay it to us monthly or twice- monthly. Employee privacy and prejudice The law requires you to protect the privacy of your employees who pay child support. You cannot give out information about their child support responsibilities (with 2 exceptions - see page 49). By law, you cannot discriminate in any way against any employee because of their child support obligations. It's very important you read the full statements about privacy, prejudice and penalties on pages 46 to 49. Deducting arrears We may send you a notice asking you to deduct tax and/or student loan arrears from salary or wages paid to an employee, or schedular payments to a contractor. • • You're required to make the deductions requested in the notice. • • Child support payments (if applicable) must be deducted before tax or student loan arrears. • • Arrears must be paid to us by the end of each calendar month, separately from PAYE. • • Do not include deductions for arrears in your employment information return. Instructions on how to pay the arrears are included in the deduction notice. Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. You choose to set up payroll giving and how it will run. You pass your employee's donations on to the chosen donee organisation and reduce their PAYE with a tax credit for payroll donations. To offer payroll giving, you'll need to complete your employment information return electronically. Employer's role If you offer payroll giving as an employer you're required to: • • deduct the requested donation amount from your employee's salary or wages • • calculate the correct tax credits for each payroll donation made • • record the tax credits for payroll donations on your employment information • • keep records of all tax credits for payroll donations, donation amounts, donee organisations and payment dates • • pass the donation on to the chosen donee organisation within the specified timeframe • • advise the donee organisation that the donations are made through payroll giving. For more information, please read our guide Payroll giving - IR617. Responsibilities 16 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) and ESCT An employer's contribution is a monetary amount paid made to a superannuation fund, by an employer, for the benefit of their employees. A superannuation fund is a scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. All employer contributions paid to a superannuation fund, including KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, are liable for ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax). The exception to this is if you and your employee have agreed to treat some or all the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. See pages 16 - 19 for more information If your employee asks you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. ESCT There are 2 options for calculating and withholding tax on employer contributions: • • If you and your employee agree, the amount of employer contribution can be treated as the employee's salary or wages and PAYE must be deducted. • • In all other cases, ESCT must be deducted. ESCT is calculated at a rate based on the employee's total annual salary or wages plus gross employer contributions for the previous tax year (1 April to 31 March). When employees have not worked for you for the full previous tax year, the rate is based on the employee's total salary or wages plus gross employer contributions you estimate they will receive in the tax year ESCT is being calculated for. Employers paying into a defined benefit fund can choose to apply ESCT at the flat rate of 39%. Note If you’re not treating the employer contributions as part of the employee's salary or wages, you must deduct ESCT at the time of making any employer contributions. If you do not to do this, the ESCT is worked out on the grossed-up amount of the employer's superannuation contribution. Calculate the tax using this formula: ESCT= a × b 1 - a Where: a is the rate of ESCT, and b is the actual amount paid to the fund. The grossed-up contribution is the: • • actual amount paid to the fund, plus • • amount of ESCT worked out using the formula. Example An employer contributed $1,000 to a superannuation fund. Using the formula, the amount of ESCT to be paid is: ESCT= 0.30 × $1,000= $428.57 0.70 The gross superannuation contribution is: The amount received by the superannuation fund $ 1,000.00 Plus the tax on that amount $ 428.57 Grossed-up contribution $ 1,428.57 Tax on $1,428.57 at 30% is $428.57. The ESCT is deducted from the grossed-up contribution. The above formula and example assume no ESCT has already been paid for the contribution. Note Responsibilities 17ird.govt.nz ESCT rate based on 17.5% Example Joe is a KiwiSaver member and employed by A & B Limited. Joe is contributing 3% of his salary and his employer agreed to match the employee contributions dollar for dollar. This means that A & B Limited is also contributing 3% as employer contributions. For the purposes of calculating ESCT: Joe's 4-weekly salary is $ 3,200.00 KiwiSaver deduction $ 96.00 Employer contribution $ 96.00 ESCT rate (0.175) × $96.00 = $ 16.80 A B Limited would return the following information in their employment information return: KiwiSaver deduction $ 96.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contribution $ 79.20 The employer contribution is made up of $96.00 less ESCT of $16.80. A & B Limited would also account for the $16.80 ESCT in their employment information return. Read pages 23 to 28 on how to complete your Employment information - IR348. Note Sometimes an employer may be ‘locked-in’ to an employment agreement where they contribute a set percentage of their employee's salary. In these cases, it may be necessary to gross up the employer contribution, so the employee receives their full entitlement. If this applied to A & B Limited's employment agreement with Joe the result would be: Example KiwiSaver deduction $ 96.00 Employer contribution $ 96.00 A & B Limited would then gross up their contribution to account for ESCT while ensuring Joe received the full 3% employer contribution using the following formula. ESCT rate (0.175) × $96.00 = $ 20.36 1 - ESCT rate (0.175) A & B Limited shows the information in their employment information return as: KiwiSaver deduction $ 96.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contributions $ 96.00 A & B Limited would also account for the $20.36 ESCT in their employment information return. If Joe's superannuation scheme was not a KiwiSaver scheme, the employer contribution is not shown in their employment information return, but ESCT must still be shown. Note ESCT rate based on employee salary or wages The ESCT rate is based on the employee's salary or wages plus gross superannuation employer contributions received in the previous tax year (1 April to 31 March). The tax rate is used for all employer superannuation contributions made in the current tax year. Employee's salary or wage income for year ended 31 March\* ESCT from 1 April $0-$16,80010.5% $16,801-$57,60017.5% $57,601-$84,00030.0% $84,001 - $216,00033.0% $216,001 upwards39.0% \* This includes gross superannuation employer contributions. ESCT is calculated on the whole dollar and is deducted from the gross employer contribution. Responsibilities 18 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Example Regan's Trucks Ltd employs John and makes employer's contributions on his behalf. John is not a KiwiSaver or complying fund member. He worked at Regan's Trucks Ltd for the full year 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, receiving a salary of $36,400 and employer contributions of $1,820. For the 2025 tax year, Regan's Trucks Ltd elected to tax the employer's contributions using a rate based on John's previous year's salary and employer contributions. Because his salary, plus gross employer contributions, was between $16,801 and $57,600, the ESCT rate is 17.5%. John's salary is now $39,000, or $750 per week. Regan's Trucks Ltd's contribution to John's superannuation is $37.50 (5%) of his salary a week. The amount paid to John's superannuation is not shown in the employment information return. If the superannuation contribution amount includes ESCT, the ESCT calculation is: $37.50 x 17.5% = $6.56 The amount passed to John's superannuation scheme is $30.94 ($37.50 - $6.56) and ESCT of $6.56 is shown in the employer information return. If the superannuation contribution amount excludes ESCT, the ESCT calculation is: 37.50 x 17.5% = $7.95 82.5% The amount passed on to John's superannuation is $37.50 and the ESCT amount of $7.95 is shown on the employment information return. If the employee did not work for the employer for the full year 1 April to 31 March, the employer must: • • estimate the amount of salary or wages and gross superannuation employer contributions that will be earned by the employee in the current year, and • • base the ESCT rate on the estimate. Example Regan's Trucks Ltd employs Matt on 1 October 2024. Matt's on a contract for salary of $30,000 and employer contributions of $1,500 a year. The company estimates Matt's ESCT rate based on the amount of salary or wages plus gross employer contributions he will earn in the remainder of this tax year (1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025)\*. Salary $ 30,000 Employer contributions $ 1,500 Total $ 31,500 $31,500 ÷ 12 months $ 2,625 $ 2,625 × 6 months $ 15,750 Because the estimate of $15,750 is between $0 and $16,800 the ESCT rate is 10.5%. \* There are only 6 months left in the tax year. If an employee is only employed for 3 months the employer would estimate how much the employee would earn in those 3 months and base the ESCT rate on the estimation. As the employee started part-way through the current tax year, the employer must make a second estimation of the employee's earnings as the basis for the ESCT rate at the beginning of the following tax year (1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026). Note You need to work out the ESCT rate for each employee. Do this at the start of the tax year (1 April). If an employee’s salary or wage changes during the tax year do not change the ESCT rate during the year. Change it at the start of the next tax year. Paying ESCT Pay any ESCT deducted with your PAYE by the due date. Taxing contributions at the employee's personal tax rate If you agree, your employee can choose all or part of your employer's contribution to be included in their gross salary or wage, and taxed under the PAYE rules. Employees must understand by classifying this amount as salary and wages it will affect their Working for Families and, independent earner tax credit entitlements, the amount of child support they pay and their student loan repayments. Employees can change back at any time. Responsibilities 19ird.govt.nz The actual employer contribution is paid into the superannuation fund - the employee does not receive the contribution in the hand. The value of the employer contribution will be added to the employee's gross wages for the pay period and taxed at the appropriate rate using the PAYE tables. The rate will depend on the employee's tax code. Contributions treated as salary and wages have ACC earners’ levy deducted (included in the PAYE tables). There are 2 ways of paying the employer contribution to the superannuation fund: • • the gross amount is paid to the superannuation fund and the employee's net salary or wage is reduced by the amount of PAYE, or • • the net amount is paid to the superannuation fund after deducting the income tax component of the PAYE. Example Rachel is employed by Red Bottle Ltd. She belongs to KiwiSaver. Her employment agreement includes Red Bottle Ltd contributing $50 (10%) a week to her KiwiSaver scheme, in addition to her normal weekly salary of $500. Rachel chooses to have these contributions included as part of her salary and her employer agrees. This means Red Bottle Ltd uses the total of her salary and the employer contributions of $550 to calculate her PAYE. 1. If the superannuation contribution is paid as a gross amount, the calculation is: Weekly gross $ 500.00 plus employer contribution $ 50.00 Total gross $ 550.00 PAYE on $550.00 $ 84.05 Weekly gross $ 550.00 less PAYE $ 84.05 less employer contribution $ 50.00 Net amount $ 415.95 Red Bottle Ltd shows this in their employment information return as: Gross earnings $ 550.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contribution $ 50.00 Example 2. If the superannuation contribution is paid as a net\* amount, the calculation is: Weekly gross $ 500.00 PAYE on $500.00 $ 74.50 Weekly gross $ 500.00 plus employer contribution $ 50.00 Total gross $ 550.00 PAYE on $550.00 $ 84.05 less PAYE on $500.00 $ 74.50 PAYE on employer contribution $ 9.55 Identify earner premium $50.00 × 1.60% = $0.76 Deduct the earner premium from the PAYE on the employer contribution $9.55 - $0.80 = $8.75 Subtract tax on employer contribution from gross employer contribution $50.00 − $8.75 = $41.25 Weekly gross $ 550.00 less PAYE $ 84.05 less net employer contribution $ 41.25 Net amount $ 424.70 Red Bottle Ltd enters the information in their employment information return as: Gross earnings $ 550.00 Net KiwiSaver employer contribution $ 41.25 \* Net refers to tax, not PAYE. The ACC earners’ levy must be removed before the tax is deducted from the gross employer contribution. Records and payments 20 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Your records must be in English or Māori unless you've asked us for approval to use another language. Records you need to keep You must keep all employment and wage records for at least 7 years, including all pay sheets and PAYE payment receipts. You also need to keep all tax code declaration forms, KiwiSaver forms and any certificates and notifications you receive from your employees or Inland Revenue. To help with your record keeping, you can get computer payroll packages or specially designed wage books. PAYE intermediaries Employers can hire a PAYE intermediary to complete their payroll requirements. If a PAYE intermediary is used, both the employer and the intermediary must meet the following requirements. Employers need to: • • provide information requested by the intermediary within the time agreed by the employer and intermediary • • pay employees' gross salary or wages (and compulsory employer contributions for employees' KiwiSaver schemes) for the pay period into a trust account established by the PAYE intermediary by the date specified by the intermediary • • keep records of the gross salary or wages paid for the period. PAYE intermediaries: • • calculate the employer's respective payroll information • • pay the employer's respective employees, including payment of any third-party deductions • • pay the employer's respective tax deductions (including student loans, KiwiSaver, child support, ESCT and additional employee-related deductions) to us • • meet all the employer record keeping and return filing requirements. Providing an employer has supplied the intermediary with all their relevant payroll information and gross payments, the intermediary is responsible for applying the PAYE rules correctly, not the employer. Manual record keeping • • Start a new page in your wage book as soon as an employee starts work with you or at the beginning of each tax year. Make sure they give you the personal details you need. • • Keep a separate page for each employee, even if they were only employed for one day. • • Complete all these wage details each payday: - total gross earnings, including taxable allowances (the amount before PAYE is deducted) - the amount of PAYE deducted - any child support deductions - any KiwiSaver deductions - any KiwiSaver employer contributions (gross) - any net KiwiSaver employer contributions - any student loan repayments - any student loan extra deductions - any ESCT (see page 16) - any tax credits for payroll donations (see page 15) - the value of tax-free reimbursing allowances. • • Summarise the details for each employee at the end of each deduction payment period. The information in your wage book will help you complete your Employment information - IR348 form - see page 23. Part 2 - Record keeping and making payments Records and payments 21ird.govt.nz Paying twice a month If your gross annual PAYE (including ESCT) is $500,000 or more in the previous year ended 31 March, you're required to pay PAYE: • • from wages paid between the 1st and 15th of the month by the 20th of the same month • • from wages paid between the 16th and the end of the month by the 5th of the following month, except for the second period of December, the due date is 15 January. Period PAYE deductedDue date 1 to 15 October20 October 16 to 31 October5 November 1 to 15 November20 November 16 to 30 November5 December If your payment is made late, you'll be charged interest and may also be charged late payment penalties and non-payment penalties - see page 47. Paying PAYE to Inland Revenue If the PAYE due date for payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, you can make your payment on the next working day without penalty. Whether you pay your PAYE to us monthly or twice-monthly depends on your gross annual PAYE deducted. Gross annual PAYE is the total PAYE, including any ESCT, but excluding ACC earners’ levy, student loan repayments, KiwiSaver deductions and child support. Your payment can be made electronically - see page 29. If the gross annual PAYE and ESCT deductions are $50,000 or more, you must file your IR348 electronically. Note Paying once a month If your gross annual PAYE (including ESCT) is less than $500,000 you must pay PAYE monthly. PAYE is due by the 20th of the following month. Example An employer pays wages fortnightly on Wednesdays.

Note New employers As a new employer, you’re required to make payments to us monthly until your total amount of PAYE and ESCT is $500,000 or more. From then on you must make payments twice a month. To avoid late filing penalties, you need to let us know if you do not pay wages in any period. Find the best way to contact us at ird.govt.nz/contact-us New Employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K You'll need to fill out new employee details. You can do this through your myIR account or by completing a New Employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form for each new or returning employee and send it to us either: • • before their first pay day; or • • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if you have it. Payday filing Every payday you must complete your employment information return with details of your employees' gross wages and deductions made. If you are filing electronically the due date is within 2 working days after the payday If you are paper filing, you can choose to send in the information within 10 working days of each payday, or • • for payments between the 1st and the 15th of the month, within 10 working days of the 15th and • • for payments between the 16th of the month and the end of the month, within 10 working days of month end. • • Use the 15th and/or last day of the month as the payday(s) not the actual payday when filing employment information. If you choose to file your employment information twice a month, you must show each payday for each employee in a separate entry in your employment information return. This rule also applies to all payments made to employees including schedular payments and irregular payments to employees outside their regular pay day. Employers with gross annual PAYE of $50,000 or more must file their employment information returns electronically. See page 29 for more information on electronic filing. If you’re paper filing, on your first Employment information return - IR348, enter each employee's name, IRD number, tax code and start date. After your first return, this information will be filled out for you on the IR348, and you'll only need to enter details of any new employees. If any of the preprinted information is incorrect, cross it out and note the correct details on the form. Are you a new employer? For the first 6 months of employing staff, you can choose to file paper returns. If after 6 months you have gone over the $50,000 threshold, you’ll need to file your returns electronically Exempt employers If your gross annual PAYE is more than the $50,000 threshold, you can apply for an exemption from filing electronically. We’ll look at: • • the nature and availability of digital services to you, such as the reliability of the services • • whether you can use a computer, and • • whether the cost in delivering your employment information electronically would be unreasonable for your business’ circumstances. Records and payments 23ird.govt.nz Completing your Employment information return - IR348 Fill in the following details for each employee: Full name This can either be the employee’s legal name or their preferred name.

We need to know why the payment is different so we can apply the amount correctly to the person’s child support account. Use one of these codes A - Payment in advance Use this code if you pay an employee in advance. Deduct the same amount of child support as you would if you were paying the employee on the usual payday. You must include the child support with the deductions for the period when the employee was given the advance pay. Your C - Ceased employment Use this code if an employee stops working for you. Deduct child support from the last full pay you gave them, and from any holiday pay owed. We will remove the employee from your records. D - Previously deducted Use this code if the full amount of child support requested from an employee's wages is not deducted because you made an advance payment. Your child support will be less than usual for period P - Protected earnings Use this code if you're unable to deduct the full amount of child support requested from an employee's wages due to protected net earnings. S - Short-term absences Use this code if an employee is off work on unpaid leave for a short period of time and you're unable to deduct any of the child support requested. O - Other Use this code if none of the other variation codes can be used to explain why the amount of child support deducted does not equal what was expected If an employee stops working for you, the ceased employment code takes priority, even if another code, for example protected earnings, might also apply.

How to pay your deductions Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: • • internet banking • • by credit or debit card • • direct debit. If you're paying PAYE you need to select the EMP tax type for employer deductions (PAYE or any combination of PAYE, child support, student loan, KiwiSaver and ESCT). When an employee stops working for you You will need to enter each employee's finish date in your employment information return. You must also enter the employees finish date in the employees list in myIR or via an Employee details file. If you are deducting child support, you must provide the employee’s finish date and child support code. An automatic cease date is added by us if an employee has not been ceased by you and, for 3 consecutive months: • • has not been included in your employment information return, or • • has been included and no earnings have been recorded. If an employee stops working for you and is rehired then they must complete another Tax code declaration – IR330. You’ll also need to show the employee’s new start date in your employment information return. If an employee is being rehired or has returned to work for you within 30 days of the automatic cease date, process their pay as usual. If the employee is paid 30 days after the automatic cease date, you may need to confirm the employee’s KiwiSaver status. • • If the employee is an active KiwiSaver member, you can process their pay as usual. • • If the employee has previously opted out of KiwiSaver, you should confirm with them they wish to remain this way and provide us with a new KiwiSaver opt-out request Employee rehired in the same year If an employee stops working for you and is rehired in the same year ended 31 March, you must get another Tax code declaration - IR330. You'll also need to show the employee's new start date in your employee information return. Employee on transfer If an employee transfers from a branch of a company to another and is paid by the new branch office on a separate payroll: • • the old branch treats the transfer as if the employee has stopped work • • the new branch must get the employee to fill in another Tax code declaration - IR330 and will show the employee's start date in your employment information return. If the employee is paid from a central or head office, that office continues deducting PAYE from the employee's earnings. The employee does not need to complete a new IR330. Records and payments 30 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE If you've stopped or are about to stop providing fringe benefits If you are no longer providing fringe benefits or closing down your business, you need to cancel your fringe benefit tax (FBT) registration. You cancel your registration through myIR or on your final return. If your company is still in business but you want to opt out of FBT, go to ird.govt.nz/fbt-close- companies If you stop employing staff If you've stopped paying wages permanently, on your final employer information return you must include finish dates for all employees. You can cancel your registration in myIR. If you are paper filing, include a note with your final employment information return saying you’ve stopped employing and the date this applies from, or call 0800 377 772 and let us know, even if your business is still going. A company has not stopped paying wages permanently until all its wages, including shareholder-employee salaries, have been finally calculated. Shareholder-employee salaries with no tax deducted are included in the company's IR4 tax return. If you’re ceasing your business You can cease your business registration in myIR or complete a Business cessation - IR315 form and send it to us. Other payments 31ird.govt.nz Besides normal salaries and wages, you may make other payments to, or on behalf of, your workers. This part covers the most common payments and explains the tax treatment for each. Allowances Allowances can be taxable or tax-free, and are usually paid because of: • • an industrial collective agreement, or • • an agreement made between the employer and employees - commonly known as an inhouse agreement. Taxable allowances are added to an employee's gross earnings and PAYE is deducted from this total. If you do not do this, you could be liable for the PAYE that should have been deducted, as well as penalties. Include the total taxable allowances with your employees' gross wages in your employment information return Tax-free allowances should be added to your employees' net wages (wages after PAYE) when you pay them. Show the total amount of tax-free allowances paid in your wage book. You do not need to apply for our approval to pay tax-free allowances to your employees. Use our guidelines to decide if the allowance you want to pay will be tax-free or not. The 5 types of allowances commonly paid are: • • accommodation allowances • • meal and clothing allowances • • benefit allowances • • reimbursing allowances • • travelling allowances. We can also issue binding rulings on which allowances may be paid tax free. Accommodation allowances Generally, if you provide accommodation or pay an accommodation allowance to an employee it is a benefit allowance for the employee and is taxable. Accommodation includes board or lodging provided by or paid for by you, as well as the use of a house or living premises, whether permanent or temporary. However, certain accommodation or accommodation payments may be tax exempt, if provided: • • in specific locations, for out-of-town secondments or capital projects • • when an employee is required to work in multiple locations on an ongoing basis • • when required to stay overnight to attend a meeting, training course or conference. You might choose to provide accommodation or an accommodation allowance when an employee needs to continuously work at a distant work location that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home. This accommodation may be exempt from tax, provided 1 of the following conditions are met: • • There’s a reasonable expectation the employee's secondment will be for a period of no more than 2 years, in which case the maximum exemption is 2 years. • • The employee is sent to work on a capital project at a distant work location for no more than 3 years, in which case the maximum exemption period is 3 years. A capital project is a project of limited duration whose principal purpose is the creation, enhancement or demolition of a capital asset, which involves work for a client not related to the employer. Note However, if the accommodation or accommodation allowance is being provided under a salary trade- off arrangement, it will not be tax exempt under these rules, and will be treated as a taxable benefit allowance. Part 3 - Other payments Other payments 32 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Example Adam is an accountant in Auckland. His employer sends him to New Plymouth for 3 months to audit a client before returning to the Auckland office. Adam's employer reimburses his hotel costs in New Plymouth. Because Adam's employer expects him to work in New Plymouth for less than 2 years, the payment Adam receives as reimbursement for his accommodation costs in New Plymouth is exempt income. Example Bill lives in Wellington. His job is moved permanently to Auckland, but he chooses not to move his family and commutes on a weekly basis. Bill's employer pays him an allowance towards his Auckland accommodation costs. Bill and his employer expect him to work at the Auckland workplace for more than 2 years. The accommodation allowance is not tax exempt under the 2-year rule. The exemption ends when any of the following occur: • • You pay the employee's costs associated with buying a house in or near the distant work location, as a reimbursing relocation expense. • • There's a change in the expectation the employee will be at the distant work location for longer than the maximum period of 2 years or 3 years, as applicable. • • The employee's involvement in the secondment or project comes to an end before the maximum time is up. If you expect the secondment or role on the project will last a certain length and that expectation changes, you’ll need to keep accurate and clear records including when the secondment began and when the expectation changed. Evidence of the original expectation and any subsequent change may take the form of: • • a modification in the employee's terms of employment • • board minutes • • planning documents • • correspondence with the third party you’re carrying out the capital project for. There are some circumstances where an employee must work at more than 1 workplace on an ongoing basis. These may be because of the nature of their duties or because the additional workplaces are beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from their home. This could be the case, for example, for senior managers of large organisations. In these circumstances there is an exemption for employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments, without an upper time limit, given there will be genuine ongoing additional costs in such cases. Example Andrew manages 2 offices, one in Dunedin where he lives and one in Christchurch. He works in Dunedin for 3 days a week and in Christchurch for 2. When he works in Christchurch, it's unreasonable for him to travel back to Dunedin every day. The Christchurch accommodation is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. The Dunedin accommodation is not tax exempt. There is no time limit on tax-exempt accommodation or accommodation payments for an employee who attends a work-related meeting, conference or training course that requires an overnight (or longer) stay. The exemption also applies to locally-held courses that may require employees to stay overnight for reasons like networking and team-building. If you provide a taxable accommodation allowance or accommodation, it becomes a benefit allowance. To tax it as a benefit allowance, you must first determine its taxable value. If you pay for accommodation on behalf of an employee, or pay an accommodation allowance to an employee, the taxable value is the amount paid: • • less any rent or other contributions from the employee • • after any adjustments for business/work use of the premises. Other payments 33ird.govt.nz If you provide an employee with accommodation, the taxable value is the market rental value of the accommodation: • • less any rent paid by the employee • • after any adjustments for business/work use of the premises • • after any adjustments for when employees share accommodation. Specific rules determine the taxable value of accommodation for: • • employees working overseas • • ministers of religion • • New Zealand Defence force personnel. For more information on the tax treatment of accommodation allowances and how to determine the taxable value for accommodation go to ird.govt.nz/allowances Meal and clothing allowances You may pay for an employee's meals linked to work-related duties, because these meals may be more expensive for the employee than normal meal costs at home. There are 2 specific exemptions for meals and meal allowances paid to employees: • • An exemption of up to 3 months applies to meals if the employee is required to work away from their normal workplace because they are travelling on business. This may be for a specific short-term, work-related journey or for a longer period such as a secondment to a distant work location. • • Payments to cover working meals and light refreshments when working away from your business premises are exempt without any time limit. The full amount of any meal payment will be exempt in both situations. The exemption includes meal allowances, reimbursement of meal expenses and paying for the employee's meal. However, a meal allowance provided under a salary trade-off arrangement is not tax exempt and treated as a taxable benefit allowance. There are 2 types of clothing payments exempt from tax. They are payments: • • provided to cover the cost of distinctive work clothing such as uniforms, and • • to meet the costs of plain clothes allowances paid to members of a uniformed service, provided certain conditions are met. Distinctive work clothing is defined as a single item of clothing: • • worn by an employee as, or as part of, a uniform that can be identified with the employer: - through the permanent and prominent display of a name, logo or other identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their activity or undertaking, or - because of the colour scheme, pattern or style is readily associated with the employer • • is worn during, or as an incident of, employment, and • • is not clothing that employees would normally wear for private purposes. This would include uniforms worn by nursing staff, members of the armed forces and police officers. Specialist clothing might include overalls and protective clothing worn for health and safety reasons. Uniformed service workers, such as police officers meeting specific conditions, may be entitled to an exemption for plain clothes allowances that were in place on 1 July 2013. Note Benefit allowances Benefit allowances are payments made in addition to salary or wages, that benefit the employee. A taxable benefit allowance is included with the employee's wages and taxed in the pay period it's paid in. Food or accommodation provided to employees may also be a benefit allowance. The taxable value of the benefit is the difference between the market value of the benefit provided, and any amount the employee pays. Add the taxable value of the benefit to the employee's wages each pay period and deduct PAYE from the total. Other payments 34 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE incurred. • • The expenditure is incurred before the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the employee relocates. • • Reimbursements for assets costing less than $1,000 are exempted. Travelling allowances A cash allowance paid to an employee for travel between home and work is tax-free if: • • the amount paid reimburses an employee's additional transport costs, and • • there are one or more special circumstances. Special circumstances are where the employee: • • is working outside the normal hours of work (for example, in overtime, shift or weekend work) • • needs to carry work-related tools and equipment (for example, usually they take the bus but must use other transport to shift work- related gear) • • is travelling to fulfil a statutory obligation • • has a temporary change in workplace • • has some other condition of their job, or • • has no adequate public transport system that serves the workplace. For all the special circumstances given, except the lack of adequate public transport, the tax-free amount is the actual cost of travelling between home and work, less the employee's usual travel costs. Example Market value of accommodation $ 250 a week Less rent paid $ 100 a week Value to be added to wages and taxed $ 150 a week If the employee paid no rent, the value to be taxed would be $250 per week. These rules do not affect the existing exemptions applying to overtime meal payments, sustenance allowances and when you provide distinctive work clothing to an employee. The rules also do not apply in the case where FBT (fringe benefit tax) is payable on meals directly provided by you such as a discount in the work canteen. The rules limiting employers' deductions of entertainment expenses also continue to apply. Note Reimbursing allowances Reimbursing allowances are payments made to employees to compensate them for expenses they've incurred while doing their job, for example, kilometre allowances, clothing allowances, tool money, meal allowances or overtime meal allowances. Reimbursing allowances are not taxable. However, if the payment is more than the employment related expenses, the excess is taxable. Work-related relocation payments made to your employees are tax-free, provided they meet all the following conditions: • • Your employee's relocation is required as the result of: - taking up new employment with a new employer, or - taking up new duties for you at a new location, or - continuing in their current position but at a new location. • • Your employee's existing home is not within reasonable travelling distance of their new workplace (unless accommodation is provided as part of the job). • • The expense is on the list of eligible relocation expenses, go to ird.govt.nz/allowances • • The payment reflects actual expenditure Other payments 35ird.govt.nz Example You change the roster, requiring some of your employees to work the night shift. There are no additional transport costs if your employee's usual travel from home to work is by: • • bus during the day and bus to do the new night shift, or • • private car during the day and private car to do the new night shift. Any travelling allowance paid is taxable. But, if your employee's usual travel from home to work is by bus, costing $6 during the day, and they have to travel 22 km by private car to do the new night shift because there is no late bus, part of the travel is tax-free. Actual cost: 22 km @ $1.04 for each km\* $22.88 Less usual travel costs $ 6.00 Additional transport costs (tax-free amount) $16.88 • • if the travelling allowance paid is: $22.88, $16.88 is tax-free and $6.00 is taxable • • $13.00, all is exempt as it is below the increased cost of $16.88. \* From the 2023-24 income year, the Inland Revenue kilometre rate is $1.04 per km for the business portion of the first 14,000 km. For further kilometres travelled different rates apply, depending on vehicle type. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/vehicle-expenses Add the taxable amount to your employee's gross income and work out PAYE on the total. If you pay a travelling allowance because there's a lack of adequate public transport, only the first $5 of the daily travelling allowance is taxable. Any additional amount is tax-free. For a combination of any of the special circumstances set out above and there's no adequate public transport, you will need to choose a calculation method to use. Example - no public transport There's no public transport so an employee travels 22 km by private car between their home and work, for their employer's benefit. Actual cost: 22 km @ $1.04 for each km\* $22.88 Less $5.00 per day $ 5.00 Additional transport costs (tax-free amount) $17.88 $17.88 is payable tax-free. Example - no usual transport costs A paramedic works during the day at a medical centre. They're called out at night to a car accident, travelling 57 km return in their private car. Actual cost: 57 km @ $1.04 for each km\* $59.28 Less usual travel costs $ 0.00 (nil cost, because this is additional to the usual travel from home to work) Additional transport costs (tax-free amount) $ 59.28 You may make a reasonable estimate of the likely costs for an employee or a group of employees and use an average. You do not have to calculate the costs for each employee in each pay period. If your employee travels more than 70 km a day you must let us know why this travel is necessary for the purposes of the additional transport cost calculation. If a group of employees has a travelling arrangement, such as sharing 1 employee's car, you must calculate the non-taxable amount. This amount will be based on either the average expenses of each individual or the average expenses of that group of employees. Other payments 36 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE GST on allowances You can claim a business expense for reimbursing your employee’s actual expenses if: • • you're registered for GST • • they incur the expenditure in the course of your business. Keep taxable supply information for your employees purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents to claim GST. You cannot claim GST if the allowance is a general one that does not reimburse the employee's actual expenses incurred on your behalf, or if it's paid to meet the employee's private expenses. Lump sums (extra pays) Lump sum payments include annual or special bonuses, retiring or redundancy payments, payments for accepting restrictive covenants, exit inducement payments, gratuities, back pay and holiday pay paid in addition to the regular pay for the pay period. These are also called "extra pays". Overtime or any regular payments are not lump sum payments. You can choose how you calculate tax on holiday pay paid as a lump sum to an employee before they take their leave. You can choose to calculate tax on this payment: • • as an extra pay, or • • as if you're paying the lump sum to the employee in their regular pay cycle. Refer to page 43 for more details on this calculation. Note There are 6 tax rates for lump sums. These are shown in the current PAYE deduction tables. Earners' levy is included in the rates, except for: • • retiring or redundancy payments, • • employee share scheme benefits (if they are provided in shares), or • • where the combined earnings of the employee, including the lump sum, is more than or likely to be more than the ACC earners’ levy maximum. If your employee's annual salary or wages plus the lump sum will be more than $14,000, you must deduct tax at 1 of the higher rates. This means your employee will be less likely to have a large tax bill at the end of the year from an under-taxed lump sum payment. Your employees can also elect to have any lump sums taxed at a higher rate. They may choose to do this if, they have another job or other untaxed income, such as rent. They will tell you if they want to use a higher rate. The PAYE deducted on the lump sum is paid with the other PAYE for the pay period it occurs in. If the lump sum is taxed using the lowest rate, tick the box in your employment information return to show this. If an employee is on the non-notified rate (ND tax code) or they are a non-resident seasonal worker on the NSW tax code (see page 54), any lump sum extra pays will have PAYE calculated based on the flat rate that applies to each tax code - 10.5% for the NSW code (plus ACC earners levy, if applicable), 45.0% for the ND tax code (plus ACC earners levy, if applicable). Lump sum payments from main employment The calculation for tax on an extra pay for employees using a main tax code (M, ME, M SL or ME SL) is: 1. the amount of the extra pay 2. plus annualised income\* 3. equals the annual income estimate. The whole lump sum is then taxed at a flat rate based on the appropriate income range from table 1. \* Calculate annualised income by adding up the PAYE income payments for the 4 weeks ending on the date of the extra payment, whether this is the normal pay cycle or not, and multiplying by 13. Do not include the amount of the extra pay in this total. Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in the pay period. Note Other payments 37ird.govt.nz The income thresholds tables in this section should be used for any lump sum payments, including redundancy and retiring allowances for main and secondary job employees, up to 31 March 2025. The new threshold rates do not apply until after this date. Note Table 1: Income range and tax rates Annual income estimateTax rateACC rate $0 - $14,00010.5%1.6% $14,001 - $48,00017.5%1.6% $48,001 - $70,00030.0%1.6% 70,001 - $142,28333.0%1.6%\* $142,284 - $180,00033.0%0% $180,001 upwards 39.0%0% \* The ACC earners' levy is only added to the tax rate up to the maximum threshold of $142,283 (from 1 April 2024). Amounts above this level only have 33% and 39% deducted. • • ACC earners' levy does not apply to retiring or redundancy payments. These should have PAYE applied at 10.5%, 17.5%, 30.0%, 33.0% or 39.0% according to annualised income. • • If the lump sum has tax applied using the lowest rate (10.5%), tick the box on the IR348 to show this. Note Example Tama is paying an employee a bonus payment of $400. The employee's gross earnings for the last 4-weeks was $2,500. The calculation is: Annualised income (13 × $2,500) $ 32,500 Add the bonus payment $ 400 Total $ 32,900 In this example, the income level is less than $48,000, so the PAYE rate (tax rate plus earners' levy) applied to the bonus payment is 19.1% (19.1 cents in the dollar). $400 (bonus) × 19.1% (tax + ACC earners' levy) = $76.40 (PAYE) If the employee uses a student loan tax code (M SL or ME SL) you'll also have to deduct student loan repayments. See pages 12 to 13 for details on calculating student loan repayment deductions. In addition, if the employee is a KiwiSaver member, you'll need to deduct contributions from lump sum payments. Lump sum payments from secondary employment The calculation for lump sum payments for secondary employment uses the minimum income the employee expects to receive from their main job employment, based on the secondary tax code they have selected. The calculation for PAYE on an extra pay for employees using a secondary tax code is: • • the amount of the extra pay • • plus annualised income\* • • plus the low threshold amount, based on the secondary tax code used (see the following table) The total is the annual income estimate. \* Annualised income is calculated by adding up the PAYE income payments for the 4 weeks ending on the date of the extra pay , whether this is the normal pay cycle or not, and multiplying by 13. The amount of the extra pay is not included in this total. Do not include any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in the pay period. Note The whole lump sum is then taxed at a flat rate (including student loan if needed) based on the appropriate income range from Table 3.

The PAYE rate is 33% for income up to $180,000, and 39% for income of $180,001 and over. • • If the annualised income plus the low threshold is $142,283 or less, but the annual income estimate is more than $142,283: - the amount of PAYE applied to the extra pay amount below the threshold is calculated at 34.6% - the extra pay amount above $142,283 has no ACC earners' levy, PAYE is calculated at 33.0%. Example Jane has a secondary job and uses the ST tax code. Jane’s secondary employer wants to pay her a bonus of $30,000. In the last 4 weeks Jane has earned $3,298 from her second job. Jane’s employer works out the amount of PAYE on her bonus: Annualised income ($3,298 × 13) $ 42,874 plus low threshold (ST) $ 70,001 $112,875 plus extra pay $ 30,000 Total amount $142,875 The annualised income plus the low threshold amount is below $142,283. But when the lump sum is added, the annualised income of $142,875, it’s more than $142,283. The earner’s levy only applies to $29,408 of the extra pay (PAYE rate is 34.6%). The remaining $592 does not have any earner’s levy applied, the PAYE rate is 33.0%. In the next example PAYE (including earner’s levy) is calculated on the full bonus and then the excess earner’s levy is deducted: Example $30,000 × 34.60% = $10,380 Annual income estimate – ACC earners’ levy = amount not liable for ACC earners’ levy $12,875 − $142,283 = $592 $592 × 1.60% = $9.47 $10,380 − $9.47 = $10,242.53 Amount of PAYE applied to the lump sum = $10,370.53 Paying a net bonus If you want to pay an employee a net bonus, you must calculate the gross amount to include in your wage records. The PAYE and any student loan repayment calculated on the bonus must be paid with other deductions for that pay period. The method for working out the gross bonus depends on the employee's tax code. Example – no student loan Balvant is being paid a net bonus of $60. Their tax code is M, and his annual income will be $49,000. The PAYE rate is 19.1%: To work out the gross bonus Deduct 19.1% from $1 (1 - 19.1% = 0.809) $60 ÷ 0.809 = gross bonus $74.16 Calculate the PAYE Gross bonus x 19.1% PAYE rate = $14.16 Net bonus $60.00 Example – with a student loan Freya is also being paid a net bonus of $60. Their tax code is M SL, and her annual income will be $51,000. The PAYE rate 19.1% + 12.0% student loan = 31.1%: To work out the gross bonus Deduct 31.1% from $1 (1 - 19.1% = 0.689) $60 ÷ 0.689 = gross bonus $87.08 Calculate the PAYE Less gross bonus x 19.1% PAYE = $14.16 Less student loan deduction $87.08 x 12.0% = $10.45 Net bonus $60.00 Other payments 39ird.govt.nz Restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments These payments are taxable as follows: Restrictive covenant payments These are payments made in return for a person agreeing to restrict their ability to perform services. This includes payments made to an employee when their employment is terminated, and they agree not to carry on business in competition with their former employer. It also includes payments made when an employee enters a restrictive covenant with a wholly owned company and then sells the shares in that company to their employer. These types of payments are classed as source deduction payments, so PAYE must be deducted. Exit inducement payments Exit inducement payments are made by a prospective employer or contractor to a person to give up a status or position. These include payments to employees whose job status changes, even if they do not have a career change. These types of payments are also defined as source deduction payments, so PAYE must be deducted. Both restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments are taxed at the lump sum rate. See the PAYE deduction tables for the current lump sum rates. Retiring and redundancy payments Retiring allowances A retiring allowance is a payment made to an employee on retirement. The employment must have been fully terminated because of: • • the employee's decision • • the terms of any union contract • • the length of service of the employee, or • • the employer's policy. It's not based on the age of the employee. Retiring allowances are taxable in full but not liable for ACC earners’ levy. See pages 39 to 42 for information on how to calculate the correct tax. Example Retiring payment $ 10,200 PAYE at 30% \* $ 3,060 \* This example assumes the employee's gross annual income is between $48,001 and $70,000. Redundancy payments A redundancy payment is different from a retiring allowance. The decision to terminate employment is the employers. Redundancy payments may be made: • • to an employee whose position is no longer needed, or • • to a seasonal worker whose usual seasonal position is no longer needed (the employee works for you at a regular time each year for a continuous period of less than 12 months). The following are not redundancy payments, and are liable for ACC earners’ levy: • • any payment made to an employee solely because of a seasonal lay-off • • any payment made at the end of a fixed-term contract or a contract for a predetermined amount of work • • any payment made instead of giving an employee notice • • any payment of deferred wages made to an employee when finishing work (such as holiday pay, accrued bonuses and commissions) • • any payment by a company under its articles of association to any of its directors. A severance payment may be a redundancy payment for tax purposes. A lump sum severance payment made to a permanent employee when a specific job or project is finished is a redundancy payment if the position of the employee has been fully terminated, and the position is no longer required by the employer. If the employee stays with the same employer on another job or project, any payment is liable for ACC earners’ levy. If the employee uses an M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL code, you'll also have to deduct student loan repayments from retiring and redundancy payments. Other payments 40 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Termination of employment To treat any payment as a retiring allowance or redundancy payment, the person's employment must have been terminated. If employment is not terminated, the payment is liable for ACC earners’ levy. Employment is not terminated if the employee: • • is still employed by a company that is at least 50% owned by the same shareholders, or under the control of the same persons • • is still employed by the same employer, even if the employer's business has changed • • is still with the same business, even if the ownership of the business has changed • • has remained in substantially the same employment. This means if the employee continues to work under a contract of employment with substantially the same employer. The following 2 types of payment are not retiring allowances or redundancy payments and are liable for ACC earners’ levy. • • Payments for accumulated annual leave, long- service leave and sick leave. These are payments that do not relate to retirement or redundancy. • • Payments made because of a merger, takeover, amalgamation or reconstruction between 2 parties if: - the employee is rehired by any party to the transaction within 6 months of termination of employment, and - the employee's new job is substantially the same kind of employment they had before. Substantially the same kind of employment means doing the same type of work. This is based on such things as similarity of duties, similar conditions of employment and a similar job description. For example, if you rehire an employee to do most of the old duties but with slightly different salary and leave arrangements, the employment is substantially the same kind. However, if you rehire the employee in a different area that needs new skills, it's not substantially the same. Employee Share Scheme benefits In some situations, you must withhold tax from an employee share scheme (ESS) benefit. In other situations, you can choose whether to withhold tax. Your withholding obligations depend on whether the ESS benefit is provided in shares or in cash. You must file employment information about the value of an ESS benefit provided to an employee, even if you do not withhold tax from the benefit. Cash-settled ESS benefits An ESS benefit is usually provided in shares. However, if the share scheme taxing date is triggered by the cancellation or transfer of shares or share rights and you’ve paid the employee cash instead, then the benefit is a cash-settled ESS benefit. If an ESS benefit is in cash, it is an extra pay, and you must withhold tax. In this situation: • • Use the ‘extra pay’ tax rate that applies • • Deduct ACC and student loan (if they apply) • • KiwiSaver does not apply. Share-settled ESS benefits If an ESS benefit is in shares, you can choose to withhold tax. However, you do not have to withhold. If you choose to withhold tax: • • Use the ‘extra pay’ tax rate that applies • • Deduct student loan (if it applies) • • KiwiSaver and ACC do not apply. If your employee agrees, you can sell some shares to pay any tax owing. If you fund the tax (and student loan repayment, if any) on the ESS benefit, this amount is treated as income to the employee. However, it is not part of the value of the ESS benefit. Treat it like an ordinary extra pay. If you do not withhold tax on a share-settled benefit, then the employee pays the tax through the end-of-year tax process (and provisional tax if it applies). You should let your employee know they’ll have to pay tax on their ESS benefit. Completing employment information What you need to tell us You must file employment information about the value of an ESS benefit you provide to an employee, even if no tax is withheld from the benefit. You need to show the following information: • • The employee’s name and IRD number. • • The value of the ESS benefit in the employee share scheme earnings field. ESS benefits have their own separate field and are not included in the gross earnings field. Other payments 41ird.govt.nz Filing twice a month If your ESS deferral date is between the 1st and 15th of the month, treat the benefit as if the employee received it on the 15th of the month. If it's between the 16th and end of the month, treat the benefit as if the employee received it on the last day of the month. Example Sam's employer provides him with an ESS benefit on 14 July 2023. The 20th day after Sam receives the benefit is 3 August 2023 (that is, between the 1st and 15th of August 2023). Sam’s employer files electronically. Sam’s employer can choose to report information about the ESS benefit either • • within 2 working days of 3 August 2023; or • • within 2 working days of 15 August 2023. Exempt ESS An ‘exempt ESS’ is not an ESS and different tax rules apply. For more information about employee share scheme benefits go to ird.govt.nz/employee-share-schemes. Regular bonuses Regular incentive or production bonuses Add these bonuses to wages for the pay periods they were earned. Use the PAYE tables to work out the amount of PAYE to deduct. Remember, if your employee uses an M SL, ME SL, SB SL, S SL, SH SL, ST SL or SA SL code you must also deduct student loan repayments from the bonus. Use the student loan columns in the PAYE tables. The following notes refer only to PAYE, but the same method applies for employees with student loans. Bonuses for 1 pay period Add the bonus to other wages for the pay period the bonus was earned in. Deduct PAYE from the total earnings. Example Ordinary wages for pay period $ 270 Bonus for same pay period $ 54 Total earnings $ 324 • • The value of the ESS benefit in the earnings not liable for ACC earners’ levy field (if the benefit is provided in shares). • • The total PAYE and any student loan deducted from the benefit. Record the ESS income under the employee’s current tax code. The employment information return no longer has the ESS tax code option. If you fund the tax (and student loan repayment, if it applies), this amount is not part of the value of the ESS benefit. The amount is a separate extra pay and you report it in the gross earnings field. You are not required to provide employment information about an ESS benefit provided to a former employee if the benefit is in shares and you have chosen not to withhold tax. We recommend you let the employee know they will have to include the value of their ESS benefit in their income tax return – IR3 themselves and may have to pay tax on the shares. When you need to tell us When you need to tell us about an ESS benefit depends on the ‘share scheme taxing date’ and the ‘ESS deferral date’. The share scheme taxing date is the date that the value of the ESS benefit is calculated. It is the earlier of the following dates. • • The date the employee beneficially holds the shares and there are no conditions or protections under the scheme that would defer the taxing date. For example, the taxing date will be deferred if: o The employee is required to sell their shares back to the employer (other than for market value) if they leave the company, or o The employee has the benefit of a limited recourse loan. • • The date the shares or share rights are cancelled or transferred to a non-associated person. The ESS deferral date is 20 days after the share scheme taxing date. You can either file the information on a payday basis or twice a month. The ESS deferral date is treated as the payday. Filing on a payday basis If you are filing on a payday basis, file the employment information within 2 working days of the ESS deferral date if filing electronically, or within 10 working days if filing by paper. Other payments 42 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Monthly bonuses - more than 1 pay If you pay a monthly bonus relating to more than 1 pay period: 1. Add up the gross wages paid in the month. 2. Add on the bonus and work out the PAYE (using the monthly tables) on the total. 3. Work out the PAYE on the gross wages (excluding the bonus) for the month and subtract this from the PAYE on the total calculated at step 2 above. This is the PAYE on the bonus. Example Margaret is paid weekly. She is also given a monthly production bonus. 1. Add together the gross wages paid for the month: $222 + $240 + $274 + $264 $1,000.00 2. Add bonus $ 300.00 Total $1,300.00 3. PAYE on $1,300 (monthly tables) $ 157.30 4. Deduct PAYE on $1,000 (M code) $ 121.00 PAYE deducted from the bonus is $ 36.30 Use the same method if a bonus is paid fortnightly or 4-weekly. Use the fortnightly or 4-weekly PAYE deduction tables to work out how much PAYE to deduct. Add the PAYE on the bonus to the PAYE on the wages for the period the bonus was actually paid. Bonuses covering more than 1 month For a bonus covering more than 1 month: 1. Divide the bonus by the number of months it covers. This gives you the monthly bonus amount. 2. Add the monthly bonus to the normal pay for the month and use the monthly PAYE tables to calculate the PAYE. 3. Calculate the PAYE on the normal monthly pay and subtract this amount from the PAYE calculated at step 2. This gives you the PAYE on the monthly bonus. 4 Multiply this by the number of months the bonus covers to get the total PAYE to be deducted from the bonus Example Patrick gets a monthly salary of $1,120. He's paid a 3-monthly incentive bonus of $720. Bonus $720 ÷ 3 $ 240.00 Plus normal monthly pay $1,120.00 Total monthly amount $1,360.00 PAYE on $1,360 x 19.1% $ 168.76 Less PAYE on normal pay $ 135.50 Difference $ 33.26 PAYE on bonus $33.26 x 3 $ 99.78 (amount to deduct from bonus) Include the bonus PAYE with the wages PAYE for the period the bonus was actually paid. Bonuses for a broken period If a bonus covers a broken period, such as when an employee leaves, treat the bonus as being for the whole of the pay period. Add the bonus to wages in that pay period. Holiday pay Include holiday pay and statutory holiday pays as earnings in the period you pay them. PAYE for holiday pay can be calculated either as standard salary or wages, or as an extra pay. To calculate tax on your employee’s holiday pay, decide whether it should be calculated as an extra pay or not. Holiday pay treated as standard salary or wages If the holiday pay is included in the employee’s regular pay at 8% of the employee’s gross pay or linked to the workdays within the pay period (such as not working but being paid for a public holiday or annual leave) then it’s treated as salary or wages for the pay period. Other payments 43ird.govt.nz Holiday pay treated as an extra pay Holiday pay paid in addition to the regular pay for the pay period is treated as an extra pay. These are payments that are not normally paid in the pay period, such as when accumulated leave is paid out at the end of employment. Holiday pay paid in advance If you pay your employee annual leave in a lump sum before the leave is taken, you can choose to calculate tax as a lump sum either as: • • an extra pay, or • • if the lump sum were paid to the employee in their regular pay cycle over the pay periods their holiday covers (the alternative approach). This calculation also applies to lump sum payments of salary/wages in advance. Calculate PAYE using the alternative approach by: • • apportioning the lump sum payment across the pay periods the payment relates to • • calculating PAYE on each of these apportioned amounts as if they were the only payments made to the employee in each pay period, and • • add PAYE amounts together and deduct the amount from the lump sum payment. A more complex PAYE calculation is needed when the whole pay period is not taken as annual leave and the annual leave was taxed using the alternative approach. This can happen when an employee takes leave for part of a pay period and works as normal for the remainder. PAYE is calculated by: • • adding together the amount of the holiday pay and the regular salary/wages for the pay period, • • calculate PAYE on the total as a single payment, this is the total PAYE payable for the pay period, and • • subtract the PAYE deducted from the amount of the holiday pay apportioned to the pay period from the amount of PAYE calculated in the previous step. This is the amount of PAYE to be deducted from the payment of salary/wages. Example Kim is taking 3 weeks annual leave and asks her employer Dan to pay the holiday pay in a lump sum before the leave is taken. Dan agrees and calculates PAYE using the alternative approach. Kim is paid fortnightly and uses the M tax code. Regular fortnightly pay is $1,492.00, 3 weeks holiday pay is $2,238.00. The holiday pay covers 3 weeks across 2 fortnightly pay periods. Kim is back at work in the last week of the 2nd fortnight. Dan apportions the holiday pay across Kim’s pay periods and calculates the PAYE using the alternative approach: Holiday pay PAYE 1st fortnight $1,492.00 $242.97 2nd fortnight $ 746.00 $100.49 Totals $2,238.00 $343.46 Dan calculates the PAYE he needs to deduct for the week Kim worked in the 2nd fortnight: Amount PAYE 1 week's holiday pay $ 746.00 1 week's normal pay $ 746.00 Totals $ 1,492.00 $ 242.97 Less PAYE deducted on week 3 of holiday pay $ 100.49 Total PAYE for the week Kim worked $ 142.48 Dan deducts $142.48 from Kim’s pay for the week she worked after her annual leave. If your employee is a member of KiwiSaver or has a student loan, these will be calculated on the whole lump sum, even if you choose to calculate PAYE using the alternative approach. Note Refer to ird.govt.nz/holiday-pay for more information on how to categorise holiday pay. You can use our online PAYE calculator at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators to calculate tax on holiday pay when it is treated as salary or wages. You can also view or print our PAYE tables - IR340 or IR341, go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides If it is taxed as an extra pay, see page 37. Other payments 44 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Before calculating your employees' holiday pay, please check your obligations under the Holidays Act 2003. Loss of earnings compensation paid by ACC Loss of earnings compensation paid by ACC to your employees is liable for PAYE. ACC will deduct PAYE using the employee's tax code. Similarly, if an injury occurs at work and you pay an employee for the period up until the time compensation is payable, you must deduct PAYE using the employee's tax code. If you subsidise an employee receiving compensation, deduct PAYE on the extra payment you make using the secondary tax rates. If you pay the employee salary or wages and ACC then reimburses you, deduct PAYE using the employee's tax code. Honoraria Sometimes payments are made for a service where the usual custom is that a price is not set. These payments are called honoraria. Generally honoraria are made to volunteers and are schedular payments, subject to a standard tax, or a rate chosen by the volunteer. The standard rate is listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. However, if honoraria are paid to employees, they should be treated as wages and taxed using the PAYE tables. Where both honoraria and reimbursement expenses are paid to a person for volunteer activities, and provided records are kept showing how much of the payment relates to each, the reimbursement expenses will be tax free. Note Payments to school trustees Part of any honoraria paid to school trustees for attending board meetings is treated as reimbursement of expenditure and not subject to tax as follows: • • for the chairperson, the first $75 per board meeting (up to a maximum of $825 a year) • • for any other board member, the first $55 per board meeting (up to a maximum of $605 a year). However, if the chairperson or a board member receives more than the amounts above, the exemption is reduced by the amount of the additional reimbursement. Example If a board member received $70, made up of a payment of $50 and reimbursement for travel expenses of $20, the first $55 is reduced by the amount of the reimbursement for travel. Amount exempt for board members $55 Less reimbursement for travel expenses $20 Exempt amount $35 Payment received $50 Less exempt amount $35 Balance $15 Tax on schedular payments applies to balance amount of $15. Life insurance and personal accident premiums Policies payable on maturity or surrender Examples of these policies are endowment or whole-of-life policies. If you pay the whole premium of the policy and all the proceeds of the policy will go to the employee, the premiums you pay are treated as salary or wages. Include the gross premium with wages for the period in which the premium was paid to the insurance company. If the proceeds of the policy are payable to the employer, the premiums are not taxable to the employee. Do not deduct PAYE or record payment information on your employment information return. Other payments 45ird.govt.nz Policies payable on accident or death only Several accident, temporary or term life insurance policies are available on the market, and these can have different tax implications. See the following table if you pay the premiums for personal sickness, accident or life insurance on behalf of the employees or for your employees who are the beneficiaries of the policy. Policy TypeTaken out byPremium liable for Life insuranceEmployerFBT EmployeePAYE and is treated as normal salary and wages Personal sickness or accident EmployerFBT EmployeePAYE and is treated as normal salary and wages Group insurance policy (either life or accident/ medical) EmployerFBT Prize money paid at sporting events and competitions If winning prize money forms part of a participant’s taxable activity, you must deduct withholding tax from prize money at any sporting event or competition, not just professional events. The prize money threshold is $500. For any amount won over this threshold, you must deduct tax of 20%. This applies to each separate participant, for each separate event the participant enters at the competition or sporting event. Example 1 A doubles team in a tennis tournament win their division. First prize is $900. The prize money is shared equally - $450 each. Although the total prize money exceeds $500, the amount per person is under the $500 threshold so the payer does not have to deduct tax. Example 2 One of the tennis players from the doubles team also wins the singles title in her division. First prize is $700. The prize money is over the $500 threshold so tax must be deducted, but only from the portion that exceeds the threshold. The total amount of tax to be deducted is $200 × 20 cents = $40. The player has won total prize money of $1,150. However, the threshold applies to each separate participant for each separate event. You'll need to get a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form from the recipient of the prize money. They'll use a WT tax code. If they do not give you an IR330C or it is not completed, deduct tax at the non-notified rate - see page 7. Include the gross amount and the tax on your employment information return and show WT tax code for the prize recipient. If winning prize money does not form part of a participant’s taxable activity (for example if they are competing as an amateur) then no withholding tax is required to be deducted from the prize money. Penalties 46 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Part 4 - Penalties As an employer you're responsible for making various deductions, such as PAYE, KiwiSaver, ESCT (employers' superannuation contribution tax), student loans and child support, from your employees' gross wages. It's a serious matter if any employer does not properly deduct or pay employees' PAYE or other deductions. You face penalties if you do not meet your responsibilities. If you believe you'll be unable to file or pay by the due date, contact us as soon as possible. By contacting us before the due date, you may be able to reduce penalties that will be charged. The information on pages 47 to 50 applies to all these employer deductions: • • PAYE (including ACC earners' levy) • • child support • • student loan • • KiwiSaver deductions • • KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions • • ESCT. For more help For more information about penalties, see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. Late filing penalty By law you must file your tax returns on time. If you do not file your employment information returns by the due date, you may have to pay a late filing penalty. The first time you are late with your filing we will give you a warning. If you are late again in the next twelve months we will charge a late filing penalty. A late filing penalty of $250 will then be charged for each month your employment information return is not filed by the due date. We'll send a statement advising you of the late filing penalty and the due date for paying it. Late payment penalties and interest are also charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. Interest These rules apply when you either overpay or underpay the amount due. If you overpay the amount due, we'll generally pay you interest from the day after the original due date (within certain rules). If you underpay the amount due, we'll charge interest on the unpaid amount from the day after the original due date. We do not charge interest on • • unpaid amounts less than $100. • • any overdue KiwiSaver employer contributions. The interest rates are set by government and are based on market rates. You can check the current rates at ird.govt.nz Late payment penalties A payment is late if it's posted or delivered to us after the due date. See page 21 for information about due dates. Penalties are not charged on unpaid amounts less than $100. We'll charge you interest if you do not make your tax payment by the due date. We'll also charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us, we may contact you before we do this. Otherwise, we'll charge an initial 1% late payment penalty on the day after the due date. We'll charge a further 4% penalty if there is still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) 7 days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date, a further 1% incremental penalty may be charged. Penalty notice If a payment is late, and the penalty is not paid, we'll send a separate notice showing the penalty charged. If the due date for a payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, you can make your payment on the next working day without penalty. Note Penalties 47ird.govt.nz Non-electronic filing penalty If you do not file online when you should, we may charge you a non-electronic filing penalty. The penalty is the greater of: • • $250, or • • $1 for each person employed at any time during the month. For example, if there are 500 employees listed on the employment information return each month, the penalty will be $500 each month. The penalty is due 30 days after the end of the month the return was due. You'll only be charged 1 non- electronic filing penalty for a month. Shortfall penalties Shortfall penalties apply to certain offences, including failing to deduct PAYE or failing to pay PAYE to Inland Revenue. We charge shortfall penalties on top of any normal tax. The shortfall penalty is a percentage of the tax shortfall (deficit or understatement of tax), resulting from certain actions by the employer. There are 5 types of penalties: • • not taking reasonable care 20% • • unacceptable tax position 20% • • gross carelessness 40% • • abusive tax position 100% • • evasion 150%. The rate of shortfall penalty may be reduced for previous good behaviour. In addition to these penalties, you could be fined and/or imprisoned for up to 5 years. Disputing shortfall penalties You may dispute a shortfall penalty if you feel it is wrongly imposed. See page 49 for further information about disputes. Non-payment of employer deductions penalty If you file your employment information returns but do not pay the amount calculated by the due date, we'll send you a reminder letter. If you do not pay the overdue amount or enter an instalment arrangement, we'll charge you a non-payment penalty (NPP) as well as the late payment penalties and interest. The non-payment penalty is 10% of the amount outstanding. Every month you do not pay in full or enter an instalment arrangement, a further 10% penalty will be added. If you pay in full or enter an instalment arrangement within that month, the non-payment penalty will be at a reduced rate of 5% of the unpaid tax. NPPs are not charged on outstanding amounts of less than $100 or if you make payments under an instalment arrangement. The total amount of NPP will not exceed 150% of the returned amount that is unpaid when the first penalty was imposed. For more information, see our guide Penalties and interest - IR240 or go to our website ird.govt.nz/ employers Failing to make deductions Example Tom's payment for 30 June period is due on 20 July. Tom files his employment information every payday but does not make the payment. A month later, Tom receives a reminder letter asking him to make full payment or enter an instalment arrangement within one month to avoid becoming liable to pay non-payment penalties. If Tom takes no action, after 1 month he will be liable for a non-payment penalty. The amount of the penalty is 10%, unless full payment is received, or an instalment arrangement entered, within the following month, then the penalty is reduced to 5%. Employers must deduct PAYE, KiwiSaver deductions, ESCT, student loan repayments or child support when required, from any payments made to employees. Failure to do this is a serious offence and can result in penalties and fines being imposed. Anyone who knowingly fails to make deductions can be fined up to $25,000 for a first offence and $50,000 for subsequent offences. Shortfall penalties may also be charged. If you cannot make the student loan, child support, KiwiSaver and/or PAYE deductions, contact us straightaway. You must still file your employment information returns and make your payments by the due dates. Note Penalties 48 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Failing to pay deductions You must pay deductions to us by each due date. The money deducted does not, at any stage, belong to you. Under no circumstances should the deductions be used for any other purpose other than payment to us. We'll help employers who try to meet their responsibilities but will take legal action against those who do not comply with the tax laws. Failing to pay deductions to us is a serious offence and can result in prosecution. An employer who is convicted may be: • • fined up to $50,000 and/or • • sent to prison for up to 5 years. The name of anyone convicted will also appear in the New Zealand Gazette. The imprisonment penalty does not apply to ESCT offences. Note Evasion You can be fined up to $50,000 and/or be imprisoned for up to 5 years if you’re convicted of knowingly attempting to evade your responsibilities. It's also illegal for you to aid or assist another person to commit an offence. Additional student loan penalties You must give us details about your employees who have student loans, such as IRD number, name and amounts deducted. Failing to provide the correct information is an offence and you may be prosecuted. If convicted, you can be fined up to $25,000 for the first offence and $50,000 for subsequent offences. Shortfall penalties may also be charged. Additional child support penalties Employee privacy The law requires you to protect your employees' privacy by not giving out any information about their child support responsibilities. There are only 2 exceptions when: 1. Inland Revenue Child Support asks you for information. 2. You must give the information as part of running your business, for example, when you have to show your records to our investigators. If convicted of violating this law, you can be fined up to $15,000. Prejudice It's an offence to discriminate against an employee or potential employee because of student loan and/ or child support responsibilities. You may not: • • refuse to employ the person, or refuse to pay wages • • dismiss or threaten to dismiss the employee • • stop or threaten to stop paying wages • • show or threaten prejudice against the employee • • intimidate, coerce, penalise, or discipline the employee because of student loan and/or child support responsibilities. If convicted of prejudice, you may be ordered to pay compensation to the employee and act to remedy or reduce the loss suffered. You may be fined up to $2,000 if convicted of prejudice in relation to student loan responsibilities. Employees start and finish information penalties You must provide us with your employees' start and finish dates. Failing to provide the correct details is a serious offence and you may be prosecuted and penalised. Penalties 49ird.govt.nz Audit procedures You can expect to be audited by us from time to time. This will involve checking your PAYE records against the returns filed to make sure they are correctly completed. Remember, you must keep all financial records of your taxable activity for 7 years. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional 3 years when auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. Voluntary disclosure If there's any omission or error in your PAYE affairs, you should tell us about it. We may still charge shortfall penalties but, if you tell us before we notify you of an audit or investigation, we may reduce these by up to 100%. For more help If you'd like to know more about this process, read our guide Putting your tax returns right - IR280. If you disagree We make every effort to apply the tax laws fairly and correctly, but sometimes you may disagree with how we've assessed your tax. In most cases we can correct the assessment before you need to make a formal complaint. If we cannot agree, there is a formal process to follow, so your rights are protected in case the matter goes to court. For more information, read our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Special types of workers 50 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Part 5 - Special types of workers This part explains what you need to do for the following types of workers: • • casual agricultural workers • • commission agents • • directors • • drovers and musterers • • election-day-workers • • fishers • • foreign fishing workers • • IR 56 taxpayers • • jockeys and trotting drivers • • musicians, dance bands and orchestras • • non-residents • • partners in a partnership • • piece-workers and outworkers • • recognised seasonal workers • • screen production industry workers • • shareholder-employees in close companies • • shearers, shearing shed hands and shearing contractors • • spouses or partner • • subsidised workers • • workers engaged in "activity in the community" projects • • workers under labour-only contracts in the building industry. • • working owners of a look-through company. For the tax rates, see the current PAYE tables - IR340 or IR341. Casual agricultural workers Casual agricultural workers are employees who do casual seasonal agricultural work on a day-to-day basis, for up to 3 months. They use the CAE tax code on their Tax code declaration - IR330. These workers are taxed through the PAYE system at a flat rate of 19.1% (includes ACC earner’s levy). Agricultural contractors are independent contractors, not employees, and have tax deducted on schedular payments. Note Commission agents For agents receiving commission only, tax the gross commission as a schedular payment - see page 10 Some agents get a salary or other fixed remuneration plus commission from the same employer. If an agent is an employee, add the gross commission to the fixed remuneration for the period it was paid in. Calculate PAYE using the current PAYE tables. Whether you deduct PAYE or deduct tax from schedular payments depends on if the agent is an employee or is self- employed. For more information on employment status, see page 5 -Who is an employee? Directors Fees paid to directors are generally schedular payments. Tax the fees paid using the standard rate shown on the back of the IR330C, or the rate chosen by the director, provided it’s not less than the applicable minimum. Some directors who are shareholder-employees of the company may pay provisional tax. Drovers and musterers For employees doing occasional droving and mustering work, calculate PAYE using the current PAYE tables. If they supply their own dogs, horses or saddlery and receive allowances, deduct the allowances paid. Reimbursements for assets costing less than $500 are exempted. Deduct tax from the gross payments made to a droving contractor using the standard rate shown on the back of the IR330C, or the rate chosen by the drover, provided it's not less than the applicable minimum Election-day workers Election-day workers are employed on a casual basis immediately before, on, or after polling day. Election-day workers use tax code EDW and have PAYE taxed at a flat rate 19.1% (includes ACC earners' levy). Special types of workers 51ird.govt.nz If you’re an IR56 taxpayer, you must complete and send in your employment information return within 10 working days of the end of the month and make payments on the 20th of the month following the pay period. For more information see our guide IR56 taxpayer's handbook - IR356. Jockeys and trotting drivers You must deduct PAYE from wages and any riding or driving fees paid to apprentice jockeys or probationary drivers. Use the standard rate shown on the back of the IR330C, or the rate chosen by the jockey or trotting driver, provided it's not less than the applicable minimum. See page 10 of this guide for more information on schedular payments. Musicians, dance bands and orchestras If bands or other entertainers are actual employees, you must deduct PAYE from payments made to them. Each performer in a band must fill in an IR330. Musicians hired on a casual basis are usually paid schedular payments. Every performer in a group must fill in an IR330C using a WT tax code. In the case of larger bands where the leader is in business and files income tax returns for that business, a Certificate of exemption - IR331 may be used - see page 11 of this guide for more information. The leader must make deductions of PAYE or tax (as the case may be) from payments made to musicians involved in the band. If the band is registered with us as a partnership, show the IRD number of the partnership on the IR330C (use the WT tax code). Door charges Where a band member collecting door charges is accompanied by an employee of a licensed premises, and the employee performs the licensing responsibilities of the licensee or manager (for example, allows or restricts entry), do not deduct tax from the door charges. Where the band member is not accompanied by an employee, tax must be deducted from the door charges made. Fishers Fishers may be employees or self-employed contractors depending on the terms of their contracts. If you're unsure whether a fisher is an employee or self-employed, read page 5 of this guide. For fisher employees, deduct PAYE from their wages using the current PAYE tables. Payments to fishers who are not employees are taxed as schedular payments. Use the standard rate shown on the back of the IR330C, or the rate chosen by the fisher, provided it's not less than the applicable minimum. Foreign fishing workers Foreign crew working on a fishing vessel are non- residents for New Zealand tax purposes, but they must pay New Zealand tax on their New Zealand income (income paid to them while fishing in New Zealand waters). If they hold a work visa as foreign crew of a vessel fishing New Zealand waters, they use the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) on their IR330 and are taxed through the PAYE system at a flat rate of 12.1% (includes ACC earners' levy). Use the NSW tax code for any foreign fishing workers on your employment information return. You may be required to make deductions for child support. Student loan repayments are not deducted and as non-residents, they are not be eligible to join KiwiSaver. IR56 taxpayers An IR56 taxpayer is a worker whose employer is not required to deduct PAYE from their earnings. They are responsible for paying their own PAYE. You cannot be an IR56 taxpayer if you are self- employed. Examples of IR56 taxpayers are: • • part-time private domestic workers, such as home helpers, attendant caregivers, nannies, gardeners and domestic odd-jobbers • • embassy staff • • New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies • • United States Antarctic program personnel. Special types of workers 52 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Non-residents Generally, someone who comes to New Zealand, stays less than 183 days in any 12-month period, and who does not have an ‘enduring relationship’ with New Zealand, is taxed as a non-resident. A non-resident is liable for New Zealand tax on income for personal services performed in New Zealand, and other income from New Zealand sources. For more help If you want more information about tax residency, see our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. Non-resident employees Employers must deduct PAYE from wages paid to non-resident employees in the same way as for resident employees (see page 5 of this guide for a definition of an employee). However, a non- resident may be entitled to an exemption from New Zealand tax, either under a double tax agreement, or under the 92-day rule. In general, the 92-day rule applies if all the following criteria are met: • • the visit is less than 92 days • • the person's income is being taxed in another country • • the employer is also a non-resident. If you need more information about the 92-day rule, call us on 0800 377 772. It may not be clear if a non-resident qualifies for the exemption straight away. So, any PAYE deducted before exemption is established may have to be refunded later. Also, if a foreign tax administration requires tax payments, you may have to make double deductions. If it turns out the employee is not entitled to an exemption, you'll have to pay the PAYE on past wages paid. We'll tell you when the payment is due. If the person is employed over more than 1 income year, you must apportion the PAYE to the years the income was earned. Non-resident contractors Payments to non-resident contractors must have tax deducted, unless they hold a valid certificate of exemption or are present in New Zealand for 92 days or less in any 12-month period. This means you will not be required to deduct any tax. However, the non-resident contractor must have come from a country New Zealand has a double tax agreement with, and the activity or service carried out is exempt under the double taxation agreement. Payments for contract work amounting to $15,000 or less in a 12-month period will be exempt from non-resident tax. The non-resident contractors themselves will be responsible for paying any New Zealand tax owing at the end of the year. Specified contract activities or services are: • • work carried on in New Zealand for construction, installation, assembly and similar projects, or consultancy, advisory and other professional or technical services for these projects • • the hire of personnel or equipment to be used in New Zealand. 60-day grace period for late payments of tax If the contractor was expected to have an exemption or the exemption has been breached, all payments are liable for tax to be deducted. You may have a 60-day grace period to rectify the breach and pay the tax due without penalties being applied. For more information, refer to ird.govt.nz/apply-for-exemption-nr-contractor Backdated non-resident contractor exemptions For applications received after 1 April 2024, an exemption can be backdated for up to 92 days before the date of the application for exemption. This means that if the exemption is issued after the date of the first contract payment, the exemption can cover payments made before its issue date. Applications before 1 April 2024 cannot be backdated. Before 1 April 2024 a non-resident contractors' tax (NRCT) exemption was valid for future payments only (from the date the exemption was issued). Special types of workers 53ird.govt.nz Nominated taxpayer A non-resident contractor can enter in an arrangement with a nominated taxpayer. This allows the good compliance history of the nominated New Zealand entity to be used for the purpose of obtaining an exemption for the non- resident contractor. The non-resident contractor needs to provide authority for the resident nominated taxpayer to act in that capacity. The resident nominated taxpayer then needs to advise in writing they are taking over the agreed non-resident contractors’ obligations. The nominated taxpayer will be responsible for filing for all parties included in the agreement. All parties will be jointly and severally liable for the tax payable. For more help If you have any questions about how to treat non-resident contractors, contact the Non-resident Contractors Team on nr.contractors@ird.govt.nz or call us on +64 4 890 3056. Non-resident entertainers Deduct tax from payments to non-resident entertainers, except from payments for a performance: • • that is part of a New Zealand or foreign government sponsored cultural programme, or • • that forms part of a programme of an overseas non-profit organisation, or • • in relation to a game or sport, where the participants are the official representatives of the organisation that administers the game or sport in an overseas country. If you have any questions about non-resident entertainers, call Inland Revenue Large Enterprises, Auckland, on 09 984 4329. For more help If you have any questions about taxing non- residents and visitors to New Zealand, other than non-resident contractors and non-resident entertainers, contact the: Non-resident Centre Inland Revenue Private Bag 1932 Dunedin 9054 Phone 03 951 2020 Partners in a partnership A partnership (except an investment partnership) may make payments to a working partner for services personally performed. These payments are treated as salary or wages if all the following apply: • • the partner is employed under a binding written contract of service, signed by all the partners • • the contract states the amount payable to the working partner for the services • • the working partner personally and actively performs the services for the partnership. These services may be of any kind needed for the partnership's business. The payments are treated as salary and wages for the period between the date the contract became binding and the date the contract is terminated. The partnership must deduct PAYE and pay it to us. Piece-workers and outworkers If the payment is for piece-work or is based on output, and is solely for personal services, deduct PAYE as usual. If you do not pay salary or wages regularly, average the taxable earnings over the number of weeks in the working period. Treat any odd days as an extra week. Calculate the PAYE for each week separately and add up the PAYE to arrive at the total amount to deduct. Payments to a labour-only contractor in the building industry are liable for tax. To work out whether a worker is an employee or a contractor, see page 5 of this guide. Special types of workers 54 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE Recognised seasonal workers You must be a registered employer for the Recognised seasonal employer (RSE) scheme to employ recognised seasonal workers. Recognised seasonal workers are generally employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries. They're non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. However, they must pay tax on their New Zealand income. Recognised seasonal workers use the tax code NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) on their IR330 and are taxed at a flat rate of 12.1% (includes ACC earners’ levy). Use the NSW tax code for any recognised seasonal workers on your employment information returns. You may also have to make deductions for child support payments. Recognised seasonal workers do not have student loan deductions and they are not eligible to join KiwiSaver. The RSE scheme is administered by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. To find out more information go to www.employment.govt.nz Television and screen production industry workers Television and screen production industry workers are generally resident contractors working behind the camera in television, video and film in the screen production industry. Resident contractors must have tax deducted at the standard rate shown on the back of the IR330C, unless they choose their own rate provided it is not less than the applicable minimum. If they do not provide a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C or have not provided their name and IRD number on the form, use the non-notified rate of 45%. Any contractors who wants to use a lower rate of deduction than the applicable minimum can apply to us for a special tax rate certificate or a certificate of exemption. Taxing daily allowances Daily allowances paid to resident and non-resident contractors and entertainers working in the screen production industry in New Zealand, are included in their gross income for PAYE. However, if you pay a contractor or entertainer a daily allowance for services provided to a screen production, where they are working away from their town of normal residence, $60 each day is considered as expenses, and you do not need to deduct tax from this amount. If the daily allowance is more than $60, deduct tax from the portion over $60. Example You pay a contractor a $45 daily allowance as they're required to work away from their town of normal residence. You do not have to deduct tax because the total payment is less than $60. However, if the contractor or entertainer is also provided with goods or services for the allowance paid, either by the payer or another party acting on the payer's behalf, the amount regarded as expenses reduces on a pro-rata basis. This is because the contractor receiving the allowance has not incurred the expense. Example You pay a contractor a $60 daily allowance. The contractor is also provided with all meals while working, either on the set or at another location. The contractor has not incurred the expense so you must deduct tax from the allowance. Shareholder-employees in close companies Deduct PAYE from: • • regular salaries paid to shareholder-employees for pay periods of 1 month or less • • other payments made to shareholder-employees we consider to be liable for PAYE. Do not deduct PAYE from irregular salary payments made to a shareholder-employee. You include all shareholder-employee salaries where PAYE has not been deducted in the IR4 company tax return. Special types of workers 55ird.govt.nz Shearers, shearing shed hands and shearing contractors Shearers and shearing shed hands have PAYE deducted at a flat rate and use the tax code CAE. Combined farming and shearing If a shearer does ordinary farm work because shearing is impossible, include any wages for this work with shearing wages. If you employ someone for normal farm work and they also do shearing work at shearers' rates of pay, treat the shearing wages as part of the normal pay for the pay period. Calculate the PAYE using the current PAYE tables. Do not use the special rate for shearers and shearing shed hands. If a farmer does part-time shearing for another farmer, an IR330 declaration should be completed, and PAYE deducted using the CAE tax code Shearing contractors There are several different situations for shearing contractors and shearing gangs working for you: • • The contractors pay their own shearers and shows you a current Certificate of exemption - IR331 - see page 11. • • You do not deduct tax - pay the full contract price to the contractor. • • The contractors pay their own shearers but they do not show you a current IR331. • • You must get an IR330C from the contractor (WT tax code). The contractor may also have a special tax rate certificate - see page 8. If you do not get an IR330C, or the IR330C is not fully completed, deduct tax at the non-notified rate. The contractor must deduct PAYE from wages paid to employees. • • You pay the wages of the contractor's employees. Treat them as if you were employing them directly: - Get a completed IR330 from each employee. If an IR330 is not given to you or is not completed in full, deduct PAYE at the non- notified rate. - Deduct PAYE for shearers and shed hands using the CAE tax code. - If the contractor has a current Certificate of exemption - IR331, pay the contractor the contract price less the wages you've paid to the employees. - If the contractor does not have a current Certificate of exemption - IR331, you must get an IR330C from them and deduct tax from the contract payment. If they have a special tax rate certificate, you can deduct tax at the rate shown but you must still obtain an IR330C. • • Farmers who employ open-shed shearers or shed hands must: - Get a fully completed IR330 from each employee. If the IR330 is not completed, deduct PAYE at the non-notified rate. - Deduct PAYE for shearers and shed hands at the current rates using the CAE tax code. Contractors who pay shearers If you're a contractor and employ shearers and shed hands , you must deduct PAYE from any payments you make. Allowances Travelling allowances and hand-piece allowances are non-taxable. All other types of allowances, including the value of free meals and board, are taxable. Add the value of these allowances to wages. Show any tax-free allowances paid in your wage book. Spouses or partners The term spouse or partner means a husband or wife, or a civil union or de facto partner you're living with. It does not include a person you have separated from. If you employ your spouse or partner in your business (unless your business is a company) you must get approval from us to be able to claim a deduction of the wages paid for income tax purposes. Approval must be applied for and given before a deduction for wages paid to your spouse may be claimed. Approval cannot be given if you have already claimed this deduction in your return. We give approval if: • • the payment is solely for services given while carrying on the business, and • • the payment is not excessive. The rates must be the same as those you would pay to an unrelated employee for doing similar work. Special types of workers 56 EMPLOYER’S GUIDE When you apply to us, include the following details: • • The type of business your spouse or partner is employed in. • • Full details of the work done by them. • • The average number of hours they will work each week, and the number of weeks worked during the year. • • Details of any other workers you employ, and the total amount paid as wages, not including the wages paid to your spouse or partner. • • How payment of wages is made, such as cash at regular intervals, periodically, or crediting to an account. • • The amount of wages paid to your spouse or partner. You should apply for approval before you start paying your spouse or partner wages. You need to make another application if you increase the wages because of: • • an increase in the duties performed by your spouse or partner, or • • an increase in pay that is not a general wage increase. Subsidised workers If you employ someone who has been unemployed for a certain time, Work and Income may subsidise their wages. Deduct PAYE from the employee's wages using the current PAYE tables. Tax deductions should be made from the gross wage, not the gross wage less the subsidy. You must keep a record of the grants or subsidies received and how you've used them. There are GST obligations for these grants.If you're registered for GST, the wages subsidy received will be GST-inclusive and the GST component will need to be returned in your GST return. You cannot claim GST on wages paid out. Workers engaged in ‘activity in the community’ projects Under current benefit laws, people may choose to participate in a recognised community activity. The sponsor is the organisation that provides the recognised community activity. As an employer, you may be a sponsor. Participants of ‘activity in the community’ projects still receive income support. Those who choose to participate in a recognised community activity receive an allowance in addition to their income support. The sponsor is responsible for paying this allowance and can claim it back from Work and Income every 4 weeks. The sponsor is not an employer of any community work participants - they are acting as an agent of Work and Income in paying the allowance to the participant. This means the allowance is not subject to GST or income tax in the hands of the sponsor. You're not required to make any deductions from this allowance. Workers under labour-only contracts in the building industry Payments made under labour-only contracts for the following activities in the building industry are liable for tax: • • erecting, extending, protecting, decorating, repairing or renewing buildings, other constructions, prefabricated or precut buildings • • carpenters under a building contract (excluding employees - their earnings are liable for PAYE) • • laying concrete, bricks, blocks, tiles, slabs or stones of any description • • fixing roofs or fences • • hanging wallpaper, other decorative wall- coverings or furnishings • • painting, decorating and plastering • • installing any fibrous plaster, wallboard, insulating material, interior tiles, carpets, linoleum or other floor coverings. Special types of workers 57ird.govt.nz Working owners of a look- through company A look-through company may make payments to a working owner for services personally performed. These payments are treated as salary or wages if employed under a contract of employment. A contract of employment is an agreement that: • • sets out the terms and conditions of the services to be carried out by the working owner • • sets out the amount payable to the working owner for the services • • is in writing. Payments under certain labour hire arrangements This type of schedular payment activity applies when labour hire businesses supply workers to perform work directly for their clients. You must deduct tax from payments you make where: • • 1 of your main activities is the business of arranging for a person to perform work or services for your client(s), and • • you make a payment for work, or services provided directly for your client, or the client of another person. Payments described above by a labour hire business to a company are also subject to tax on schedular payments.

Self-employed or an employee? How to work out your tax status Introduction It is important to know if you’re employed or self-employed, because the tax and Accident Compensation laws treat the two groups differently. This leaflet will help you decide if you’re employed or self-employed. It also explains the tax differences between the two. There is no single test for deciding between them. You can decide whether you’re employed or self-employed by looking at the work you do and the way you do it. The decision can’t be made just because you or your employer call your job “employment” or “self-employment”. A contract with a person who pays you might describe you as an “independent contractor”, or as “self-employed”, or similar. This doesn’t mean you will automatically be self- employed. The working conditions set out in the contract (or agreed verbally) will determine your status, not the way you’re described. Guidelines Most of the time, deciding whether you’re employed or self-employed will be easy. For example, if you’re working for a company on a factory production line, doing a job set by your boss, you’re employed. If you’re in business for yourself, such as running your own dairy, you are self-employed. If you have several jobs, you’ll need to apply the guidelines to each job. Being employed or self-employed in one job does not automatically mean the same will apply to your other job(s). Consider the main conditions of each job that controls the way you work. Self-employment guidelines If you answer “yes” to most of these questions, it usually means you are self-employed. • • Do you decide or control how you do the work? For example: – when you take holidays – when, where and what hours you work – the standard or quality of work – how much you get paid and how. • • Do you invest or risk your own money in the activity in any way? For example: – Could you sell the business? – Do you support the business with your own money? For example, lending money, or providing working capital. (Excluding shares obtained from any employee share purchase plan). – Are you responsible for losses or your own mismanagement? – Are you responsible for management and investment decisions for the business? • • Do you provide the major assets or working equipment needed for your job, (not just small tools, work clothing and/or vehicle to get to and from work)? • • Do you provide or pay for your own training? • • Are you responsible for getting the work done? – Can you get other people to work with or for you, without needing to get permission from anyone else? – Do you pay these people from your own funds? – Are you free to do work for other people? – Do you advertise on your own account? – Do you arrange for someone else to do the job if you can’t (for example, if you’re sick)? – Does your work contract say you’ll be penalised if you stopped work, or left without completing a project? – Do you have to correct unsatisfactory work in your own time and at your own expense? Employee guidelines If you can answer “yes” to most of the following questions, you’re probably an employee. • • Do you have to do the work yourself, rather than hiring someone else to do it for you? • • Can someone tell you at any time what to do on the job, or when and how to do it? • • Are you paid at a set rate (for example, hourly, weekly, monthly, or per unit of production)? • • Can you get overtime pay or penal rates? (Please note that even if you’re paid by commission or on a piecework basis you may still be an employee, especially if there are other people at your job who work on the same basis.) • • Do you work set hours, or a given number of hours a week or month? • • Does someone else set the standards for the amount and quality of your sales or output? • • Do you work at the premises of the person you’re working for, or somewhere that person decides? • • Are other people who do the same sort of job as you treated as employees? • • Are you under an employment contract (either individual or collective), or any law that says how your relationship with your “employer” should be run? • • Are you prevented from doing work for anyone else? • • Do you have to follow the rules or procedures of the person you’re working for? If you answered yes to most or all these questions, but PAYE is not being deducted from your pay, you’ll need to contact us. We will help you sort things out with your employer, so your income is taxed correctly. Note The questions listed above are only guidelines, and your job might not fit completely into either set. If you’re still unsure, phone us on 0800 227 774. Casual, short-term, temporary or part-time work If you have one or more part-time jobs, or work for several different people, you need to go through the questions for each of your jobs. Being self-employed in one job does not automatically mean you will be self-employed in your other jobs. You can be employed and self-employed at the same time. For example, you could be employed as a part-time shop assistant and spend the rest of your time running a business from home. If you work part-time or for a short period, you may have more freedom to choose your hours of work. But unless you can answer “yes” to the self-employed questions, you will normally still be an employee. Tax for self-employed people If you’re self-employed, you’re responsible for your own tax. This means that you must: – tell us, if you haven’t already done so, that you’re in business. – complete an Individual tax return - IR3 each year, showing all your income and expenses, and complete your return. – budget to make regular payments of provisional tax and end-of-year income tax. To assist with this the person paying you might agree to deduct tax from the payments they make to you. – register for goods and services tax (GST) if your turnover was over $60,000 in the last 12 months or will be over $60,000 in the next 12-months. If you meet the tests for being self-employed, tax may still have to be deducted from schedular payments you receive. On the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C is a list of the occupations that are subject to tax, and the standard rate that will be deducted from each dollar you earn if you don’t choose your own rate. If the type of work you do is listed there, you can claim work-related expenses against your income from that job. You’ll find more information about tax for self-employed people in our Smart business - IR320 guide. Get a copy on our website at ird.govt.nz or order a copy by phoning INFOexpress on 0800 257 773. Tax for employees If you’re an employee, your employer will normally be responsible for deducting PAYE from your wages or salary and paying it to Inland Revenue. At the end of the tax year, if we are satisfied we have all your income details we’ll send you an income tax assessment showing: • • your income earned for the year, • • PAYE deductions, and • • if you have had the right amount of tax deducted. Otherwise we will send you the details we hold and ask you to add anything we have missed. To find out more got to ird.govt.nz/income-tax-assessments Inland Revenue audits Our auditors routinely go over the tax records of individuals and businesses. If a person has others working for them, we will check whether the workers are employees or self-employed. This may involve interviews with both the employer and the workers. We may want to discuss your job with you, to work out whether you’re self-employed or an employee, and who is responsible for your tax. Overall, we look at who has control over what, how and when work is done. If the answer is the employer then the worker is almost certainly an employee. Our auditors use tests based on the guidelines set out in this leaflet. For more information If you’re still not sure whether you’re employed or self-employed, please phone us on 0800 227 774. If you do not agree with our decision you can dispute it, but only when you receive an assessment based on the decision.

Twice monthly filers need to file Employment Information (EI) forms for the pay dates: • • the 15th of the month showing an employee line item for each pay from 1st to 15th of that month (for example if you paid an employee/contractor weekly on the 2nd and 9th of the month then you would record two separate lines for each weekly pay this employee/contractor received); and • • the last day of the month showing an employee line item for each pay from 16th to the last day of that month (for example if you paid an employee/contractor weekly on the 16th and 30th of the month then you would record two separate lines for each weekly pay this employee/contractor received). Paper filers need to send us completed EI forms within 10 working days of the pay date, otherwise a late filing penalty of $250 may be charged. The IR348 is page 1 of the EI form and includes the income and deductions fields for all employees/ contractors and the declaration. The IR349 is page 2 onwards of the EI form. You don’t need to send us nil EI forms if you haven’t paid any wages during a pay period, and you also don’t include non-taxable allowances on your EI. Paying online – when making payments electronically, select the “EMP” tax type. This means you can make a single payment for all your employer deductions and KiwiSaver contributions. Payday filing is mandatory from 1 April 2019 New employee and KiwiSaver details (IR346K) form You must complete one of these for any new employee(s) who start working for you and send it to us either: • • before their first pay day; or • • with the Employment Information (IR348) form that includes their first pay. Details you need to provide on this form include KiwiSaver status, tax code, address details, and date of birth (if you hold this). The picture below shows the section of the form that requests the details mentioned above. The New employee details forms can be downloaded from our website. Go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides.
