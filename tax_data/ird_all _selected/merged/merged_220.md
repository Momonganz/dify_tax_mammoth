Electronic article surveillance systems Draft general depreciation determination In TIB Volume Nine, No. 1 (January 1997), we published General Depreciation Determination DEP21 for Tags (Security). At the time we also advised that we intended to undertake further investigation into the depreciation rate for security systems. As part of that review, the Commissioner now proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will create a new asset class for Electronic Article Surveillance Systems under the “Shops” Industry category. A draft of that determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate of 33% D.V. is based on an estimated useful life of 5 years and a residual value of 13.5%. Exposure draft – General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1997. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemp- tion ITR8”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1997 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1996 exemption. Disclosure is required for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these inter- ests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign com- pany 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8 (3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF inter- ests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” on page 3). Foreign company interests A person who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 1997 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form IR 4G “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Schedule”. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. •to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United King- dom and the United States of America). •the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15 (1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy •an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15 (2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15 (2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC •an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Nor- way, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme •a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person’s 1997 tax return. See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) for more information. •interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquir- ing the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year •an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or considera- tion readily convertible to New Zealand currency •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s “Foreign Investment Funds” booklet (IR 275B). A person who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1997 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet” (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G form to disclose: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Summary The 1997 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclo- sure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. (Text of disclosure appears on page 4) 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR8” 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1997. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1997, shall not be required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that income interest or control interest in that foreign company and that income year, except where: •the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 10th day of April 1997. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Provisional taxpayers and the new compliance and penalties rules – changes from 1 April We have been asked whether there are any changes to the calculation of provisional tax liability as a result of the introduction of the new Compliance and Penalties regime. There are only two changes: •The underestimation penalty is treated as due on the third instalment date for the purposes of calculating interest only – the penalty itself is due for payment on the terminal tax due date. •The underestimation penalty cannot be increased by an amended assessment. Interest start dates Use of money interest relating to provisional tax instalments remains unchanged by the Compliance and Penalties regime. We have restated these rules below. Section 120K sets out the interest start dates for provi- sional taxpayers: Residual income tax exceeding $30,000 •tax is treated as due and payable equally on all three instalment dates •interest is calculated from each instalment date. Residual income tax exceeding $30,000 – new provisional taxpayer •instalment date liability linked to first day of business •interest is calculated from appropriate instalment date Residual income tax $30,000 or less •Interest starts from the third instalment date for these taxpayers: –any taxpayer who is not a natural person –any taxpayer who has estimated –any taxpayer who holds a valid Certificate of Exemption –any taxpayer who has income in their capacity as trustee –any taxpayer who is incorrectly assumed to be a provisional taxpayer. •Interest starts from terminal tax due date on balances over $100, for anyone who meets all of these condi- tions: –He or she is a natural person. –He or she uses the standard option. –He or she pays all instalments in full on or before due date. New interest end dates With the new interest provisions for periods starting on or after 1 April 1997, it is important to remember that the interest stop date is no longer the terminal tax due date. Interest will only stop calculating when the period balance is $100 or less or the tax is paid in full, which- ever is the earlier. Standard option (safe harbour) This option remains available to all taxpayers except: •those whose residual income tax exceeds, or is expected to exceed, $300,000 •those who make an estimate of their provisional tax. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Interest/bank charges deductibility – loan from shareholder to company Section DD 1 (b) (previously section 106(1)(h), Income Tax Act 1976) – Certain deductions not permitted – rents, interest, and premises: A company share- holder plans to take out a mortgage on her own property and on-lend the pro- ceeds to the company. Under the arrangement, the company will pay her the same rate of interest as she has incurred, and also meet all her borrowing ex- penses. She has asked if she can deduct the following costs for income tax pur- poses: •bank interest on the mortgage •bank and legal charges for arranging the mortgage Section DD 1 (b) does not allow a deduction for interest except where the interest is payable in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year, or it is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year. In this case, the loan from the bank is in the shareholder’s name. A second, or back-to-back, loan has been arranged, and the money has been on-lent to the company under a separate loan agreement. Under the arrangement, the com- pany will pay the interest to the shareholder, who in turn will pay the bank. The interest paid to the shareholder by the company will be income to the share- holder, and the interest paid by the shareholder to the bank will be a deductible expense. The company is also able to claim a deduction for the interest payments made to the shareholder. The company may also be required to deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) from the interest payments made to the shareholder. For the Commissioner’s policy on RWT and back-to-back loans, see TIB Volume Six, No. 11 (April 1995). Regarding the bank and legal expenses, section DJ 11 (previously section 136, Income Tax Act 1976) permits a deduction to a shareholder for costs incurred in borrowing money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the production of assessable income. The company is also allowed a deduction for any costs passed on to it, such as the costs of arranging the back-to-back loan. Whether losses can be partially offset in one year, and balance carried forward to next year Section IE 1 (3) (previously section 188(3), Income Tax Act 1976) – Carry-for- ward and set-off of losses: A taxpayer incurred a $17,000 loss in the 1994-95 income year. She has asked if $11,000 can be offset against her 1995-96 assessable income of $35,000, and the balance offset in the 1996-97 income year. Under section IE 1 (3), any loss incurred in one income year may be carried forward to the next income year, to be deducted or set-off against the assessable 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) income of the same taxpayer, if any, in that next income year so far as that assessable income extends. Only if the loss cannot be fully deducted or set-off in an income year can it be carried forward to the following income year or years. The whole $17,000 must be offset against the taxpayer’s 1995-96 assessable in- come of $35,000, leaving no balance to carry forward to the 1996-97 income year. Childcare/housekeeper rebate when attending university full-time Section KC 4 (previously section 54, Income Tax Act 1976) – Rebate in certain cases for housekeeper: A wage and salary earner whose husband is intending to return to full-time university study has asked if they are able to claim the childcare/housekeeper rebate, as their three-year old child will be attending a childcare centre on a regular basis. Under section KC 4 (1), taxpayers who pay a “housekeeper” during any income year are allowed a rebate of income tax, for that income year, of 33 cents in the dollar of those payments. The maximum rebate a family can claim is $310. A “housekeeper” is defined in section KC 4 (2) as: (a)Where the taxpayer is a widow, a widower, a divorced person, an unmarried person, or a separated person, – (i)A person who, or an institution which, has the care and control, either in the home of the taxpayer or elsewhere, of any child; or (ii)A person who tends the home of the taxpayer, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the services of the person are necessary by reason of any mental or physical infirmity or disability of the taxpayer; or (b)Where the taxpayer is a married person (other than a separated person), – (i)A person who, or institution which, has the care and control, either in the home of the taxpayer or elsewhere, of any child; or (ii)A person who tends the home of the taxpayer, - where, in either case, the Commissioner is satisfied that the services of the person or the institution are necessary by reason of any mental or physical infirmity or disability of the taxpayer or his or her spouse; or (c)Where the taxpayer is a married person (other than a separated person), a person who, or institution which, has the care and control, either in the home of the taxpayer or elsewhere, of any child, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the services of the person or the institution are necessary by reason of the employment or business activities of both the taxpayer and his or her spouse. In this case, neither partner is suffering from any mental or physical infirmity or disability, and so, in order to qualify for the rebate, both partners must either be in employment or be self-employed. As attending university does not meet these criteria, the couple have been advised they are not able to claim the rebate. Imputation credits affected by change in shareholder continuity Section ME 5 (previously section 394E, Income Tax Act 1976) – Debits arising to imputation credit account: A company has undergone a change in shareholding that has necessitated the cancelling of an amount of credits in its imputation credit account (ICA). The company’s accountant has asked if the company’s non-standard balance date of 30 June is a factor to be taken into account when considering the amount of the cancelling debit. The loss of continuity provisions were introduced to ensure that imputation credits could not be retained by a company that had undergone a substantial change of shareholding during the imputation year. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Section OB 1 defines an imputation year as: ... the period of 12 months commencing on 1 April in any year and ending with the following 31 March: This is regardless of any approved non-standard balance date that the company may have for other tax purposes. From 1 April 1992, the continuity of shareholding to be maintained before a deemed debit arises in the imputation credit account, is 66%. This is measured on the basis of the shareholders’ percentage of ownership in the company by determining the aggregate of the voting interests (or market value interests where a market value circumstance exists) held by the shareholders. For each credit, shareholder continuity is measured from the time the credit arises to the time continuity is breached. When the 66% continuity in respect of a credit no longer exists, that credit will be extinguished by a debit to that account which arises on the date that the breach in continuity occurs . The accountant was advised that the company’s imputation credit account would be debited on the day the 66% continuity of shareholding ceased. The company’s late balance date is not significant, as imputation runs from 1 April to 31 March. Non-cash dividend and imputation credits Section ME 6 (previously section 394F, Income Tax Act 1976) – Company may attach imputation credit to dividend: A shareholder in a company, who is not a shareholder-employee, has received additional shares in the company in lieu of a cash dividend. She is aware that under section CF 2 (previously section 4, In- come Tax Act 1976) the distribution of these shares is a non-cash dividend, and has asked if a non-cash dividend is able to carry imputation credits. Section ME 6 states: An imputation credit account company may, on payment of a dividend by the company, attach an imputation credit to that dividend. Since 1 April 1992, a dividend for imputation purposes includes a non-cash dividend. Since that date non-cash dividends are assessable to shareholders who are not also employees of the company. This means that imputation credits may be attached to the non-cash dividend. A non-cash dividend is defined in section OB 1. The definition includes a divi- dend within the meaning of section CF 2 (1) which includes a taxable bonus issue. The shareholder was advised that imputation credits may be attached to the non- cash dividend. Company partially owned by non-resident – can it be a “qualifying company”? Section OB 3 (1) (previously section 393B(1), Income Tax Act 1976) - Meaning of “qualifying company”: A company has two shareholders who are individu- als: one is a New Zealand resident, the other is a non-resident. Both own 50% voting rights. One of the shareholders has asked if the company can become a qualifying company in view of the part-overseas ownership. She is also inter- ested in knowing how Inland Revenue would pursue any outstanding tax liabil- ity of a qualifying company from a non-resident shareholder. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Section OB 3 (1) defines a “qualifying company”. Under the definition, a com- pany is not precluded from being a qualifying company simply because one of its shareholders is a non-resident. As long as the company qualifies under the criteria set out in section OB 3 (1), it can become a qualifying company. Under section HG 8 (previously section 393H, Income Tax Act 1976), the shareholders are personally liable for income tax assessed to the qualifying company in pro- portion to their effective interest in the company. Any tax owed by the non-resident shareholder would be pursued in the same manner as any other tax owed by a non-resident. If the non-resident refused to pay the tax owing, Inland Revenue would look to locate any assets held in New Zealand, and at the obligations of any agent for the taxpayer in New Zealand. In this case, if no other assets were held in New Zealand, Inland Revenue would look to obtain the outstanding tax from the company by means of an order under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (previously section 400, Income Tax Act 1976). If Inland Revenue were unable to obtain payment of the outstanding debt, the company could no longer be a qualifying company. Tax Administration Act 1994 Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees Section 126 (previously section 30, Income Tax Act 1976): A company’s tax return was furnished which showed all its profit distributed as salaries to its shareholder- employees. The company’s accountant has now realised that some legitimate deductions have been omitted from the accounts and disputed the assessment notice issued by Inland Revenue. The accountant has asked that the additional expenses be allowed and the salaries reduced. Inland Revenue will agree to an adjustment for the unclaimed expenses, but not for an adjustment to the salaries. When a company has resolved to pay an amount of salary, and a journal entry to that effect has been made, the salary is considered to have been paid. It is not possible to later change the amount of salary that has been paid. The dispute relating to the expenses has, therefore, been settled, but the dispute concerned with the amount of the salaries would continue to be subject to the disputes resolution process. When an adjustment has been agreed and the dispute resolved, a reassessment to allow an additional claim for expenses means that the company now has a loss for the year. Subject to continuity of shareholding requirements, that loss will be carried forward and will be available to be offset against taxable income in future years. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Late GST refunds – interest of less than $5 payable? Section 46(5A) - Interest less than $5 not payable: A GST registered person filed a GST return that resulted in a refund. The refund was not issued within 15 working days and Inland Revenue had not advised that there would be a delay. When the refund was issued, the taxpayer calculated that interest of $4.90 should have been paid by Inland Revenue, but it was not. The taxpayer has asked why interest was not paid. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Section 46(1) requires that GST refunds must be paid not later than 15 working days after the relevant return was received by Inland Revenue. If that 15 day timeframe is not met, section 46(5) requires Inland Revenue to pay interest. Interest is calculated on a daily basis at a specified rate of interest. Section 46(6) provides the method by which the amount of interest is calculated. However, under section 46(5A), interest is not payable by Inland Revenue for a late GST refund when the amount of that interest is less than $5. Therefore, in this case, interest was not payable, despite the refund being paid late. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Judicial review – assessments under old section 276 Case:BNZ Finance Ltd v CIR and Nash Decision:10 April 1997 Keywords:Judicial review, “liable to be assessed”. Summary:BNZ Finance Ltd appealed to the Court of Appeal from a decision of Justice Fisher in the High Court that the CIR was able to assess BNZ Finance for tax payable by a defunct “old company” under the old section 276 of the Income Tax Act 1976 because, at the time the old company was wound up, it was liable to be assessed for tax. The majority decision in the Court of Appeal disallowed the appeal. Facts:BNZ Finance Deposits Ltd (“Deposits”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of BNZ Finance. It was assessed for 1989-1992 (inclusive) but, in its returns, had omitted dividend and interest income received from an investment in redeemable prefer- ence shares and debentures. Deposits was wound up in 1994 under section 335A of the Companies Act 1955. The Commissioner had confirmed prior to wind up that Inland Revenue did not object to the dissolution of Deposits. Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 would have precluded the Commissioner from increas- ing the 1989 and 1990 assessments after 31 March 1995 and 31 March 1996 re- spectively, and for the latter two years, after 31 March 1997. On 31 March 1995 the Commissioner purported to issue amended assessments for the 1989 and 1990 income years in respect of the amounts alleged to have arisen from the investments. These assessments were nullities as Deposits had already been wound up. Mr Nash, by letter of 21 July 1995, then advised BNZ Finance that Inland Revenue intended to assess BNZ Finance for $26,457,520.00 in respect of Deposits’ dividend and interest income for the 1989 and 1992 years, and to include the whole sum in the BNZ Finance’s assessment for the 1995 year once the return for that year had been filed. Judicial review proceedings followed. Justice Fisher, in the High Court, held that the words “liable to be assessed for tax” in section 276 covered the situation where an assessment had been made but was subject to amendment within the 4 year time limit imposed by section 25. He held that section 276 was a charging section, not merely a recovery one, and that subject to section 25 BNZ Finance could be assessed for the investment income earned by deposits in the 1989 to 1992 years. He noted that Richardson P had already held in the Court of Appeal that the assessments of 31 March 1995 and 21 July 1995 did not amount to assess- ments or amended assessments of the 1989 and 1990 years and that under sec- tion 25 the Commissioner was out of time to issues amended assessments to BNZ Finance in respect of those years. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Justice Fisher also found that the Commissioner was not estopped from relying on section 276 by having had no objection to Deposits being wound up under section 335A of the Companies Act 1955. Decision:The Court of Appeal (by a 3 to 2 majority) held that Justice Fisher was correct in his findings. McKay J found that the words “liable to be assessed” were added to the old section 276 to ensure that the section applied not only where the original company is liable for some quantified amount of tax as when an assessment had been issued, but also where it is liable for tax which has not yet been quantified by an assessment. He agreed that the section was a charging one (not a recovery one) evidenced by the use of phrases like “...shall be deemed to be the agent...and...shall be liable for all tax payable”. McKay J held that liability for tax is not contingent on an assessment. It is an absolute liability imposed by statute. It may not be finally ascertained as to amount until assessed, but the liability is not subject to any contingency. The assessment is merely part of the process of quantifying the amount of pre-exist- ing liability, considering objections and recovering payment. There is nothing in section 276 (3) which suggests that the words “liable to be assessed” should be restricted to a liability that was already assessed or otherwise identified and quantified. BNZ Finance was liable to be assessed for tax on any taxable income derived by Deposits, under section 276. Justice McKay agreed that the notice under section 335A of the Companies Act 1955, which the Commissioner gave prior to Deposits being wound up, is not a statement that he is satisfied there is no outstanding tax liability. Therefore there is no basis for an estoppel by representation or a statutory estoppel. The Commissioner cross-appealed Fisher J’s finding that it was beyond the Commissioner’s power to make assessments in respect of the years ended 31 March 1989 and 31 March 1990 as the 4 year period had expired. The Com- missioner argued that it was sufficient that he had validly quantified the tax in question prior to the expiry of the period by his assessments of Deposits on 31 March 1995. Justice McKay held that the applicable time bar for BNZ Finance carried over to the time bar period for Deposits. Both the appeal and the cross-appeal were dismissed and the respondents were granted $10,000 costs. Input tax credits – “supply by way of sale” Case:Union Corporate Services Ltd v CIR Decision:21 March 1997 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 20 (3). Keywords:Input tax, “supply by way of sale”, secondhand goods Summary:The High Court held that the appellant (“Union”) was entitled to an input tax credit under section 20 (3)(a)(ia) because the sale of the vessel between itself and its subsidiary, “C Limited”, had occurred in New Zealand. It was therefore the sale of a secondhand good. Facts:In 1989 the Objector (“Union”) purchased a ship from the Isle of Man. Union wanted to use the vessel for Gulf War shipping charters. For the ship to remain on the Isle of Man Shipping Registry (which was necessary for chartering) it had to be owned by a company incorporated in the Isle of Man. Union therefore from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) incorporated “C Limited”. Union was the beneficial owner of the shares in C Limited, and had total control over the use of the vessel. The Gulf War charters did not eventuate and the ship was chartered back to New Zealand. It was sold by C Limited to Union and Union sought to claim an input tax credit for the purchase of the vessel. The TRA held that C Limited held the ship as bare trustee for Union and there- fore Union actually purchased the ship outside New Zealand from a non-regis- tered supplier. The TRA held that Union was not entitled to a secondhand goods input tax credit for the purchase of the vessel as there had been no “supply by way of sale” to Union by C Limited of “secondhand goods situated in New Zealand”. This is because Union had beneficial ownership. Decision:Justice Baragwanath held that the original acquisition of the vessel by C Limited was both beneficial and legal. The sale of the vessel by C Limited to Union was at a time the vessel was in New Zealand. Accordingly there was a supply, by way of sale, of secondhand goods in New Zealand and Union was entitled to claim an input tax credit under section 20 (3)(a)(ia) of the GST Act 1985. It was found, on further evidence adduced by Union at the hearing, that under the Isle of Man’s legislative provisions, it was, at all material times, unlawful to secure registration of a ship in the name of any party other than its beneficial owner and that a declaration had been signed which cited C Limited as the beneficial owner. Justice Baragwanath further held there was no resulting trust between C Limited and Union as had been held by the TRA. He distinguished the cases relied on by the Commissioner . Body corporate charging GST output tax Case:Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR Decision:21 March 1997 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 6 Keywords:Body corporate, output tax, taxable activity Summary:This is an appeal by the Objector of a decision from the TRA. The High Court held that the Objector, a body corporate, is a separate entity from the proprietors of the land it provides services for. The High Court held that the Objector merely collects contributions from its members and passes them on. The actions of the Objector did not amount to a supply for consideration so as to amount to a taxable activity under section 6 (1)(a) of the GST Act 1985. It was not, therefore, required to charge output tax on administration and maintenance levies. Facts:The Objector is a body corporate which operates a timeshare resort consisting of 28 units. The 28 units are owned by 850 proprietors. Each unit has been divided into 51 weeks (for availability to use purposes). These weeks were marketed by a company and sold to individual proprietors. Each unit is separate and is clearly defined in an individual certificate of title issued in respect of each week pur- chased by an owner. The proprietor is able to mortgage, sell or deal with the unit title like any other estate in land. The Objector collects annual levies payable by the proprietors and credits the money collected to its own account. It then meets all outgoings on the property. The Objector is invoiced for such outgoings, not the proprietors. The Objector undertakes every form of administration to ensure the resort is properly main- tained and managed for the benefit of the proprietors. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Decision:The High Court agreed with the TRA that the Objector has an identity separate from the proprietors who constitute it. It has powers and liabilities which the proprietors do not individually possess and it is subject to at least one restriction to which they are not individually subject i.e., the prohibition on trading. The High Court held that whether the relevant activities undertaken by the Objector comprise a taxable activity under section 6 depends on whether the activities of the Objector are carried out for a consideration. The Court ruled that the Objector, in the circumstance of the case, did not receive consideration for the services it passed on to the proprietors. The Objector does not receive or obtain anything for its own benefit in respect of the services it performs. It merely collects the money from its members and passes it on to any creditors. Therefore, the actions of the Objector, although amounting to the supply of goods or services from one person to another, were not supplies for considera- tion so as to amount to a taxable activity in terms of section 6 (1)(a) of the GST Act 1985. Club manager – whether employee or independent contractor Case:TRA No 96/74 Decision:3 April 1997 Keywords:employee, independent contractor Summary:The TRA held that the Objector was liable for PAYE for work carried out by a manager. The manager was not in business on his own account; he was an employee of the Objector and the Objector was liable to account for PAYE ac- cordingly. Facts:The Objector was a rugby club, which had taken on “M” as a manager. There was an unsigned employment contract prepared by the Objector’s solicitors to cover the hiring of a manager by the Objector. The contract was for an “employee” in the position of “Club manager” and referred to the Objector as “the employer”. The contract provided for a base retainer of $19,220.00. This contract was not handed to M at any time. An Inland Revenue investigator found entries in the Objector’s cashbook under the name of M starting in November 1993 for $369.92 weekly by “AP” encoded to “Wages Club Man”. The “AP” was taken to mean automatic payment into a bank account. $369.92 per week for 52 weeks amounted to $19,220.24 for the year, which was very close to the base salary in the unsigned employment contract. The Objector did not deduct PAYE from the remuneration it paid M over the period 1 October 1993 to 31 August 1994. M did not file personal income tax returns for that period nor pay income tax on that remuneration, so the Objector has been assessed for $5,806.63 as PAYE deductions in respect of M’s remunera- tion over that period. M had served the Objector for nearly two years but only the said 11 month period is the subject of the case. The issue was whether M was hired by the objector as an employee or as an independent contractor. If the former was the case, the Objector was required to account for PAYE. Decision:Barber J agreed that the intentions of the parties were not decisive. He confirmed the lack of a signed contract did not invalidate the principles found in TNT Worldwide (1995) 17 NZTC 7,145. The terms of the unsigned contract were con- sidered neutral, as the manager had not seen the contract. from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Barber J noted that the manager was under the “firm control” of the club but that this need not be considered determinative. Of more importance was the fact the manager was an integral part of the Objector’s operation. His Honour placed some weight on the regular “wages” payments which were made to the man- ager by the Objector. Barber J considered the classic tests of employee/contractor status were probably outmoded. Of the manager’s status, Barber J concluded that in reality, he was not in business on his own account. Rather the manager was part of the ongoing business activity of the Objector. The Objector was therefore liable to the Com- missioner for PAYE. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

A sample is made by taking a piece of the fabric from stock, attaching it to a card, and displaying it in the home delivery van. This is then shown to customers as an example of what is available. The life of the samples varies from 1 month to 2 years, with the average sample lasting between 8 and 12 months. When the fabric goes out of stock and/or becomes unavailable, the sample is of no value and is disposed of. There is currently no general depreciation rate for these samples. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class, “Fabric Samples and Fabric Display Stock” under both the “Shops” and “Textile, Garment and Carpet Manu- facturing” industry codes. The new rate will be 100% D.V. and S.L., and is based on an estimated useful life of 1 year. The draft determination is reproduced below.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 3 Determination: amount of a specified withholding payment (being prize money) which shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in production of payment and as in the Income Tax (Withholding Payment) Regulations 1979. Determination When any non-resident entertainer or entertainer receives prize money, being a specified payment, in relation to a sporting event or competition of any nature, being a specified activity, the sum of $500 shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the payment. However, where the total amount of the prize money is less than $500, the total amount of the prize money shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the payment. This Determination is made by me acting under del- egated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Determination is signed on the 13th day of May 1997. Peter Wallwork National Manager (Businesslink) Examples Example 1 A team of four bowlers compete in a competition and they win the first prize of $1,600. The prize money is shared equally – $400 each. Therefore, the payer does not have to deduct withholding tax. This is because although the total amount of the prize exceeds $500, the amount per person is under the $500 threshold. Example 2 A doubles pairing in a tennis tournament win their division – first prize was $900. The total prize amount exceeds $500, but again the amount per person is under $500. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax. Example 3 One of the tennis players in the above example also wins the singles title in one division – first prize is $700. The prize money is over $500 so withholding tax must be deducted, but only from the portion exceeding the $500 threshold. The total amount of withholding tax to be deducted is $200 x 20 cents = $40. The player has won total prize money of $1,150. However, the determination applies to each separate prize paid to each separate participant for each separate event. Introduction This Determination sets out the amount which is regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of a specified withholding payment when that payment is prize money. Section NC2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires anyone who makes a source deduction payment to deduct tax from the payment when making it. Under section OB 2 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 a withholding payment is included in the definition of source deduction payments. Consequently any person who makes a withholding payment must deduct tax from that payment at the time it is made unless an exemption applies. Prize money paid to participants at sporting events or competitions comes within the definition of ‘specified payment’ in the Income Tax (Withholding Payment) Regulations 1979, so section NC(2) applies to these payments. The regulations require withholding tax of 20% to be deducted from the amount of the prize paid to partici- pants. Regulation 7 of the Income Tax (Withholding Pay- ments) Regulations 1979 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any specified withholding payment which is considered to be expendi- ture incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination the person paying the specified withholding payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount which exceeds this threshold. Application This determination applies to prize money, being a specified payment, paid to participants, (being non- resident entertainers or resident entertainers) at sporting events or competitions. This determination applies to prize money paid on or after 1 June 1997 until such time as the Commissioner varies or revokes this determination. This determination applies to each separate prize paid to each separate participant for each separate event that participant has entered at the sporting event or competi- tion. Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section NC and OC (2)(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 4 Estate and Gift Duties (Termination of Exemption) Order 1997 Recent Order in Council with implications for local authorities Introduction The Estate and Gift Duties (Termination of Exemption) Order 1997 came into force on 8 May 1997. It termi- nates the temporary provision in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 which exempts from gift duty the payment of income earned on the proceeds of port company share sales from local authorities to commu- nity trusts. Background The Local Government Act 1974 provides that local authorities may establish community trusts with the proceeds of the sale of shares in port companies. Payments to the community trusts would have been subject to gift duty. However, section 73(2)(k) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (inserted by the Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1995 - see Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Six, No. 12, page 33) exempts from gift duty any payment from a local authority to its community trust if the payment is funded from one of the following sources: •the proceeds of the sale of port company shares or equity securities •any of the income derived from or capital gain arising on the sale proceeds, if that income or gain is paid to the community trust before a date set by the Gover- nor-General by Order in Council. Key issues The date for the termination of the gift duty exemption for income derived from or capital gain arising on the sale proceeds has now been set at 8 May 1997 by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Therefore any payment made on or after 8 May 1997 by a local authority to a community trust of any income derived from or capital gain arising on the sale proceeds of port company shares will be subject to gift duty. The ability to pass on the original sale proceeds without gift duty will remain.

Interest on money borrowed to pay up uncalled or unpaid capital in a group company – deductibility and meaning of “to acquire shares” Public Ruling – BR Pub 97/4 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section DD 1 (b)(iii). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of interest by one company (“the shareholder company”) included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to pay for shares in another company included in that group of companies, where those shares were issued to the shareholder company at an earlier date, but the shareholder company has not previously provided all the consideration for those shares, i.e. the shares are unpaid or uncalled capital. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The interest payable by the company under the Arrangement is payable in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another company included in that group of companies for the purposes of section DD 1 (b)(iii). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to interest incurred, in respect of an Arrangement to which this Ruling applies, in the period of the 1997, 1998, and 1999 income years. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of April 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 6 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/4 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in PIB 178 (February 1989). To the extent that the Ruling covers issues dealt with in that earlier policy statement, this Ruling supersedes and replaces that earlier policy. Public Ruling BR Pub 97/5 deals with the deductibility of interest on money borrowed to refinance a debt used to acquire shares in a group company. Background A company that is a member of a group of companies is allowed a deduction under section DD 1 (b)(iii) for interest on money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. In some cases a company may be issued with shares in a group company, and may agree to provide all or part of the consideration for those shares to the group company at a later stage – either at a fixed time or when the group company makes a call shares. At that later stage, the shareholder company may borrow money to pay up the previously unpaid or uncalled capital. The shareholder company may seek to claim a deduc- tion under section DD 1 (b)(iii) for the interest payable on the money borrowed to pay up the unpaid or uncalled capital. In this case, the issue is whether the payment of the unpaid or uncalled capital is a payment to “acquire” shares. If it is, the interest on the money borrowed will be interest on money borrowed to acquire shares and will be deductible under section DD 1 (b)(iii). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DD 1 (b)106(1)(h) IG 1191 Under section DD 1 (b), no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer for interest except so far as the Commissioner is satisfied that: (i)It is payable in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income; or (ii)It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income; or (iii)It is payable by one company included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another company included in that group of companies: Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph expenditure deemed to be incurred under the qualifying accruals rules shall be deemed to be interest payable: Provided further that for the purposes of this paragraph any 2 companies shall be treated as being included in a group of companies in respect of any income year only if those companies are members of the same group of companies at the end of that income year: Whether companies are a “group of companies” is determined by section IG 1 (2). Application of the Legislation Section DD 1 (b)(iii) allows a deduction for interest payable on money borrowed to acquire shares in a group company. The issue which the Ruling addresses is whether the payment of uncalled capital is a payment “to acquire shares”. This depends on whether a payment for shares which occurs some time after the shares are obtained by the shareholder can be said to be a payment to “acquire” shares. If money borrowed to pay a call on unpaid capital is borrowed to “acquire” shares, the interest paid on that borrowed money is deductible under section DD 1 (b)(iii). There are no cases on whether money that is borrowed to pay for shares in a group company, where that payment occurs some time after the shares have been issued to the shareholder, is money borrowed to “ac- quire” the shares. However, general observations made by the courts in respect of the word “acquire” indicate that the courts accept that “acquire” has a flexible meaning which can vary depending upon the context in which it is used and the issue that is being addressed (see Beetham v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 575; Mayor of Stratford v The King \[1926\] GLR 151; US v ITT Continental Baking Company (1975) 420 US 223). Companies Act An examination of the provisions of the 1993 and 1955 Companies Acts helps to determine when a shareholder acquires shares for the purposes of those Acts. Under the Companies Act 1993, a person may become a shareholder by way of an issue of shares by the company either on the registration or amalgamation of a company (section 41) or at any other time (section 42). Under section 51 of the Companies Act 1993, a share is issued when the name of the shareholder is entered on the share register. A person could become a shareholder by way of an issue of shares by the company under the Companies Act 1955 by way of subscription to the memorandum or by an allotment of shares by the company. In any event, the name of the shareholder must be entered in the company’s register of members (sections 39 and 118 of the 1955 Act; section 87 of the 1993 Act) and the register is prima facie evidence of legal title to shares (section 126 of the 1955 Act, section 89 of the 1993 Act). However, although a shareholder may have legal title to shares, not all of the consideration for those shares will necessarily have passed to the company. The 1955 and Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 7 acquisitions where that money is borrowed at the time of the initial share issue. This would give rise to injus- tice and absurdity in cases where companies delay making a call on their newly issued shares or agree to deferred payment for the shares. In the case of such delays, shareholders borrowing to meet those calls or make the deferred payment will be penalised if section DD 1 (b)(iii) does not apply to allow a deduction. This does not appear to be the purpose of the legislation. The Privy Council in Mangin v C of IR \[1971\] 1 NZLR 591 held that words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that there is no room for intendment. However, the Privy Council also said that, in the case of an ambiguity, if a literal interpretation results in an injustice or an absurdity, and the language of the section admits an interpretation which avoids such a result, then the alternative interpretation may be adopted. The Court of Appeal took a similar approach to ambi- guities in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439 and said that one should approach the question of statutory interpretation on the premise that the legisla- ture will not have intended absurdity or injustice. The Court said that one should always have regard to the total context of the words used and to the purpose of the legislation in order to arrive at the meaning intended. However, it should be remembered that this does not mean giving the words, “some forced meaning to fit a preconceived idea of purpose”. Taking the approach authorised by Mangin and Alcan, on the basis that: •the phrase “to acquire shares” in section DD 1 (b)(iii) is ambiguous in that it is not clear whether it only refers to the initial obtaining of shares at the time that they are issued to the shareholder, or whether it includes the payment for those shares at a later date; and •a narrow interpretation of the phrase, “to acquire shares”, as meaning only the initial obtaining of shares, would give rise to injustice and absurdity; and •the language of section DD 1 (b)(iii) admits an interpretation which avoids such injustice and absurd- ity arising, being that a deferred payment of the outstanding consideration for shares relates directly to the acquisition of the shares by the shareholder, the Ruling adopts a wider interpretation of the phrase, “to acquire shares” as including a payment for shares which becomes due after those shares are issued by the company to the shareholder, i.e. the paying up of unpaid or uncalled capital. Record-keeping The shareholder company must maintain adequate records of the initial expenditure of the borrowed funds and the subsequent refinancing(s). It may be necessary to retain these records for many years, and longer than the statutory requirement to retain records, in order to establish the purpose of the later refinancings. 1993 Companies Acts clearly envisage that share may be only partly paid (or completely unpaid) at the time it is acquired by the shareholder, with the unpaid balance to be paid at a later date (either at a fixed time or when called up by the company at its discretion). Section 13 of the 1955 Act and section 97(2) of the 1993 Act confirm that a shareholder is liable for any amount unpaid on shares held by the shareholder. Thus, although entry of the shareholder’s name on the share register is prima facie evidence of legal title to shares, the shareholder will be liable for any unsatisfied consideration which exists in respect of the issue of the shares. Even though a shareholder may not be called upon to meet the liability arising for the initial issue of shares until quite some time after that issue, that liability nevertheless relates directly to the “acquisition” of the shares by the shareholder: that is, it is the out- standing consideration for that acquisition. Treating money borrowed to pay for shares issued some time previously as meeting the meaning of the expres- sion “to acquire shares” in section DD 1 (b)(iii) is, therefore, entirely consistent with the provisions of the Companies Acts. It is therefore clearly arguable that any consideration payable for the issue of shares in a company, whether payable by way of an immediate subscription at the time of issue, or deferred, or subject to a call at some later stage, is money payable “to acquire shares” within the meaning of section DD 1 (b)(iii). Consequences of limiting meaning of “acquisition” to time of issue Section DD 1 (b)(iii) was first enacted as section 112(1)(g)(ii) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. At the time of its enactment, inter-company dividends were exempt from tax under section 86C of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. Thus, interest on money bor- rowed to purchase shares in a group company would not have been deductible under the general interest deduct- ibility provision (interest payable on capital employed in the production of assessable income), because there was no nexus between the interest and the production of dividend assessable income. The enactment of section DD 1 (b)(iii) therefore enables a shareholder to claim a deduction for interest on money borrowed to purchase group company shares. A narrow interpretation of the word “acquire” in section DD 1 (b)(iii) is that it only refers to the shareholder’s initial act of obtaining the shares when the shares are issued to the shareholder. When a shareholder pays for the shares at a later stage, this payment relates to discharging the shareholder’s liability in respect of the shares and arguably does not relate to the “acquisition” of the shares because the shareholder has already acquired or obtained the shares. However, the result of such an interpretation is that shareholders would only be allowed a deduction under section DD 1 (b)(iii) for interest payable on money borrowed to fund share continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 8 money to pay the call, and incurs interest on those borrowed funds. Although the loan money in respect of which the interest is payable is not borrowed until 6 months after the shares are subscribed for and issued to Borrower Company, the interest is payable on money used to acquire shares in Issuer Company. As Borrower Company and Issuer Company are members of the same group of companies, Borrower Company can deduct the interest paid under section DD 1 (b)(iii).

Borrower Company and Issuer Company are members of the same group of companies. Borrower Company subscribes for shares in Issuer Company, and is issued 100,000 shares, but Issuer Company makes no call on the shares at that time. Issuer Company makes a call on the 100,000 shares on 1 December 1996.

The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in PIB 178 (February 1989). To the extent that the Ruling covers issues dealt with in that earlier policy statement, this Ruling supersedes and replaces that earlier policy. Public Ruling BR Pub 97/4 deals with the deductibility of interest on money borrowed to pay up uncalled or unpaid capital in a group company. Background A company that is a member of a group of companies is allowed a deduction under section DD 1 (b)(iii) for interest on money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. In some cases a company may borrow money to acquire shares in a group company, and then later refinance by borrowing money to repay the existing debt. The issue is whether the interest on the replacement debt is deduct- ible under section DD 1 (b)(iii) as interest on money borrowed to acquire shares. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DD 1 (b)106(1)(h) IG 1191 Under section DD 1 (b), no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer for interest except so far as the Commissioner is satisfied that: (i)It is payable in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income; or (ii)It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income; or (iii)It is payable by one company included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another company included in that group of companies: Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph expenditure deemed to be incurred under the qualifying accruals rules shall be deemed to be interest payable: Provided further that for the purposes of this paragraph any 2 companies shall be treated as being included in a group of companies in respect of any income year only if those companies are members of the same group of companies at the end of that income year: Whether companies are a “group of companies” is determined by section IG 1 (2). Application of the Legislation Section DD 1 (b)(iii) permits a deduction for interest payable in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in a group company. It is arguable that the words “to acquire shares” only refer to the one-off event of obtaining the shares. If this is the case, an interest deduction will only be allowable for the original bor- rowing of money to purchase shares in the group company, and interest payable for any subsequent refinancing of the original borrowing will not be deductible. Conversely, it is arguable that “to acquire” is capable of bearing a wider meaning, and that it includes all acts which enable the shareholder to obtain shares in the group company. The refinancing of the debt used to purchase the shares is arguably an extension or continu- ation of the original act of borrowing for the purpose of acquiring the shares, and has the same character as that original borrowing. If this is the case, interest on money borrowed to repay and replace a loan that was originally used to acquire shares will also be deductible under section DD 1 (b)(iii), because it is payable on money borrowed in respect of the shareholder continuing the act of acquiring shares in the group company. Section DD 1 (b)(iii) was first enacted as section 112(1)(g)(ii) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. At the time of its enactment, inter-company dividends were exempt from tax under section 86C of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. Thus, interest on money bor- rowed to purchase shares in a group company would not have been deductible under the general interest deduct- ibility provision (interest payable on capital employed in the production of assessable income), because there was no nexus between the interest and the production of dividend assessable income. The enactment of section DD 1 (b)(iii) therefore enabled shareholders to claim a deduction for interest on money borrowed to acquire group company shares. There are no cases on whether an interest deduction is available under section DD 1 (b)(iii) in respect of money borrowed to refinance a loan which was used to acquire shares in a group company. General observations made by the courts in respect of the word “acquire” indicate that the courts accept that “acquire” has a flexible meaning which can vary depending upon the context in which it is used and the issue that is being addressed (see Beetham v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 575; Mayor of Stratford v The King \[1926\] GLR 151; US v ITT Continental Baking Company (1975) 420 US 223). In US v ITT Continental Baking Company (1975) 420 US 223 the Court held, in a 5-4 majority decision, that the word “acquiring”, as used in the case before it, meant not only the initial act of acquisition, but also the retention of the rights obtained. In that case, a Federal Trade Commission order prohib- ited the respondent baking company from, “acquiring ... the whole or any part of the stock, share capital, or assets of any concern, corporate, or non-corporate, engaged in the United States in the production and sale of bread ...”.

The Privy Council in Mangin v C of IR \[1971\] 1 NZLR 591 held that words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that there is no room for intendment. However, the Privy Council also said that where words in a section are ambiguous, and a literal interpretation of those words results in an injustice or an absurdity, if the language of the section admits an interpretation which avoids such a result, then the alternative interpre- tation may be adopted. The Court of Appeal took a similar approach in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439 and said that one should approach the question of statutory interpretation on the premise that the legislature will not have intended absurdity or injustice. The Court said that one should always have regard to the total context of the words used and to the purpose of the legislation, in order to arrive at the meaning intended. However, it should be remembered that this does not mean giving the words, “some forced meaning to fit a preconceived idea of purpose”. As a narrow, literal interpretation of the phrase “to acquire” would lead to an injustice, and an alternative meaning of the words is possible having regard to the total context of the words used and the purpose of the legislation, the alternative meaning (which does not lead to an injustice) may be adopted. This approach lends support to interpreting the words “to acquire” more widely, as extending to include the act of refinanc- ing the original loan that was used to acquire the shares. Records The shareholder company must maintain adequate records of the initial expenditure of the borrowed funds and the subsequent refinancing(s). It may be necessary to retain these records for many years, and longer than the statutory requirement to retain records, in order to establish the purpose of the later refinancings. Example Company A is granted a loan for a five-year period for the purposes of purchasing shares in Company B, a member of the same group of companies. Under section DD 1 (b)(iii), Company A can deduct the interest payable on the loan, because the interest is payable by one company included in a group of companies for money borrowed to acquire shares in another company included in that group of compa- nies. At the end of the five-year loan period, Company A refinances by entering into a new loan. To the extent that the replacement loan is used to repay the earlier loan which was used to actually “acquire the shares”, the interest on the replacement loan is also deductible under section DD 1 (b)(iii). This is because the loan moneys are a replacement for the original loan, and are an extension and continuation of the original act of borrowing money to acquire shares in the group company. The relevant statutes authorised the imposition of a daily $1,000 penalty for a continuing failure or neglect to obey the order. The petitioner alleged that the respondent had acquired assets in three companies in violation of the order, and that the retention of the assets constituted continuing violations of the order. The respondent argued that “acquiring” in the order unambiguously referred only to the initial transaction and that to read it otherwise was to add the words “holding or retaining” to the literal language of the order. The US Supreme Court found for the petitioner on the grounds that it interpreted “acquiring”, as used in the order, to mean both the initial transaction and the maintaining of the assets or rights obtained without resale, and accordingly held that the violation of the order was a continuing violation subject to daily penal- ties. While Continental Baking lends some support to the proposition that the phrase “to acquire” has connota- tions of continuity, that case is not persuasive authority in respect of the interpretation of the words “to acquire” in the context of section DD 1 (b)(iii), not only because decisions of the US Supreme Court do not bind New Zealand Courts but also because: •The surrounding documentation and the context of the word’s use were important factors in the US Supreme Court’s interpretation of the word “acquir- ing”; •The Court was not considering the word “acquiring” in the context of the United States taxation legisla- tion, but rather in the context of its anti-trust legisla- tion, and the specialised meaning of the term in this context; and •It was not a unanimous decision of the Court, and the division between the judges was narrowly split with the dissenting judges unanimous in their decision. Continental Baking should therefore only be seen as an example of an instance where a Court has found that the word “acquiring” can be interpreted widely to include maintaining or retaining assets and rights, and is not the basis for the Commissioner making the Ruling in this instance. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “acquire” as meaning “gain by and for oneself; come into possession of”. This definition arguably does not connote any consequent transactions. However, to interpret the words “to acquire” in the context of section DD 1 (b)(iii) narrowly to mean only the initial act of obtaining shares would result in unfairness, in that shareholder companies which can only obtain short-term financing will be at a disadvan- tage when compared with shareholder companies which can obtain longer term finance. Shareholder companies that can only get short-term finance will not be able to deduct the interest on any subsequent loan(s), thereby increasing their business costs, while shareholder companies that can get longer term financing will be able to claim the interest deduction for a longer period.

Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraph (m) of section CI 1 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a non-monetary benefit by a charitable organisation to an employee of that organisation. In this Ruling, the term “charitable organisation” has the meaning that it has in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. That is, in relation to any quarter or (where FBT is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which, in the quarter or income year, section KC 5 (1) applies. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1 (m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is not received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity of the charitable organisation which involves carrying out any of the organisa- tion’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, even if income is received by the organisation in the course of carrying out that activity. •For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1 (m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity which both: –cannot be characterised as carrying out any of the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes; and –constitutes a profession, a trade, a venture, or an undertaking which is carried on for the purpose of making a profit (even if that profit is to be applied solely for the purposes of the charitable organisation). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to non-monetary benefits provided by charitable organi- sations in the FBT periods which commence after 30 June 1997 and which end before 1 July 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of May 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 12 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR 97/6 (“the Ruling”). Background The charitable organisation exemption from fringe benefit tax does not apply to any benefit that is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee in the course of the employee’s employment in a business activity of the charitable organisation. The issue is whether the FBT exemption applies to benefits provided by charitable organisations which carry on their charitable objects in a business-like manner, and which have a record and expectation of making surpluses of income over expenditure.

The relevant parts of that section, for the purposes of the Ruling, state: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of - (a)The private use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (b)The availability for private use or enjoyment of the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (c)Any loan that is owing, by the employee,... (d)Any subsidised transport: (e)... any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund ... (f)... any specified insurance premium or any contribution to any insurance fund of a friendly society: (g)Any contribution in relation to an employer of an em- ployee, to any superannuation scheme: (h)Any benefit of any other kind whatever,... being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availabil- ity for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; but does not include– ... (m)Any benefit that, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, is provided or granted by or on behalf of an employer, being a charitable organisation, to an employee of the employer: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any such benefit to the extent that the benefit is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, primarily or principally in relation to, and in the course of, or by virtue of, any employment, in relation to the employee, that consists of any activity or activities performed by the employee in the carrying on, by the employer, of a business \[emphasis added\]: “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. “Charitable organisation” is defined for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ... any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which ... section KC 5 (1) applies. Section KC 5 (1) applies to certain named institutions (paragraphs (ae) to (bq)), and, more generally, to: (aa)A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab)A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac)A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad)A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): “Charitable purpose” is defined in section OB 1 as including: ... every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Act does not define “benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes”. Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 13 intention and record of making surpluses is not carried on “for profit”, unless the organisation’s constitution states that one of its purposes is to make a profit. As such organisations are not carried on “for pecuniary profit”, they are not carrying on a “business” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and the FBT exemp- tion. The Commissioner considers that Parliament did not intend the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 to include any charitable organisation which operates in a business-like manner and which intends to make surpluses. Such an interpre- tation would mean that most successful charitable organisations, in carrying on their charitable, benevo- lent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, would be carrying on businesses for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and so would be subject to FBT in respect of benefits they provide to their employees. The proviso to the exemption contained in paragraph (m) would apply to most charitable organisations, making them subject to FBT, and the exemption from FBT contained in para- graph (m) would generally not apply. Only those charitable organisations which could show that they did not operate in a business-like manner or did not intend to make surpluses, either in the short or long term, would not be carrying on a business and would be exempt from FBT. The Commissioner considers that this wide interpretation of the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 is not correct. Instead, the Commissioner considers that the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to business activities which are carried on by charitable organisa- tions but which are not, themselves, charitable, benevo- lent, philanthropic, or cultural activities. Such business activities may be conducted to assist the achievement of charitable purposes, and the income produced by them may be applied to the charitable purpose. However, the business activities that the proviso applies to are not the intrinsically charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural activities of the organisation. A distinction between the charitable (i.e. running and administering a charity, and providing charitable services) and the non-charitable purposes of a charity was drawn in Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council \[1975\] 2 All ER 289. That case concerned section 40 of the United Kingdom General Rate Act 1967 which applied to premises or hereditaments that were occupied by a charity and wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords considered whether Oxfam’s gift shops were on premises wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords found that, although the gift shops were used for purposes that indirectly related to the achievement of the objects of the charity (i.e. selling donated goods to raise money for the charity), the premises were not wholly or mainly used for charita- ble purposes. In reaching this conclusion, the House of Lords drew a line between the use of premises for purposes which are Application of the legislation The charitable organisation exemption from FBT contained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to the extent that the employee does not receive the benefit in the course of the organisation carrying on a business. The Ruling addresses the issue of when a charitable organisation will and will not be carrying on a business for the purposes of the charitable organisa- tion exemption from FBT. “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including “any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit” \[emphasis added\]. The Court of Appeal in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 considered that underlying the Act’s definition of “business”, and the use of the word in the context of a taxation statute, is the fundamental notion of the exercise of an activity in an organised and coherent way that is directed to an end result - the making of pecuni- ary profits. The Court said that the existence of a business activity is determined on the basis of the nature of the activity and whether the taxpayer has the inten- tion of making a pecuniary profit in carrying out that activity. The Court stated, at page 61,691: Statements by the taxpayer as to his intentions are of course relevant but actions will often speak louder than words. Amongst the matters which may properly be considered in that inquiry are the nature of the activity, the period over which it is engaged in, the scale of operations and the volume of transactions, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity, and the financial results. Many charitable organisations engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money and effort to those activities and conduct a large volume of transactions, and so will have these characteristics of a business. The issue is therefore whether a charitable organisation that budgets for, and has a record of making surpluses of income over expenditure has the intention of making a profit. If it is carried on for profit, it will be a “busi- ness” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. English cases have held that the fact that a charity makes a profit does not mean that it is carried on “for profit”. In Trustees of the National Deposit Friendly Society v Skegness UDC \[1958\] 2 All ER 601, the House of Lords found that a charity’s objects are to advance the charitable purposes for which it is estab- lished. If profit-making is not one of their purposes but is only a means of achieving those purposes, the charity is not carried on “for profit”. In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Bell Concord Educational Trust Ltd \[1989\] 2 All ER 217, the Court held that the question of whether or not an organisation is carried on “for profit” must be answered by reference to the objects for which that organisation is established, as contained in its constitution, and not by reference to the budgeting policy of that organisation. Thus, a charitable organisation that carries on its activities in a business-like manner and which has the continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 14 organisation, or directly facilitating the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as fundraising or adminis- trative or clerical activities) will not be treated as being business activities for the purposes of paragraph (m). However, trading activities which are carried on to raise funds for the charity, and which are not themselves the charitable purposes of the charity, will be treated as business activities of the charitable organisation, if they satisfy the “business” test set out in the Income Tax Act (i.e. if those activities are carried on for the purpose of making a pecuniary profit). Thus, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in carrying out the charitable purposes of the organisation, any benefits provided to them are not provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. The benefits will therefore be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1. However, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in activities of the organisation which are not in themselves charitable, and which constitute business activities of the organisation, any benefits provided to them will be provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. These benefits will not be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m). An employee may be employed by a charitable organisa- tion in a range of activities, some of which relate to the carrying out of the organisation’s charitable purposes or other non-business activities of the organisation, and some of which are non-charitable business activities. Such an employee may receive benefits from the organisation in connection with both the business and non-business types of activities. Section CI 1 (m) exempts benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations from FBT except where the benefit is received principally or primarily in relation to the employee’s employment in a business carried on by the charitable organisation. Thus, a benefit provided to an employee who engages in both the business and non- business activities of a charitable organisation will only be subject to FBT if the employee receives that benefit principally and primarily in relation to the carrying out of the organisation’s business activities. In other cases the benefit will remain exempt from FBT. As a guide, the Commissioner considers that an employee will receive a benefit principally and primarily in relation to his or her employment in a business activity of the organisation where the benefit arises primarily in connection with such a business activity, rather than in connection with a non-business activity, or where the benefit arises equally in connection with both the business and non-business activities carried out by the employee, but the employee is predominantly employed in the business activities of the employer. Note that the Ruling does not apply to employers that are local authorities, public authorities, or universities. These organisations are excluded from the definition of “charitable organisation” for the purposes of the FBT rules, so the charitable organisation exemption con- tained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 does not apply the charitable purposes of the charity, and the use of premises for purposes which, though purposes of the charity, are not charitable purposes. Lord Cross said (at page 293): The wording of s 40(1) of the 1967 Act shows that the Legislature did not consider that the mere fact that a hereditament in question is occupied by a charity justifies any relief from rates. That is only justified if the hereditament is being used for the ‘charitable purposes’ of the charity. So the first question which arises is: what are the ‘charitable purposes’ of a charity as distinct from its other purposes? The answer must be, I think, those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity - that is to say in this case the relief of poverty, suffering and distress. Oxfam identifies the fact that a charitable organisation can carry out both charitable and non-charitable activi- ties. However, not all of the “non-charitable” activities carried on by a charitable organisation will constitute business activities. Only benefits provided to employees of a charitable organisation in relation to the carrying on of a business by or on behalf of the organisation will be subject to FBT. The distinction between an organisation carrying out the functions for which the organisation was established and an organisation carrying on a business was exam- ined in Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union v CIR; New Zealand Waterfront Workers Union v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,059 (High Court); CIR v Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union (1996) 17 NZTC 12,523 (Court of Appeal). That case concerned section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 61(23) (which is section CB 4 (1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994) provides an exemption from income tax for the income of a friendly society, except so far as that income is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. In Port Chalmers, the High Court drew a distinction between a friendly society carrying on a business as a trading organisation and a friendly society discharging its functions as a friendly society. It said that where the friendly society is discharging its functions as a friendly society it is not carrying on a business even though it may conduct transactions that have a commercial flavour. This distinction was accepted by the Court of Appeal. The Ruling interprets paragraph (m) of section CI 1 as drawing a similar distinction as that drawn in Port Chalmers between the activities of a charitable organi- sation which discharge the purposes for which the organisation was established (i.e. the discharging of its charitable, benevolent, or philanthropic objects) and the charitable organisation carrying on a business as a trading organisation. A charitable organisation is not carrying on a business for the purposes of paragraph (m) when it discharges its charitable objects, even though it may discharge those purposes in a business-like manner. The effect of the Ruling is that the activities involved in carrying out the charitable objects of a charitable from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 15 applied wholly or principally for charitable pur- poses (the advancement of education) within New Zealand. The trust charges tuition fees and has had surpluses of income over expenditure for the 1994, 1995, and 1996 income years. The trust provides a car to its school principal for work and private use. The trust is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car which it provides to the principal. This is because the benefit is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee who is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable objects. The employee is not employed in a separate business activity carried on by the school. Example 2 A company conducts a farming business on land adjacent to the school. All of the shares in the company are held for the benefit of the school charitable trust referred to in Example 1, and the company’s constitution provides that the assets and profits of the farming business must be applied exclusively to the promotion of the objects of the school charitable trust. The company provides a car to its farm manager for his work and personal use. The company is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the car to the farm manager because the farm manager receives the benefit in relation to his employment in a business (the farm) carried on by the company. Example 3 The same facts exist as in Example 2, except in this case the farming operation is carried out by the company, in a business-like manner, for the purpose of the practical component of the school’s agricul- tural courses. In this case the farming operation relates to the carrying on of the educational charita- ble objects of the school, and the availability of the car for private use by the farm manager is not subject to FBT. Example 4 A polytechnic charitable organisation offers a course on working in the hospitality industry. As part of that course the polytechnic operates a restaurant where the students gain experience in preparing food and waiting on tables. The restau- rant is open to the public and patrons pay for their meals. The polytechnic provides the supervisor of the hospitality course with a van for restaurant use. The van is also available for the supervisor’s private use. The supervisor is employed in carrying out the to them. Fringe benefits provided by these organisations will be subject to FBT unless some other exemption applies to them. Examples It will be a question of fact in each case whether the particular activities of a charitable organisation are activities which are not the inherently charitable activities which the organisation was established to carry out, and are also activities which constitute a business for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The following activities are examples of activities likely to be characterised as not being business activities of the charitable organisation (and, hence, any benefits provided to employees of the organisation in connection with these activities will be exempt from FBT). Note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of such activities: •Activities which are directly related to carrying out the objects of the charity but which also have an income component. For example: –A school or polytechnic which is established to provide education which charges fees for the provision of the educational services. –An organisation which is established to provide assistance to a disabled or disadvantaged group which provides services to those people for payment (e.g. residential accommodation serv- ices in return for board). –An organisation established to provide relief and assistance to the poor which runs a second hand shop in order to provide affordable goods to that group. •Appeals for funds for the charity’s purposes. •Passive investment and management of the funds of the charity, as long as the charitable organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment. •Administration of the above activities. An activity that is carried on by the charitable organisa- tion which does not involve the organisation carrying out its charitable objects but which involves the sale of goods or services for valuable and adequate considera- tion, on a similar basis to business enterprises carried out by private individuals, and with a view to making a profit, is likely to constitute the organisation carrying on a business. Any benefits provided to employees in connection with such an activity will be subject to FBT under the proviso to paragraph (m). Example 1 A charitable trust has the principal purpose of providing education through a private school. The trust is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules, as it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and its funds are continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 16 Notice of withdrawn product rulings The Commissioner hereby gives notice under section 91FJ(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that Product Rul- ings 97/13 and 97/14 have been withdrawn. The following notices appeared in the New Zealand Gazette of 15 May 1997. Notice of withdrawal of Product Ruling 97/13 1.This is a notice of a withdrawal of a product ruling made under section 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.Product ruling 97/13 is hereby withdrawn. 3.Product ruling 97/13 originally applied to a whole- sale superannuation fund for the period 14 February 1997 to 31 March 1997, and notice of its making appeared in the New Zealand Gazette of 27 Febru- ary 1997. 4.Product ruling 97/13 is withdrawn on and from 15 May 1997.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) The polytechnic employs a person to prepare food for the cafeteria. Once a week, this employee is also employed by the polytechnic to provide instruction in the hospitality course run by the polytechnic. The employee therefore is employed in both the business operations (the cafeteria) and the charitable activi- ties (providing education in the hospitality course) of the polytechnic. The polytechnic pays for the employee’s member- ship to an off-campus fitness centre. This benefit arises because of the employee’s employment with the polytechnic, and does not specifically arise in relation to either her employment in the cafeteria or her employment in the hospitality course. However, because the employee’s employment in the cafeteria takes up 80% of her time, the benefit arises princi- pally and primarily in relation to her employment in a business activity of the polytechnic. The benefit is therefore not exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1 and will be subject to FBT. polytechnic’s charitable purpose of providing education to the students in the hospitality course. Because of this, the van is not provided in relation to the supervisor’s employment in a business carried on by the polytechnic and its availability for private use is not a benefit that is subject to FBT. Example 5 A polytechnic runs a cafeteria which is open to students and the general public. The cafeteria is not operated as part of any polytechnic course. The cafeteria is an activity of the polytechnic which cannot be characterised as carrying out the poly- technic’s charitable purposes of providing educa- tion. Further, it is a commercial trading activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. The cafeteria is therefore a business run by the polytechnic. from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 17 Public Service Investment Society transaction fees Product Ruling – BR Prd 97/36 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CE 1 (1)(a), the definition of “dividends” in section CF 2 (1) and the definitions of “interest” and “investment society dividends” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is that the Public Service Investment Society (“PSIS”) will charge account holders monthly transaction fees, subject to a policy which states that account holders will not be charged transaction fees where they meet certain stated criteria. Assumption This Ruling is based on the assumption that the criteria for not charging transac- tion fees are not dependent on whether the account holder is also a member of the PSIS. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the Assumption above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The benefit of not being charged transaction fees is not gross income of those account holders under section CD 5. •Such benefits are not interest or investment society dividends under section CE 1 (1)(a). •Such benefits are not dividends under section CF 2 (1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies from the commencement of the 1997-98 income year to 31 March 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the ninth day of May 1997.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Land subdivision – taxable activity Case:Rick David Wakelin v CIR Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:meaning, taxable activity Summary:The fact that the venture may have lacked a commercial or business flavour or that it may be a sale of private assets is not sufficient to preclude the application of section 6(1) of the GST Act. A transaction, which involves the sale of private assets, if carried out continuously or regularly, falls within the provision of the section. Facts:In 1985, the Objector decided to subdivide a 2.4 hectare block of land at Parau into six residential sections, including a section on which a dwellinghouse had been erected. The subdivision work was carried out over a period of three years, and between 1989 and 1995 the Objector sold all six lots. Inland Revenue contends that GST was payable on five of those sections, but not on the sale of the proceeds of the dwellinghouse. Decision:The Court held that the Objector was involved in a taxable activity. What the Objector did over a period of nine years was to continuously and regularly subdivide a portion of land and supply it to the market. The activity was unin- terrupted in time or sequence in that it was started with the intention of seeing it through to completion. The fact that it may have gone on in fits and starts does not mean that this was not activity which was carried on continuously. The activity was also carried on regularly in the sense that the Objector was pursuing a course or observing a uniform principle of action or conduct, namely, the subdivision of land and the sale or supply of sections on the open market. Crown payments not subject to GST Case:CIR v New Zealand Refining Company Limited Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Consideration for supply of services Summary:The Court of Appeal held the payments made by the Crown were not part of the value of the supply of services to the oil companies and therefore were not subject to GST. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997) 19 Facts:The taxpayer operated an oil refinery at Marsden Point. Under an Agreement between the Crown, NZRC and the oil companies, the Crown made payments to the Objector totalling $85 million in 1988-90 as part of an assistance package following the deregulation of the oil industry. Inland Revenue assessed GST on the payments on the basis that they were a fee/consideration for the supply of services by the taxpayer for the use of its facilities by the oil companies. Decision:The Court found in favour of the taxpayer and stated that in taxation disputes the Court is concerned with the legal arrangements actually entered into and the rights and duties they create, not with the economic or other consequences of the arrangements. Support for the view that the payments represented a contribution to NZRC’s operating expenses and were no part of the value of the supply of services to the oil companies was given by the terms of the contract or, more specifically, what it did not say. In terms of the Agreement between the parties, there was little or no linkage between the Crown’s payments and the making of particular (or any) supplies of goods and services. A linkage between supply and consideration is requisite for the imposition of the tax. The Court found that although the payments were intended as an inducement to NZRC to keep the refinery open they were not payments for any supply. The payments related to the structure or framework within which supplies of serv- ices were expected to be made. They were payments received in the course of the taxable activity but were not to be regarded as consideration for any supply by NZRC.

We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 1 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry: zero-rating under GST Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of zero-rating in section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) in relation to animal trophies and animal products derived from the tourist, hunting and safari industry. For these purposes, “animal” includes birds and fish. Background Animals are being sold to tourists in New Zealand, who then have them killed for trophies. Hunting guides who sell the animals to the tourists are zero-rating the supplies. They collect and return GST on items of goods and services enjoyed by clients while they are in New Zealand, and claim zero-rating on the trophy fees that directly relate to the items exported. In addition, taxidermists who process the carcasses before they are exported zero-rate the supply of their services. In some instances, the types of products supplied are not only the mounted trophies but also the salted skins and horns that may be supplied unmounted. In all, there are three supplies on which zero-rating is being claimed: •the taxidermy services provided by the taxidermist •the packaging and shipping of the trophy and related animal products •the trophy fee. The GST treatment of each of these supplies is consid- ered in turn. Legislation Section 11(1) states that a supply of goods will be charged with GST at the rate of zero percent if: (a)The supplier has entered the goods for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and those goods have been exported by the supplier; or (aa)The goods have been deemed to be entered for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and the goods have been exported by the supplier; or (ab)The supplier has satisfied the Commissioner that the goods have been exported by the supplier to a place outside New Zealand; or (ac)Subject to subsection (1B) of this section, the supplier will enter the goods for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply and will export the goods; or (ad)Subject to subsection (1B) of this section, the goods will be deemed to be entered for export, pursuant to the Customs Act 1966, and exported by the supplier in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply; or... Section 11(1B) states: In any case where paragraph (ac) or paragraph (ad) of subsection (1) of this section applies, and the goods are not exported by the supplier within - (a)Twenty-eight days of the time of supply; or (b)Such longer period, from the time of supply, as the Commissioner has determined pursuant to subsection (1C) of this section - the goods shall, notwithstanding paragraphs (ac) and (ad) of subsection (1) of this section, but subject to paragraphs (a) and (aa) of subsection (1) of this section and to subsection (1C) of this section, be charged with tax under section 8 of this Act. Section 11(1C) states: In any case where paragraph (ac) or paragraph (ad) of subsection (1) of this section applies and the Commissioner has determined, upon application by the supplier in writing, that - (a)Circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and recipient have prevented, or will prevent, the exportation of those goods within 28 days of the time of supply; or (b)Due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export those goods, or a class of those goods, within 28 days of the time of supply, - the Commissioner may extend the 28-day period before the supply of goods is charged with tax under section 8 of this Act, as the Commissioner sees fit. Section 11(2) states that a supply of services will be charged with GST at the rate of zero-percent if: continued on page 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 2 Packaging and shipping of the trophy and related animal products The packaging and shipping of the trophy and related animal products to the recreational hunter overseas are properly zero-rated under section 11(2)(ac) as services comprising “the insuring or the arranging of the insurance or the arranging of the transport of passenger or goods to which any provision of paragraphs (a) to (ab) of this subsection applies”. Paragraph (a) includes services comprising the transport of goods from a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand. Trophy fee A trophy fee is charged for the animal, and from this the recreational hunter receives the head and hide of the animal (which will have been prepared by the hunting guide or in part by the taxidermist) in his or her country of residence. The trophy fee is properly zero-rated provided that it is supplied in accordance with the relevant provisions of the GST Act. The hunting guide must make the supply under section 11(1)(ac), meaning that the hunting guide must enter the goods for export in the course of, or as a condition of, making the supply. The hunting guide must be both the person supplying the trophy or animal and the person entering the goods for export – otherwise GST must be charged on the trophy fee. The export must take place within 28 days of supply, unless the Commissioner exercises his discretion to permit a longer period for export. Due to the difficulties involved in the processing, drying, and salting of the trophies within the tourist, hunting and safari industry, when it is not possible for goods to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply, section 11(1C)(b) of the Act permits the Commissioner to extend the 28-day period. The Commissioner’s general practice is to grant such an extension so that the total period within which the goods must be exported is up to 183 days. Any request for an extension of time beyond the 28-day rule (but not exceeding 183 days) must be made in writing and sent with a copy of the contract of supply to the supplier’s local Inland Revenue office. (a)The services (not being ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading, and handling) comprise the transport of passengers or goods- ... (ii)From a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand; or ... (ac)The services comprise the insuring or the arranging of the insurance or the arranging of the transport of passengers or goods to which any provision of para- graphs (a) to (ab) of this subsection applies; or ... (e)The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with- ... (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed;- and not being services which are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on any taxable activity, to the extent that the conduct of that activity would have occurred within New Zealand; or.... Interpretation Taxidermy fee The taxidermy fees are chargeable with GST at the standard rate as they do not fall within the zero-rating provisions of the GST Act. While the services are supplied to someone who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are carried out, they are in connection with “moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed” and are clearly excluded by section 11(2)(e)(ii). from page 1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Electronic Article Surveillance Systems – Depreciation Determination DEP26 In TIB Volume Nine, No.4 (April 1997) at page 1, we published a draft general depreciation determination for Electronic Article Surveillance Systems. These systems are used in the retail sector as an aid to help prevent shoplifting. Only one submission was received, which accepted the proposed depreciation rate but requested the implemen- tation date be backdated to the 1995/96 income year. The Commissioner has agreed to this request and has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below, and may be cited as, “Determination DEP26: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination No. 26”. The new depreciation rate is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) as set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP26 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP26: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 26”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1995/96 and subsequent income years. 2.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 4 Average market values of specified livestock – 1997 Under section EL 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the Act), the Governor-General has announced, by Order in Council, the national average market values of specified livestock for the 1996/97 income year. The values listed below apply to animals valued under the herd scheme. High-priced livestock The trigger price for high-priced livestock purchased in the 1996/97 income year is the greater of these two amounts: 1. $500 2. five times the greater of these two amounts: •the national average market values (1996/97 values) listed below; or •the national average market values declared for the 1995/96 income year. The trigger price for animals purchased during the 1996/97 income year is shown in the right-hand column below. High-priced livestock cannot be valued under the herd scheme, but must be capitalised and written off at an assigned percentage. The assigned percentages for the 1996/97 income year remain the same as for previous years. They are shown in the table at the end of this item.

The rates for the 1996/97 income year are unchanged from last year. They are shown in the following table. LivestockStraight-Equivalent categoryline ratediminishing rate Sheep25%33% Cattle20%26% Stags20%26% Other deer15%22% Goats20%26% Pigs33%40% A taxpayer who wishes to apply the diminishing value rate to an animal must clearly use the diminishing value rate in the financial statements that support the tax return. Once a taxpayer makes this election it is irrevo- cable. If there is no such clear use of the diminishing value rate, the straight-line rate will apply. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 6 Mulchers (Commercial) – Depreciation Determination DEP 25 In TIB Volume Nine, No. 3 (March 1997), we published a draft provisional depreciation determination for Mulchers (Commercial) of the type used at land fill and forestry sites for composting green waste. Although no submissions were received, we have received an application for a provisional depreciation rate for mulchers used in orchards for the mulching of orchard green waste, such as kiwifruit vines and orchard and shelterbelt trimmings. We have decided that the mulching machines used in orchards will have the same depreciation rate as the mulchers as described in the original draft determina- tion. Therefore, the determination will extend the asset “mulchers (commercial)” to the “Agriculture, Horticul- ture and Aquaculture” industry category.

Fringe benefit tax – prescribed interest rate decreased to 9.65% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been decreased to 9.65% for the quarter beginning on 1 April 1997. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. The prescribed rate, down from 10.00%, is a reflection of the recent fall in market rates.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 Sections KC 1, KD 3, KD 5, KD 5 AB, KD 5B, KD 6, OB 1, and Schedules 1, 14 and 19, Income Tax Act 1994 Section 33A, Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Taxation (Income Tax Rates) Act 1997 was enacted in May 1997. It gave effect to the decision, announced in the Coalition Agreement of 11 December 1996, to defer for one year the implementation of the second round of tax reductions enacted last year as part of the Tax Reduction and Social Policy Programme. The legislated increases in the Independent Family Tax Credit and Family Support will proceed, with effect from 1 July 1997. The deferral of the tax reductions has these results: •The previously legislated annual tax rates (basic rates of income tax) for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 income years become the annual tax rates for the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 income years respectively. •The previously legislated entitlement and abatement rates for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 income years become the entitlement and abatement rates for the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 income years respectively. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 9 •PAYE tax deduction rates (basic tax deductions) and the other withholding tax rates applying for pay periods or interest paid on or after 1 July 1996 continue to apply until 30 June 1998. •The increase in the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income from 1 July 1997 is deferred to 1 July 1998. •The increase in the non-filing threshold from $34,200 to $38,000 is deferred until the 1998/99 income year. The annual tax rates for the 1997/98 income year have been set and confirmed. The entitlement and abatement rates for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year have also been set. Key features Tax rates - 1997/98 income year Here are the annual tax rates for the 1997/98 income year. They are the same as those that applied from 1 July 1996. Annual tax rates 1997/98 IncomeAnnual tax rate $0 – $34,20021.5 cents over $34,20033 cents The 1997/98 PAYE tax deduction rates for the 1997/98 income year are the PAYE tax deduction rates that applied from 1 July 1996. Here are the annual entitlement and abatement rates for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year: Low income rebate 1997/98 IncomeLow income rebate $0–$9,500– 6.5 cents $9,501–$34,2002.5 cents over $34,200nil Taking into account the low income rebate, these are the effective tax rates for the 1997/98 income year. They are also the PAYE tax deduction rates for the 1997/98 income year. Effective tax rates 1997/98 AnnualLow incomeEffective Incometax raterebatetax rate $0–$9,50021.5 cents– 6.5 cents\*15 cents $9,501–$34,20021.5 cents2.5 cents 24 cents over $34,20033 centsnil 33 cents \* A negative number reduces the tax rate by the amount of the rebate. A 21.5 cent tax rate less a 6.5 cent rebate gives an effective tax rate of 15 cents. A positive number represents an abatement rate, which is added to the tax rate. A 21.5 cent tax rate plus a low income rebate abatement of 2.5 cents gives an effective tax rate of 24 cents. The resident withholding tax rate on interest will remain at 21.5 percent until 1 July 1998. The secondary tax deduction rate on secondary employ- ment income will remain at 24 percent until 1 July 1998. The extra emolument rate on payments such as retiring allowances and redundancy payments will remain at 24 percent until 1 July 1998. Tax rates - 1998/99 income year The annual tax rates for the 1998/99 income year take into account the deferred tax reductions. They are composite rates based on the tax rates applying for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1998 and reduced rates applying from 1 July 1998 to 31 March 1999.

The annual GMFI threshold for the 1997/98 income year is $14,768 ($284 a week). This means that the annual threshold for the 1998/99 income year will be $15,002 ($288.50 a week), being the composite of the threshold applying from 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1998 of $284 a week, and the threshold applying from 1 July 1998 to 31 March 1999 of $290 a week. The threshold for the 1999/2000 income year will be $15,080 ($290 a week). The purpose of the GMFI increase was to ensure that recipients of GMFI benefited from the tax reductions. As the reductions have been deferred a year it is also appropriate that the GMFI increase was deferred. Non-return filing threshold The increase in the non-return filing threshold from $34,200 to $38,000 from 1 April 1997 has been deferred to 1 April 1998. This coincides with the increase in the top marginal tax rate threshold of $38,000, which now takes effect in the 1998/99 income year as a result of the deferral of the 1 July 1997 tax reductions. Provisional tax The Act does not amend the provisional tax uplift factors for the 1997/98 income year. The existing provisional tax rules will apply. For those taxpayers who use the “safe harbour” provi- sional tax rules to calculate their provisional tax, the uplift factors will be either 105 percent or 110 percent depending on whether they have filed a 1996/97 tax return. Deemed rate of return announced for foreign investment fund regime The deemed rate of return used for the foreign investment fund regime has been set at 12.04% for the 1996-97 income year. This rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF regime taxes the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents, when the Controlled Foreign Company rules do not apply. The deemed rate of return method is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate for future income years will continue to be set annually.

Employment Court awards for lost wages or other remuneration – employers’ liability to make tax deductions Public Ruling BR Pub 97/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4 (b), EB 1, NC 2, NC 16, OB 1 (definitions of “employee”, “extra emolument”, “monetary remuneration”, “shareholder-employee”), and OB 2 (definition of “source deduction payment”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an order by a Court or Tribunal requiring an employer to make an award for lost wages under sections 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991. A Court or Tribunal will make such an award when an employee has lost remuneration as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the em- ployer (e.g. unjustified dismissal or other unjustified action by the employer). This Ruling does not apply to an award of compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury made under section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A. Monetary remuneration The payment of an award for lost wages under sections 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 is “monetary remuneration” of the employee as defined in section OB 1. As the payment is monetary remuneration, it is assess- able income of the employee under section BB 4 (b). B. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under sections 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 is an extra emolument and is a “source deduction payment” under section OB 2 (1). The employer must make tax deductions from the payment under section NC 2 and account for those deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 12 If an employer fails to make the required tax deductions from a payment, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to pay an amount equal to those tax deductions to the Commissioner (and is also required to furnish to the Commis- sioner a return in the prescribed form). C. When the payment is assessable to the employee Under section EB 1 (1), an employee derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under section 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 when the employee receives the payment, or when the pay- ment is credited to an account or otherwise dealt with on the employee’s behalf. A person who is a shareholder-employee for the purposes of section EB 1 (as defined in sections OB 1 and OB 2 (2)), derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under sections 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991, in the income year that the expenditure on that award is deductible to the employer. If the expenditure on the award is not deductible to the employer, the shareholder-employee derives the award in the year of receipt. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments of awards for lost wages or other remunera- tion which are made by a Court or Tribunal within the period 1 April 1997 to 30 September 1997. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21st day of May 1997.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A (“the Rulings”). The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 amended a large number of sections in the Income Tax Act 1994. It has done this, in the main, by repealing those provisions and replacing them with new amended provisions. The new provisions take effect from the commencement of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year (i.e. from 1 April 1997 for standard balance date taxpayers). Given that the repealed provisions will no longer apply from the commencement of each taxpayer’s 1997-98 income year, the Commissioner has produced two rulings. BR Pub 97/7 applies for the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 1997. BR Pub 97/7A applies for the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 2000. For example, if a taxpayer has a standard balance date, i.e. 31 March, BR Pub 97/7A will apply to that taxpayer for the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 2000. BR Pub 97/7 will apply from 1 April 1997 to those taxpayers with late non-standard balance dates whose continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 14 (b)That the employee’s employment, or one or more condi- tions thereof, is or are affected to the employee’s disad- vantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer (not being an action deriving solely from the interpretation, application, or operation, or disputed interpretation, application, or operation, of any provision of any employ- ment contract); or (c)That the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d)That the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e)That the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’s employment in relation to membership or non- membership of an employees organisation. Section 40 of the ECA states: Where the Tribunal or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, it may, in settling the grievance, provide for any one or more of the following remedies: (a)The reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance ... Section 41 of the ECA states: (1)Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, where the Tribunal or Court determines, in respect of any employee, - (a)That the employee has a personal grievance; and (b)That the employee has lost remuneration as a result of the personal grievance, - the Tribunal or Court shall, whether or not it provides for any of the other remedies provided for in section 40 of this Act, order the employer to pay to the employee the lesser of a sum equal to that lost remuneration or to 3 months’ ordinary time remuneration. (2)Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the Tribunal or the Court may, in its discretion, order an employer to pay to an employee by way of compensation for remuneration lost by that employee as a result of the personal grievance, a sum greater than that to which an order under that subsection may relate. (3)Where - (a)The Tribunal or the Court is obliged to make an order under subsection (1) of this section; and (b)The Tribunal or the Court is satisfied that the situation that gave rise to the personal grievance resulted in part from fault on the part of the employee in whose favour the order is to be made, - the Tribunal or the Court shall reduce, to such extent as it thinks just and equitable, the sum that would otherwise be ordered to be paid to the employee by way of reimburse- ment. Application of legislation Monetary remuneration In Egmont Co-operative Dairies Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,536 the Court of Appeal confirmed the long line of cases beginning with Burmah Steamship Co 1996-7 income year has not yet ended. BR Pub 97/7A will apply to those taxpayers when their 1997-8 income year commences. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. In particular, it refers to section CH 3 (previously section BB 4 (b)) and to the concept of “gross income” (previously, in the context of the Rulings, “assessable income”). Background The Employment Contracts Act 1991 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for wages lost by the employee as a result of actions by the employer which are the subject of a personal grievance. These Rulings confirm the Commissioner’s existing practice in respect of the assessability and deduction of tax from awards for lost wages or other remuneration made under sections 40(1)(a) or 41 of the Employment Contracts Act 1991.

The Egmont case concerned the taxation of insurance moneys received under loss of profits insurance follow- ing Cyclone Bola. The Court of Appeal examined the issue of whether the common law compensation princi- ple required the compensation payment to be treated for income tax purposes in the same manner as the original sum would have been treated had it in fact been re- ceived. In the High Court Thorp J held that “the rules as to derivation were unaffected by such matters as ‘com- pensation principles’”. However, the Court of Appeal overturned this decision. Richardson P at page 12,541 stated that: Characterising the insurance recovery requires determining whether the function of the insurance was to compensate for the asset or for the revenue that would have been derived from the asset. That turns on consideration of the nature and effect of the insurance policy and its relation to the general conduct of Egmont’s business.... Having considered the facts, the Court found that “the insurance recovery, having the same character as the loss which it replaced, was inherently business income.” An award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to compensate the employee for wages or other remu- neration he or she may have lost as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a per- sonal grievance by the employee against the employer. The wages or other remuneration that would have been received if it were not for the personal grievance are revenue in nature. It follows from the principle con- firmed in the Egmont case, that amounts received in compensation for those wages or other remuneration would be similarly revenue in nature. Having clarified that these payments are of an income nature, it is then necessary to consider whether they constitute monetary remuneration. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” as meaning: ...any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ... The words “...other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ...” cover an award for lost wages or other remuneration. The payment of the award for lost wages or other remuneration is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”, even though the payment is made to resolve a personal grievance rather than for services actually performed. A wide interpretation of the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, in response to Shell’s argu- ment that a payment was not made in respect of or in relation to employment because it was not made under a contract of employment. The Court stated that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. The Court also found that the words “emolu- ment (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” were not to be read ejusdem generis with the preceding words, the genus being reward for services. Thus, for the purposes of the definition of “monetary remunera- tion”, the words “emolument ... or other benefit in money” are not confined to rewards for services. In Shell the Court found it important that the employees were only in a position to receive compensation pay- ments (for changing the employees’ place of employ- ment) because of their employment relationship with the employer. So, although the employees received compen- sation for the costs of moving rather than payments for services, this was still monetary remuneration. Simi- larly, the personal grievance claim which gives rise to an award for lost wages or other remuneration arises directly out of and as a result of an employee’s employ- ment relationship with the employer. Again, although this is not a payment for services, it is within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The earlier TRA decisions on the previous legislation are consistent with the decision in the Shell case. In Case L92 (1989) NZTC 1,530, Barber DJ considered the term “monetary remuneration” in relation to a payment of compensation for unjustified dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. The compensa- tion was calculated on the basis of the personal hurt and procedural unfairness suffered by the objector. Barber DJ found that, even though the compensation was damages in nature, it was money received in respect of the objector’s employment. He stated that the words “compensation for loss of office or employment”, “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” and “in respect of or in relation to the employ- ment or service of the taxpayer” have a wide embrace and go beyond the narrower concept of “salary, wage, allowance, bonus gratuity, extra salary” which precede them. He said that “monetary remuneration”, inter- preted widely, covered the payment in issue. Barber DJ reached the same conclusion in relation to a similar compensation payment in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451. This case examined the nature of an ex gratia payment made to an employee as a result of a personal grievance claim brought against the employer under section 117 of the Industrial Relations Act 1973 which covered reimbursement for lost wages. The ex gratia payment was made up of six weeks’ holiday pay and pay for untaken sick leave. This holiday and sick leave was not owing to the taxpayer. The payment was held to fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section 2 of that Act. In Case P19 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,127, Barber DJ exam- ined whether a severance payment of $77,598 paid to an objector by his overseas employer was assessable income. The objector was a jockey who entered into a three-year oral contract to ride his employer’s horses. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 16 stated that “payments out of the income of the appellant company to employees by way of allowances for past services, which had been rendered by them, were within section 26(e)”. Awards for lost wages or other remuneration arise out of the employee’s previous service with the employer. A court award that compensates for lost wages or other remuneration is made as a result of the employee’s service with the employer, and so is made in relation to the employment of the employee. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award for lost wages or other remuneration The Rulings state that the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is a source deduction payment. Under section NC 2 (1), an employer must make the appropriate tax deduction from every source deduction payment made to an employee. Award is a source deduction payment Section OB 2 (1) states that a “source deduction pay- ment” is a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Section OB 1 defines “extra emolument” as: ... in relation to any person, means a payment in a lump sum (whether paid in one lump sum or in 2 or more instalments) made to that person in respect of or in relation to the employ- ment of that person (whether for a period of time or not), being a payment which is not regularly included in salary or wages payable to that person for a pay period, but not being overtime pay ... An award for lost wages or other remuneration is generally paid in a lump sum. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remunera- tion is made to a person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made in a lump sum, is in respect of or in relation to employment of a person, and is not a payment of salary or wages, it is an extra emolument. As the payment of the award is an extra emolument, it is included in the definition of “source deduction payment”. A former employee is an “employee” Section NC 2 requires an employer to make tax deduc- tions from source deduction payments to employees. Section OB 1 defines “employee” as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes a source deduction payment. A payment can still be “monetary remuneration” and a source deduction payment when it is paid to a former employee. A former employee who is entitled to receive this source deduction payment is also an “employee” for the purposes of section NC 2 (even though he or she may no longer be in an employment relationship with the employer). The employer became dissatisfied with the objector’s performance and unilaterally terminated the contract after about 4 months. After negotiation, the matter was settled on the basis that the employer made the sever- ance payment. Barber DJ held that “the severance payment was made as compensation for the objector’s loss of income due to the millionaire having terminated the contractual relationship”. He inferred that “the payment was a top-up of the first year’s minimum income” made to “assist the objector re-build his income earning process” and said that that type of payment “must be revenue in nature”. He stated that: In terms of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the payment made to the objector must be “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;”. Although not concerning a Court award, Case P19 supports the proposition that payments made as com- pensation for loss of income fall within the definition of monetary remuneration. As an award for lost wages or other remuneration is “...other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ...”, it is monetary remuneration. All monetary remuneration is gross income of the employee. When the employment relationship has ended In some cases the employment relationship of the employer and employee will have ended by the time the employer pays the court award to the employee. The fact that the employment relationship may have ended by the time the employer pays the award does not change the fact that the award is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” of the former employee. In the case of Freeman & Ors. v FC of T (1982) 82 ATC 4629 the Supreme Court of Victoria found that a payment is made “in relation to the employment” of a former employee when the entitlement to that payment arises out of the employment or from services performed by the employee before the termination of employment. In Freeman the taxpayers were directors, shareholders, and employees of the appellant company which ceased to carry on business. The next day the business was sold to another company controlled by the taxpayers and carried on business as before. Six months later it was decided that the appellant company should pay to each of the taxpayers certain lump sum payments. The evidence suggested that the source of the greater part of the payments consisted of fees (or “salaries”) received by the appellant company after it ceased carrying on business. The Court found that the payments received by the appellants were assessable income under section 26(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1978. Section 26(e) provided that assessable income included the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensations, benefits, bonuses and premiums given to him or her in relation directly or indirectly to their employment or services rendered by him or her. Kaye J from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 17 The appropriate tax deduction Section NC 2 requires the employer to make the appro- priate tax deduction from source deduction payments to employees. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes an “extra emolu- ment”, the employer must deduct tax at the extra emolument rate as provided for in section NC 6 and set out in Schedule 19 (currently 24 cents in the dollar). The employer must also: •deduct ACC earner premium from the payment; and •account for the deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way and pay the remaining amount to the employee; and •pay employer premium to Inland Revenue in respect of the gross award for lost wages or other remunera- tion. By deducting tax from the gross award and paying the net sum to the employee, the employer will satisfy the requirements under both the court award and the Income Tax Act. When an employer has deducted tax from a source deduction payment, section NC 19 (a) deems the employer to have paid the amount deducted to the employee. Thus, the employer is deemed to have paid the total amount of the award to the employee for the purposes of satisfying the obligation imposed by the Court or Tribunal. When the Court or Tribunal awards a net sum In some cases a Court or Tribunal may make an award for lost wages or other remuneration net of tax, i.e. the sum that the employee would have received as remu- neration after the deduction of tax. Because it is a “source deduction payment”, in such cases the employer would normally “gross up” the award to take account of the PAYE and the ACC earner premium. The employer would then pay the tax on the gross of the net award to Inland Revenue and pay the net award to the employee. In this way the employer would fulfil his or her obliga- tions to both the employee and the Commissioner. If the employer breaches the Court’s or the Tribunal’s direc- tion to pay the net sum to the employee, the onus will be on the employee to enforce the terms of the award by requiring the employer to pay the employee the full net amount of the award. The required tax deduction must be made from whatever amount is paid to the employee. When an employer fails to make tax deductions Under section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the employer fails to make the correct tax deductions from the payment of the award, the unpaid tax deduc- tions become a debt owed by the employer to the Commissioner. The debt is due and payable on the date that the tax deductions were due to be paid to the Commissioner. Where an employer fails to make a deduction, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to: •furnish the Commissioner with a return in the pre- scribed form of the source deduction payment (i.e. the award) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award; and •pay the Commissioner a sum equal to the tax deduc- tions that the employer should have made on that source deduction payment (unless the employee is exempted from this requirement) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award. When the payment is derived by the shareholder-employee Under section EB 1, a person is a shareholder-employee if he or she is a shareholder-employee in a close company and has met the criteria set out in section OB 2 (2). Example 1 An employee is dismissed from her job. She issues proceedings against her former employer alleging unjustifiable dismissal. She seeks reinstatement and damages for wages lost as a result of the unjustifi- able dismissal. The Employment Tribunal orders the employer to reinstate the employee and awards her $27,000, a sum equivalent to the employee’s wages from the time of redundancy to the time of reinstatement, to compensate for the wages lost as a result of the unjustified dismissal. The Tribunal makes the award for lost wages on 20 March 1996. The employer pays this award to the employee on 10 April 1996. 1.The award for lost wages is derived by the employee in the 1996-97 income year, as this is the year of receipt. 2.The employer must deduct tax and ACC earner premium from the court award, and pay the following amounts to the employee and Inland Revenue respectively (in the 1997 income year): Award for lost wages$27,000 Less tax at the extra emolument rate of 24%$6,480 Less ACC earner premium ($27,000 x 0.007)$ 189 Total payable to Inland Revenue$ 6,669 Total payable to the employee$20,331 The employer must also calculate the employer premium on the award and pay this to Inland Revenue in the 1996-97 income year in the normal manner. Example 2 The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the Tribunal awards damages of $27,000 and states that this sum is net of tax. In order to ensure that it pays the employee a net sum of $27,000, the employer “grosses up” the payment by the extra emolument tax rate plus ACC earner premium. The employer should make the following calculations and payments: continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 18 In both examples: •The employer must also calculate the employer premium on the gross award and pay this to Inland Revenue in the 1997 income year in the normal manner; and •The employee will include the amount of the award for lost wages in their return of income for the 1996-97 income year and claim the tax paid as a credit. Award for net lost wages$27,000.00 Divided by 0.753 (1 - 0.24 - 0.007) to give the gross wage$35,856.57 Less tax at the extra emolument rate of 24%$ 8,605.57 Less ACC earner premium ($35,856.57 x 0.007)$ 251.00 Total payable to Inland Revenue$ 8,856.57 Total payable to the employee$ 27,000.00 from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 19 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Whether doctor companies can return income using the cash basis Sections CD 3 and CH 3 – Business and Monetary Remuneration: A taxpayer has asked whether he can return the income from his medical practice using the cash basis of income calculation. The medical practice is operated as a limited liability closely held company. Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CH 3 states: All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Monetary remuneration is defined in section OB 1 as: (a)Means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer; and includes - (i)Any expenditure on account of an employee: ... It is a settled matter of law that the method used to calculate income for tax purposes must give the correct reflex of income for a particular taxpayer. (C of T (SA) v Executor Trustee & Agency Co of South Australia Ltd (1938) 63 CLR 108 - Cardens Case.) The cash basis has been held to be appropriate to give a correct reflex of income for professional taxpayers who earn income as a direct result of their personal exertions, and do not have large levels of stock or accounts receivable, nor use employees or assets in a significant way to generate their income. (FC of T v Firstenburg (1977) 6 ATR 297 and FC of T v Dunn (1989) 89 ATC 4,141.) If the earning of income is a result of the efforts of staff in more than a subsidiary or minimal way, and not solely related to the personal exertions of the taxpayer in question, the accruals or earnings method of calculating income is more ap- propriate. Other factors such as the size of the business, levels of stock or ac- counts receivable held, or accounting method used by the taxpayer may also mean that the accruals or earnings method will give the more correct reflex of income for a taxpayer. (Henderson v FC of T (1970) 119 CLR 612 and Barratt & Ors v FC of T (1992) 92 ATC 4,275.) These cases have decided the determining factors to be considered, regardless of profession or any impediments to recovery of fees. Accordingly, it is not possible to say that any particular profession is entitled to use the cash basis. Each case must be considered in light of its own facts, but Inland Revenue considers that the requirements outlined above will only be met if a professional provides services in a small practice, earning income as a direct result of his or her personal exertions. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 20 Note that the Commissioner has for some time permitted doctors who trade on their own account to compute their income for tax purposes on a cash basis. Although there may be some question as to whether this practice is entirely endorsed by the decisions in the cases discussed above, the Commissioner in- tends to continue the practice. However, in the case of this taxpayer who conducts his practice as a company, the cash basis will not give a correct reflex of his income. According to the de- cided cases, the predominant requirement before the cash basis can be used is for the taxpayer’s income to be earned as a result of his or her personal exertions. If the taxpayer in question is a company, it is not possible for the company to exercise personal exertion. This distinguishes it from the case of doctors trading on their own account. A company earns its income as a result of the exertions of others, including the registered medical practitioner who may be the principal shareholder. This will be the case regardless of the size of the practice, the number of staff employed, and whether the individual doctor would have been permitted to use the cash basis if he or she were practising as a sole trader. The company must use the accrual method to calculate its income. Depreciation of intangible assets Section EG 8 (section 108G, Income Tax Act 1976) – Annual depreciation rate for fixed life intangible property: A taxpayer uses a registered trademark, and has asked what depreciation she is able to claim on this intangible asset. She acquired the right to use the trademark for five years by making a lump sum payment of $10,000. Intangible assets are now included in the depreciation regime, and can be depre- ciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer’s 1993/94 income or non-standard accounting year. Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 which are depreciable, are limited to those listed in Schedule 17, (Twenty-second Schedule, Income Tax Act 1976). The right to use a trademark is included in the Schedule. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets are fixed life intangible property (FLIP). “Fixed life intangible property” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...any intangible property that - (a)Is depreciable property; and (b)Has a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of the creation or acquisition of the property, to be the same length as the property’s remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset is a FLIP, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner under section EG 8 using the formula: 1 legal life “Legal life” is also defined in section OB 1 as: in respect of any intangible property and the owner of that property, means the number of years and any monthly fraction that the property may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the property for the owner assuming any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre- determined fees, are exercised: from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 21 The formula gives a straight-line depreciation rate, as the straight-line method is the only depreciation method that can be used for FLIPs, as per section EG 3(2). FLIPs are not eligible for the 20% loading applying from the 1995/96 income year. If the intangible asset is not a FLIP, i.e., the asset can be expected to have an economic life which is shorter than its legal life, the Commissioner determines its depreciation rate using the same method that is applied to all tangible depreciable assets. Unlike FLIPs, economic life intangibles can be depreciated using a diminishing value or straight-line depreciation rate. They can also be pooled, and are eligible for the 20% loading applying from the 1995/96 income year. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. In this taxpayer’s case, the right to use the registered trademark was acquired from 1 June 1993 with a value of $10,000, and a legal life of 5 years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate to be used is: 1 5 = .2 or 20% The taxpayer is able to claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No. 9 (May 1993) carries a full commen- tary on the depreciation of intangible assets. Non-resident withholding tax on royalties paid to overseas holder of copyright Section NG 1 (2) (section 310(2), Income Tax Act 1976) - Non-resident with- holding income: A local operatic society intends to perform an internationally known musical. As a condition of putting on this production, the society is required to pay royalties to the copyright holder in the United States. The con- tract between the society and the copyright holder requires all royalties to be paid “free of all deductions, including local taxes”. The society’s secretary has asked if she must deduct non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) from the pay- ments, and if so, how they would be calculated, given the requirement that the payment is to be free of local taxes. Even though the contract requires the payments to be “free of all deductions, including local taxes”, the society must still comply with the New Zealand tax legislation. Under section NG 1 (2), the NRWT rules apply to income, including royalties, that is derived from New Zealand by a person who is not resident in New Zealand. Under section NG 2 (1)(c) (section 311(1)(b), Income Tax Act 1976), NRWT must be deducted at a rate of 15% of the gross amount of the payment. The rate of 15% is reduced to 10% under Article 12 of the double tax convention between New Zealand and the United States. In this case, so that the society could comply with both the NRWT legislation and the contract requirements, the secretary was advised that the payment should be “grossed up”, and that tax should be deducted from the resulting figure. Example: Royalties due to copyright holder$25,000.00 Gross up payment to include NRWT$27,777.77 Deduct NRWT $ 2,777.77 Payment to copyright holder $25,000.00 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 22 Resident withholding tax on interest paid on GST refunds paid late Section OB 1 (section 327A, Income Tax Act 1976) - Definition of “exempt interest”: An accountant has asked if interest is paid on delayed GST refunds and, if it is, if Inland Revenue deducts resident withholding tax (RWT) from the interest. Under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the Commissioner is required to pay interest on GST refunds not paid out within 15 working days of receipt of the return, unless he is not satisfied with the return and decides to investigate further, or requests further information. Under section NF 1 (2) (section 327B(2), Income Tax Act 1976), the RWT rules do not apply to interest that is exempt. Under section OB 1, for RWT purposes exempt interest includes interest paid by the Commissioner under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act. Although the interest remains taxable under section CE 1 (1)(a) (section 65(2)(j), Income Tax Act 1976), section NF 1 (2) through section OB 1 releases the Com- missioner from an obligation to deduct RWT. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Gift Duty exemption clarified Section 75A(5) – relief from gift duty: A taxpayer is considering seeking a court order under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 giving her husband, her 15 year- old son, and her niece a portion of her share in the family farm. She has been advised that the disposition of her share may be subject to gift duty if it is given to them by way of a discretionary trust. She has asked whether this is so. Note that there are different gift duty exemption provisions for matrimonial property agreements and court orders. Section 75A(5) deals with court orders and states: Any disposition of property by or pursuant to any order of the Court under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 shall not constitute a gift to the extent that the disposition is to a spouse or former spouse or is solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the mar- riage. Dispositions of property made directly to a spouse, former spouse, or minor or dependent children are clearly exempt from gift duty under section 75A(5). A single disposition made to more than one of the spouse, former spouse, or minor or dependent children in one court order would also be exempt from gift duty under section 75A(5), due to the existence of the words “to the extent that”. If a disposition of property were made to a fixed trust for (only) minor or de- pendent children this would also come within section 75A(5) as being “solely for the benefit of” those children. The Commissioner also accepts that a disposition of property made to a trust for only a spouse or former spouse can satisfy section 75A(5) (notwithstanding the section’s reference to a disposition “to” such a person). Further, a disposition to a trust for (only) a spouse, former spouse, and/or minor or dependent children would also qualify (again, due to the words “to the extent that”). The Commissioner does not accept that a disposition of property to a discretion- ary trust would be exempt, as the trustee would normally have discretion as to which, if any, of the beneficiaries were to benefit and by how much. A disposi- tion to such a trust would not necessarily be “to” the spouse or former spouse or “solely for the benefit of” the relevant children. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 23 Note that in 1993 when this provision was amended to include reference to minor and dependent children, the Minister said in his Second Reading Speech to Parliament that “the exemption will now not apply to transfers made to discretionary family trusts”. In the taxpayer’s case, the proposed court order would not be exempt from gift duty if a discretionary trust were used. If a direct disposition or a fixed trust disposition were made, it would be exempt to the extent of the dispositions made to the taxpayer’s husband and son. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 24 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Conveyance duty - land acquisition Case:Fulton Hogan Canterbury Limited v CIR Decision date:20 May 1997 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1974 – sections 24(1)(b) and 24(2) Keywords:conveyance duty, dwellinghouse Summary:The Court held that the objector was not entitled to an exemption from convey- ance duty pursuant to section 24(1)(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 as the property conveyed was not land acquired for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected upon it. Facts:In 1992 the objector purchased a block of land in Christchurch. Before entering the agreement for the sale and purchase of the land the vendor obtained ap- proval for the subdivision of the land into 264 lots. At the date of the hearing the objector had started stage 4 out of 10 of the planned stages of the subdivision, and had sold 44 of the 264 proposed lots. A term was included in the contracts for the sale of the individual lots requiring building plans to be approved by the objector and some of the sections were sold with builders’ terms. A number of sections were sold before October 1994 and the decision in Baillie v CIR. None were sold with covenants requiring building to take place by the sub-purchaser within a specified time. However, all sections sold after November 1994 included such covenants. Decision:The Court held that the objector was not entitled to an exemption from convey- ance duty pursuant to section 24(1)(b). The objector’s purpose at the time the land was acquired was subdivision and not the erection of dwellinghouses. His Honour was unable to distinguish this case from the case of Baillie. His Honour rejected the objector’s submission that they could obtain relief under section 24(2) even if they failed to satisfy the test under section 24(1). Justice Holland held that section 24(2) will apply only when part of the land comes within section 24(1) and the balance does not. Judicial review – assessment under appeal Case:Miller & O’Neill v CIR Decision date:29 May 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 99 and 25 Keywords:tax avoidance IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 25 Summary:The High Court held that the taxpayer’s transactions constituted a device the dominant purpose and effect of which was tax avoidance. Facts:This is both the appeal from Case R25 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,120 and the final part of the Judicial Review reported at (1996/97) 18 NZTC 13,001 and 13,127. The taxpayers were involved in a complex financial arrangement. The effect of this was to enable the taxpayer to receive income from their company as a tax free capital sum and for the company to access tax losses in unassociated compa- nies. Decision:The Court rejected the taxpayer’s appeal and held that section 99 should be applied. His Honour, Baragwanath J, held that whether the transactions were viewed broadly or in minute detail, the dominant purpose of the transactions was tax avoidance. The Court held that the fees in relation to the transactions were largely non- deductible as part of a tax avoidance scheme, but that some fees relating to ordinary accountancy work were deductible. The Court rejected the suggestion that Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,022, was no longer good law in New Zealand. The Court found that the changes to section 191 were not intended to limit section 99’s application. The Court held that the Commissioner was not statute barred by section 25. Furthermore, His Honour rejected the objector’s argument that full disclosure had been made and held that it was the taxpayer’s responsibility to provide all relevant information within a single package. Penal tax – failure to account for PAYE Case:TRA 96/18 Decision date:13 May 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 369 and 423(1) Keywords:penal tax, employer, PAYE Summary:The TRA held that the failure to return PAYE by an employer is viewed very seriously by Parliament. Consequently, in the circumstances of the case, penal tax assessed at 75% was not excessive. Facts:Inland Revenue assessed the taxpayer for penal tax in respect of his failure as an employer to account for PAYE for the periods September 1992 to June 1993. The taxpayer alleged that this imposition of penal tax breached an agreement be- tween himself and Inland Revenue in relation to the payment of outstanding tax. Decision:The TRA held that in the circumstances of the case, the penal tax assessed at 75% was not excessive. The objector had been investigated three times before this incident and on one of those occasions suffered a penalty of 25%. In the current case, the Commissioner reduced the penal tax to half of the maxi- mum amount. Judge Willy found that in the circumstances of the case, this was an appropriate and fair result. The Authority found that it was necessary to keep in mind the fact that Parlia- ment takes a serious view of the wilful failure by an employer to return pay- ments of PAYE tax. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) 26 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Accrual determinations – fee setting Regulations 3(1) and 11(1) of the Income Tax (Deter- minations) Regulations 1987 require that fees be charged for accrual regime determinations made in terms of section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 90 the Commissioner is empowered to determine certain matters relating to financial arrangements. A taxpayer may wish to apply for a determination to ascertain the tax treatment of a particular financial arrangement. The criteria for setting these fees are set out in Regula- tions 11(2) and 11(3). For the year beginning 1 July 1997 the GST inclusive fees are: Application fee (non-refundable)$210 Processing fee (per hour or part thereof, exclusive of the first two hours)$105 Regulation 13 allows the Commissioner to waive fees in exceptional circumstances, either in full or in part. Applications for determinations should be made to: Assistant General Manager Adjudication & Rulings Inland Revenue National Office PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON The information relating to applications is set out in Regulation 3(1). Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Wood-Turning Machines – draft general depreciation determination nation, applicable from the 1997/98 and subsequent income years, which inserts these machines into the “Timber & Joinery” industry category. The determina- tion, which is reproduced below in draft form, will set a deprecation rate of 22% DV for these assets. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of 8 years and a residual value of 13.5%. The Commissioner has been made aware that there is currently no depreciation rate for computer numerically controlled (CNC) wood turning machines used for specialised wood turning operations in the timber and joinery industries. These machines are variously referred to as tooling machines or machine centres. The Commis- sioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determi- General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Timber & Joinery” industry category the general asset classes, estimated useful lives, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent useful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate Timber & Joinery(years)(%)(%) Tooling Machine, CNC82215.5 Machine Centre, CNC82215.5 continued on page 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 2 ACC premium assessments – applications for review Introduction This article provides commentary on the review proce- dures to be followed if you disagree with an ACC premium assessment. Overview The disputes resolution process does not apply to ACC premium assessments. Part VI of the Accident Rehabili- tation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 (ARCI Act) provides for reviews and appeals relating to the administration of the ACC scheme generally. Briefly, •Premium payers have three months from the date of the assessment notice to apply for a review. •The review must start within three months of the lodging of the application. If it doesn’t, the decision can be deemed in the premium payer’s favour. •Even if the premium payer lodges an application for review, the assessed premium must be fully paid by the due date. A full legislative analysis and the administrative proce- dures to be followed is set out below. Application for review Legislation Section 89 of the ARCI Act states – . . . . (4)Any person who is dissatisfied with any decision of the Corporation relating to any premium payable or claimed to be payable by that person under this Act may apply to the Corporation for a review of that decision; but no such right shall exist under this Act in respect of the calculation for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 of the taxable income of any person. (5)An application pursuant to this section - (b)In any other case an application in the prescribed form may be made within 3 months after the date on which notice in writing has been given of the decision in respect of which the review is sought – and each such application shall state briefly the grounds on which the application is made. Section 90(9) of the ARCI Act states - Where the hearing of a review has not commenced within 3 months after the lodging of the application for review, and the delay is not caused or contributed to by the applicant, the application shall be deemed to have been determined in favour of the applicant. Commentary You have three months from the date of the premium assessment notice to apply for a review. The new notices of assessment contain the following message, which tell you what to do if you disagree with the ACC premium: If you disagree with the ACC premium amount on this notice, you can apply for a review. Fill in an ARC 33 form and send it to us within three months of the date of this notice. You can get an ARC 33 form from any Inland Revenue or ACC office. If you disagree with the income the ACC premium is charged on you must follow the tax disputes procedures (mentioned above). To apply for a review, you must fill in an ARC 33 form (and usually include a letter detailing the objection), and lodge it with the Inland Revenue office that issued the assessment. The review must start within three months from the date Inland Revenue receives the application. Inland Revenue is not delegated to consider these reviews. We refer applications to ACC for its consideration. Under section 89(4), you can’t use the premium review process to challenge the amount of taxable income on which premium is assessed. In practice this relates only to self-employed people because their premiums are based on their taxable income. Employers’ and close companies’ premiums are calculated on the employee earnings; not the taxable income. from page 1 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. If you wish to make a submission on these proposed new depreciation rates, please write to: Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Adjudication & Rulings National Office Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON We need to receive your submission by 29 August 1997 if we are to take it into account in finalising the determination. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 3 Also, you can’t seek a review of premium rates because they are set by Regulation. However, the applicability of a particular classification unit is reviewable. On receipt of the application for review, the ACC may either: •refer it to an independently appointed review officer for hearing in terms of section 90 of the ARCI Act, or •concede the case. Once a decision is made, the ACC will advise both the applicant and Inland Revenue of the outcome. Appeal rights are available through the courts. Premium payable despite application for review Section 79(2) of the ARCI Act states - No obligation to pay any premium or right to receive or recover any premium shall be suspended because any review or appeal or other proceeding may have been commenced in respect of that premium. This means the assessed premium must be fully paid by the due date even when an application for review has been lodged. There are no discretionary powers to allow payment to be deferred. Library books and periodicals – draft depreciation determination Currently there are ten asset classes for library books and periodicals. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination that will set two new asset classes for library books, as reproduced below. The determination will set a new depreciation rate of 63.5% DV for books whose editions are published annually or more fre- quently. This proposed rate is based on a useful life of 2 years and a residual value of 13.5 % of cost. The other new asset class will cover all other books, for which the rate proposed is 18% DV. This rate is based on a useful life of 10 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost.

It is not designed to provide superannuation or other retirement related benefits. Where a person is an owner and employee of the business, and the business is not operated through a separate legal entity, the owner may not participate in the Plan. There are two agreements: •A Participation Agreement between the employer and the employee. •A trust deed under which the employer is the settlor, NZGT is the trustee, and named employees are the beneficiaries. Participation Agreement: Under the Participation Agreement between the em- ployer and the designated employee, the employer agrees to pay to the trust a set monthly amount for each complete month that the designated employee remains in the service of the employer. The employee has no current entitlement whatso- ever to that monthly contribution. At most, the employee can enforce: •the employer to make the contribution to the trust, and •the trustees to comply with the trust deed. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 6 Trust Deed: The trustee holds the contributions received on trust for the named employees. The trust deed contains detailed rules covering the terms on which the trustee holds the employer contributions in the Trust. Both the participation agreement and the trust deed cover the circumstances where the trustee may pay out amounts to the employees. An employee will only ever receive one payment from the Trust and that will be at the earliest of: •the expiry of continuous service for a set number of years (six years). •the happening of a certain listed termination event (death, resignation within three months of a takeover offer, redundancy, retirement due to ill-health or by resignation in special circumstances). If the employee ceases employment before the set number of years the employee will receive nothing from the Trust. If the employee stays in the employment of the employer for the set number of years, the employee will receive an amount based on the employer contributions and any investment gains made on that amount. In no circumstances will the employee have any entitlement to the trust fund or any claim on it, or use it as collateral to obtain funds or as security for any other purposes. There is the possibility for the employees to receive a larger amount should other employees who have participated in the Plan leave before they reach the set number of years. If all participating employees leave before reaching the set number of years, the trustee must find the last participating employees in the preceding 12-month period and distribute the remaining amount to them (clause 4.3 of the Trust Deed). In no circumstances will the employer ever receive any of the contributions back from the Trust. The total amount of the Trust’s fund must always vest in one or more of the named beneficiaries. There is no requirement that an employee stay within the employ of the em- ployer for any set period of time after the payment has been made by the Trust. Investment: The Trust will invest the employer contributions in a suitable invest- ment vehicle. From a substantive practical viewpoint any investment vehicle will be designed to give a “fair” return from a balanced portfolio of “safe” invest- ments. Currently only unit trust based investments are being considered. Those pres- ently included for consideration are: Armstrong Jones Balanced Fund. BNZ Active Growth Fund. National Mutual Balanced Growth Fund. Tower Multi Sector Fund. The trustee will invest the employer contributions and pay tax on any gross income derived in relation to such investments. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •An employer may not participate in the Plan in the capacities of both em- ployer and employee. •The trust will return the employer contributions as gross income of the trust in terms of section HH 1 (7) of the Act. from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 7 •In a year of an employee payout, the trust, as agent, will meet the income tax liability on any portion of the employee payout which qualifies as beneficiary income. •The trust is not established principally to provide retirement benefits. •In no circumstances will any of the employer contributions ever flow back to the employer. •GST input tax credit will not be claimed on the employer contributions. •The Trust will not be registered or be liable to be registered for GST. •The Trust Deed is in the form supplied with the rulings application. •No employer contributions to the Trust, nor any distribution from the Trust is made directly or indirectly in lieu of or in substitution for any remuneration or bonus that an employee would otherwise have received or would have been likely to have received or become entitled to if not for the inclusion in the Participation Plan. •The Participation Plan is not a condition of employment. •Superannuation surtax may apply to an amount that is distributed from the trust notwithstanding that tax may have been paid by the trustee of the Trust on distribution from the Trust. •There will be no employer contributions to the Trust in respect of a named participant in any quarter in which a contingent event leads to a distribution from the Trust in respect of that named participant, resulting in a benefit that is used, enjoyed or received by that participant or any person associated with that participant in the Plan in that quarter. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The employer contributions will qualify as allowable deductions to the em- ployer under section BD 2 (1) and will not be excluded as allowable deduc- tions under section BD 2 (2). •The employee payout will comprise either or both of beneficiary income which is gross income of the employee under section HH 3 (1) and distribu- tions which are not gross income of the beneficiary under section HH 3 (5). •No gross income arises, under sections CH 3 or EB 1 (1), to any designated employee as a result of participation in the Plan. •No fringe benefit as defined in section CI 1 arises as a result of the participa- tion of a designated employee in the Plan. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 4th July 1997 to 31st March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of July 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 8 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Cost price of repairable spares acquired under a warranty contract – income tax implications Section EE 1 –Valuation of trading stock: A taxpayer is in the business of retail- ing photocopying equipment. She backs up her products with a warranty either as part of the sale price or for a fee based on the value of the equipment pro- vided. All warranty contracts include the following clause: ... repairing or replacing, at \[the taxpayer’s\] option, any product or parts thereof, which, under normal and proper use and maintenance proves defective in material or workmanship. Further, it is either an actual or an implied term of the warranty contracts that the retailer has the right to retain any defective parts removed from items requir- ing repairs. The taxpayer has asked what the cost price of defective parts recovered is. Recovery of defective parts occurs when the taxpayer simply removes the defec- tive part and replaces it with either a new or used part. Under the above term of the warranty contract, she is then entitled to retain the defective part or parts recovered. Those defective parts may later be repaired and placed into the tax- payer’s trading stock for future use in making repairs under other warranty contracts. Under section EE 1, “cost price” is one option available for valuing trading stock at the end of an income year. Trading stock includes anything acquired or pur- chased for the purposes of manufacture, sale, or exchange. The repairable parts are “acquired” for the purpose of “exchange”, and so are trading stock. To establish the cost price it is necessary to determine what was given up and what was obtained. In this case, a client has paid for a warranty in return for the taxpayer ensuring that the product operates properly for a specified period from the date of purchase. The taxpayer gives up new or used parts and labour to meet the obligations as repairer under the warranty and, when possible, recovers any repairable defec- tive parts to mitigate the cost of repairs made under the warranty. The taxpayer therefore gives up labour to meet the obligations under the repair contract, and gives up the replacement parts both to meet obligations under the repair contract and to obtain the defective part for repair. As the cost price of the replacement part is given up for two purposes, that cost price must be apportioned between the two purposes. It is necessary in any particular circumstance to determine the most appropriate means of apportionment, and this will depend on the available facts. An exam- ple of one method that might be appropriate for the taxpayer is as follows. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 9 Example The taxpayer chooses to repair the defective part and return it to the client’s machine, rather than put in a replacement part and keep the defective part for repair and later use. The estimated cost of repairs to the defective part may provide a good approximation of the cost price given up in order to meet the obligations under the warranty. Any remainder of the cost price of the replace- ment part is then attributable to the cost of the defective part recovered. Applying this approach before repair: cost of defective part = cost of replacement – estimated cost to recoveredpart put into machinerepair defective part Applying this approach after repair: cost of defective part recovered=cost of replacement part. If the replacement part costs $1,000 and the estimated cost of repairing the defec- tive part recovered is $400, then the cost attributed to repair under the warranty will be $400, and the cost price attributable to the defective part recovered will be $600 ($1,000 less $400). Once the defective part recovered has been repaired, its cost price is $600 plus the cost of repair. If the estimated cost of repair is accurate, then the cost price of the defective part after repair will be $1,000 ($600 + $400). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 10 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Declaration – legal professional privilege, litigation privilege Case:A J Dinsdale v CIR & ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Ltd Decision date:6 June 1997 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 – section 17 Keywords:Legal professional privilege, litigation privilege, Summary:The Court dismissed the application for a declaration that the Commissioner’s notice under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) was invalid on the ground that no legal professional privilege or litigation privilege attached to interview notes that were taken. Facts:The Plaintiff sought a declaration that a notice issued on behalf of the Commis- sioner under section 17 of the TAA was invalid by reason both of legal profes- sional privilege and litigation privilege. Bage Investments Limited (“Bage”) and Post Office Bank Limited (“Postbank”) had entered into a redeemable preference share (“RPS”) transaction with Capmar Investments Limited. The second respondent the “Bank” subsequently acquired ownership of Bage and Postbank. The Commissioner requested and received documents relating to the RPS trans- action but did not receive any preliminary documentation covering the consid- eration and negotiation of the investment. Two letters from the Commissioner addressed the concerns relating to this non- disclosure, alerting the Bank to the possibility of prosecution. The Commissioner also requested a statutory declaration to the effect that all relevant papers had been made available under section 17(5) of the TAA. Counsel for the Bank recommended that KPMG carry out an audit of all the relevant documents as well as a full review of all matters relating to the threat- ened prosecution. A number of documents not previously provided to Inland Revenue were then found including notes from interviews with 34 people about the RPS transaction. The Commissioner requested notes of interviews with six of these people, but the Bank declined to provide them arguing litigation privilege and legal profes- sional privilege. The Commissioner then made a formal request for the notes of the interviews under section 17 of the TAA. Decision:The Court held that there was no legal professional privilege attaching to the interview notes. The interviews were conducted by KPMG to enable them to prepare their report. The court found there was no basis for holding that the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 11 interviews were communications passing between a legal practitioner and the practitioner’s client. At most these communications were between a legal practi- tioner and third parties. The notes themselves do not purport to be and were not communications between solicitor and client. Likewise no litigation privilege attached to the interview notes. Although the Court held the bank did have a reasonable apprehension that litigation would ensue, the dominant purpose test was not satisfied. That is, the plaintiff could not show that the dominant purpose of the preparation of the interview notes was to enable the legal adviser to conduct litigation or advice regarding the litigation. Therefore the plaintiff could not invoke litigation privilege. Although this matter did not arise, Eichelbaum CJ stated that if he had to make a decision on waiver, he would decide against the Commissioner because there would be no unfairness to him in doing so. Superannuation surcharge assessment Case:Reginald Stevens Shaw v CIR Decision date:1 July 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – section 336B(1) Keyword:superannuation surcharge, Magna Carta Summary:The Court held that the Commissioner acted correctly in assessing the objector as liable to the National Superannuation surcharge, and held that the natural and ordinary provisions of the Magna Carta have no application in this case. Facts:The objector is the recipient of New Zealand superannuation. He had been assessed by the Commissioner for the surcharge pursuant section 336B(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”) in respect of his superannuation. The objector challenged the assessments arguing that section 336B(1) of the Act is unlawful and invalid on the basis that it is discriminatory and offends against the principles of the Magna Carta. Decision:In appropriate cases, the Courts can consider whether statutes have been prop- erly enacted. The Courts do not however have the power to consider the validity of properly enacted laws. The Courts’ power is simply to determine whether or not the laws have been properly enacted. Further, Parliament must have the right to take with one hand what it has given by another hand. The Court held that the natural and ordinary provisions of the Magna Carta can have no application in this case. Demolition cost deductibility – decision on appeal Case:CIR v Lyttelton Port Company Decision Date:25 June 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – section 104 & 106(1)(a) Keywords:Deductibility of demolition costs Facts:Under a statutorily enforced transfer of assets, the respondent was obliged to acquire certain buildings irrespective of whether they held any value to it. The respondent did not want these buildings, and decided to demolish them. The continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 12 respondent then claimed a deduction of $13,500 for the costs of the demolition. The High Court held that these costs were deductible under section 104 of In- come Tax Act 1976, but the Commissioner appealed this as previous Australian decisions held that these costs were non-deductible as they were capital in na- ture. The Commissioner appealed this to the Court of Appeal so that the status of demolition costs in New Zealand could be clarified. Decision:The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the High Court erred in finding that the demolition costs were deductible. The present case came squarely within the principles enunciated in the Australian decisions and was particularly analogous to Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1992) 24 ATR 261. The demolition improved the Respondent’s capital asset by providing an up- graded and uncluttered wharf area. Its effect was to enhance the assets deployed by the respondent in the production of revenue. Further, the demolition of the buildings as an isolated incident of the respondent’s operations could not be characterised as maintenance or upkeep. The Court of Appeal concluded that the expenditure was capital in nature and therefore non-deductible. from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) 13 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Family Support increase at 1 January 1998 Introduction From 1 January 1998 the amount of Family Support payable for qualifying children aged 16 and over will increase to $60 per week. Background This change was introduced in the Youth Income Support Bill, which was split into the following Acts when enacted in June: •The Social Security Amendment Act (No. 3) 1997 •The Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1997 •The Child Support Amendment Act 1997 The Youth Income Support Bill was introduced by the previous Government and was part of that Government’s youth employment strategy. That strategy, which was based on the recommendations made by the Prime Ministerial Task Force on Employment, was designed to send a clear message that 16 and 17 year olds should remain in education if they do not have a job to go to. Key features The Social Security Amendment Act (No. 3) 1997 makes changes to the age of entitlement to the sickness, unemployment and training benefits; amends the eligibility criteria for the independent youth benefit; abolishes the job search allowance; and creates a new job seeker’s allowance. These benefits are paid by the New Zealand Income Support Service. The Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1997 increases the rate of Family Support to $60 per week for qualifying children aged 16 and over. Because the change takes place on 1 January 1998, Family Support for the 1997/98 income year will be a composite rate comprising the amounts payable to 30 June 1997, from 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1997 and from 1 January 1998 to 31 March 1998. Set out below are the composite rates for the 1997/98 income year and the full year rate for the 1998/99 income year. 1997-981998-99 income yearincome year For the eldest child: aged 0 to 15 years$2,411.50\*$2,444.00\* aged 16 years and over$2,580.50$3,120.00 For each additional child aged 0 to 12 years$1,631.50\*$1,664.00\* aged 13 to 15 years$2,047.50\*$2,080.00\* aged 16 years and over$2,307.50$3,120.00 \* Unchanged from increased Family Support that applied from 1 July 1997 Two consequential changes arise from the creation of the new job seeker’s allowance. This allowance has been added to the definition of a social security benefit in the Child Support Act 1991 by the Child Support Amend- ment Act 1997. The allowance has also been added to the definition of an income-tested benefit in the Income Tax Act 1994 by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act 1997. Application date The increased Family Support is payable from 1 January 1998. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 2 Computerised Ink Mixing Systems – Depreciation Determination DEP27 In TIB Volume Nine, No.6 (June 1997) at page 7, we published a draft general depreciation determination for Computerised Ink Mixing Systems used in the printing industry. No submissions were received on this draft and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as, “Determination DEP27: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination No.27”. The new depreciation rate is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) as set out in the determina- tion and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP27 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP27: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 27”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1994/95 and subsequent income years. 2.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 3 Trailers (Class TD – over 10 tonnes) – when rented for periods of 1 month or less Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised there is currently no general depreciation rate for heavy truck trailers (Class TD, as included in First Schedule to the Miscellaneous Trans- port Regulations, – over 10 tonnes) which are rented out for short periods. These trailers are usually rented to front line major transport and distribution companies to cover emergencies and excess workload requirements. The period of rental is short-term: generally, for only 1-2 weeks at a time. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination, applicable from the 1997/98 and subsequent income years, which inserts a new category into the “Hire Equipment (Where on short-term hire of 1 month or less only)” Industry Category. The determi- nation, reproduced below in draft form, will set a depreciation rate of 18% D.V. for these assets and is based on an estimate useful life (EUL) of 10 years and a residual value of 13.5%.

Maori trust boards: declaration of trust for charitable purposes made under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 – income tax consequences Public Ruling – BR Pub 97/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the In- come Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to income derived by a trust established by a Maori Trust Board pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, declaring that it stands possessed of any of its property upon trust for charitable purposes. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Where a Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust that it shall stand possessed of property for charitable purposes, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, the income of such a trust is exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) or CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 if: •all of the purposes specified in the declaration of trust are purposes that are specified in sections 24 or 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955; and •the Commissioner is satisfied that, with the exception of the charitable pur- pose requirement and the public benefit test, all other requirements of charita- ble status are met; and •the declaration of trust has been submitted to and approved by the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 5 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to income derived by such a Maori Trust Board during income years falling within the period 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2001 (inclu- sive). This Ruling is signed by me on the 1st day of August 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/8 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/8 (“the Ruling”). Background Sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provide the following exemptions from income tax for income derived by a charitable trust: •Under section CB 4 (1)(c), income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes (except income to which section CB 4 (1)(e) applies). •Under section CB 4 (1)(e), income derived from a business carried on by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes. Neither exemption is available if any person is able to influence the amount of any private pecuniary benefit from the trust. The exemption under CB 4 (1)(e) only applies to the extent that the charitable purposes are limited to New Zealand. Under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, a Maori Trust Board may declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes. The income of the trust can only be applied for those purposes set out in sections 24 and 24A of that Act and which are specified in the declaration of trust. Section 24B deems the income of such a trust to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 CB 4 (1)(c)61(25) CB 4 (1)(e)61(27) Income tax exemption – section CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) Section CB 4 (1) provides an exemption from income tax for: ... (c)Any amount derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or derived by any society or institution estab- lished exclusively for charitable purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual, except where the income so derived is income to which paragraph (e) applies: ... (e)Any amount derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit to trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand, or derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of any society or institution established exclusively for such purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. Provided that if those purposes are not limited to New Zealand the Commissioner may apportion the income in such manner as the Commissioner deems just and reason- able between those purposes within New Zealand and the like purposes out of New Zealand, and accordingly only a part of the amount may be exempt:... Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 states: (1)Any Board may from time to time, in its discretion, execute under its seal a declaration of trust declaring that it shall stand possessed of any of its property, whether real or personal, upon trust for charitable purposes. (2)Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. (3)No declaration of trust under this section shall have any force or effect unless it has been approved by the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue. Sections 24 and 24A specify the purposes for which a Maori Trust Board may apply money. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 6 the trust must be applied for purposes referred to in section 24 and 24A, it follows from this approach that, as the trust must be also charitable, the income can only be applied for section 24 and 24A purposes that are themselves charitable. Such income would therefore be exempt under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. The second interpretation is that the income of a section 24B trust can be applied for any of the purposes referred to in section 24 or 24A – whether those purposes are charitable under general law or not. However, this approach proceeds upon the basis that any income derived by the trust is deemed by section 24B(2), to the extent that it is applied for purposes specified in sections 24 and/or 24A, to be income derived in trust for charita- ble purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, and therefore exempt from income tax. This is irrespec- tive of whether the purpose is a purpose that would generally be considered charitable in law. The background papers relating to the introduction of section 24B, including Hansard, indicate that the new section was intended to remedy the concern, at the time, that trusts established by Maori Trust Boards were not considered charitable in terms of both the common law and the income tax legislation. This view of the law was confirmed by the Court in Arawa Maori Trust Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1961) 10 MCD 391. In that case Donne S M ruled that a trust established by the Arawa Maori Trust Board was not charitable because: •Many of the purposes specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 were not charitable purposes under the general law; and •The trust failed the public benefit test because it was for the benefit of a group of persons determined by their bloodline, or whakapapa. The Court determined that such a group of people did not satisfy the public benefit test. Analysis The Commissioner believes the better view of the law to be that contained in the second interpretation, as set out above, and that the first interpretation was not what was intended by Parliament. As has been noted, at the time that section 24B was enacted it was strongly arguable, taking into account the Court decision in Arawa, that a trust that benefits a specific tribe or iwi, or the members of such a tribe or iwi, cannot be charitable at common law because it will not meet the requirements of the public benefit test. Therefore, it would be arguable that any trust established under section 24B could not be charitable, irrespective of the purposes for which it was established, because Maori Trust Boards are acknowledged by the Maori Trust Boards Act to be for the benefit of iwi and hapu determined on the basis of whakapapa. This would give rise to a situation where, despite the enactment of section 24B, trusts established by Maori Application of the Legislation Charitable purposes For a trust to be considered charitable for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, it must generally meet the common law requirements of charity. That is, a trust must be established for a “charitable purpose”, and must meet what is known as the “public benefit test”. The term “charitable purpose” is defined in the Income Tax Act, as: ...includes every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Court of Appeal noted in Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070 that the definition of charitable purpose in the Income Tax Act does not have the effect of enlarging or altering the ordinary, general law, meaning of charity. This means that it is necessary to refer to general law to determine whether any specific taxpayer, or activity, is charitable. In Commrs of IT v Pemsel \[1891\] AC 531, p.583, Lord Macnaghten determined that all charitable purposes fall within four classes of charity (known as the “Pemsel Heads”), namely: •the advancement of religion; •the relief of poverty; •the advancement of education; and •any other matter beneficial to the community. In addition to falling within one of the “Pemsel Heads”, with the exception of a trust for the relief of poverty, to be charitable in law a trust must be established for the benefit of the community or a sufficiently important class of the community, rather than for the benefit of private individuals. This requirement, which is in addition to the objects of the charity falling within one of the four heads listed above, is known as the public benefit test. The public benefit test has been endorsed and further developed by a large body of case law, including Verge v Somerville \[1924\] All ER 121, Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Company Limited \[1951\] 1 All ER 31, Davies v Perpetual Trustee Co. (Ltd.) \[1959\] 12 All ER 128 and New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 148. Section 24B, Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 was inserted into that Act by section 3 of the Maori Trust Boards Amendment Act 1962. Section 24B permits the establishment of charitable trusts by Maori Trust Boards, and provides a concessionary tax treatment of the income of such trusts. There are two possible interpretations of the meaning of section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act: The first interpretation is that a declaration can only be made under section 24B(1) if the purposes of the trust are exclusively charitable, i.e. ‘charitable’ being inter- preted as the common law meaning of the term. Al- though section 24B(2) only requires that the income of from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 7 Trust Boards would possibly continue to be denied charitable status, and the amendment would have no effective operation. Clearly, this cannot have been the intention of Parliament. Taking this into account, and after considering the available background documents, the Minister’s state- ment (as recorded in Hansard) and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s practice immediately following the enactment of section 24B, the Commissioner believes that the second interpretation is the correct view of the law. Under this interpretation, section 24B(1) allows a Maori Trust Board to declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes, and authorises the Trust Board to settle some of the Trust’s assets to a charitable trust. Section 24B(2) contains two limbs. The first limb states: Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; ... The Commissioner considers that this limb limits the purposes for which the income of a charitable trust can be applied to those purposes that are referred to in sections 24 and 24A. The purposes for which the income is to be applied must be specified in the declaration of trust. As previously noted, many of the purposes referred to in sections 24 and 24A may not be charitable purposes under common law. In addition, any trust established by a Trust Board is only allowed to apply its income for the benefit of the Trust Board’s beneficiaries, which are restricted, by the Maori Trust Boards Act, to the mem- bers of specified iwi. Such a requirement could mean that a trust would fail the public benefit test applied under the common law. However, the second limb of section 24B(2) deems the income of the trust to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”. The second limb states: and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. Therefore, the effect of this section is to deem the income of the trust, even though it is established for purposes that may not be charitable in general law, to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. This means that the requirements of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, to the extent that those sections only apply to “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”, have been satisfied. It is therefore not necessary for such a trust to satisfy the common law requirements of “charitable purpose” and the “public benefit test”. However, note that section 24B(2) of the Maori Trust Boards Act only modifies the requirements of the Income Tax Act. It does not apply for any other pur- poses. Therefore, whatever may be the position of such a trust under common law and irrespective of whether the public benefit test would be failed in other contexts, the Commissioner is satisfied that in this provision Parlia- ment intended for a trust established under section 24B to be treated as being a charitable trust for income tax purposes. The income of such a trust is therefore treated as having been derived for charitable purposes and as such is exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) or (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Nevertheless, before that exemption can be applied, the requirements of section 24B(3) must be satisfied. That section requires a declaration of trust under section 24B(1) to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before it will take effect. The Commissioner must still be satisfied that the constituting documents of the trust meet the legal requirements of a charitable trust, other than the public benefit test discussed above. Approval of charitable trust As has been outlined earlier in this commentary, section 24B(2) of the Maori Trusts Board Act 1955 modifies the general law requirements of a trust established under subsection (1) to the extent that the trust is not required to satisfy the meaning of “charitable purpose” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the public benefit test. However, before such a trust will be approved by the Commissioner under section 24B(3), the trust must still meet the other criteria of a charitable trust. For example, the Commissioner must also be satisfied that the declaration of trust provides that: •the charitable activities are restricted to New Zealand; •the rules of the trust cannot be changed in order to allow the income of the trust to be applied to purposes that are not specified in sections 24 or 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act, or to otherwise affect the charitable nature of the trust; •no person is able to derive a personal pecuniary profit from the trust; •trustees are unable to materially influence their remuneration; •professional services provided by trustees to the trust are provided at commercial rates and that conflicts of interest are avoided; and •upon winding up, any remaining trust assets must be applied for charitable purposes. This is not an exhaustive list of all matters that the Commissioner will consider when deciding whether or not a trust is charitable, and therefore entitled to the tax exemptions under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e). Further information regarding the Commissioner’s requirements is contained in the booklet “Charitable Organisations” (IR 255), which can be obtained from any Inland Revenue office. continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 8 Runanga o Ngai Tahu from any property to which a declaration of trust made by the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 and dated the 24th day of March 1975 relates shall, if applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, be deemed, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, to be income derived by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu in trust for charitable purposes. It is the Commissioner’s view that, notwithstanding the fact that the Trust Board has been dissolved and no longer exists, section 30(1)(c) provides that any income derived from property that was subject to the original declaration, to the extent that it is applied for the pur- poses specified in the declaration, shall be treated for tax purposes as being derived in trust for charitable pur- poses. This means that the income of the trust created under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act will continue to be exempt for tax purposes. Similar provisions may apply to other section 24B trusts established by Trust Boards that have since been dis- solved. Application of this Ruling Section 91DA(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the Commissioner to state the period for which a public binding ruling applies. The Commissioner has determined that this public ruling will apply to income derived by approved trusts during income years falling within the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2001, inclusive. Examples Example 1 A Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. The declaration provides that the trust will hold certain assets upon trust for charitable pur- poses. The declaration specifies that the income of the trust will be applied by making grants to reim- burse any dental costs incurred by any of the beneficiaries, being members of the iwi. The declaration is submitted to the Commissioner who is satisfied that the purpose for which the trust’s income will be applied is a purpose specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act (section 24(2)(a)(iii) “The promotion of health ... by provid- ing, subsidising, or making grants for medical, nursing, or dental services”) and that there are adequate provisions in the Trust Deed to prevent the Trust’s income and assets from being used for other purposes. The Commissioner will therefore approve the declaration and the income of the trust will be exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. When a section 24B trust has previously obtained the approval of the Commissioner, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act, that approval will continue to apply. Approval given by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) cannot be revoked. However, continued tax exemption in respect of the income of the trust is dependent on the trust continuing to apply its income for the purposes specified in the declaration. Comments on technical submissions received When a draft public binding ruling on this subject was first made available for public comment, a number of submissions were received that disagreed with the views expressed in that draft ruling. In particular, those submissions noted that the Commissioner did not appear to have taken into account the use of a deeming provi- sion in section 24B. That view, that the deeming provi- sion effectively creates a charitable trust where one would not exist under general charitable law, has been incorporated into this ruling. A number of commentators also disagreed with the Court decision in Arawa and the general position of trusts for the benefit of iwi under the public benefit test. That issue has only been referred to in this commentary in so far as it is relevant to the issue being considered. Following requests for him to do so, the Commissioner intends to consider the position of such trusts generally as a separate matter, and it is likely that an interpretation statement on that issue will be prepared. That statement, when drafted, will be subject to consultation (and submissions will be sought on it) in the usual way. A submission was also received that argued that the Commissioner was not legally able to issue a binding ruling on the effect of a declaration made under a provision of an Act other than one of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner is of the view that he is able to issue this Ruling because it relates to the consequences of such a declaration under the income tax law and, in particular, to the application of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu asked for the ruling to be expanded to deal specifically with its specific circum- stances. The Ngai Tahu Trust Board executed a declara- tion of trust pursuant to section 24B in 1975. That Trust Board was dissolved by the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act 1996, which also established the Runanga. All of the assets and liabilities of the former trust board were vested in the new Runanga. Section 30(1)(c) of the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act provides: 30. Taxes and duties-(1) For the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts (as defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994) and any other enactment that imposes or provides for the collection of any tax, levy, or other charge,- (c)Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board by this Act, any income derived by Te from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 9 Example 2 A Maori Trust makes a declaration under section 24B for the same purpose as described in Exam- ple 1. The Commissioner is satisfied that the pur- pose for which the Trust’s income is to be applied is a purpose that is specified in either section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act. However, it is found that the declaration does not prohibit the trustees from materially influencing the amount of remuneration that they receive. The declaration also does not provide for the disburse- ment of assets, upon winding up, to other charitable entities or purposes. The Commissioner will therefore decline approval until such time as the declaration is amended in such a manner to satisfy the Commissioner’s require- ments. Tower SuperPlus Income Fund Product Ruling – BR Prd 97/65 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, unless otherwise stated. Taxation Law This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 3 (5), JB 3, and the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies All defined terms have the meanings set out in the SuperPlus Income Fund Trust Deed and Rules dated 2 November 1992. The Arrangement relates to a superannuation scheme entitled “Tower SuperPlus Income Fund” (“SuperPlus Fund”). The SuperPlus Fund was established by Tower Trust Services Limited by trust deed dated 2 November 1992. The SuperPlus Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannua- tion Schemes Act 1989. The SuperPlus Fund is established for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for Members of the SuperPlus Fund. The SuperPlus Fund comprises all Assets held by the Trustee of the SuperPlus Fund upon the trusts of the Deed dated 2 November 1992, including income arising therefrom. Contributions made by Members of the SuperPlus Fund are allocated to the SuperPlus Fund. At the time of investment, each Member is allocated a number of Units. The number of Units allocated represents the interest each Member has in the SuperPlus Fund. The value of the Units (and therefore the Unit Price) rises and falls depending on market conditions and earnings’ performance. Members can receive payments from the SuperPlus Fund by either: •cancelling all or any of the Units a Member holds in the SuperPlus Fund and receiving a Benefit which reflects the Unit Price at the time less any amount deducted by the Trustee; or •the Trustee, at its discretion, allocating any part of the Distributable Income to Members at the end of the Distribution Period. Other aspects relating to the operation of the Superplus Fund are contained in the Deed dated 2 November 1992. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 10 Notice of withdrawal of Product Ruling 1.This is a notice of a withdrawal of a product ruling made under section 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.Product ruling 97/64 is hereby withdrawn, due to a numerical typographical error and so that the opera- tion of the arrangement is able to be clarified in a replacement ruling. It is replaced by Product Ruling 97/67. 3.Product ruling 97/64 originally applied to a share option scheme for the period 5 August 1997 to 1 April 2004, and notice of its making appears in the New Zealand Gazette of 14 August 1997. 4. Product ruling 97/64 is withdrawn on and from 14 August 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling assumes that Unit Withdrawals and allocation of Distributable Income are made in accordance with the Deed of the SuperPlus Fund dated 2 November 1992. This Ruling also assumes that: •Unit Withdrawals made by a Member are not made at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period at three-monthly intervals. This assumption means that a Member cannot rely on this Ruling if the Member makes Unit Withdrawals at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve- month period at three-monthly intervals. •The allocation of Distributable Income by the Trustee is not made at a fre- quency greater than four times in any twelve-month period at three-monthly intervals. This assumption means that a Member cannot rely on this Ruling if the Trustee has allocated Distributable Income at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period at three-monthly intervals. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement In terms of the arrangement and assumptions set out above: •The SuperPlus Fund is a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1. •Distributions to Members of the SuperPlus Fund are not gross income by virtue of section HH 3 (5). •For the purposes of calculating “other income” under section JB 3 (1), distribu- tions to Members of the SuperPlus Fund on account of Unit Withdrawals and Distributable Income are not received in the form of a pension, and are not received in the form of an annuity. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies from the commencement of the 1997/98 income year to 27 March 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7th day of August 1997. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 11 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Rev- enue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess tax- payers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Ostriches and emus – valuation for income tax purposes This interpretation statement outlines the various valuation options available to taxpayers who farm ostriches and/or emus. It focuses on the cost price valuation option, and suggests a self-assessed cost price valuation method for ostriches and emus on hand at the end of an income year. The self-assessed cost price valuation method is a guideline only; taxpayers can adopt any other method that leads to an appropriate allocation of cost. Introduction All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Ostriches and emus are livestock and come within the definition of “non-specified livestock” in section OB 1. Under section EL 9 (1), the value of any non-specified livestock to be taken into account at the end of the income year shall be any of the following, at the taxpay- er’s option: •its cost price •its market value •the price at which it can be replaced •its standard value, if the Commissioner concurs. Only non-specified livestock that is “trading stock” must be taken into account at the end of the income year. (See section EE 1 which contains the rules for the valuation of trading stock.) It is clear that all livestock is “trading stock” for the purposes of section EE 1, and therefore all ostriches and emus, regardless of the purpose for which they were purchased, must be taken into account at the end of the income year and valued using one of the options con- tained in section EL 9 (1). “Livestock” is not defined in the Act. It is necessary to consider the ordinary meaning of the word. “Livestock” is often used in contradistinction with “deadstock”. The Court in Wardhaugh (AF) Ltd v Mace \[1952\] 2 All ER 28 at 31, stated that: “Livestock” generally means live animals. If the live and dead stock on a farm are advertised for sale, everybody knows what that means. The dead stock are the implements, the livestock are the animals on the farm. In Land Projects Limited v C of IR \[1964\] NZLR 723, Barrowclough CJ said: I think that \[livestock\] must mean all animals. Probably, though I need not now decide, it would include all fowls, bees, fish, silkworms and anything else which can be described as livestock and which are assets of the business. Nothing in the ordinary meaning of “livestock” suggests that animals must be purchased for the purpose of resale in order to constitute livestock. All ostriches and emus are therefore livestock. “Trading stock” is defined for the purposes of section EE 1 in section OB 1. The definition includes livestock. Therefore, on a strictly literal interpretation all livestock are trading stock. A number of New Zealand and Australian cases have specifically addressed the issue of livestock as trading stock. In particular, a number of the cases refer to the fact that the definition of trading stock includes things not ordinarily regarded as trading stock, e.g. breeding stock (which is usually considered to be a capital asset). In Land Projects Limited, the issue was whether profits from the sale of livestock resulted from a sale or disposal of trading stock, and were therefore properly taken into account under section 98 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. \[Section 98(1) provided that “for the purposes of this section the term “trading stock” includes anything produced or manufactured, and anything acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale, or ex- change; and also includes livestock; but does not include land”.\] The Commissioner argued that under section 98(1) all the livestock sold was included in the expression “trading stock”. Barrowclough CJ held that: It \[the Legislature\] declares that the expression “trading stock”, for the purposes of s. 98 and only those purposes, includes livestock. I think that must mean all live animals...With respect, I adopt the language of Dixon and Fullagar JJ. in Wade’s case and say that our New Zealand Act places all animals in the category of trading stock but only of course for the purposes of s.98. Land Projects Limited was followed in Case B15 (1975) 2 NZTC 60,112 and Case J30 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,176. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 12 ery (not affixed to land) for his own indefinite use as part of his own operational business structure. The taxpayer will recognise some possibility, or even a high likelihood, at some day in the future such machinery may be sold, but there is no present intention to sell. The machinery certainly would be “produced or manufactured”, but few would argue such sensibly could be regarded as “trading stock”. It is fixed, not circulating, capital...Did Parliament intend such items be treated as trading stock? A commonsense approach is required, guided by the purposes of the section. Section 85(1)(a), despite literal content, and a seeming contrast with adjacent s 85(2)(b), inevitably imports a concept of accompanying purpose that items be within inventory. I am unable to accept the objectors’ submissions based on s 85(1)(a). These showhomes cannot be regarded as “trading stock” simply because they were “pro- duced or manufactured”, and without further inquiry. There must also be sufficient accompanying purpose to sell in the ordinary course of trade. However, the better view is that all livestock are trading stock. Horizon Homes was decided in relation to a different limb of the definition of “trading stock”. The New Zealand and Australian courts have specifically considered whether all livestock are trading stock and have acknowledged that the inclusion of some livestock (e.g. breeding animals) in the definition of trading stock is artificial. However, the courts have interpreted “trading stock” as including all livestock. This interpre- tation has not been regarded by the courts as leading to a manifest absurdity which would justify departing from the literal interpretation of the definition. Options As it is clear that all livestock are “trading stock” for the purposes of section EE 1, all ostriches and emus, regardless of the purpose for which they were purchased, must be taken into account at the end of the income year and valued using one of the options contained in section EL 9 (1). Cost price Taxpayers can value their ostriches and emus at cost price. Certain taxpayers are not allowed to value specified livestock at cost price, i.e. bailors, lessors, and non- farming parties to a sharefarming agreement unless it is agreed that cost price is calculated by the owner of the livestock as if no sharefarming agreement existed. Because the Act does not prohibit such taxpayers from valuing non-specified livestock at cost price, the cost price option is available to all taxpayers. A suggested method for establishing the cost price of producing ostriches and emus is set out in detail later in this statement. Market value and replacement price The valuation options of market value and replacement price are sufficiently similar in nature to be discussed together. A number of Australian cases have considered the meaning of “livestock” in the context of the Australian definition of “trading stock”. “Trading stock” is defined in section 6(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. “Trading stock” includes livestock. Unlike in New Zealand, “livestock” is a defined term. It excludes only beasts of burden and working beasts in businesses other than primary produc- tion. In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105, the Court considered whether the definition of “trading stock” referred to all livestock including breeding stock. Dixon and Fullagar JJ stated that: The definition of ‘trading stock’, as has already been men- tioned, brings ‘live stock’ within sec 36(1). There is a defini- tion of live stock which, by inference, makes it clear that all animals are to be included in the case of a business of primary production. In Riddle v Federal Commissioner of Taxes (1952) 5 A.I.T.R 225, the issue was whether the racehorse was trading stock. The Court held that the racehorse was a “working beast”, and therefore did not fall within the definition of “livestock”. However, dicta in the case make it clear that the racehorse was excluded from the definition of “trading stock” because it was a working beast (and therefore not “livestock”), not because the racehorse was purchased or acquired for sale. In Case C20 (1971) 71 A.T.C. 91, the Board of Review considered whether a stud bull was trading stock. The Board recognised that treating a stud bull as trading stock was artificial, but by virtue of the statutory defini- tion the bull was trading stock and was accounted for as such. It may be argued that the decision of the High Court in Horizon Homes Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,064 is support for the proposition that livestock cannot be regarded as trading stock, unless there is a sufficient accompanying purpose of selling the livestock in the ordinary course of trade. In Horizon Homes, the taxpayer was in the business of constructing houses. It erected a number of show homes, which were later available for sale by removal. The taxpayer’s policy was to sell off show homes after two years. The taxpayer treated the unsold show homes as trading stock for the purposes of section 85 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section EE 1). The Commis- sioner considered that the show homes had been incor- rectly treated as trading stock. The Court held that the show homes were not trading stock. The dominant purpose of erecting the show homes was for use as a marketing tool, not for sale. The Court recognised that on a strictly literal interpretation the show homes were items “produced or manufactured”, and therefore were within the definition of trading stock. However, McGechan J at page 11,068 stated that: There is a severe problem with any such literal approach. It leads to manifest absurdity. A taxpayer may construct machin- from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 13 Market value is a concept which appears throughout the Act. It is regarded as the current selling value in the relevant taxpayer’s own selling market. In Australasian Jam Co Pty Ltd v F.C. of T. (1953) 10 A.T.D. 217, Fullagar J said: But it is not to be supposed that the expression ‘market selling value’ contemplates a sale on the most disadvantageous terms conceivable. It contemplates, in my opinion, a sale or sales in the ordinary course of the company’s business – such sales as are in fact effected. Such expression in such provisions must always be interpreted in a common sense way with due regard to business realities... For example, a taxpayer who sells birds to other breeders cannot use the slaughter value of the birds as market value. In the course of the taxpayer’s business the breeder market, not the slaughter market, is the taxpay- er’s relevant selling market. Replacement price is a factual option. The replacement price is the current price at balance date when immediate replacement is possible. Nothing in the legislation requires taxpayers to have their non-specified livestock valued by a recognised livestock valuer. However, when a taxpayer uses market value or replacement price the taxpayer must be able to substantiate the value used. Standard value The Commissioner has not determined a standard value for ostriches or emus. It is likely that any standard value set would be based on average market value. This would be set close to market value to avoid unduly high or low figures being set. Inventory groupings Birds generally reach physical maturity (and slaughter age) by the end of their second year. Therefore, there will be two main inventory groupings for birds on hand at the end of the income year (similar to those for most specified livestock). Bird age atInventory balance dategroupings Zero to one yearRising one year Opening rising one year,Rising two year plus all birds purchasedand older birds which at the end of that(mature birds) income year would be over one year of age In addition, if the farmer decides to value eggs sepa- rately another inventory group will be required for any eggs on hand at the end of the income year. \[A full discussion of the valuation of eggs is contained immedi- ately below.\] A strict legal interpretation of the trading stock valuation rules for non-specified livestock (section EL 9) requires taxpayers who elect one valuation option to use that option to value all classes (age groupings) of birds as well as any other non-specified livestock on hand at balance date. Under this strict interpretation owners cannot use different valuation options to value different types of non-specified livestock or different inventory age groupings of non-specified livestock. (Refer TRA Case J30 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,176). In Case J30 it was decided that section 98(4) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (now section EE 1 (3) of the 1994 Act) requires taxpayers to value all the livestock of the taxpayer under the same valuation option. It is not possible to use different options for different lines of trading stock. The wording of section EL 9 (1), which governs the valuation of non-specified livestock, is similar to that used in EE 1 (3) and it is considered that the same rules apply, i.e. only one option is available to value all of the non-specified livestock. However, it has been the Commissioner’s long-standing practice to allow different lines of trading stock to be valued under different valuation options – see PIB 164 (August 1987). In view of this practice, and the pending legislative changes proposed in the recently-released discussion document “Trading Stock Tax Rules”, owners of birds will be able to value the different age groupings under the different valuation options of cost (as ex- plained in these guidelines), market value, or replace- ment price. End of year valuation of eggs A unique factor of these industries is that there will be artificially incubated eggs on hand at the end of the income year. A problem arises as to how these eggs should be valued. Eggs on hand at the end of the income year have to be valued using one of the options contained in section EL 9 (1) only if the eggs are non-specified livestock. As discussed in the introduction to this statement, “live- stock” is not defined in the Act. Although it is clear that animals are livestock, there is some debate about what constitutes an “animal”. It is not clear whether an ostrich or emu egg is an “animal”. On the basis that eggs are not “livestock”, the correct legal position appears to be that only eggs on hand at the end of the income year which are intended for sale will meet the definition of “trading stock”, i.e. “anything produced or manufactured” or “anything acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale, or ex- change”. Eggs produced or acquired for the purpose of resale are “trading stock” and have to be valued under section EE 1 (3) at cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. Eggs not intended for resale do not meet the definition of “trading stock” and do not need to be valued at the end of the income year. However, ostrich and emu farmers may value eggs on hand, whether intended for sale or not, if they so wish. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 14 •all outward freight from the farm, and all inward freight of livestock other than ostriches or emus, or inward freight relating to non-livestock enterprises •deductible share of car expenses •accounting and legal fees, consultancy fees, rates, and general farm (non-livestock) insurance •interest and rent •all livestock purchase costs including ostriches, emus, and eggs. These are treated separately within the cost of production formulae. •imputed costs of labour or livestock depreciation (the latter being specifically disallowed as a cost for ostriches and emus) The livestock owner may apportion the cost of wages, salary, or management fees paid (which are tax deduct- ible) over all enterprises/activities in the farming opera- tion on a fair and reasonable basis. This applies regard- less of whether the payment is made to an individual, a partner, a shareholder-employee, or anyone else. These expenses could be apportioned on the following activi- ties: •activities excluded from BEC, such as accounting and administration •other farm enterprises, such as forestry and cropping •specified livestock production •non-specified livestock production, e.g. ostriches or emus. Note that a dual product multiplier is not included. Dual product multipliers are used in preparing costs of production for specified livestock. These multipliers remove a portion of the costs allocated to a livestock group to account for the cost of producing secondary or dual products. For example, the dual product multiplier for sheep is 0.8, thus removing 20% of the costs associ- ated with wool production rather than growing livestock. A dual product multiplier for ostriches or emus is not included as the dual product (feathers) is generally harvested at slaughter. Under steps 1 and 2, the total deductible farm costs have been reduced by the allowable exclusions in order to determine the BEC relating to the ostriches and emus. The next step in the costing process is to assign those costs specifically relating to a bird type or inventory age grouping. Step 3: Assign BEC to inventory groups Assign the BEC to the rising one year or rising two year inventory groups. Specific cost allocations between age groups are suggested below. Other appropriate alloca- tions that the taxpayer can substantiate are allowed. (a)Rising one year grouping: •repairs and maintenance and depreciation on paddock buildings, incubators and hatcheries, and any other buildings or plant and equipment However, the question of valuing eggs on hand at the end of any income year is largely academic. Most ostrich and emu eggs will be hatched by March or June. There should be very few eggs on hand at the end of the income year for a 30 June or later balance date (30 June being the common balance date for farmers). Suggested guidelines for using cost price as a valuation option This part outlines a suggested method for a self-assessed cost price valuation for ostriches and emus on hand at the end of an income year. It is based on the self- assessed cost method for specified livestock detailed in the Appendix to Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Four, No. 7, (March 1993). Certain departures from this method occur due to the unique nature of farming birds. The method is a guideline only – taxpayers can adopt any other method that leads to an appropriate allocation of cost. The suggested method covers both ostriches and emus. If both types of bird are farmed on the same property, the two types should be treated as separate enterprises and the costs allocated between them. Step 1: Establish deductible farm costs List all deductible costs incurred in running the farm. Defining the costs to be included in the costing of birds on hand at the end of an income year is important. Taxpayers can include all deductible costs incurred, but may exclude certain categories of cost relating to the running of the business or enterprises other than the production of ostriches or emus. Step 2: Identify direct bird enterprise costs Identify the direct costs relating to ostriches and emus (the bird enterprise costs), including the purchase cost of birds and eggs which have hatched at balance date. Calculate the bird enterprise costs (BEC) by excluding the following expenses from the total deductible farm costs: •all direct costs relating to any enterprise other than ostrich and emu production when these costs can be identified or estimated on a fair and reasonable basis •all costs of harvesting any products in any way, e.g. feathers from ostriches or emus, as these are not associated with producing and growing immature birds •repairs, maintenance, and depreciation of all farm buildings, except those specifically used by the ostrich or emu enterprises (which would include ostrich and emu related paddock sheds, quarantine facilities, and hatcheries) •repairs, maintenance, and depreciation on plant and equipment used in producing secondary (dual) live- stock products or non-livestock enterprises, e.g. cropping from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 15 specifically used in the production of rising one year birds •specific costs of incubation and early rearing facilities (or contracts to outside organisations for these activities) •inward freight of eggs and live birds which would be valued (if on hand) at the end of the income year in the rising one year group •all identifiable costs associated with breeding birds, including vet and bird health, and all feedstuffs (including freight) other than that fed to non-breeding rising two year olds and older •fencing associated with breeding areas. (b)Rising two year and older grouping: •inward freight of live birds classified in this group •any direct costs including feedstuffs (plus freight), and vet and animal health costs identifi- able as being incurred by this group or which are the residual of total costs after allocation to the rising one year bird group •bird fencing not associated with (a) above. Step 4: Identify BEC not assigned to inventory groups or other enterprises Identify the BEC that have not been assigned to rising one year or rising two year inventory groups, or to any other farm enterprise (“remaining bird enterprise costs”) Total farm tax deductible costs minus exclusions from costs equal bird enterprise costs. Bird enterprise costs minus costs specifically assigned equal remaining bird enterprise costs. Step 5: Calculate proportion of farm used in producing ostriches and emus To allocate the remaining bird enterprise costs between the bird enterprises and other enterprises on the farm (e.g. sheep and cattle), you need to calculate the total area involved in producing ostriches and emus, and convert this to a proportion of the total farm holding. Step 6: Apportion remaining BEC based on proportional area calculation Only costs shared with other livestock enterprises are apportioned under this step (e.g. non-specific animal health, fertiliser, wages paid, and repairs and mainte- nance of a general nature). Allocate the remaining bird enterprise costs between enterprises on an area-related basis or any other fair and reasonable basis which can be substantiated, e.g. invoice documentation, a payment recording system, best estimate. Here the remaining bird enterprises costs have been allocated on an area-related basis. This approach as- sumes that the remaining bird enterprise costs are averaged over the total farm area. Allocation to birds=BECx a d In this formula: BEC=remaining BEC a=the area of the bird enterprise d=total farm area This calculation determines the share of remaining bird enterprise costs to be allocated to the bird enterprise. Step 7: Apportion remaining BEC between inventory groupings Apportion the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the bird enterprise between the rising one year and rising two year groupings on an area basis or any other fair and reasonable basis which can be substantiated. Here the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the bird enterprise are allocated between the inventory age groupings on an area basis reflecting the grazing demand of the age groupings and breeding stock. (a)Allocation to the rising one year group: Amount allocated = BEC x b a In this formula: BEC=remaining bird enterprise costs relating to the bird enterprise b=the ostrich or emu area used by the breed- ing stock, their offspring, and purchased birds which would be valued as rising one year of age if they were still on hand at the end of the income year a=the area of the bird enterprise (b) Allocation to the rising two year and older group: Amount allocated = BEC x c a In this formula: BEC=remaining bird enterprise costs relating to the bird enterprise. c=the ostrich or emu area used by the birds classified as rising one year stock at the end of the preceding income year, together with all birds purchased and which would be valued as rising two years or older if they were still on hand at the end of the income year. a=the area of the bird enterprise. If ostriches and emus are being run on the same farm, this calculation would be based on four inventory groupings, two inventories for each bird type. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 16 hand at the end of the preceding income year plus all purchases of birds which would be valued in the rising two year and older class if still on hand at the end of an income year. This is achieved through the following formula: Average cost/head = BEC + m + n + o p + q In this formula: BEC = the share of the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the rising one year group m =total closing value (cost) of the rising one year birds on hand at the end of the preceding income year n =specific costs allocated to this group o =the total purchase costs of birds purchased that would be valued in the rising two year and older group if still on hand at the end of the income year p =the closing number of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the preceding income year q =the total number of birds purchased that would be valued in the rising two year and older group if still on hand at the end of the income year Apply the average cost for each inventory group so calculated to the new intake of birds on hand at the end of the income year. If all birds in either inventory group are purchased during the year, i.e. none homebred or on hand as rising one year birds at opening, simply value these at their average purchase cost and don’t make the above calcula- tions. This will usually only occur in the start-up year. Step 9: Apply average cost to new intake on hand at year end in each grouping Apply the average cost per head for the rising one year group to all rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year. Any change between the opening and closing valuation in the income year is assessable for income tax purposes. Step 10: Valuing multi-age bird groups For the rising two year and older grouping, an inventory system for multi-aged bird groups will be required unless individual recording and tracing is undertaken. This may be accomplished using the FIFO or Average Cost Inventory System currently used for specified livestock. For the rising two year and older group, the allocation of average cost is a little more difficult. This is because this group will contain birds of various ages, possibly over a range from 2 to 30 years. Each will have an associated historical cost relating to the year in which it reached maturity. If individual bird recording is practised, then no complexities will arise. New birds will enter with Step 8: Calculate average cost per head for each inventory grouping Calculate the average cost per head by dividing the bird enterprise costs plus costs of bird (and egg) purchases allocated to each inventory grouping (plus the opening inventory value in the case of rising two year and older group) by the total number of birds in each grouping passing through the enterprise in that year. Make a separate calculation for each age grouping. (a)Rising one year age group: Calculate average cost by dividing all costs including purchase cost allocated to this group by the number of rising one year stock which passed through the enter- prise during the year. For the rising one year group, this number is the closing number of birds on hand in that group plus all sales of birds which would have been valued as rising one year of age if still on hand at the end of the income year. \[Note that purchases are not included in this formula. Adding together closing rising one years on hand plus sales of that age group automatically calculates the total number of live birds passing through the farm. Any purchases will already be included as either birds on hand or birds sold. To include both purchases and sales in the formula would result in counting birds twice.\] This calculation is represented by the following formula: Average cost/head = BEC + f + g + w + y h + j In this formula: BEC =the share of the remaining bird enterprise costs allocated to the rising one year group f =specific costs allocated to this group g =the total purchase costs of birds purchased where the birds would be valued in the rising one year group if still on hand at the end of the income year w =total closing cost of eggs on hand (if any) at the end of the preceding income year y =total cost of eggs purchased during the year that have hatched by the end of the income year h =the closing number of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year j =the total number of birds sold that would be valued in the rising one year group if still on hand at the end of the income year (b)Rising two year and older group: This average cost increases the average valuation of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the previous income year by the average costs allocated to the rising two year and older age grouping (including purchase costs) during the income year. For the rising two year and older group, the number of rising one year birds on from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 17 current year average cost, and any deaths or sales of older birds will have a deduction from the total book value of birds on hand at their historical cost. Any net change between the opening and closing values for the income year will be assessable for income tax purposes. If individual bird recording is not practised for the mature group, an inventory system of some description will be needed. The FIFO system is the most likely to be used as it will allow a faster phasing out (larger deduc- tion) for the very high cost birds originally purchased as these are progressively replaced by lower costing stock (either at purchase or homebred as the industry ex- pands). The Average Cost Inventory System is an alternative system, and is the method most commonly used for specified livestock enterprises. This method allows sales and deaths to reduce book values at last year’s average cost, and the new intake of birds (e.g. replacements) to be brought in at this year’s calculated cost per head. A new average over all the closing birds on hand is then calculated for the year. Details of this system, together with examples are contained in the Appendix to Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Four, No 7, (March 1993) for specified livestock. Under either of these inventory systems, any difference in the total opening and closing values for the income year is assessable for income tax purposes. Example of ostrich costing Calculation of average cost This example sets out a suggested calculation of the costs of production for an ostrich enterprise. The analysis is for example purposes only and does not reflect the financial viability of the current or future ostrich industry, or the actual valuation at cost of birds in any real enterprise. Table 1 provides the necessary physical information about the farm. It considers a small farm of 60 hectares, of which only 9 hectares are used for ostrich farming. The ostrich enterprise is increasing in numbers over the year as well as selling both young and older stock. Eggs are also purchased and sold. Table 2 calculates the bird enterprise costs (other than bird and egg purchases) for each inventory grouping. The costs incurred in running the farm are identified. The bird enterprise costs are identified and assigned to the bird inventory groups and other farm enterprises. The remaining bird enterprise costs are shared on either an area related basis or a fair and reasonable estimate. In this example the allocation between the bird enter- prise and the rest of the farm is mainly made on an area basis (of 15% or 0.15 allocated to the birds), but a fair and reasonable basis has been used in the case of the ‘Animal Health General’ category. (However, we note that taxpayers may be able to identify actual costs.) Table 3 summarises the calculation of average costs per head. The average cost per head for the rising one year group is $1,624. The average cost per head for the rising two year and older group is $19,317. In the case of the rising two and older group, the large difference in value (from the rising one year olds) occurs because of the much higher opening value of rising one year olds ($12,000 per head), and the purchase of rising two year and older birds at an average cost of $40,000 per head. Farming policy This enterprise is part of a larger farm. It breeds its own replacements, sells some chicks at 4 months, and rears others for sale at 18 months. It keeps the rest to increase breeding numbers. This operation is in its second year after initial purchase of the birds.

In the case of rising one year birds, the inventory value would change to: Opening value (cost): 30 rising 1 year birds @ $12,000/head$360,000 Closing value (cost): 40 rising 1 year birds @ $1,624/head$ 64,960 Change in assessable value of birds on hand($295,040)(deduction) This results in a reduction (tax deductible) of the value of rising one year birds on hand at the end of the income year of approximately $295,000, despite an increase in numbers of 33%. This arises as a result of much lower homebreeding costs compared to initial purchase costs in the previous year. The rising two year and older valuation also changes significantly. On the basis that four of the breeding ostriches are sold, and an increase in total numbers over the year from 16 to 22 occurs, the following inventory adjustments could occur: (a)Individual tracing On the basis that the four birds sold were all hens, their sale would reduce the book value by $240,000, and their replacement and increase (numbering ten) which were purchased at $40,000 per head would increase the value of birds on hand by $400,000. In summary form: Total opening value (cost)$880,000 Less four sold/dead @ $60,000- $240,000 $640,000 Plus intake of 10 this year @ $40,000+ $400,000 Total closing value (cost)$1,040,000 Assessable change in value+ $160,000 (b)FIFO inventory Using an FIFO inventory system, the outgoing birds would be valued at their average opening value of $55,000. The intake for the year (ten in number) would come in at their average cost for the year of $19,317. In summary: Total opening value (cost)$880,000 Less four sold at FIFO value (cost) $55,000- $220,000 $660,000 Plus intake of 10 this year @ $19,317$193,170 Total closing value (cost)$853,170 Assessable change in value($26,830)(deduction) Under the FIFO system, the sale of mature birds in subsequent years would continue to reduce book values by the average $55,000 per head until all original 16 birds are disposed of. The next sales would be accounted for at $19,317 until they are also disposed of, after which the next oldest cost would apply. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 20 Choice of inventory system As seen, the choice of inventory system may have significant income tax implications. Taxpayers can change between inventory systems without notice, but if they are going to adopt the ‘cost of production’ valua- tion option, it is essential that they take advice at the outset of developing an ostrich or emu enterprise. Movement between options The rules for movement between options are those that apply to other industries, i.e. free movement between cost price to market value or replacement price. Fencing costs The cost of ostrich farm fencing is high. Birds are run in pairs or trios in separate paddocks of about 0.25 hec- tares. Fences are similar to deer fences, and represent a high cost at the time of farm set-up or enterprise expan- sion. There has been some debate over whether fencing costs should be included in the calculation of a cost price for ostriches and emus. If so, there is the question of whether the total costs should be factored into the cost calculation in the year incurred or be spread over a number of years. Fences are an essential factor in the management of birds because breeding pairs and offspring need separa- tion, so fencing costs are part of the “plant” of an ostrich farm. Depreciation of plant associated with the produc- tion or manufacture of trading stock should be factored into the cost of production of trading stock – see Phillip Morris Ltd v FC of T \[1979\] ATC 4,352. Also, The New Zealand Society of Accountants’ (now ICANZ) Mem- bers Handbook (Financial Reporting Standards) FRS-4 and Inland Revenue’s Public Information Bulletin No. 82 (December 1974) both require fixed production overheads such as depreciation on factory plant and equipment to be absorbed into the cost of trading stock. The cost of fencing must be included in the cost calcula- tion for ostriches and emus. It has also been suggested that because section DO 3 allows taxpayers carrying on a farming or agricultural business to claim the full cost of fencing in the year incurred, the full costs should be factored into the cost of livestock produced in the same year. The section DO 3 deduction is a concession available only to farmers and is similar to the “incentive” provisions for development expenditure available some years ago. In Greive v C of IR \[1984\] 6 NZTC 61,682, Richardson J adopted the view that, in determining the meaning of “pecuniary profit” any incentive deductions or allowances should be ignored. At 61,682 he said: Such a profit cannot sensibly be equated with the profit for tax purposes which depends on the shifting sands of almost endless amendments to the incentive provisions in the legisla- tion. By inference, the same approach is applicable in deter- mining the cost price of livestock for income tax pur- poses. Incentive deductions should be ignored. Therefore, the cost of fencing should be spread over the expected life of the fencing in similar fashion to other items of depreciable plant or equipment used in the production of trading stock. If it were not for section DO 3, farmers would be required to write-off the cost of fencing at the rate of 10% annually as provided for in section DO 4. This seems to be the most appropriate rate of spreading fencing costs as it aligns with the income tax deductions that are available to farmers other than the current year deduction in terms of section DO 3. Fencing costs must be factored into the costs of produc- ing ostriches and emus at the rate that would be available as deductions under section DO 4. High priced scheme The valuation of specified livestock includes a high priced scheme incorporating a straight-line depreciation (c)Average inventory system Using an average inventory system, the four sold would go out of the books at last year’s average value (cost) of $55,000. The incoming ten would enter at their average value for the year ($19,317), and there would be a new average for the 22 birds of rising two years and older ($38,780 per head). In the following income year, mature birds disposed of would exit the accounts at the average value of $38,780, and a new average per head would be calculated for the end of the year. The average inventory system is summarised below: Total opening value (cost)$880,000 Less four sold at average value (cost) $55,000- $220,000 $660,000 Plus intake of 10 this year @ $19,317$193,170 Total closing value (cost)$853,170 Assessable change in value($26,830)(deduction) New average value per head$38,780 Note that this change in book value is the same as under the FIFO system. However, in subsequent income years it will not be, as the FIFO system will reduce book value at the rate of $55,000 per bird sold (until all of the original 16 are disposed of), and the average inventory system will reduce next year’s breeding bird sales by the average opening cost of $38,780 (and probably lower average values in subsequent income years). Other issues from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 21 rate over the expected breeding life of the animal. “High-priced livestock” is defined in section OB 1. As non-specified livestock is not high-priced livestock, ostriches and emus cannot be depreciated. Submissions received The subject matter of this interpretation statement was previously the subject matter of an issues paper (IP3151/IRRU IP 1) on the valuation of ostriches and emus for income tax purposes. We received a number of submissions from taxpayers on the issues paper and, as a result, an amended paper (IS 9702) was prepared and issued for comment in March/April/May 1997. Additional submissions were received, resulting in further consideration. In particular, the ability to value different classes (age groupings) under different valuation options was of concern to some commentators in the light of TRA Case J30. The Commissioner’s policy of allowing the valua- tion of trading stock on a line by line basis has been maintained despite the decision in Case J30. Therefore, we will continue to permit a line by line (or class by class) valuation of non-specified livestock, bearing in mind that the recently issued discussion paper “Trading Stock Tax Rules” proposes legislative change to allow a line by line valuation. A further issue was the inclusion of fencing costs in the cost price of producing ostriches and emus. The matter has been considered further and the guidelines amended to provide that the cost of fencing should be spread over a number of years. ACC Accredited Employer Programme This item confirms that payments made by accredited employers to meet the costs of employee work injury claims are not subject to fringe benefit tax. Introduction Section 105 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compen- sation Insurance Act 1992 (ARCI Act) allows employers to act as agents for the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation (ACC) for the purposes of managing claims and meeting the costs of claims for work injury. Administratively the process is referred to as the Accredited Employer Programme. A key component of the programme is the discounting of the employer’s employer premium liability. In recent times, some commentators have observed that a liability for fringe benefit tax (FBT) may arise on the payments made by the accredited employer. This view is based on the fact that ACC does not directly reimburse the employer as its agent, as would normally be ex- pected. The question then is whether the accredited employer is acting as agent for the Corporation or whether the employer is a principal and thus liable for such payments. Legislation Section ND 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the Act) imposes an FBT liability on an employer “who has provided or granted a fringe benefit to an employee”. Section CI 1 defines fringe benefit to mean- ..... (h)Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee.... being a benefit that is....enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee....and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee.... Discussion FBT applies to benefits provided or granted by an employer. The issue is whether the employer or ACC provides or grants a benefit. This depends in turn on whether in meeting the costs of an employee’s work injury, the accredited employer is acting as agent for ACC or as a principal. Ultimately, the issue turns on the arrangement between an accredited employer and the ACC. Inland Revenue’s view is that even though the arrangement between ACC and an accredited employer does not provide for the reimbursement of the agent’s expenses, the arrangement is still one of agency. A principal and agent may agree to exclude or limit any right of indemnity that would otherwise be implied in the absence of any such exclu- sion or limitation. If the parties expressly agree that there is to be no reimbursement of expenses, that does not make their relationship any less one of agency. As expressed in Halsbury 4th ed., vol1, para 807- “The relationship of principal and agent raises by implication a contract on the part of the principal to reimburse the agent in respect of all expenses, and to indemnify him against all liabilities, incurred in the reasonable performance of the agency, provided that such implication is not excluded by the express terms of the contract between them, and provided that such expenses and liabilities are in fact occasioned by his employment.” In the standard accreditation agreement, the express terms of the contract make it clear no reimbursement is required. Nonetheless the arrangement is still one of agency. Conclusion Reference to the standard accreditation agreement makes it clear that the employer is exercising functions on behalf of ACC. Even though there is no provision for direct reimbursement of employer’s costs, the agreement still constitutes an agency agreement as explained above. The programme provides for the employer’s premium to be discounted which clearly acknowledges the cost of payments the accredited employer may have to make in the event of an accident. If there is a benefit, it is provided by ACC, not by the employer. Inland Revenue therefore concludes that there is no fringe benefit and FBT does not apply. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 22 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Dispositions where the transferor reserves a benefit or advantage in real property – gift duty implications Section 70(2) – reservation of a benefit or advantage: The Commissioner issued public ruling BR Pub 96/1 on 23 January 1996 (see page 1, TIB Volume Seven, No. 8 – February 1996). The ruling relates to a situation where a taxpayer dis- poses of real property to another person or persons (often trustees of a family trust) and keeps or reserves a benefit or advantage in that property. The ruling concerns the potential application of section 70(2), which operates to prevent a reduction in the value of a dutiable gift when there is a disposition of property with a reservation of an interest in that property by the transferor. Very broadly speaking, the ruling states that if a taxpayer can legally grant an interest in the property to himself or herself, and then dispose of the remaining interests in the property to another person, there is no reservation of interest. On the other hand, if a taxpayer disposes of the property to another person and the other person then grants an interest back to the taxpayer, there is a reservation of interest. Once there is a reservation of interest, the provisions of section 70(2) may apply in the manner set out in the ruling. A taxpayer has asked whether public ruling BR Pub 96/1 applies to dispositions of all types of real property for the period of the ruling, or whether it is limited to dispositions of dwelling houses. The taxpayer notes that the part of the ruling entitled “Arrangements to which this ruling applies” states that it applies “when a taxpayer disposes of real prop- erty and keeps or reserves a benefit or advantage in that property”. However, she advises that certain seminar presenters have commented that the ruling only applies to dispositions of dwelling houses. In light of this uncertainty, she has written asking for clarification of the point. The ruling applies to dispositions of all types of real property for the period of the ruling and is not limited to dispositions of dwelling houses. Although the type of arrangement to which the ruling applies usually involves a disposition of a dwelling house, the ruling is not limited to these situations. Accordingly, we have advised the taxpayer that the ruling will apply to dispositions of real prop- erty other than dwelling houses, including, without limitation, dispositions of commercial buildings and farms. Gift duty exemption further clarified Section 75A(5) – relief from gift duty: In TIB Volume Nine, No. 6 (June 1997), we published an item on the gift duty exemption for certain court orders granted under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 23 That item stated that a disposition of property made directly to a spouse, former spouse, or for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage would qualify for the section 75A(5) gift duty exemption. In addition, a disposition to a fixed trust for (only) minor or dependent children would come within the section as being “solely for the benefit of those children”, and a disposition to a trust for (only) a spouse, former spouse, and/or minor or dependant would also qualify due to the words “to the extent that” in the section. The item also stated that the Commissioner did not accept that a disposition of property to a discretionary trust would be exempt, as the trustee would normally have discretion as to which, if any, of the beneficiaries were to benefit, and by how much. A taxpayer has asked for clarification as to whether or not the exemption applies when a court order provides for a disposition to a trust and the only beneficiaries are the three infant children of the marriage. The trustees in this case are given a discretion as between those three infant children, but cannot add further benefi- ciaries at any stage. As there is a closed class of beneficiary, limited to only minor or dependent children of the marriage, we consider that the disposition is solely for their benefit, and the exemption applies. Such dispositions to trusts will only gain the exemption from gift duty when: •the closed class of beneficiaries is limited to the spouse, former spouse, and/ or minor or dependent children of the marriage; and •there are no other possible beneficiaries named or described (including de- fault beneficiaries); and •no ability exists for the trustee to subsequently add further beneficiaries. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 24 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Double deduction not available under sections 85 and 104 Case:BASF New Zealand Limited v CIR Decision Date:23 July 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 85 and 104 Keywords:Double deduction Summary:The Court held that it is implicit in section 85 that opening stock of a business which is taken into account for the purposes of that section is not also subject to a deduction under section 104 in that income year. Facts:BASF New Zealand Limited (“BASF”), an importer and wholesale merchant, made an adjustment under the proviso to section 85(3) of all the trading stock acquired during its first year and treated these purchases as a double deduction in terms of sections 85(3) and 104 of the Act. Inland Revenue amended the as- sessment and the company subsequently objected to it. The objection was disallowed on the grounds that the purchases had been taken into account under section 104 and could not be deducted again under sec- tion 85. Inland Revenue later advised that the value of the purchases had been allowed in terms of section 85 and that no deduction was available under section 104. BASF requested a case stated to the High Court. A second amended assessment was sent stating that if the expenditure was deductible under section 104 no further deduction was available under section 85 and vice versa. Result:The Court held that it is implicit in section 85 that the opening stock of a business which is taken into account for the purposes of that section is not also subject to a deduction under section 104 in that income year. In respect of the purchase of opening stock, section 85 provides for a deduction whether the stock was purchased in the year in which the business commenced or in an earlier year. It is not however deductible under section 104 as the expenditure on that stock was incurred in the previous year and not in that income year. It is an amount brought forward from the previous year that has to be taken into account, and is taken into account under section 85 in order to reflect the result of the year’s trading. However, a deduction is allowable in the case of a continuing business. The Court held that there were no policy considerations for treating the same trading stock as attracting two deductions in the same year. As a result, the Court held that the second amended assessment achieved noth- ing and that it was unnecessary to consider the status of it. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 25 Lease inducement payment – assessability Case:Bruce James Wattie & Michael Gordon Lawrence v CIR Decision Date:31 July 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”) sections 65(1) & 65(2)(a) Keywords:Lease inducement Summary:The majority of the Court of Appeal held that a $5 million lease inducement payment to the Objectors was not assessable income under section 65(2)(a), and was not a form of rent subsidy. Facts:The Objector, a partner in Coopers and Lybrand, negotiated a “deed collateral” lease with the lessor, Pacific Tower Ltd whereby a cash inducement sum of $5 million was paid to the Objector as part of the leasing deal. In addition, the lessor made a contribution of $4.7 million to fitout the premises and provided a rental subsidy which reduced the rent to $20.90 per square foot over a period of six years. Decision:The Court of Appeal (“the Court”) held that the $5 million cash inducement was not assessable income under section 65(1) & (2)(a) of the Act and was not a form of rent subsidy. The Court held that the characterisation of a payment for tax purposes is to be made by examining the bargain made and recorded by the parties in its factual setting. Here, the documentation does not expressly categorise the payment of the $5 million. It does however describe the lessor’s monthly payments as a rent subsidy, thereby suggesting that the cash inducement is not. Instead, the $5 million is rather baldly called a cash inducement. The Court held that the Objector was right to categorise the cash inducement as a negative premium. It is a mirror image of the McKenzies decision where the payment by the lessee to obtain surrender of its lease was a capital item. The Court also expressed concern about the Myers decision. There, the Australian High Court was referring to a profit from an adventure in the nature of trade. The present case does not fit comfortably within that concept and should not be applied to the facts of this case. Also, the Australian decision of Cooling which held that a lease inducement is assessable income, should not be followed in New Zealand. Justice Thomas (dissent) held that the payment was revenue in nature therefore assessable income. On a closer analysis of the contractual arrangement, Justice Thomas held that commercial reality requires recognition of the fact that the payment induced the Objector to enter a lease containing an obligation to pay rent significantly higher than the market rent. The inducement payment is inex- tricably linked with the rent, the payment of which is a revenue obligation. Loan guarantee payments – deductibility Case:Louis Patrick McElwee v CIR Decision Date:15 July 1997 Act:Income Tax Act – sections 64B(1)(b), 64F(8) Keywords:Guarantor Summary:The Court held that the Commissioner correctly disallowed the deduction claimed in respect of the payments made by the Objector under the guarantee. continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 26 Facts:The Objector was involved in a coal mining business (which operated as a part- nership) and carried on its business “per medium” of a company called Tiller Mines Limited. (“Tiller Mines”) The company borrowed substantial sums of money from the ANZ Bank, which required various directors, including the Objector to provide personal guaran- tees. In 1987, the shares in Tiller Mines were sold to Starline Minerals Limited, but after a year the sale was cancelled and the shares reverted to the partnership. Tiller Mines could not meet its financial obligations and the bank turned to its rights under its guarantees. Decision:The Court held that the link between the Objector’s income and the payment was too remote to meet the “Sufficient Nexus test”. Also, if the Guarantor is not in the business of giving guarantees, these payments are regarded as capital in nature, and are therefore not assessable. Here, the objector was not in the business of giving guarantees, as the partnership which owned Tiller Mines earned income which was several steps removed from the income earning process to which this payment related. The Court also held that on a purposive application of section 64(1)(b), a guaran- tee given without valuable consideration does not fall within the general pur- view of the accruals regime. In terms of whether the Objector had the influence under section 64F(8) to effect the loss which was sustained, the Court found that the Objector had resigned his offices in the company and transferred his interests as a result of the sale of Tiller Mines to Starline before the default which caused his loss occurred. Conse- quently, during the critical times, the Objector lacked the required influence and could not have altered the course of events. Land subdivider – whether in business Case:TRA 92/15 Decision Date:16 July 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 (“The Act”) sections 67(4)(ba) and (c) Keyword:Subdivision Summary:The Authority held that the Objector was not in the business of developing land or subdivision and that the Commissioner could not rely on section 67(4)(c) of the Act. Facts:The Objector was a member of a partnership which purchased two residential properties. In mid 1978 these were commenced as a four flat cross-lease building project. By October 1978, the subdivision and building development work was underway. The Objector was also a member of a syndicate which purchased 4.5 acres of land on 2 titles. One title comprised of rural land and one of residential land. The syndicate intended to rezone the rural land as residential and subdivide it into residential sections. The residential land was eventually subdivided into 4 lots, and was eventually sold, as was the rural land. Decision:The Authority held that the Objector was not in the business of developing land or subdivision. Judge Barber found with regard to the partnership that it had no from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) 27 profit purpose from carrying on a business of developing or subdividing land. Similarly, he found with regard to the syndicate’s activities that it had no profit purpose from subdivision and that subdividing land into lots had been well completed with regard to the residential land and had failed with regard to the rural. The Authority found on the evidence that the Commissioner could not rely on section 67(4)(c) therefore he could not change the substance of his case against the Objector.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Superannuitant surcharge abolished Sections DB 1, MB 2B, NC 14, OB 6, OZ 1, subparts JB and NI, Income Tax Act 1994 Section 33A, Tax Administration Act 1994 The New Zealand superannuitant surcharge has been abolished from 1 April 1998. Background The New Zealand superannuitant surcharge, introduced in 1985, is a form of targeting which imposes a sur- charge of 25 cents in the dollar on a superannuitant’s “other income” above a certain threshold. From 1 April 1998, the surcharge is abolished. Key features Those sections and definitions of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 which provide for the imposition and collection of the sur- charge have been repealed. Provisional taxpayers may calculate their provisional tax based on their residual income tax, the amount remain- ing after making certain deductions from the total amount of income tax and New Zealand superannuitant surcharge payable. A transitional provision, section MB 2B, has been enacted which ensures that superannuitants who are provisional taxpayers and paying on a prior year basis do not effectively pay surcharge as part of their 1998/99 and 1999/2000 provisional tax payments. The taxpayer’s residual income tax used to calculate provisional tax for the 1998/99 and/or 1999/2000 income years is reduced by its superannuitant surcharge component. No legislative amendment has been made for provisional taxpayers who estimate their provisional tax liability, as they are able to take the surcharge abolition into account in their estimations. Application date The amendments take effect from 1 April 1998 for the 1998/99 and subsequent income years. Computer numerically controlled (CNC) wood turning machines – Depreciation Determination DEP28 In TIB Volume Nine, No. 7 (July 1997) at page 2, we published a draft general depreciation determination for computer numerically controlled (CNC) wood turning machines used for specialised wood turning operations in the timber and joinery industries. These machines are variously referred to as tooling machines or machine centres. No submissions were received on this draft and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP28: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination General Determination No.28”. The determination is based on as estimated useful life (EUL) as set out in the determina- tion and a residual value of 13.5%.

Interest repayments imposed as a result of early repayment of a financial arrangement – deductibility Public Ruling – BR Pub 97/9 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2 (1)(b), BD 4 (4), and EH 1-10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement involves the following facts: •A person places a sum of money on term deposit with a person or institution; •The deposit is a “financial arrangement” for the purposes of the “qualified accrual rules”; •A condition of the term deposit contract is that the rate of interest payable will be reduced in the event of the withdrawal, in part or in full, of the principal sum before the contractual maturity date; •The depositor withdraws the whole or part of the term deposit prior to the contractual maturity date; and •The application of the reduced rate of interest requires the actual repayment of interest already derived by the depositor, or the set-off of interest owed against the principal sum ultimately repaid to the depositor. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: Cash basis holders If the person making the deposit (“the holder”) is a cash basis holder: •A full withdrawal of the deposit by the holder leads to a cash base price adjustment (“cash BPA”) under section EH 4 (2). If the holder has to repay interest, the amount repaid will be taken into account under the cash BPA. No allowable deduction arises under general rules of deductibility, outside the qualified accruals rules, by virtue of section EH 8 (1). continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 6 •A partial withdrawal of the deposit by the holder does not lead to a cash BPA, because the deposit has not matured. If the holder has to repay interest the repaid amount will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b), providing that the partial withdrawal is to pay a business expense or if the holder incurs the amount in deriving other gross income. If the holder can make a deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b), no second deduction will arise under the cash BPA. If the amount repaid is not an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b), the repayment will not be taken into account until the deposit fully matures, by virtue of the cash BPA. Non-cash basis holders If the person making the deposit (“the holder”) is a non-cash basis holder: •A full withdrawal of the deposit by the holder leads to a base price adjust- ment (“BPA”) under section EH 4 (1). If the holder has to repay interest, the amount repaid will be taken into account under the BPA. No allowable de- duction arises under general rules of deductibility, outside the qualified accruals rules, by virtue of section EH 8 (1). •A partial withdrawal of the deposit by the holder does not lead to a BPA, because the deposit has not matured. However, Determination G25 applies to a partial withdrawal by a non-cash basis holder with the results set out in that Determination. Any repayment of interest will be taken account of in the calculation required by Determination G25. No allowable deduction arises under general rules of deductibility, outside the qualified accruals rules, by virtue of section EH 8 (1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 November 1997 to 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of August 1997 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/9 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/9 (“the Ruling”). Background The contract between lenders (“holders”) and borrowers (“issuers”) in respect of term deposits often includes a condition that early withdrawal of the principal sum will result in a reduced interest rate, calculated as from the date of deposit. In some cases, holders who withdraw funds early may have to repay part of any interest they have derived previously. An example illustrates this: Example 1 On 1 October 1996 Holder invests $10,000 for 12 months at 7%, interest to be credited to Holder’s nominated bank account six-monthly. On 1 May 1997 Holder wishes to withdraw $5,000, prior to maturity. On 31 March 1997 Holder had been credited with six-monthly interest of $350. $175 of the $350 interest related to the $5,000 to be with- drawn. On the $5,000 to be withdrawn, Holder is credited 5% interest for the period from 1 October to 1 May, which is $146. As Holder has already been credited with $175 in respect of the $5,000, she owes the bank $29. This will be deducted from the $5,000 so that she receives $4,971. from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 7 amount of principal to the holder. This does not alter the ultimate tax results of the transaction. Derivation of interest subject to repayment on early withdrawal The fact that a holder may have to repay interest if the deposit is withdrawn early does not mean that interest already received is not derived. At the time of receipt or crediting the holder has “earned” the relevant interest, and it is the holder’s to deal with as he or she wishes. The fact that a liability to repay may arise later, if certain events occur, does not alter the fact that derivation has occurred. Support for this proposition, in the context of salary that had to be repaid if an employment bond was breached, comes from Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062. Mr Bowcock was an employee of the Post Office, and while on study leave continued to receive full salary. He had agreed to repay certain amounts of salary if he left within four years of the end of his study leave. He did leave within that time and was required to repay salary in respect of two income years. He sought to deduct these sums from his income tax returns for the two years. In the High Court he claimed he had never derived the amounts because they were contingent receipts not absolute receipts. Vautier J rejected the taxpayer’s argument. At page 61,069 he said: Upon a consideration of the terms of the bond and the course pursued in this case, I am quite unable to come to the conclu- sion that the moneys which were paid to the objector during the two years in question can be said to have been received by him conditionally in the sense referred to in the judgments in the High Court in the Arthur Murray case. Those moneys clearly in my view became the absolute property of the objector when they were paid. No conditions or stipulations were attached to those payments themselves. They were clearly received and accepted as of right. Whether or not any liability arose in the future to repay any part of those moneys depended entirely on the course which the objector chose to take. The Bowcock principle supports the view that if a taxpayer is liable to repay an amount (e.g. for breaching a bond, or for the early withdrawal of funds), the repayment of the amount does not reconstitute the nature of the original derivation of funds from being absolute to being conditional. At the time the amount is received it is derived, as the recipient has done all that is necessary to earn the income. Vautier J distinguished Mr Bowcock’s circumstances from those of the taxpayer in Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314. There the taxpayer sold dancing lessons. The taxpayer would sell blocks of lessons with payment being made in advance. Although not a contractual obligation, the taxpayer would refund money to customers who did not wish to use all their pre-paid lessons. The taxpayer would transfer pre-paid lesson revenue to a suspense account, and amounts would be transferred from that suspense account to a trading account as the dancing lessons were taken. The This poses the question of how holders account for the repayment of the interest (in the example, $29) when they have already derived income in respect of the amount.

(b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i)incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpay- er’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii)allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part...E (Timing of Income and Deductions)... Section BD 4 (4) states: If an expenditure or loss gives rise to more than one allowable deduction, the allowable deductions may be allocated to income years to the extent that their total does not exceed the amount of that expenditure or loss. Section EH 8 (1) states: Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, gross income or expenditure in an income year in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accruals rules shall be calculated under those rules. Application of the Legislation Nature of the repayment of interest by a holder to the issuer For the purposes of the Ruling it is assumed that the legal nature of the repayment of interest from the holder of the term deposit to the issuer of the term deposit is that of a set-off. That is, there are two independent obligations that are set-off against each other. The issuer must repay the holder the principal amount of the deposit, and the holder must repay the issuer an amount of interest for early withdrawal. The issuer will set-off the holder’s obligation by deducting the repayable interest from the amount of the principal outstanding. However, for the purposes of the qualified accrual rules the transaction will be considered to be the payment of the full amount of principal by the issuer to the holder, and the repayment of the interest by the holder to the issuer. Later we consider the implications of there not being a set-off and the issuer simply paying a reduced continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 8 Australian High Court found that the amounts in the suspense account were not derived until the lessons were taken. At page 319 of the case the High Court said: ...But those circumstances nevertheless make it surely neces- sary, as a matter of good business sense, that the recipient should treat each amount of fees received but not yet earned as subject to the contingency that the whole or some part of it may have in effect to be paid back...For that reason it is not surprising to find...that according to established accounting and commercial principles in the community the books of a business either selling goods or providing services are so kept with respect to amounts received in advance of \[the provision of goods and services\] that the amounts are not entered to the credit of any revenue account until the sale takes place or the services are rendered... Arthur Murray concerns whether income has been derived in the first instance, and does not relate to the situation where the income has been derived but may have to be repaid. That second situation was covered in Bowcock, where the Court found that the possibility of repayment did not affect the derivation of the income. Accordingly, in the situation where a holder must repay some interest for the early withdrawal of a deposit, the Arthur Murray decision does not apply to mean deriva- tion has not occurred. Instead, the principles in Bowcock can be applied such that derivation has occurred in spite of the subsequent repayment. Cash basis holder: full withdrawal of term deposit If a cash basis holder fully withdraws a financial ar- rangement, there is a maturity for the purposes of the accrual rules. (“Maturity” is defined in section OB 1 to mean the date on which the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement is made.) Maturity of a financial arrangement triggers a cash BPA according to the section EH 4 (2) formula: a - (b + c) where- “a” is the sum of all consideration derived in respect of the financial arrangement by the person, and amounts remitted by the person; and “b” is the acquisition price of the financial arrangement; and “c” is the sum of all amounts that are gross income derived by the person, less the aggregate of amounts of expenditure deemed to be incurred under sections EH 1 and EH 6 or deemed to be an allowable deduction under section EH 3. A numerical example illustrates the effect of the cash BPA. Using the facts from Example 1 above, but assuming there is a full withdrawal of funds, gives the following result: Example 2 Holder was credited with $350 in interest on 31 March 1997. On 1 May she fully “breaks” the deposit. Recalculated interest for the period from 1 October to 1 May is $290. Holder has been overpaid $60, so the bank repays $9,940, i.e. it sets off from the $10,000 principal the $60 “overpaid” interest. For the cash BPA, item “a” is all the sum of all amounts derived in respect of the financial arrange- ment. This includes the $350 paid on 31 March 1997 and the $10,000 of principal which, because of the “set-off” analysis, the holder is deemed to have derived. Item “b” of the cash BPA is the “acquisition price” of the financial arrangement. “Acquisition price” is defined in section OB 1 by a formula (y – z) where “y” is the “core acquisition price” and “z” is, roughly speaking, fees. Ignoring fees for this example allows us to focus on just the “core acquisi- tion price”. “Core acquisition price” is defined in section OB 1. The relevant paragraph of the defini- tion here is paragraph (e). This provides that for a holder of a financial arrangement the core acquisi- tion price (CAP) is “the value of all consideration provided by the holder in relation to the financial arrangement”. The repayment of interest by a holder to an issuer involves the holder providing considera- tion to the issuer in relation to the financial arrange- ment. So too does the original provision of the deposit. So the acquisition price is made up of $60 repaid interest and $10,000 of principal. Item “c” of the cash BPA is the sum of all amounts that are gross income derived by the person less the aggregate of expenditure deemed to be incurred under sections EH 1 or EH 6, or deemed to be an allowable deduction under section EH 3. The amount of $350, being interest derived by the holder, is the gross income already derived by the holder in respect to the financial arrangement. Therefore, for the cash BPA, “a” is $10,350 ($10,000 + $350), “b” is $10,060, “c” is $350. This gives a result of: $10,350 - $10,410 ($10,060 + $350) = $-60 Even if there were no set-off, and the amount of repaid interest were merely deducted from the principal repaid, the answer would be the same. For the cash BPA, “a” would be $10,290 ($9,940 of principal + $350 of interest), “b” would be $10,000 (as there would be no payment from holder to issuer), and “c” would still be $350. This would give the same result as: $10,290 - $10,350 ($10,000 + $350) = $-60 Under section EH 4 (4)(b), when the amount so calcu- lated is a negative amount, it is deemed to be an allow- able deduction of the cash basis holder in the income year. The amount of the deduction under section EH 4 (4)(b) is the amount of “overpaid” interest. Under section EH 8 (1), gross income or expenditure in an income year in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 9 meet the requirement that the expenditure be incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. The leading case on the interpretation of a predecessor to section BD 2 (1)(b) is the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA). In that case Richardson J, in delivering the judgment of the court, made the following comments about section BD 2 (1)(b)(i): ...the expenditure must meet the statutory standards in relation to the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduc- tion. The deduction is available only where expenditure has the necessary relationship, both with the taxpayer concerned and with the gaining or producing of his assessable income. Relationship with the taxpayer is not, in itself, sufficient, as the prohibition of a deduction for capital expenditure...and private and domestic expenditure... makes clear. There must be the statutory nexus between the particular expenditure and the assessable income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction... The Court made it clear that the test of deductibility is applied at the time the expenditure is incurred. Further- more, at pages 61,241 to 61,242 His Honour continued: For reasons such as these it seems clear that the application of the first limb must involve an amalgam of considerations. In the Australian cases...there has been considerable stress on the character of an outgoing in the sense of its being incidental and relevant to the gaining or producing of the assessable income. Statements to that effect emphasise the relationship that must exist between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. They do not, and can not, specify in concrete terms the kind and degree of connection between the expenditure and the gaining or producing of assessable income required in individual cases for the expenditure to qualify for deduction....Dixon J said in Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FCT (1935) 54 CLR 295, at p 309 and we respectfully agree: “The expression ‘in gaining or producing’ has the force of ‘in the course of gaining or producing’ and looks rather to the scope of the operations or activities and the relevance thereto of the expenditure than to purpose in itself.” It then becomes a matter of degree, and so a question of fact, to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided, or sought to provide, on the one hand, and the income earning process, on the other, to fall within the words of the section. (Emphasis added.) Applying the principles of Banks requires asking whether there is a sufficient relationship between the repayment of interest and the earning of interest income to fall within section BD 2 (1)(b). There is not a suffi- cient relationship: the income is earned as a result of lending money. Expenditure incurred to earn that income may include brokerage or financial advice, but a repayment of interest on an early withdrawal can not be said to be a cost of deriving the interest. Incurring the repayment can not be said to assist in the deriving of the interest. The repayment is imposed after the income has been derived, not in respect of the derivation process but in respect of not completing the term of the deposit. The repayment is a cost of not fulfilling the terms of the contract between the bank and the depositor. accruals rules must be calculated under those rules. The deemed allowable deduction under section EH 4 (4)(b) is expenditure under the qualified accrual rules, meaning that section EH 8 (1) would operate to deny any deduction under the general deductibility provision, i.e. section BD 2 (1)(b). Cash basis holder: partial withdrawal of term deposit If the cash basis holder only partially withdraws the deposit, there is no maturity triggering a cash BPA as the last payment contingent on the deposit has not been made. (This assumes that the parties have contemplated that the principal may be repaid early, and the contract between them provides for that, irrespective of whether such a repayment would normally terminate a contract and require a new one to be created.) For a partial withdrawal there are two possibilities: any repayment of overpaid interest is taken into account on the cash BPA that occurs on the eventual maturity of the deposit, or there is a deduction under the general deduct- ibility provision section BD 2 (1)(b) prior to the cash BPA. Cash BPA If the holder’s repayment of interest does not satisfy the general test of deductibility, the expenditure will be taken into account at the time of the cash BPA. Adopting the facts in Example 1, and considering what occurs on maturity and the cash BPA, leads to the following result: Example 3 Holder was credited with $350 on 31 March 1997, but had to repay $29 at the time of partial with- drawal. On 30 September 1997 she receives interest of $175 (being her half-yearly interest on the remaining $5,000 at 7% interest), together with the return of the remaining principal of $5,000. Item “a” of the cash BPA is $10,525 (being the $10,000 principal returned plus $350 of interest derived on 31 March 1997, plus $175 of interest derived on 30 September 1997). Item “b” of the cash BPA is $10,029 (as explained in Example 2, this is made up of the original sum deposited plus the repaid interest). Item “c” is $525 (being all gross income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement, namely the interest derived on 31 March 1997 and 30 September 1997). The cash BPA formula gives the following result: $10,525 – $10,554 ($10,029 + $525) = $-29 The amount of the deduction under section EH 4 (4)(b) (the cash BPA) is the amount of “overpaid interest”. Section BD 2 (1)(b): General test of deductibility Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer will be an allowable deduction from gross income to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. Generally, however, any repayment of interest does not continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 10 Even if one focused on the purpose of breaking the investment, the repayment would still not be an allow- able deduction on general principles. If the partial realisation of the deposit was for private purposes (e.g. to buy a car for private use), the nexus with the deriving of gross income would not be satisfied. The expenditure would not be incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. Thus the repayment of the interest falls to be dealt with on maturity of the deposit through the cash BPA. However, if a cash basis holder breaks the investment to pay a business expense, or if the holder applies the amount to deriving other gross income, the repayment amount will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b). No double deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b) and the cash BPA If expenditure of a cash basis holder is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b), the expenditure will only be deductible under that section and not on the cash BPA. It may appear that a cash basis holder could potentially be entitled to a double deduction for the expenditure. In Example 3 above, the cash BPA gave a result that there was a deduction of $29 available to the holder. If the holder had already deducted $29 under section BD 2 (1)(b), there would be no change to the result under the cash BPA, even though the holder would already have had a credit for that expenditure. It might be argued that there is nothing in the cash BPA to reflect this previous allowable deduction. The problem is that item “c” of the cash BPA only takes account of expenditure incurred under sections EH 1 or EH 6, or deemed to be an allowable deduction under section EH 3. As subsections EH 1 (2) to (6) (the methods that spread income and expenditure under the accrual rules) do not apply to cash basis holders by virtue of section EH 1 (8), expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement is not incurred under section EH 1. Neither is the expenditure of the type referred to in sections EH 3 or EH 6. Accordingly, by not coming within item “c” of the cash BPA a second deduction of the repaid interest may appear to be possible. It is the Commissioner’s view that a double deduction would not be allowed in such cases because of either or both of the following reasons: •A court would read into item “c” of the cash BPA, a requirement to take account of amounts that had already been the subject of an allowable deduction; or •A court would apply section BD 4 (4) and the policy behind that section to deny a deduction. Item “c” of the cash BPA The first alternative is that in these circumstances a court may read item “c” of the cash BPA more widely than its literal meaning so that the previous allowed deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b) would be taken account of in item “c” of the cash BPA. This is in spite of item “c” referring only to expenditure under sections EH 1, EH 3, or EH 6. Looking at the definition of item “c” in the BPA formula in section EH 4 (1), it is clear that for a non-cash basis holder item “c” takes account of gross income and allowable deductions taken account of in previous income years. For item “c” in the cash BPA formula this intention to reverse previously allowable deductions is not fulfilled by the legislation. Only deductions taken under the accruals rules are taken account of in “c”, yet a cash basis holder returns income and expenditure on a cash basis not an accrual basis. In these circumstances item “c” of the cash BPA should be read to include not just expenditure under the specific sections of the accrual rules mentioned in the definition, but also expenditure under section BD 2 (1)(b). Giving item “c” this interpretation ensures that Parlia- ment’s intention, that expenditure previously taken into account is reversed out of the ultimate BPA calculation, is satisfied. This is consistent with cases such as Mangin v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 591 (PC), FCT v Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd 79 ATC 4398, and CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175 (CA). In Mangin Lord Donovan, delivering the judgment of the majority, noted certain rules of interpretation. One of these was to look at the ordinary meaning of the words. However, His Lordship went to on to say, at page 594: ...the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the Legislature it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If therefore a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an interpretation may be adopted. In Alcan, McKay J quoted Lord Donovan’s comments in Mangin with approval. At page 11,179 he said that “one should certainly approach the question of statutory interpretation on the premise that the legislature will not have intended absurdity or injustice”. At page 11,180 he framed the interpretation issue in the following terms: That question is to be answered, however, by applying the provisions of the statute in accordance with the provisions laid down. Where the words are unclear, or are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, the Court will prefer an interpreta- tion which does not lead to injustice or absurdity, and one which accords with the evident purpose. Both these judgments favour reading into item “c” a need to take account of expenditure for which an allowable deduction has already been taken under section BD 2 (1). To find otherwise would be unjust to non-cash basis holders, and would go against the statutory intent obvious in sections such as section BD 4 (4) and its predecessor sections. In the Cooper Brookes decision, the Full Federal Court was prepared to read extra words into a statute in a situation where it considered that a literal reading would not give effect to the legislature’s clear intention (as from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 11 and the final sum is calculated. Under section EH 4 (3), if a calculation gives a negative amount for the holder, the holder is deemed to have an allowable deduction in the income year. For a non-cash basis holder, the income and expenditure in relation to the financial arrangement will need to be spread under one of the methods men- tioned in section EH 1. Under section EH 8 (1), gross income or expenditure in an income year in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accruals rules must be calculated under those rules. As the repaid interest expenditure is expenditure under the qualified accrual rules it must be dealt with under those rules, and there can be no allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b). Non-cash basis holder: partial withdrawal of term deposit For non-cash basis holders, a partial withdrawal of a deposit will require the application of Determination G25 “Variations in the terms of a financial arrange- ment”; which appears to cover changes such as partial withdrawals of deposits. Example 2 in paragraph 7 of the determination gives an example of a partial repayment, albeit instigated by the issuer rather than the holder. The Commissioner can not rule on a matter on which there is an accrual determination, but the determination can be discussed in the commentary to a ruling. The Commissioner is unable to rule because section 91C(1)(e)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 prevents a binding ruling being issued on a matter that is, or could be, the subject of an accrual determination made under section 90 of that Act. This is clearly the case with Determination G25. If there is a variation in the terms of a financial arrange- ment, the determination requires the following calcula- tion to be performed: 6(1) In the income year in which a financial arrangement is varied, a person who is the issuer or holder of the financial arrangement shall include, in calculating assessable income for the income year, an amount in respect of the financial arrange- ment calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - b - c + d, where: ais the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrange- ment from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; bis the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrange- ment from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; cis the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year; and dis the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. ascertained from the context of the legislation). At page 4412 Fisher J said: In circumstances such as in the present case and particularly where the intention of the legislature is as clear as in my opinion it is, the terminology of the machinery provision is not so intractable as to deny a reasonable as opposed to a literal construction. This is consistent with Alcan, where McKay J after noting the presumption against an interpretation that leads to injustice or absurdity, said (page 11,179): It would be a mistake, however, to regard these as the only situations in which words may be understood in some other meaning of which they are capable. One should always have regard to the total context of the words used and to the purpose of the legislation in order to arrive at the meaning intended. This does not mean some forced meaning to fit a preconceived idea of purpose, but a proper approach to ascertain the true meaning. The true meaning must be consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is discernible. Section BD 4 (4) The other alternative involves the application of section BD 4 (4). Section BD 4 (4) provides that if an item of expenditure or loss gives rise to more than one allowable deduction, those deductions may not exceed the amount of that expenditure or loss. In the circumstances dis- cussed above the effect of the cash BPA is to give credit for an item of expenditure twice. However, it is difficult to describe the taking account of the expenditure in the cash BPA (through item “b” including the amount, and item “c” not being reduced by including the amount) as giving rise to an “allowable deduction”. The expenditure is taken account of in the cash BPA, but that expenditure does not necessarily give rise to an allowable deduction; it is the result of the application of the cash BPA formula that gives rise to any allowable deduction. Notwithstanding these difficulties, a court may be prepared to consider the policy behind section BD 4 (4) and refuse a second “effective” deduction on the cash BPA. Section BD 4 (4) suggests that amounts of ex- penditure should give a tax benefit only once. Further- more, the original predecessor section to section BD 4 (4), section 108(1)(o) of the Income Tax Act 1976, was introduced at the same time as the qualified accrual rules, suggesting it was meant to prevent a holder taking a deduction under general principles of deductibility and an effective deduction under a BPA. The Commissioner’s view is that, while the wording used in the legislation is less than ideal, it is most likely that a court would adopt either of the two approaches discussed above to deny the potential second deduction. This seems to clearly accord with Parliament’s intention to only allow one deduction. Non-cash basis holder: full withdrawal of term deposit The tax treatment of a non-cash basis holder on full withdrawal of a deposit is similar to that of a cash basis holder. The BPA formula in section EH 4 (1) is applied, continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 12 The amount so calculated shall: (a)Where it is a positive amount, be deemed to be income derived by the holder or the issuer as the case may be: (b)Where it is a negative amount, be deemed to be expendi- ture incurred by the holder or issuer as the case may be: Provided that expenditure incurred by the holder, in the year in which the financial arrangement is varied, using this method shall not exceed total income derived by the holder in previous income years. 6(2) In income years after the income year in which the financial arrangement is varied, income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred shall be calculated using the terms of the financial arrangement as varied and the provisions of the Act. Example 4 On 1 October 1996, Holder, who is not a cash basis holder, invests $10,000 for 24 months at 7%, interest to be credited to Holder’s nominated bank account six-monthly. On 1 May 1997 Holder wishes to withdraw $5,000 prior to maturity. On 31 March 1997 Holder had been credited with interest of $350. $175 of the $350 interest related to the $5,000 to be withdrawn. On the $5,000 to be withdrawn, Holder is credited 5% interest for the period from 1 October to 1 May, which is $146. As Holder has already been credited with $175 on the $5,000, he owes the bank $29. This will be deducted from the $5,000 so that he receives $4,971. On 30 September 1997 and 31 March 1998 he receives a further sum of $175, being the interest payable on the remaining $5,000 deposited. On 30 September 1998 he receives $5,175, being the repayment of the remaining deposit and the last interest payment. Assuming Holder is entitled to use a straight-line method, this gives the following results. For the income year ending 31 March 1997 he has returned $350 of income. For the income year ending 31 March 1998 he must apply the formula in Determination G25. Item “a” is the sum of amounts that would have been income to the end of the income year in which the variation occurred, as if the changes had been known about at the time the financial arrangement was acquired or issued. This is made up of $525 in respect of the $5,000 that is not withdrawn ($175 for each of the three half years from 1 October 1996 to 31 March 1998) and $146 for the $5,000 that is withdrawn (the amount recalculated by the bank). The total is $671. Item “b” is nil, because if changes had been known about at the start of the financial arrangement there would have been no expenditure, just less income which is taken account of in “a”. Item “c” is $350, being all amounts treated as income in respect of the financial arrangement to the end of the previous income year. Item “d” is nil, being all amounts treated as expendi- ture in respect of the financial arrangement to the end of the previous income year. Therefore, a – b – c + d = $671 – 0 - $350 + 0 = $321. Being a positive amount it is deemed to be income of Holder. Thus for the income year ending 31 March 1998 Holder should return income of $321. Essentially, the formula takes the $29 of repaid interest and deducts it from the income derived in the 1998 income year. For the income year ending 31 March 1999, Holder must perform a BPA under section EH 4 (1). The formula is: a – (b + c) Item “a” is all amounts paid to Holder which will be $10,000 of principal plus $350 of interest for the first two years, and $175 for the last year, for a total of $10,875. (Note that amounts “paid” to Holder are different to amounts of income derived by Holder for tax purposes.) Item “b” is the acquisition price, which is $10,029. Item “c” is income derived in all previous income years, which is $350 in the first year, and $321 in the second year after applying Determination G25. Item “c” is thus $671. Therefore, the BPA gives a result of: a – (b + c)= $10,875 – $10,700 ($10,029 + $671) = $175. This is the correct amount as it is the income earned in the 1999 income year. There is no adjustment for the repaid interest, as that was taken into account in the 1998 income year. Submissions received A number of submissions have disagreed with some of the conclusions drawn in the Ruling and this commen- tary. In particular some commentators have argued that in a situation where a cash basis holder has to repay interest when an investment is withdrawn early: •The holder has conditionally “derived” the part of the interest at risk of repayment, and has only “derived” the non-repayable amount; or •The amount repaid has a clear nexus to the interest previously derived, sufficient to support an allowable deduction under section BD 2 (1)(b); or •Such a repayment of interest may give rise to a deduction under general principles of deductibility and on the BPA. One commentator considered that the commentary’s discussion on the possibility of a double deduction overlooked the first two principles of Lord Donovan in Mangin. Those first two principles require from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 13 interpretations and conclusions on some of the issues discussed. However, for the reasons discussed in the commentary under the subheadings relating to each of the bullet points above, it is considered that the better view is that set out in the Ruling and commentary. Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited’s OPALS investment product Product Ruling - BR Prd 97/48 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CG 5 and CG 15, and the definitions of “foreign investment fund”, “foreign entity”, and “foreign company” in section OB 1, and Schedule 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue, as more particularly set out in the relevant Offer- ing Circular and Pricing Supplement, by Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited, of certain series of an investment product called OPALS. More specifically, this Ruling applies to OPALS Series Nos 1 to 5, 9 to 12, 17, 23, 35 and 36, and future series of OPALS predominantly in respect of shares in companies which are resident in countries which, in the relevant income year for the tax- payer, meet the requirements of section CG 15 (2)(b). OPALS are hybrid securities issued by a special purpose Cayman Island com- pany (Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited, the “Issuer”), and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. OPALS are not shares in the Issuer. They are unsecured obligations ranking pari passu with all other unsecured obligations of the Issuer. OPALS provide investors with a return which tracks within agreed parameters the movement in a specified equity index (such as the S&P 500). This return is provided as follows. The issue proceeds from OPALS are indirectly invested in shares of companies making up the relevant index. The dividends received on these share baskets (net of any applicable withholding taxes) plus a percentage of any fees generated from the lending of the shares are paid to the OPALS holder as an annual coupon. Similarly any gains made through adjusting the composition of the share baskets are paid out as a component of this coupon. The application states that these adjustments are made without the intention of attempting to outperform the relevant index. OPALS have a stated maturity of between one and seven years. Redemption is effected by the delivery to the investor of the physical shares then comprising the basket. In certain circumstances investors with a prescribed minimum holding of OPALS can elect to redeem early, but redemption is always by delivery of shares and never by cash. that words be given their ordinary meaning, and that one looks merely at what is clearly said in the legisla- tion. The Commissioner recognises that the subject-matter of the Ruling is difficult and there is scope for differing continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 14 The actual hedging mechanism involves the holding of the share baskets in a Morgan Stanley group company resident in Luxembourg (“Counterparty”). The Counterparty issues an equity linked note to the Issuer thus hedging the Issuer’s position. Therefore, the balance sheet of the Issuer is composed of Counterparty notes on the asset side and the OPALS on the liability side balanced by share capital. The notes issued by the Counterparty are redeemable in cash or through the delivery of shares. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •None of the interests held by holders of OPALS constitute direct income interests in the Issuer of the OPALS, in terms of section CG 5 (2)(a), (b), (c), and (d); •None of the interests held by holders of OPALS constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund, being the Issuer of the OPALS, in terms of section CG 15 (1); •None of the interests which holders of OPALS have constitute direct income interests in the shares in the Baskets, in terms of section CG 5 (2)(a), (b), (c), and (d); and •The right of a holder of OPALS to acquire shares in the Baskets is not an interest in a foreign investment fund, in any particular income year, to the extent to which the shares are shares in a company incorporated in a country listed in Part A of Schedule 3 of the Act, which is not an entity specified in Part B of Schedule 4, thereby satisfying the requirements of section CG 15 (2)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 5 June 1997 until 30 September 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5th day of June 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) National Bank of New Zealand Limited’s superannuation fund – withdrawals Product Ruling – BR Prd 97/68 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 3 (5), JB 3 (1), and the definitions of “beneficiary income”, “qualifying trust”, “superannuation scheme”, and “super- annuation fund” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the withdrawal by members of benefits from The National Bank Superannuation Funds (“the Fund”). The Fund offers a regular savings plan and lump sum superannuation fund to the general public of New Zealand. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 15 The principal purpose of the Fund is to provide retirement benefits to natural person beneficiaries, and it is anticipated that in practice the members of the Fund will largely be natural persons. The Fund was established by trust deed dated 1 August 1997. Members elect to have contributions invested in one of several types of invest- ment fund within the Fund. At the time of investment, each member is allocated a number of Units. The number of Units allocated represents the interest each member has in the Fund. The price and value of the Units (and therefore the value of a member’s interest) rises and falls, depending on the market conditions and earnings’ performance. Members can elect to make withdrawals of their interest from the Fund by way of a single lump sum withdrawal. Alternatively, members may elect to make withdrawals by way of several irregular lump sum withdrawals or by regular income payments, or a combination of both. The trustee may fix a maximum number of partial withdrawals that can be made on account of any member’s interest. All defined terms have the meanings set out in the deed. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •The Fund is a registered superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. •The Ruling will apply only in respect of “Personal Members” of the Fund. •Payments made to members of the Fund are made in accordance with the Fund’s trust deed. •Withdrawals by a member (whether such withdrawals are made on an irregu- lar and/or regular basis) are not made at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period. This means that a member cannot rely on this Ruling if the member makes withdrawals at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The Fund is a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1. •Withdrawals of benefits made by members of the Fund are not assessable for income tax by virtue of section HH 3 (5). •For the purposes of calculating “other income” under section JB 3 (1), benefits paid upon withdrawal are not received by members in the form of a pension and are not received in the form of annuity. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 14 August 1997 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of August 1997.

These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Pre-1993 net losses - carrying forward and satisfying shareholder continuity requirements Summary This item considers whether a company claiming to carry forward and offset net losses incurred in the 1991-92 and earlier income years (‘pre-1993 net losses’) must satisfy the shareholder continuity requirements contained in section IF 1 (1) and/or section IF 1 (6) of the Income Tax Act 1994. A company claiming to carry forward and offset pre-1993 net losses must satisfy the shareholder continu- ity test in either section IF 1 (1) or (6). If a company satisfies the shareholder continuity test in section IF 1 (1), it need not also satisfy the shareholder continu- ity test in section IF 1 (6). This item does not comment on the application of section IF 1 (5), which provides the shareholder continu- ity requirements for net losses incurred before the 1977-78 income year. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. Issues An issue that arises when a company has incurred net losses before the 1991-92 income year and seeks to offset those losses in the 1992-93 and later income years is whether the company may satisfy the shareholder continuity test in either sections IF 1 (1) or IF 1 (6). A second related issue is whether the “continuity period” in section IF 1 (1) begins before the date from which section IF 1 (1) applies.

Section IE 1 (2) states: Any taxpayer who satisfies the Commissioner that the taxpayer has a net loss for any income year shall, subject to this section and section IF 1, be entitled to claim that- (a)The net loss be carried forward to the income year immediately succeeding that income year and be offset against the net income for that immediately succeeding income year, so far as that net income extends; and (b)So far as it cannot then be offset, the net loss be carried forward from that immediately succeeding income year to the next succeeding income year and be offset against the net income for that next succeeding income year and so on. Section IF 1 (1) states: Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, no taxpayer being a company (in this subsection referred to as the ‘loss company’) may carry forward, in accordance with section IE 1 (2), the whole or any part of a net loss for any income year (in this subsection referred to as the “year of loss”) to any later income year (in this subsection referred to as the “year of carry forward”), unless there is a group of persons- (a)The aggregate of whose minimum voting interests in the loss company in the period from the beginning of the year of loss to the end of the year of carry forward (in this subsection referred to as the “continuity period”) is equal to or greater than 49%; and (b)In any case where at any time during the continuity period a market value circumstance exists in respect of the loss company, the aggregate of whose minimum market value interests in the loss company in the continuity period is equal to or greater than 49%,- and, for the purposes of this subsection, the minimum voting interest or minimum market value interest (as the case may be) of any person in the loss company in the continuity period shall be equal to the lowest voting interest or market value interest (as the case may be) in the loss company which that person has during the continuity period. Section IF 1 (6) is a transitional provision that applies to losses incurred in the 1991-92 and earlier income years, and states: Where any taxpayer (being a company) claims, in accordance with section IE 1 (2), to carry forward the whole or part of a net loss incurred by it in the 1991-92 income year or any IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 17 earlier year (in this subsection referred to as the “pre-1993 year of loss”) to any later income year, the provisions of subsection (1) shall not preclude such claim where- (a)The taxpayer would have been entitled to claim to carry forward the whole or part of the net loss to the later income year under section 188 of the Income Tax Act 1976, as that section applied before its repeal and replacement by section 22 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992, if that section 188 had continued to apply- (i)As modified by section 188AA of the Income Tax Act 1976; (ii)As if the continuity percentage referred to in section 188(7) of the Income Tax Act 1976 were always 40%,- in respect of the later income year; and (b)In respect of the period commencing on the first day of the 1992-93 income year and ending with the last day of that later income year (referred to in this subsection as the “relevant period”), there is a group of persons- (i)The aggregate of whose minimum voting interests in the taxpayer in the relevant period is equal to or greater than 49%; and (ii)In any case where at any time during the relevant period a market value circumstance exists in respect of the taxpayer, the aggregate of whose minimum market value interests in the taxpayer in the relevant period is equal to or greater than 49%,- and, for the purposes of this paragraph, the minimum voting interest or minimum market value interest (as the case may be) of any person in the taxpayer in the relevant period shall be equal to the lowest voting interest or market value interest (as the case may be) in the taxpayer which that person has during the relevant period. Application of the legislation Whether continuity test in section IF 1 (6) overrides test in section IF 1 (1) The primary shareholder continuity test that a company must satisfy in order to carry forward net losses is contained in section IF 1 (1). However, an alternative shareholder continuity test is contained in section IF 1 (6) for net losses incurred in the 1991-92 income year and earlier income years. Section IF 1 (6) was designed as a transitional provision, and includes shareholder continuity requirements that applied prior to the introduction of the 1992 company loss legislation. In most circumstances, a company claiming to carry forward pre-1993 net losses will find it easier to satisfy the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (6) rather than those in section IF 1 (1). This is because section IF 1 (6) requires a 40% shareholder continuity for part of the relevant period, whereas section IF 1 (1) increases the shareholder continuity required to 49%. However, there will be situations when a company can more easily satisfy section IF 1 (1) than section IF 1 (6). This is because some of the modifications to the tracing of shareholder interests in a company that apply to the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (1) do not apply to section IF 1 (6). These modifications are contained in sections OD 5 and OD 5A. The existence of these modifications has prompted a number of taxpayers to ask whether a company that claims to carry forward pre-1993 net losses must satisfy the requirements of section IF 1 (6) if the requirements in section IF 1 (1) are met. The shareholder continuity test in section IF 1 (6) does not override the test in section IF 1 (1). A company claiming to carry forward and offset pre-1993 net losses may apply the shareholder continuity requirements in either section IF 1 (1) or (6). If a company satisfies section IF 1 (1), there is no need for the company to also satisfy the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (6). Section IF 1 (1) applies to companies seeking to carry forward net losses incurred in “any income year.” This is in contrast to section IF 1 (6) which only applies to companies seeking to carry forward net losses incurred in the 1991-92 and earlier income years. Under section IF 1 (6), section IF 1 (1) “shall not preclude” a claim to carry forward a net loss when the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (6) are satisfied. The words “shall not preclude” mean that section IF 1 (1) will not prevent a loss being carried forward and offset if the requirements of section IF 1(6) are satisfied. The effect of this is that a company claiming to carry forward and offset pre-1993 losses may apply the shareholder continuity requirements in either section IF 1 (1) or (6). If a company satisfies section IF 1 (1), there is no need for the company to also satisfy the shareholder continu- ity requirements in section IF 1 (6). Application of “continuity period” in section IF 1 (1) to net losses incurred before 1 April 1992 Sections IF 1 (1) and (6) replaced sections 188(7) and 188(13) of the Income Tax Act 1976. These provisions were introduced into the Income Tax Act 1976 by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992, effective from the start of the 1992-93 income year. The shareholder continuity requirements set out in section IF 1 (1) are measured over the “continuity period”, which runs from the beginning of the year the loss was incurred to the end of the year of the carry forward. We have been asked whether section IF 1 (1) can be applied to net losses incurred before the start of the 1992-93 income year, given that the “continuity period” will begin before the date from which the legislation applies. Under section IF 1 (1), the “continuity period” is measured from the start of the year the net loss was incurred. Net losses may still be carried forward if the “continuity period” begins before the date from when the legislation applies. This is because sections IE 1 (2) and IF 1 (1) operate for the year the company claims the carry forward and offset of the net loss, not for the year continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 18 •If a company cannot satisfy the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (1), the company may carry forward pre-1993 net losses if the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (6) are met. Application of sections IE 1 and 1F 1 to pre-1993 losses •Section IE 1 (2) provides the mechanism for net losses to be carried forward and offset against net income. •Because sections IE 1 and IF 1 have effect from the start of the 1992-93 income year, a claim made under these provisions to carry forward and offset a pre-1993 net loss may be made in relation to a taxpayer’s net income for the 1992-93 or later income years. •Sections IE 1 and IF 1 apply in the year the company claims to carry forward and offset the net loss and not in the year the net loss was incurred. This means that net losses incurred before the start of the 1992-93 income year can be carried forward and offset. •Under section IF 1 (1), the “continuity period” is measured from the start of the year the net loss was incurred. Net losses may still be carried forward if the “continuity period” begins before the date from when the legislation applies. GST and repossessions in the motor vehicle industry This article covers the GST treatment of repossessions by motor vehicle dealers of vehicles that were subject to a hire purchase agreement. It appears that motor vehicle dealers may be accounting for GST incorrectly on these transactions by claiming a GST input tax deduction on payments made to the finance company when the dealer is guarantor for the hire purchase. The transaction The transaction between the motor vehicle dealer and the customer is the normal sale and purchase agreement. However, to finance the deal the customer enters into a hire purchase agreement. As part of the financial agree- ment the dealer is required to be guarantor between the purchaser and the finance company. If the purchaser defaults on the contract the finance company is paid any amount outstanding by the guaran- tor (dealer). After paying the outstanding debt the dealer takes ownership of the vehicle from the finance com- pany. It is then up to the dealer to decide how to recover their debt, which is normally done by repossessing and selling the vehicle. The transaction between the dealer and the finance company is a financial service under section 3(1) of the GST Act and is therefore exempt from GST. The GST implications of the dealer actually repossessing and selling the vehicle are determined by section 5(2) of the GST Act. Example Motor vehicle dealer purchases a vehicle, and then sells it. The sale is financed by way of a hire purchase agreement between the purchaser and a finance com- pany, with the dealer being guarantor. The purchaser defaults on the repayments and the finance company calls on the guarantor to make good the outstanding debt. After paying the outstanding debt to the finance company as per the dealer agreement, the dealer obtains ownership of the vehicle. The dealer then repossesses and sells the vehicle to recover the debt created by the payment to the finance company. The GST treatment of these transactions is as follows: 1.The dealer claims an input/deemed input tax deduc- tion on the purchase of the vehicle. 2.The dealer returns output tax on the sale of the vehicle at the time the hire purchase agreement is signed. 3.Payment by the dealer to the finance company to pay the outstanding debt created by the purchaser is not subject to GST as it is a financial service under section 3(1) of the GST Act, and therefore exempt under section 14 of the same Act. Therefore, the dealer is unable to claim an input tax deduction in relation to this payment. 4.The sale of the repossessed vehicle by the dealer is to be treated for GST under section 5(2) of the GST the net loss was incurred. Therefore, even though section IF 1 (1) measures the shareholder continuity of a company over a period that begins before the legislation applies, the provision only operates to allow a net loss to be carried forward and offset from the start of the 1992- 93 income year. Conclusions The legislation applies as follows: Interaction of sections IF 1 (1) and (6) •Section IF 1 (1) contains the primary shareholder continuity test that a company must satisfy when carrying forward company net losses incurred in any income year. •A company claiming to carry forward and offset pre- 1993 net losses may apply the shareholder continuity requirements in either section IF 1 (1) or (6). If a company satisfies section IF 1 (1), there is no need for the company to also satisfy the shareholder continuity requirements in section IF 1 (6). from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 19 would not have been a sale as part of a taxable activity. If the original purchaser of the vehicle wasn’t GST- registered, the dealer must not issue a tax invoice when selling the repossessed vehicle, nor charge GST on the sale. Although this article is specifically aimed at the motor vehicle industry, it is equally applicable to any situation where the goods purchased are subject to a hire purchase agreement and the guarantor is registered for GST and the vendor of the goods. Act. This generally means the sale of the repossessed vehicle will be subject to GST if the sale by the purchaser would have been part of a taxable activity. However, the sale of the repossessed vehicle would not be subject to GST in either of these situations: •If the purchaser gives the dealer written advice stating that a sale by the purchaser would not have been a sale as part of a taxable activity, or •If the dealer can reasonably determine from information held that a sale by the purchaser IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 20 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Losses released on discharge from bankruptcy – inability to carry forward Section IE 1 (4) – Limitation on ability to carry forward losses: A taxpayer who was sole proprietor of a family restaurant was adjudged bankrupt in December 1994. At that time she had incurred a total debt of $625,000 in managing the restaurant. The debt arose because the taxpayer spent a great deal of money on redecorating the premises, and earned insufficient income from the restaurant to pay for it. No part of the $625,000 debt was a deemed dividend governed by section CF 2, nor was any part of the debt subject to the qualified accrual rules contained in the Income Tax Act 1994. In February 1996 the taxpayer was discharged from bankruptcy and released from the obligation to pay the $625,000 debt by the operation of the Insolvency Act 1967. She now wishes to offset the $625,000 debt she was released from at the time of her discharge from bankruptcy, against post-bankruptcy income earned from her highly successful garden centre. Section IE 1 (1) states: Subject always to the express provisions of this section and section IF 1, this section and section IF 1 are intended- (a)To permit taxpayers to carry forward net losses that arise in one income year for offset against net income of the taxpayer in a later income year... (emphasis added) Section IE 1 (4) states: Where and to the extent that - (a)A taxpayer has incurred any expenditure or loss which has been allowed as a deduction in an income year for which the taxpayer had a net loss; and (b)The taxpayer did not during that income year make payment on account of the expenditure or loss but rather a debt remained outstanding; and (c)The taxpayer is, in any subsequent income year,- (i)Discharged from liability in respect of that debt without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth; or (ii)Released from liability in respect of that debt by the operation of the Insolvency Act 1967 or the Companies Act 1955 or the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of any country or territory other than New Zealand,- or the debt has, in any subsequent income year, become irrevocable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time; and (d)That discharge, release, irrecoverability, or unenforceability is neither- (i)Required to be taken into account by the taxpayer under the qualified accruals rules; nor (ii)A dividend derived by the taxpayer within the meaning of section CF 2 (1)(b) or (being a dividend which, if the transaction giving rise to the dividend had been effected with a shareholder of the relevant company, would have been a dividend within the meaning of section CF 2 (1)(b)) within the meaning of section CF 2 (1)(k); and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 21 (e)The allowance as a deduction of the expenditure or loss in calculating the net loss has given rise or would, but for this subsection, give rise to the relief afforded by this section,- the relief afforded by this section shall be reduced by the amount discharged, released, or become irrevocable or unenforceable, and- (f)For the purposes of giving effect to this subsection, the Commissioner may at any time alter any assessment notwithstanding the time bar; and (g)Where and to the extent to which the relief afforded by this subsection has been reduced and the taxpayer pays an amount in respect of the debt previously discharged, released, or become irrecoverable or unenforceable, the amount paid shall, to the extent that it does not exceed the reduction in relief, be allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer in the income year in which payment is made. (emphasis added) Section 114 of the Insolvency Act 1967 states: A discharge shall release the bankrupt from all debts provable in the bankruptcy except the following:- (a)Any debt or liability incurred by means of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which he was a party: (b)Any debt or liability whereof he has obtained forbearance by any fraud to which he was a party: (c)Any judgment debt or any amount payable under any order for which he is liable under section 45 or section 110 of this Act: (d)Any amount payable under a maintenance order under the Family Proceedings Act 1980: (e)Any amount payable under the Child Support Act 1991. (emphasis added) The definition of “debt provable in bankruptcy” and “provable debt” in section 2 of the Insolvency Act 1967 is: Includes any debt, demand, or liability by this Act made provable in bankruptcy. The taxpayer has incurred expenditure or loss of $625,000 that has been allowed as a deduction in an income year for which she had a net loss. The taxpayer did not pay the $625,000 debt and was discharged from liability to pay it by opera- tion of the Insolvency Act 1967, because the debt was a debt provable in bank- ruptcy as defined in section 2 of the Insolvency Act 1967. The taxpayer cannot offset the $625,000 against her post discharge income from the garden centre. However, if the taxpayer subsequently pays an amount relating to the released $625,000 debt, the amount paid, to the extent that it does not exceed the reduc- tion in relief, will be allowed as a deduction to her in the income year in which the payment is made.

Stolen funds – whether assessable income Case:“A Taxpayer” v CIR Decision Date:28 August 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 65(1), (2)(a), (b), (e) and 38(2). Keyword:Stolen funds, income, futures exchange Summary:The Court of Appeal held the funds the appellant stole from his employer to use on the futures market were not assessable income as defined in the Act. Facts:The Appellant, an accountant in an insurance company, stole approximately $2.2 million from his employer and invested the money in the futures market. He diverted the money by writing cheques into his own account. Although the Appellant made profits, some of which he paid back, he also made substantial losses. When the stock market crashed, the Appellant incurred losses of over $1 million. Some funds were recovered from him, but approximately $800,000 was left unpaid. Result:The issue facing the Court was whether the unpaid balance of the stolen money was assessable income. The Taxation Review Authority held that the stolen funds were not income in the hands of the appellant. This is because according to the authority, stealing did not produce income according to ordinary concepts, but was just a transfer of capital. The other substantial issue before the Authority was whether the appellant’s activities came within either section 65(2)(a), business income, or section 65(2)(e), profit making schemes of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Authority found that the appellant was carrying on a business and that all the profits or gains derived therefrom were assessable pursuant to section 65(2)(a). The Authority also held that any losses were deductible under section 104. On appeal by the Commissioner of the first issue only (i.e., whether the unpaid balance of the stolen money was assessable income), the High Court held that the unpaid balance was income. Justice Morris held that the question to be asked was whether the taxpayer had acquired a sum of money over which he had control so as to derive economic value from it. Justice Morris found in the af- firmative. The appellant had received a benefit of money and so must pay tax on it, whether the money is rightfully his or not. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 23 The remaining question for the High Court, therefore, was within which para- graph of section 65(2) the unrepaid money came. Justice Morris rejected the argument for the Commissioner that the unpaid money came within section 65(2)(a), (b) or (e). As to (a), the embezzlement did not constitute the carrying on or carrying out of a business of stealing cheques as contended for by the Commissioner: unrepaid money was acquired independ- ently of the business and then put to use for trading. It was derived prior to the business rather than from the business operations. The unrepaid money was not "monetary remuneration" within para (b). The existence of the employment relationship was no more that a background fact to the making of the payment. The unrepaid money was not a gain derived from a scheme under para (e). The unrepaid funds were injected into the venture, they were not derived from it. That left para (1) and, in view of his earlier finding that the unrepaid stolen money constituted income, the money had to come within (1). The Court of Appeal rejected Justice Morris' approach. The Court held instead that the determining factors as to whether the unpaid money was assessable income are the legal rights and obligations that arose from the transaction in question. There could be no gain to the appellant unless the money was received by him beneficially and here it was not because at all times he was legally obliged to return it to the true owner. The Court held that the embezzled sums were not income derived by the tax- payer within the meaning of section 38(2) and the definition of assessable income in section 2, or within any of the provisions of section 65(2). Computer programs and software – whether intellectual property or goods Case:TRA 95/37 Decision Date:11 August 1997 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – sections 2(1)(a), (c) Keywords:intellectual property Summary:The Authority held that computer programs and software are regarded as intel- lectual property in the form of “know how”. As such the transfer of “know how” cannot be regarded as goods. Facts:Two experienced businessmen involved in agricultural fertilisers applied their collective knowledge to formulate a business package for the franchising of prescriptive fertilisers for farmland. To facilitate this, they incorporated some companies; one of which was the Objector and under an Agreement for Sale and Purchase (“Agreement”) sold the business package to the Objector. The Agree- ment referred to intellectual property which included a patent, trademark and computer programmes and software. Decision:The issue facing the Authority was whether the sale of a business “know how” package was the sale of goods or services, and if it was goods, whether it was secondhand. The provisional patent and registered trademark referred to in the Agreement were “choses in action” and are thereby excluded from the definition of goods in the Act. Goods for the purposes of the Act must be capable of being “choses in possession”, that is, physical things as opposed to intellectual things. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 24 The computer programs and software referred to in the Agreement are not goods because they are intellectual property in the form of know how or information. Know how is defined as all “undivulged technical information”. The transfer of this information is incapable of being goods, as a computer program is regarded as intellectual property. To the extent that payment was made for technical knowledge, that payment must be construed as payment for services. A registered person cannot claim an input tax credit for services provided by a non-registered person. Even if it were possible to regard the business package as goods, it was not secondhand, as such goods had never been previously utilised or exploited in any commercial way. Assets retained – whether taxable activity still exists Case:TRA 96/116 Decision Date:4 September 1997 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – sections 2, 6(1)(a), 20(3)(a) Keywords:Input tax credit Summary:The Authority held that as long as the taxpayer continues to employ its assets in some activity, or has the intention to do so, then for the purposes of the GST Act it is continuing to carry on a taxable activity. Facts:The Objector is registered for the taxable activity of restaurant services. It for- merly carried on a restaurant business, but this was sold in November 1993. In June 1995 the purchaser of the business issued proceedings against the Objec- tor for damages for misrepresentation. The Objector incurred legal and account- ing costs in defending the claim. In its returns for the taxable periods ending 30 April 1995 to 31 October 1995, the Objector claimed input tax credits in respect of such costs. Inland Revenue disallowed these claims and the Objector objected. Decision:The issue before the Authority was whether or not at all material times the taxpayer was carrying on a taxable activity and was therefore entitled to a refund of inputs claimed by it in respect of legal and accounting fees paid. Judge Willy found as a fact that the objector did not cease trading when it sold its restaurant business. On the contrary, it continued to look actively to employ the capital from the sale of the business in some other income-producing activity, and was only stopped from doing so by the intervention of Court proceedings and in particular the failure of negotiations to settle those proceedings. His Honour stated that as long as the taxpayer continues to employ its assets in some activity, or has the intention to do so, and given that it is registered for GST (or deemed to be so registered) then the fact that its efforts for the time being do not result in the derivation of any income from the attempts to employ those assets does not matter, because for the purposes of the GST legislation it is con- tinuing to carry on a taxable activity. As an alternative, in case His Honour was wrong in finding that the taxable activity still continued, he found that the legal and accounting expenses were incurred within the provisions of section 6(2) as being something done in con- nection with the termination of a taxable activity. from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.9 (September 1997) 25 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 1 Transfer Pricing Draft Guidelines A guide to the application of section GD 13 of New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 1994 This appendix contains the first of a series of draft guidelines on the application of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. The draft provides a general overview of the framework within which transfer pricing operates, including a discussion on documentation taxpayers should be looking to prepare if they are to evidence compliance with the arm’s length principle. Transfer pricing is not an exact science. For this reason, the guidelines have been drafted as a practical guide, rather than as prescriptive rules. Inland Revenue does not propose to issue the final guidelines as a binding public ruling. Inland Revenue welcomes submissions on the material in the draft guidelines. Please make these by 27 February 1998, addressed to: General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Inland Revenue proposes to follow these guidelines in administering the transfer pricing rules until such time as final guidelines are issued. On matters not addressed in this draft, Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD guidelines. This document is also available on the Internet. Visit Inland Revenue’s website at http://www.ird.govt.nz and choose the Tax Information Bulletin section.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 3 Introduction 1.This is the first of a series of guidelines to be released on New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules, and contains a general overview of the framework within which transfer pricing practice operates. It aims to provide taxpayers with an appreciation of what they will need to do if they are to demonstrate to the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue that they have complied with the arm’s length principle in section GD 13. 2.Specifically, these guidelines consider: • the rationale behind New Zealand’s adoption of the arm’s length principle • the conceptual framework on which application of the acceptable transfer pricing methods is based • the general principles of comparability (including a discussion on functional analysis) which forms the foundation of transfer pricing analysis • the factors taxpayers should consider in determining the extent to which documentation should be prepared and maintained in support of their determination of the arm’s length price. 3.Inland Revenue plans to issue subsequent guidelines to address more specific transfer pricing issues. These issues include: • the detailed application of the acceptable transfer pricing methods • the treatment of intra-group services, such as manage- ment fees • the treatment of intangible property • cost contribution arrangements • the procedure for applying for an advance pricing agreement (APA) • permanent establishments (application of section FB 2). Relationship to OECD guidelines 4.Tax Information Bulletin Volume 7, No.11 (March 1996) described New Zealand’s transfer pricing legisla- tion enacted in December 1995. On page 1 of that publica- tion, it was stated that until New Zealand’s transfer pricing guidelines are issued, Inland Revenue will be following the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (referred to in these guidelines as the “OECD guide- lines”) in applying the transfer pricing rules. 5.The issuing of New Zealand’s transfer pricing guidelines does not fully supersede the use of the OECD guidelines for New Zealand transfer pricing practice. Consensus established between OECD member countries means that the OECD guidelines will be the relevant guidelines to consider if a transfer pricing issue is raised under New Zealand’s double tax agreements. For this reason, the New Zealand guidelines follow closely the OECD model for the application of the various transfer pricing methods. 6.This raises the question of why New Zealand is drafting its own guidelines. The answer is that by issuing guidelines with a practical focus, Inland Revenue hopes to explain transfer pricing in a way that is perhaps more accessible to taxpayers confronted by the issue than are the OECD guidelines. Further, it is expected that New Zealand guidelines will be able to offer pragmatic solu- tions to issues that are better suited to the New Zealand business environment. Finally, the OECD leaves issues such as documentation to the discretion of individual jurisdictions, so it is necessary for Inland Revenue to develop an appropriate view on the issue. 7.Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD guidelines on matters not addressed in this part of the guidelines. Inland Revenue’s approach to New Zealand guidelines 8.There are two possible approaches that might be taken in drafting transfer pricing guidelines. The first is to draft prescriptive guidelines that attempt to deal with every transfer pricing issue that may arise. In Inland Revenue’s view, such an approach is ineffective. Estab- lishing appropriate transfer prices for tax purposes involves the application of judgment, which will often depend on taxpayers’ individual circumstances. Prescrip- tive guidelines are therefore not considered to be a practicable option. 9.The second approach is to provide guidance on the factors that should be considered in determining whether an amount constitutes an arm’s length price, and how these factors might affect a transfer pricing analysis. This is the approach adopted in these guidelines, and it is hoped that the result will achieve the aim of providing a practical guide to transfer pricing issues and the application of the arm’s length principle. 10.Inland Revenue acknowledges that the guidelines cannot provide an exhaustive discussion of transfer pricing issues. Taxpayers may therefore wish to look to additional sources for advice on how to apply the arm’s length principle. Because of their international impor- tance, the OECD guidelines should be the first point of reference, particularly as they will form the basis for resolving transfer pricing disputes under the mutual agreement articles of New Zealand’s double tax agree- ments. However, on issues concerning the administration of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules, such as docu- mentation, the New Zealand guidelines should be read as paramount. 11.Two other significant references are the guide- lines issued by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and the Preface IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 4 United States’ section 482 regulations. Both of these sources provide valuable background information on the application of the arm’s length principle. Obviously aspects in those guidelines that have been drafted with only Australia or the United States in mind, such as the point within a range to which the relevant jurisdiction will seek to adjust taxpayers’ transfer prices, which will not be relevant in the New Zealand context. However, on issues such as the application of pricing methods and the principles of comparability and functional analysis, for which both jurisdictions follow the established interna- tional norm, there should be no inconsistency between the Australian and United States approaches, and that of New Zealand. Key messages 12.A number of important messages are reiterated throughout these guidelines. 13.Perhaps first and foremost, transfer pricing is not an exact science. These guidelines continually emphasise that transfer pricing is a matter of judgement. (“Judge- ment” is used here in the sense of establishing the extent to which a factor is significant in determining an arm’s length price, as opposed to an intuitive feeling that a price is correct). This is the reason for preparing these guidelines as a practical guide, rather than as prescriptive rules for determining transfer prices. 14.Second, the transfer pricing rules will be adminis- tered most efficiently if taxpayers and Inland Revenue co- operate in resolving transfer pricing issues. Taxpayers are encouraged to discuss concerns about their transfer pricing practices with Inland Revenue. At the present time, such contact should, in the first instance, be made with one of the following people: Mike Spelman (Auckland Corporates) 09 367-1351 Anton Nannestad (Auckland Corporates) 09 306-2034 Pat Horan (Wellington Corporates) 04 802-6048 Paul Cooper (Policy Advice Division) 04 474-7004 15.The final key message is that taxpayers know their business best, and this should influence how they respond to the transfer pricing rules. Taxpayers know how their prices are set and what the economic and commercial justifications are for the actions they take, and this knowledge can be used to develop a strong transfer pricing analysis. If taxpayers make conscientious efforts to establish transfer prices that comply with the arm’s length principle, and prepare documentation to evidence that compliance, Inland Revenue is likely to determine prima facie that those transfer pricing prac- tices represent a low tax risk, and the review of those practices is likely to be diminished accordingly. By contrast, taxpayers who give inadequate consideration to their transfer pricing practices are likely to receive closer attention from Inland Revenue. Documentation to evidence consistency, therefore, plays a key role in determining whether Inland Revenue is likely to review taxpayers’ transfer pricing in greater detail. Inland Revenue considers it to be in taxpayers’ best interests to prepare and maintain adequate documentation. Scope of guidelines 16.This part of the guidelines applies only to the application of section GD 13 (as modified by section GC 1 where relevant). It therefore applies only to transactions between separate entities. 17.These guidelines do not apply to transactions within a single entity, such as between a parent company and its branch operation. Those transactions are subject instead to the apportionment rules in section FB 2. The OECD is currently undertaking work on this issue. New Zealand will issue guidelines on section FB 2 at a later date, and these are likely to draw on the guidelines to be developed by the OECD. Terminology 18.In the guidelines, the term “multinational” is used to refer to any commonly owned group with members in more than one country. The term “members” refers to constituent parts of that multinational, each having a separate legal existence. 19.The guidelines also frequently refer to “controlled transactions” and “uncontrolled transactions”. A “controlled transaction” is one in which the ownership relationship between the parties is able to influence the transfer price set. In relation to section GD 13, a control- led transaction will be any transaction between associ- ated persons. However, it is possible that the term could have a wider meaning to the extent that section GC 1 applies. 20.An “uncontrolled transaction” is one that is conducted at arm’s length between enterprises that are independent of each other. This could include, for example, transactions between two independent firms, or transactions at arm’s length between a multinational and an independent firm. Uncontrolled transactions form the benchmark against which a multinational’s transfer pricing is appraised in determining whether its prices are arm’s length. 21.Notice should also be taken of the term “related parties”. Section GD 13 applies only to transactions between associated persons. However, because section GC 1 can extend the application of section GD 13 to non- associated parties in certain circumstances, the guide- lines use the term “related parties” in preference to “associated persons” to encompass the potential application of both section GD 13 and section GC 1. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 5 Introduction 22.When independent enterprises deal with each other, market forces ordinarily determine the conditions of their commercial and financial relations. By contrast, when members of a multinational deal with each other, external market forces may not directly affect their commercial and financial relations in the same way. 23.For example, a multinational may be more con- cerned with its overall profitability than it is with the allocation of those profits between its members. On the other hand, the multinational may well have set its transfer prices with a view to determining accurately the profit attributable to a local operation, perhaps for the purpose of measuring accurately the relative performance of its managers. 24.The upshot is that there are many factors that might drive a multinational’s transfer pricing policies. However, these factors can conflict with the objectives of a host government. For this reason special rules have been adopted to determine transfer prices for tax pur- poses. 25.New Zealand taxes all persons on their income sourced in New Zealand, which means exercising its jurisdiction to tax foreign-based multinationals on profits attributable to their New Zealand operations. These profits, in theory, are expected to be commensurate with the economic contribution made (including commercial risk borne) by those New Zealand operations. 26.New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules are intended to measure the amount of income and expenditure of a multinational properly attributable to its New Zealand operation. Importance of transfer prices to determination of tax base 27.The transfer prices adopted by a multinational have a direct bearing on the proportional profit it derives in each country in which it operates. If a non-market value (inadequate or excessive consideration) is paid for the transfer of goods, services, intangible property or loans between those members, the income calculated for each of those members will be inconsistent with their relative economic contributions. This distortion will flow through to the tax revenues of their host countries. 28.For example, if a multinational sells to a controlled entity in a country at a high price (one that exceeds the market selling price), the profit it earns in that country is reduced. Similarly, if the multinational sells into a country at a low price, the profit it earns in that country is increased. 29.The following example illustrates the effect of transfer prices on the profit allocation between firms in two countries. For simplicity, it is assumed that neither firm incurs any distribution costs or other expenses (other than the cost of purchasing the product). 30.Consider a multinational that has a manufacturing operation in New Zealand and a distribution operation in Australia. The cost of producing one unit of a product in New Zealand is NZ$5.00. The finished product is then sold in Australia for NZ$15.00. The combined profit for each unit sold is therefore: NZ$10.00. Manufacturing inputs $5 New Zealand operation Australian operation Sales to third parties $15 Transfer price?? COMBINED PROFIT $10 Arm’s length principle Key points ï The transfer prices adopted by a multinational directly affect the amount of profit derived by that multinational in each country in which it operates. If a multinational adopts non-market values in its transactions, the income calculated for each of its members will be inconsistent with their relative economic contributions. ï The focus of New Zealandís transfer pricing rules is to ensure that the proper amount of income derived by a multinational is attributed to its New Zealand operations. ï New Zealandís transfer pricing rules are based on the armís length principle stated in para- graph†1 of Article†9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. ï New Zealand has adopted the armís length principle because it is considered the most reliable way to determine the amount of income properly attributable to a multinationalís New Zea- land operations, and, because it represents the international norm, it should minimise the potential for double taxation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 6 31.The allocation of the $10.00 per unit profit is determined by the price at which the product is trans- ferred from the New Zealand manufacturing operation to the Australian distributing operation. This inter-opera- tion price is referred to as the transfer price. 32.At one extreme, the transfer price might be set equal to the cost to the New Zealand operation ($5.00). The entire profit from each unit sold will then accrue to the Australian operation: New ZealandAustralian OperationOperation Transfer price $5.00 Sales$5.00$15.00 Costs( $5.00)($ 5.00) Profit$0.00$10.00 33.At the other extreme, the transfer price might be set equal to the ultimate selling price of the Australian operation ($15.00). The entire profit from each unit sold will then accrue to the New Zealand operation instead: New ZealandAustralian OperationOperation Transfer price $5.00 Sales$15.00$15.00 Costs( $ 5.00)($15.00) Profit$10.00$ 0.00 34.The transfer price adopted by a multinational determines where the profits of that multinational are sourced. Consequently, it also determines whether tax is imposed on the amount of income truly attributable to each jurisdiction in which the multinational operates. From a host government’s perspective, therefore, the focus of transfer pricing rules is to ensure that the proper amount of income is attributed to its jurisdiction. Arm’s length principle in New Zealand law 35.New transfer pricing rules was enacted by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995. The rules replaced the ones formerly found in section GC 1 (section 22, Income Tax Act 1976). The new rules apply from the start of the 1996/97 income year. 36.Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) provides a detailed description of how the legislation works. What follows is a discussion of the arm’s length principle, the concept about which the legislative mechanics have been built. 37.New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules are based on the arm’s length principle. The arm’s length principle is stated in paragraph 1 of Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention: “\[When\] conditions are made or imposed between ... two \[associated\] enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.” 38.Fundamentally, the arm’s length principle is based on the notion that the operation of market forces results in a true return to the economic contribution of partici- pants in a transaction. By seeking to remove the effect of the common ownership, the arm’s length principle seeks to reduce a transaction within a multinational to one that reflects the conditions that would have existed had the pricing of the transaction been governed by market forces. In this way, the true return to economic contribu- tion for each member of the multinational is determined. 1 39.The arm’s length principle has been enacted into New Zealand legislation in section GD 13 (6): “\[The\] arm’s length amount of consideration must be deter- mined by applying whichever ... method ... will produce the most reliable measure of the amount completely independent parties would have agreed upon after real and fully adequate bargaining.” 40.This rule does not say that an arm’s length price will result if a multinational sets its prices based on real and full internal bargaining. Rather, it recognises that real and fully adequate bargaining between unrelated parties is a feature of the operation of market forces in a transac- tion. Section GD 13 (6) therefore requires a multinational to adopt the price that may have arisen had its controlled transaction been governed by normal market forces. 41.The problem to be resolved is how a multinational should determine what price would have arisen if its transactions were subject to market forces. The solution advanced by the arm’s length principle is that a compara- ble transaction between independent parties (an “uncon- trolled transaction”) should be used as a benchmark against which to appraise the multinational’s prices (the “controlled transaction”). Any differences between the two transactions can then be identified and adjusted for. By adjusting the price adopted in the uncontrolled transaction to reflect these differences, an arm’s length price can be determined for the multinational’s transac- tion. 42.This, in simple form, is what applying the arm’s length principle is about. This theme is developed in subsequent chapters of these guidelines. Reasons for adopting arm’s length 1 It is accepted that the conclusion that market forces lead to the true return to economic contribution is, strictly speaking, debatable. However, it is not the purpose of these guidelines to argue the merits of the arm’s length principle over alternative approaches to resolving the transfer pricing problem. The arm’s length principle represents the developed international consensus on transfer pricing, which the New Zealand Govern- ment has chosen to follow. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 7 principle 43.New Zealand has adopted the arm’s length principle for two main reasons: • The arm’s length approach is considered the most reliable way to determine the amount of income properly attributable to a multinational’s New Zealand operations. • Because the arm’s length approach represents the international norm, the potential for double taxation is minimised. Merit of armís length approach for determining net income 44.A significant reason for adopting the arm’s length principle is that it is considered to provide the most accurate measurement of the fair market value of the true economic contribution of members of a multinational. 45.Parties transacting at arm’s length would be expected to endeavour to make efficient use of their resources. In doing this, firms seek to earn the full return to their economic activities. The arm’s length principle uses the behaviour of an independent firm as the bench- mark for what would be expected of a firm seeking to earn the true return from its economic contribution. By applying this benchmark to a multinational, the arm’s length principle seeks to remove the effect of any ownership relationship between members of the multina- tional from the transfer price it adopts. It is anticipated that this will result in each member of the multinational earning a return that is commensurate with its economic contribution and risk assumed. 46.The arm’s length principle also results in a broad parity of tax treatment for multinationals and independent enterprises. This avoids the creation of tax advantages or disadvantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. In so removing these tax considerations from economic decisions, the arm’s length principle promotes the growth of international trade and investment. Minimisation of double taxation 47.Double taxation is undesirable from the Govern- ment’s perspective, as well as from that of the multina- tional. While double taxation may increase tax revenue, at least in the short run, it is not conducive to the encour- agement of international trade and investment. This could have a detrimental effect on the economy in the long run. 48.The potential for double taxation is illustrated by revisiting our earlier example. Consider the effect if Inland Revenue were to require a transfer price of $12.00 to be adopted by the multinational, while the Australian Tax Office (ATO) required a price of $10.00 to be adopted instead. The following profit allocations would then result: New ZealandAustralian OperationOperation Transfer price$5.00$10.00 Sales$12.00$15.00 Costs( $ 5.00)($10.00) Profit$ 7.00$ 5.00 49.The true combined profit has remained unchanged at $10.00 per unit. However, the multinational is required to return $12.00 per unit for tax purposes. Clearly, tax is being imposed on more than 100% of the multinational’s profit. 50.To address this concern, an important principle followed in developing New Zealand’s rules was the need for consistency with the international norm. To this end, both the legislation and New Zealand’s guidelines have been based on the international consensus ex- pressed in the OECD guidelines, which deal with the appropriateness and application of the arm’s length principle in transfer pricing matters. 51.Because New Zealand’s approach is consistent with the arm’s length approach adopted by other jurisdic- tions, it should be easier for Inland Revenue to work with foreign tax authorities to minimise the potential for double taxation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 8 more secondary methods. Introduction 52.There are several accepted pricing methods for determining arm’s length transfer prices and a bewilder- ing set of criteria for applying those methods. One could be forgiven for thinking that these point towards some scientific way of approaching the issue which, if discov- ered, will lead one to the completely correct conclusion on the amount of an arm’s length transfer price. 53.In practice, transfer pricing is far from scientific. Instead, it requires first the identification of an independ- ent firm or firms against which the pricing of a multina- tional is to be benchmarked, and then a judgement on the extent to which the functions of the multinational are similar to or differ from those of the independent firm. It then requires a further judgement on the extent to which these similarities or differences have a material effect on the transfer price adopted by the multinational. 54.Several pricing methods have been developed in international practice for determining and appraising a taxpayer’s transfer prices. These methods are based on measuring a multinational’s pricing strategies against a benchmark of the pricing behaviour of independent firms in uncontrolled transactions. 55.New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation, in section GD 13 (7), prescribes that the arm’s length price is determined using one or more of the following methods: • The comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method • The resale price method • The cost plus method • The profit split method • Comparable profits methods. 56.The OECD refers to the CUP method, resale price method, and the cost plus method as traditional transac- tional methods. The profit split method and the compara- ble profits methods are referred to as transactional profit methods. 57.This chapter considers the principles underlying each of the various transfer pricing methods. An under- standing of these principles is useful for identifying the limitations of each method, and applying the methods in practice. 58.The discussion in this chapter also builds a foundation that will be developed in subsequent guide- lines, which will provide more detailed guidance and examples on the practical application of the pricing methods. Description of transfer pricing methods 59.A description of the acceptable transfer pricing methods and the differences between them is best given through the use of a simple example. Consider two members of a multinational that have the following profit Pricing methods: theoretical and practical considerations Key points ï There are five acceptable transfer pricing methods. These methods are tools for determining an armís length price, and require the exercise of judgement to be applied correctly. ï New Zealandís legislation does not impose an explicit hierarchy for the transfer pricing meth- ods. However, there is effectively a hierarchy in that certain methods may provide a more reliable result than others, depending on the quality of available data, and taxpayersí circum- stances. As a general rule, the most reliable measure of the armís length price will be deter- mined by applying the method that requires the fewest and most reliable adjustments to be made. ï Intangible property is a significant feature in much transfer pricing analysis, but also one of the most difficult to deal with. Because of its unique nature, it is often difficult to identify relevant comparables. The difficulty is compounded if intangible property is applied by both parties to a transaction, or is not readily identifiable. Taxpayers may need to consider applying a profit split approach in such circumstances. ï Generally, a transfer pricing analysis would be expected to result in a range of armís length outcomes, rather than a definitive armís length price. ï A key aim of taxpayers in transfer pricing should be to present a persuasive argument to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are set at armís length. To this end, taxpayersí transfer pricing practices will be more credible if they are supported by brief analyses under one or IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 9 and loss statements: Manufacturer Co: Sales to Distributor Co$10,000(transfer price) Less manufacturing costs ($ 5,000) Gross profit$ 5,000 Operating expenses($ 3,000) Net profit$ 2,000 Distributor Co: Sales to third parties$20,000 Less purchases from Manufacturer Co($10,000)(transfer price) Gross profit$10,000 Operating expenses($ 4,000) Net profit$ 6,000 60.The comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method focuses directly on the price of the property or services transferred between parties to a transaction. The price charged between independent parties forms the basis for determining the arm’s length price under the CUP method. 61.Thus in the example, the issue to be determined is whether the transfer price adopted between Manufac- turer Co and Distributor Co ($10,000) is consistent with the price adopted by independent firms for a comparable product in comparable circumstances. 62.The resale price method focuses on the gross margin obtained by the distributor. This margin repre- sents the amount from which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and make an appropriate profit in relation to its functions per- formed, assets used, and risks assumed. The margin obtained by independent distributors performing similar functions, bearing similar risks and contributing similar assets is used as the basis for determining the appropri- ate margin for the member of the multinational. 63.In the example, the gross margin obtained by Distributor Co is 50% ( 10,000 / 20,000 ). The issue to be determined is whether this margin is consistent with the gross margin earned by independent distributors per- forming comparable functions, bearing similar risks and employing similar assets to those of the multinational. 64.The cost plus method focuses on the gross mark- up obtained by the manufacturer. The arm’s length price is determined by adding a mark-up to the costs incurred by the member of the multinational to determine an appropriate profit in relation to its functions performed, assets used and risks assumed. This mark-up is deter- mined by reference to the mark-ups earned by compara- ble independent manufacturers performing comparable functions. 65.In the example, the gross mark-up obtained by Manufacturer Co is 100% ( (10,000-5,000) / 5,000 ). The issue to be determined is whether this mark-up is consistent with the gross mark-up earned by independent manufacturers performing comparable functions, bearing similar risks and employing similar assets to those of the multina- tional. 66.The profit split method starts by identifying the combined profit to be split between the related parties in a controlled transaction. In general, combined operating profit is used, although gross profits may be appropriate in some circumstances (paragraph 3.17, OECD guide- lines). That profit is then split between the parties based upon an economically valid basis approximating the division of profits that would have been anticipated and reflected in an agreement made at arm’s length. 67.In the example, the combined operating profit of Manufacturer Co and Distributor Co is $8,000 ($20,000 sales, less $5,000 manufacturing costs, less $7,000 operating expenses). One way that profit could be split might be on the basis of the relative contribution of each member to that profit. 68.The comparable profits methods are a range of methods that examine the net profit margin realised by a taxpayer from a controlled transaction relative to an appropriate base. Possible bases include the return on assets, operating income to sales, and other suitable financial ratios. The methods are globally referred to by the OECD as the “transactional net margin method” (TNMM). 2 69.In the example, the distributor may apply the ratio of net profit to sales, giving a net margin of 30% ( 6,000 / 20,000 ). The issue to be then determined is whether this net margin is consistent with the net margin earned by independent distributors performing comparable func- tions to those of the multinational. Hierarchy of methods 70.New Zealand’s legislation does not impose a hierarchy for the transfer pricing methods. However, there is effectively a hierarchy in that certain methods may provide a more reliable result than others, depending on the quality of available data, and a taxpayer’s circum- stances. This should become clear from the discussions that follow. 71.There is, however, no requirement for taxpayers to test pricing methods down a hierarchy (either inferred or explicit) to determine an appropriate method. For example, if it appears fairly clear that a CUP will not exist for a particular good or service, taxpayers are neither expected nor required to conduct an exhaustive search for comparables to demonstrate that the CUP method cannot reliably be applied before considering the use of an alternative method. 72.The availability of data is likely to be very impor- 2. Inland Revenue does not consider that there is any practical difference between the TNMM espoused by the OECD, the comparable profits method favoured in the United States (referred to there as the CPM), and the profit comparison method adopted by Australia (referred to there as the PCM). The term “comparable profits methods” used in section GD 13 (7)(e) would, in any case, be sufficiently broad to encompass all three approaches. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 10 tant in taxpayers’ choice of method. New Zealand is a small market, and this means reliable comparables may be very difficult for taxpayers to locate. Inland Revenue acknowledges this concern, and this is reflected in the guidelines’ approach to the use of foreign entities as tested parties and analyses prepared for foreign jurisdic- tions (see paragraphs 134-42). In addition, section GD 13 (7)(d) contemplates the use of the profit split method, which is less dependent on comparables than the other pricing methods. Foundation of traditional transactional methods 73.The traditional transactional methods (the CUP, resale price, and cost plus methods) form the starting point for considering the theory underpinning the arm’s length principle. The following discussion first builds a very simple scenario designed to illustrate the basic concepts behind the methods. The insights from this scenario are then developed in light of real world busi- ness factors. 74.The basic scenario is as follows: • A country has a number of small factories that manu- facture toasters. These toasters are identical to each other in all respects. Each of the manufacturers is similar in size and faces similar manufacturing costs. • The toasters are sold to consumers by a number of retail firms. All of the retailers sell the toasters to consumers at the same price. • No firm in the market is able to influence the market price by changing its output, nor is it possible for any firm to grow to such a size as to dominate the market. 75.The price we are interested in is the one at which the manufacturers sell the toasters to retailers (in a controlled cross-border transaction between related parties, this would be the transfer price). From the constraints of the scenario, it is clear that there will be an established market price for the toasters. This is because: • A retailer is not going to pay more to a manufacturer for a toaster than it would need to pay to obtain the toaster from some other manufacturer (the established market price). • A manufacturer is not going to accept less from a retailer for a toaster than it could receive from selling the toaster to an alternative retailer (the established market price). 76.No party can affect the market demand for toasters by changing the quantity of its output (meaning the price for toasters also cannot be affected). It follows, therefore, that there will be a standardised price in the market at which the toasters are sold by the manufactur- ers to the retailers. Applying the traditional transactional methods ñ an economics approach 77.The traditional transactional methods, in their purest form, are based on this scenario. Viewed through the eyes of an economist, the three traditional transac- tional methods effectively consider the transaction from three different perspectives. Regardless of the perspec- tive taken, each method results in the same arm’s length price being determined for the scenario in paragraph 72. 78.The economics approach to the traditional transactional methods is often perceived by tax profes- sionals to be an unconventional approach, perhaps because most tax professionals undertake their primary training in law and accounting. However, the approach is useful for identifying the assumptions underpinning each of the traditional transfer pricing methods, and this in turn makes the user more aware of the methods’ respec- tive strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of consider- ing the economics approach is to get beyond transfer pricing as a set of rules and processes to follow, and to get instead to the heart of what each of the methods is based on. By understanding the principles on which each method is based, taxpayers and Inland Revenue should be able to make a more realistic analysis of transfer pricing, given the nature of the tools being employed. 79.From an economics approach then, the resale price method considers the transaction from the perspec- tive of the manufacturer. The manufacturer has a toaster that it wants to have sold to consumers. The problem it faces is how to get its toaster to the market. The question it is asking, therefore, is how much it will have to pay to have someone sell its finished toaster to the market. Thus the resale price method is seeking to determine what portion of the final selling price is required to adequately reward the services performed by the distributor of a product. This portion is called the resale price margin. 80.This approach is easily reconciled with the conventional approach, which focuses instead on the retailer and asks what margin the retailer could reason- ably expect to receive for the functions performed, risks borne, and assets employed (paragraph 2.14, OECD guidelines). Essentially, the conventional approach treats the retailer as a seller of services. Although the retailer will set a price for those services, that price will ultimately be determined by what the market is prepared to pay for them. Thus the real question, even under the conven- tional approach, is how much the manufacturer will have to pay to have someone (the retailer) sell its finished toaster to the market. 81.Similarly, in relation to the cost plus method, the economics approach considers the transaction from the perspective of the retailer. The retailer wants to sell toasters to consumers, but needs to have someone manufacture the toasters to be able to sell them. The question it is asking, therefore, is how much it will have to pay to have someone manufacture the toaster so it can sell it to the market. Thus the cost plus method is seeking to determine what margin over the manufacturing costs IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 11 would need to be paid to adequately reward the services performed by the manufacturer of a product. 82.Again, this approach is easily reconciled with the conventional approach, which focuses on the manufac- turer. It seeks to add an appropriate mark-up to costs to reflect an appropriate profit in light of the functions performed, risks borne, assets employed and the market conditions (paragraph 2.32, OECD guidelines). But in a similar manner to the analysis for the resale price method, while the manufacturer may set a price based on some mark-up on costs, the ultimate price is determined by what the market (that is, the retailer) is prepared to pay for the product. So again, the real question is what margin over the manufacturing costs would need to be paid by the retailer to adequately reward the services performed by the manufacturer of a product. 83.Finally, from an economics approach, the compa- rable uncontrolled price (CUP) method effectively combines both the resale price and the cost plus methods into a single price. If a standardised market price exists for sales from the manufacturer to the retailer (which will be the arm’s length price under the CUP method), both the resale price and cost plus methods will point to that price as the arm’s length price. The resale price method will identify the arm’s length margin based on the standardised resale price less the standardised market price for sales to the retailer. Similarly, the arm’s length mark-up on cost will result in the standardised market price being determined. Economically speaking, therefore, the CUP method implicitly considers the price from the perspective of both the manufacturer and the retailer, but it does this by direct reference to the market price adopted. For this reason, the CUP method, when it can be applied reliably, is considered to provide the most accurate measure of the arm’s length price. 84.From an economics approach, therefore, the resale price and cost plus methods are concerned with provid- ing the retailer and the manufacturer respectively with an adequate reward for the economic functions that they perform. Thus the two methods place a strong focus on the functions performed by the parties to the transaction. 85.The CUP method is also implicitly concerned with rewarding the functions performed by each party to the transaction. However, it does this by focusing directly on the price of the product being transferred. This is a key difference between the traditional transactional methods in practice. The CUP method primarily focuses on the product being transferred, whereas the resale price and cost plus methods primarily focus on the functions being performed. Real world constraints 86.In practice, things are not as simple as the previous scenario suggests. The number of firms in a particular market may be small, or a single firm may even dominate the market. Toasters are not identical, but are differentiated by brand and quality. The question that needs to be addressed in practical transfer pricing is how such real world factors should be treated. 87.Transfer pricing uses the behaviour of an inde- pendent firm as a benchmark for the pricing behaviour that might be expected of a multinational if it were transacting under similar open market conditions. The traditional transactional methods, when applied in practice, make adjustments to the price used by the independent firm to reflect differences in the product of and the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by the multinational. 88.A multinational’s transfer pricing policy should therefore involve identifying as close an independent benchmark firm as possible, and then identifying and adjusting differences between the product and functions of the multinational from those of the independent benchmark firm. The multinational should then seek to quantify and adjust for the effect those differences would have on the price adopted for the transaction of the benchmark firm, and then compare that price with its own to see if the prices are consistent with each other. If the prices are consistent, it would be concluded that the multinational’s price is consistent with the arm’s length principle. 89.The toaster scenario outlined in paragraph 72 can be extended to reflect such differentiation. Consider the following examples: Example 1 One of the manufacturers discovers an improvement in the manufacturing process that significantly improves the quality of the toaster but at no additional manufacturing cost. This toaster is then branded and able to be sold to consumers at a premium to other toasters in the market. The distribution function performed by the retailer is no different for the branded toaster than for other toasters. 90.Considering first the resale price method, the key function to be priced is the distribution function. In the example, the manufacturer would not expect to have to reward the retailer of the branded toaster any more than it would to have an ordinary toaster distributed, because there are no abnormal functions being performed. The margin paid for normal toaster distribution would there- fore also be applied in determining the arm’s length price for the sale of the branded toaster. 91.Considering instead the cost plus method, the question is what mark-up on costs is appropriate. In this case, the manufacturer of the branded toaster has added something tangible beyond what the manufacturer of an ordinary toaster would. The retailer, therefore, would expect to have to pay a higher mark-up to the manufac- turer for the branded toaster than for an unbranded toaster, to reflect the improvement made by the manufac- turer. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 12 92.Determining the value of the improvement in applying the cost plus method may have significant practical problems, because it is likely to be difficult to identify a comparable independent firm to determine what the improvement is worth. While possible in theory, such an approach may be unrealistic in practice. Thus in example 1, the resale price method is likely to provide a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price, as there are fewer functions being valued under the resale price method and adjustments under that method will probably be more reliable than those required under the cost plus method (because of readier access to better quality comparables). Example 2 A retailer believes that it can profitably assign a brand to a toaster. By conducting a suitable advertising campaign, it considers it will be able to differentiate that toaster from other toasters in the market and sell it at a higher price. This turns out to be true, even though the toaster, apart from its branding, is no different from other toasters in the market. 93.In this example, if the cost plus method were to be used, the retailer would not expect to have to pay any more to the manufacturer for the branded toaster than it would pay to have an ordinary toaster manufactured. This is because the manufacturing function performed is the same for both branded and unbranded toasters. 94.If an attempt to use the resale price method is made instead, the manufacturer should not expect to be able to pay only the same margin to the retailer to sell the product as it would have to pay to have an ordinary unbranded toaster distributed. This is because the advertising function performed by the retailer has added brand value to the toaster, and requires greater compen- sation than is paid for the pure selling function performed for unbranded toasters. 95.Similar to the possible application of the cost plus method in example 1, an attempt to apply the resale price method in example 2 is likely to be unrealistic in practice, because of the difficulty in identifying reliable comparables to value the retailer’s additional marketing function. The cost plus method is likely to result in a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price, because it is only the simple manufacturing function that needs to be valued under that method. Most reliable method 96.The previous two examples have highlighted an important general principle in determining which method is likely to result in the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. As a general rule, the most reliable method will be the one that requires fewer and more reliable adjustments to be made. Thus in example 1, the resale price method required only that the gross margins of distributors be compared. By contrast, in addition to requiring that the gross margins of manufacturers be compared, the cost plus method also required an adjust- ment to be made to price the value of the manufacturer’s improvement. 97.Considering the application of the cost plus method in example 1 is still beneficial from a conceptual perspective. It highlights the need to make adjustments under that method to reflect the difference in functions performed by that manufacturer and the other manufac- turers (the additional development function). Making such adjustments to reflect better the differences in product and functions of a multinational and a bench- mark independent firm is an important feature of practical transfer pricing analysis. Intangible property 98.The previous discussion touched on, but did not directly identify, what is referred to as intangible prop- erty. In economic terms, intangible property is something that an entity owns, other than tangible property, that enables the entity to earn more from a particular activity than it could if it did not own it. The term “intangible” is given its economic sense in these guidelines. 99.Two forms of intangible property were identified in the previous section: • a manufacturing intangible, which produced a better quality toaster at no extra cost; and • a marketing intangible, which established a reputation for the toaster resulting in a valuable favourable consumer perception of the product. 100.An important question with intangible property is to whom the return to any intangible should accrue. In the examples in the previous section, it was concluded that the returns should accrue to the party that created the intangible. If the “retailer” created the intangible, the discussion suggested that some form of a cost plus method might be used to determine an arm’s length price, with the return to the intangible accruing to the “retailer”. Similarly, some form of the resale price method might be used if the “manufacturer” created the intangible, with the return to the intangible accruing to the “manufac- turer”. 101.This conclusion seems appropriate. Developing intangible property involves some degree of risk. At arm’s length, a firm undertaking such risk would expect to be compensated for bearing that risk. This compensation would arise in the form of the returns to any intangible it creates as a result of bearing the risk. Legal ownership of and economic contribution to intangible property inconsistent 102.It is important to note, however, that the legal ownership of an intangible can differ from the economic contribution to its creation. Further, the OECD guide- lines, at paragraphs 1.36 to 1.41, state that as a general rule, a taxpayer’s structuring of a transaction should be IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 13 respected in determining the arm’s length price. This means that in practice, the legal ownership of, rather than the economic contribution to, intangible property should be respected. This then leaves the question of how one should treat the contribution of a party to the value of intangible property if another party retains the legal ownership of that property. 103.Consider, for example, the development of a brand when it is introduced into a country. “XYZ” may be a brand of television set that is well recognised in its home country, but it may not be known when the television is first introduced into New Zealand. The subsequent development of the “XYZ” brand in New Zealand will attribute value to the television, but it may not be clear from where it has arisen. If the development is under- taken by the New Zealand operation, some of the value of the “XYZ” brand in New Zealand is attributable to that development. However, some of the value remains attributable to the value of the “XYZ” brand created in the home country. 104.The legal position of the intangible is quite clear – legal ownership remains entirely with the parent com- pany, even though its value has been enhanced by the marketing activities of its New Zealand subsidiary. The question is how this marketing activity should be compensated if the New Zealand subsidiary does not share in the legal ownership of the brand name. 105.At arm’s length, an independent party would not be expected to incur the cost and risk of a marketing strategy without anticipating something in return. Similarly, application of the arm’s length principle implies that a member of a multinational should not, for tax purposes, be seen to incur the cost and risk of a market- ing strategy without some form of compensatory benefit. In the case of the New Zealand subsidiary in the previ- ous paragraph, one option may be through a reduced price for trading stock purchased from the parent com- pany. Alternatively, the marketing might be treated as a service provided to the parent company, with reimburse- ment being provided on a cost plus basis. This treatment recognises that when independent firms incur costs that result in the creation of intangible value, they expect to also earn returns from that intangible. Joint ownership of intangible property 106.To further complicate the issue, intangibles are often not, in practice, readily identified or owned by only one party to a transaction. It is this feature of intangible property that makes transfer pricing so difficult to apply in practice. Real world multinationals have operations that are often integrated over the full range of manufac- turing, marketing and distribution functions. In such an environment it may not be readily identifiable that an intangible is being used in the process or which party (or parties) own, or have contributed to, that intangible. 107.Returning to the “XYZ” brand of television, for example, the parent company may have a manufacturing intangible that improves the quality of the television produced. The television may then be marketed in New Zealand under a new brand name, with legal ownership of that brand accruing to the New Zealand subsidiary. In that case, there would be valuable intangible property on both sides of the transaction. If comparables cannot be isolated to identify the value of the respective intangi- bles, two questions would need to be resolved: • How is the total value attributable to the intangible property to be ascertained? • How is this value to be allocated between the respec- tive intangible property? 108.One approach may be to attempt a direct applica- tion of the cost plus and resale price methods to the New Zealand and foreign operations respectively. Adjust- ments could then be made to reflect the intangible value generated by each of those operations. For example, the parent company may increase its mark-up on costs to reflect the market value of its manufacturing intangible in the television. The subsidiary would similarly charge a higher margin on a normal distribution return to reflect the value of its marketing intangible in the sale price to the market. 109.One obvious difficulty with this approach is finding comparable independent firms from which benchmark rates for these adjustments to the margins could be obtained. That is not to say that such an approach may not be feasible in some circumstances. However, taxpayers may find it necessary or desirable to adopt the alternative approach, which is to determine the aggregate profit from the transaction between the parties, and then divide this between the parties on the basis of their relative economic contributions. This is referred to as the profit split method. Profit split method 110.Two alternative approaches to the profit split method are outlined in the OECD guidelines. Under both approaches, the first step is to determine the combined profit attributable to the parties to the transaction. 111.The combined profit is then allocated as follows: • Under the residual profit split approach, each of the parties to the transaction is assigned a return to the basic functions that it performs. The residual profit is then allocated between the parties on the basis of their relative contribution to the intangible property. • Under the contribution analysis approach, it is gener- ally the combined operating profit that is divided between the parties on the basis of the relative contri- bution of each party to that combined gross profit. 112.The OECD guidelines do note, however, that these approaches are not necessarily exhaustive or mutually exclusive (paragraph 3.15). There may be alternative ways to split a profit that lead to a reliable arm’s length result. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 14 Residual profit split analysis 113.The residual profit split approach is intuitively the more appealing of the two approaches. It can be illus- trated by returning to the earlier toaster examples. 114.In the first toaster example, a manufacturer developed a manufacturing process that resulted in a superior quality toaster at no additional manufacturing cost. In the second example, it was the extensive adver- tising by a retailer instead that increased the value of the toaster. Consider now the scenario when both activities occur simultaneously for a product. 115.The residual profit split approach first provides a basic return to both the manufacturer and the retailer based on what independent firms would obtain for the simple functions of manufacturing and selling an ordi- nary toaster. Applying a cost plus method to the manu- facturer and a resale price method to the retailer could achieve this. The residual amount would then reflect the returns to the intangible property (the manufacturer’s quality improvement and the retailer’s marketing func- tion). The question is how this residual should be split. 116.The residual profit split approach would seek to divide the residual amount based on the parties’ relative contribution to the intangible property. This requires a judgement on what factors contribute to the residual profit, and their relative contribution. For example, it may be determined that the process development and the marketing are the only relevant contributors to the residual profit and that each contributes 50% of that profit. A 50:50 split of the residual profit between the manufacturer and the retailer would then be justified. 117.There is no definitive guide on how the relative contribution of the parties should be measured. It is quite likely that the transaction between the parties will be unique, so there will be no external benchmark available against which to test the reliability of the assessment of relative contributions. In practice, the assessment of relative contribution may, of necessity, need to be a somewhat subjective measure based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Contribution analysis 118.Multinationals are organisationally different from comparable domestic firms. One implication of this may be that an integrated multinational can reduce its costs below a level that can be achieved by a domestic firm. For example, the administration costs incurred by a multina- tional which both manufactures and retails toasters are likely to be less than the aggregated costs faced by two separate firms, one of which manufactures toasters, and the other which retails them. In the absence of intangi- bles, the price determined under the cost plus method would then be higher than the price determined under the resale price method. This means that there would be a negative residual if the residual profit split approach were to be used. 119.This phenomenon is referred to as economies of scope. Large integrated multinationals are able to benefit from cost savings attributable to the scope of their operations that are not available to independent firms. 120.Economies of scope do not fit nicely into tradi- tional arm’s length analysis. However, they are an important factor that needs to be addressed when determining whether a multinational’s transfer prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. 121.One approach to this problem may be to use the contribution analysis profit split approach. Under this approach, the combined gross profit of the two parties to a transaction is allocated between them on the basis of their relative contribution to that profit. This differs from the residual profit split approach in that basic returns are not allocated to each of the parties to the transaction before the profit split is made. Acceptability of profit split in other jurisdictions 122.There is some debate internationally about whether the use of the profit split method results in the determination of a true arm’s length price. The residual profit split method, for example, is conceptually little more than the use of a traditional transactional method, with an adjustment made to reflect the value of each party’s partial economic ownership of the intangible property. However, there are difficulties with applying the method in practice. Taxpayers need to be aware, therefore, that not all jurisdictions will readily accept the determination of an arm’s length price based on the profit split method. Comparable profits methods 123.The final set of methods to consider are the comparable profits methods. These involve the compari- son of net profit margins attained by a multinational against those attained by a comparable independent firm, relative to some appropriate base, such as costs, sales, or assets. The OECD refers to these methods collectively as the transactional net margin method (TNMM). 3 124.The TNMM, while being a transactional profit method, is more closely aligned to the resale price and cost plus methods than to the profit split method. The following income statement for a distributor illustrates this alignment in relation to a sales base: Sales to unrelated third parties$1,000 Less transfer price from related manufacturer$ 600 Gross profit$ 400 Less operating expenses$ 250 Net profit$ 150 125.Under the resale price method, the distributor’s relevant margin is its gross margin of 40% (the ratio of 3. As noted previously, Inland Revenue does not consider that there is any practical difference between the TNMM espoused by the OECD, the comparable profits method favoured in the United States, and the profit comparison method adopted by Australia. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 15 gross profit ($400) to sales to unrelated third parties ($1,000)). 126.The TNMM focuses on data from further down the distributor’s profit and loss account. For example, if operating expenses are used as the basis for appraisal, the ratio of net profit to operating expenses is 60% ( $150 / $250 ). Alternatively, using sales as the basis for appraisal, the ratio of net operating profit to sales is 15% ( $150 / $1,000 ). 127.The example illustrates why the TNMM is considered less reliable than the traditional transactional methods. The resale price method focuses only on the external sale price to third parties and the gross margin required to reward the function performed by the reseller. These factors are not overly sensitive to differences between the cost structure of a multinational and an independent firm. Thus if the multinational operates a more efficient distributorship than the independent firm, this will flow through to a higher net profit percentage when the resale price method is used. 128.By contrast, the TNMM is very sensitive to the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, because it includes operating expenses in its calcula- tions. An efficient firm will be given the same net profit percentage as an inefficient firm, unless some adjustment can be made to the net margins to reflect relative effi- ciency. For the reliability of the TNMM to be maximised, the multinational and the independent firm being com- pared would need to be structurally very similar. In practice, firms are structurally unique, and comparisons of indicators between firms will tend to be less reliable than comparisons made at the gross margin level. It is for this reason that the TNMM is considered in international practice, along with the profit split method, to be a method of last resort. 129.This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognised that reliable information on gross margins may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. Thus information constraints may dictate the TNMM as the only practicable approach in many cases. 130.Further, there may be situations where an attempt to use gross margins is inappropriate. Consider, for example, a manufacturer that acquires a partially manufac- tured product from a related party, completes the produc- tion of that product, and then sells the finished product to another related party. 131.Based on the preceding discussions, an immediate reaction to these facts may be to consider how the cost plus method might be applied, because a manufacturer is involved. However, in this case, the costs on which a mark-up is based would include the purchase price of the partially manufactured product, and that price is itself subject to question as to whether it is arm’s length. Intangible property in the production process may further complicate the issue. A TNMM based on some cost base (excluding the transfer price) may therefore be an appropriate way to determine a basic return for the manufacturer’s functions. Some practical considerations 132.The preceding discussions have outlined the broad principles on which the various transfer pricing methods are based. They have not provided detailed guidance on how the methods should be applied in practice. This will be the subject of subsequent guide- lines to be issued by Inland Revenue. Those guidelines will also contain practical examples. 133.The remainder of this chapter considers some relevant issues that have not been addressed in the preceding discussions. These are: • who the tested party in a controlled transaction should be • the use of analyses prepared for overseas tax adminis- trations • the evaluation of separate and combined transactions • the treatment of ranges of results • the use of multiple methods. Tested party 134.From New Zealand’s perspective, the concern is to determine the transfer pricing in relation to the New Zealand member of a multinational. This suggests that the focus should perhaps be on functions performed by the New Zealand member as the basis for determining and applying an appropriate pricing method. In other words, one might assume that the New Zealand member should automatically be the “tested party” for New Zealand transfer pricing purposes. 135.This assumption is not necessarily correct. The aim of transfer pricing is to determine the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. Taxpayers may, based on their circumstances and the information available to them, consider it more appropriate for the foreign party to a transaction involving the New Zealand member of a multinational to be the tested party in determining the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. For example, if the other party were a contract distributor, the obvious choice of method would seem to be the resale price method, based on the activities of that distributor. This might be the case, even though it involves applying the method to the functions of a foreign entity. 136.In deciding whether to use the foreign party to a transaction as the tested party, a taxpayer will need to consider its ability to obtain reliable information about comparable transactions from which to determine an arm’s length price. It may be that using a foreign tested party is impracticable because of information constraints. 137.From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the important point is that a pragmatic approach is required. Effective transfer pricing is not about a rigid application of a defined process to determine an arm’s length price. It is about using practical approaches that produce a reliable measure of the arm’s length price. In determining which party to a transaction to use as the tested party, taxpay- IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 16 ers should seek a practical solution that leads to a reliable measure of the arm’s length amount. 138.Taxpayers should be aware, however, that Inland Revenue is likely to use the New Zealand party as the tested party in appraising whether a taxpayer’s transfer prices are arm’s length. It is important, therefore, that if a taxpayer uses a foreign party as the tested party, the price determined is also considered in relation to the New Zealand operations, to ensure that it results in an appropriate return to those operations. Acceptability of analyses prepared for foreign tax administration 139.A question that is often raised by taxpayers is whether Inland Revenue will accept a transfer pricing analysis prepared for a foreign tax administration as evidence that a taxpayer’s New Zealand transfer prices are at arm’s length. 140.The answer to this will depend on whether the analysis prepared results in the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. Most analyses under the accepted pricing methods focus directly on only one side of a transaction (in the case of an analysis prepared for another jurisdiction, this is likely to be the foreign party to the transaction). In applying all but the profit split method, it is not necessary to consider specifically the implications of the price determined for the other party to the transaction. 141.In determining whether an analysis prepared for a foreign jurisdiction is likely to be acceptable to Inland Revenue, therefore, taxpayers should consider what effect the transfer prices adopted overseas would have for the New Zealand operations. Inland Revenue would expect an arm’s length price to result in a return to the New Zealand operations that is commensurate with its economic contribution and risks assumed. 142.If, for example, an analysis has been prepared that favours the foreign jurisdiction over New Zealand (perhaps because the other jurisdiction is more aggres- sive than New Zealand in administering its transfer pricing rules), that analysis is unlikely to be acceptable to Inland Revenue. However, if the analysis represents a fair application of the arm’s length principle and results in a return from the New Zealand operations’ perspective that is prima facie commensurate with that operations’ economic contribution and risk assumed, that analysis is more likely to persuade Inland Revenue that the transfer prices are arm’s length. Evaluation of separate and combined transactions 143.Ideally, to arrive at the most precise approximation of fair market value, the arm’s length principle should be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis. However, there are often situations where separate transactions are so closely linked or continuous that they cannot be evaluated adequately on a separate basis. The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 1.42, cite the following examples: • some long-term contracts for the supply of commodi- ties or services • rights to use intangible property • pricing a range of closely-linked products, such as in a product line, when it is impractical to determine pricing for each individual product or transaction • the licensing of manufacturing know-how and the supply of vital components to an associated manufac- turer. 144.In such cases, it may be appropriate to determine the arm’s length price with reference to some “basket of goods” or combination of transactions. 145. However, the converse may also be true. There will be cases where a multinational packages as a single transaction and establishes a single price for a number of benefits, such as licenses for patents, know-how, and trademarks, the provision of technical and administrative services, and the lease of production facilities. This type of arrangement is often referred to as a package deal. In these cases, it may be necessary to consider the compo- nent transactions of the package deal separately. This may occur when it is unfeasible to evaluate the package as a whole, or inappropriate to consider the package as a whole. This latter circumstance may occur if component parts are subject to different tax treatment under New Zealand tax law. 146.The OECD guidelines note, at paragraph 1.44, that a key principle to be followed in considering whether the transfer pricing should be determined for a combination of transactions or a package basis is that the transaction between related parties would need to be treated by the Revenue Authority in the same way that it would treat a similar deal between independent enterprises. Taxpayers should therefore be prepared to show that any package deal or combination of transactions reflects appropriate transfer pricing. Use of ranges 147.Because transfer pricing involves the application of judgement, it is generally not appropriate to refer to the arm’s length price. Instead, taxpayers can only be expected to determine an arm’s length outcome. 148.One feature of applying the transfer pricing methods is that they often result in a range of arm’s length prices, in which no one price is relatively more reliable than any of the others. As noted in paragraph 1.45 of the OECD guidelines, this may be because: • Application of the arm’s length principle only pro- duces an approximation of conditions that would have been established between independent enterprises. • Different points in a range may represent the fact that independent enterprises engaged in comparable transactions under comparable circumstances may not establish exactly the same price for the transaction. 149.Some jurisdictions have introduced statistical measures to determine where, within a range, a taxpayer’s IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 17 transfer price must fall to be acceptable to the tax admin- istration. New Zealand will not be adopting this ap- proach. Inland Revenue considers the more relevant issue is whether either: • the comparable adopted by a taxpayer to determine an arm’s length price is reliable; or • the comparables applied by a taxpayer in identifying an arm’s length range of prices in which the taxpayer’s transfer price falls are reliable. 150.Provided a taxpayer has adopted a reliable comparable (or comparables) in determining an arm’s length transfer price, Inland Revenue will not require that some other price also falling within an acceptable range of arm’s length prices be adopted instead. However, Inland Revenue would expect any comparable used to be applied consistently from year to year, unless the taxpayer has a sound reason why it no longer represents a reliable comparable. Confirming transfer prices through multiple methods 151.There are conceptual links between each of the transfer pricing methods. This means that there should be a general consistency between transfer prices deter- mined under each of the methods. 152.One of the taxpayer’s key aims in transfer pricing should be to present a persuasive argument to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are set at arm’s length. To this end, a taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices will be more credible if they are supported by analyses under one or more secondary methods. 153.This does not mean that a taxpayer should go to the same level of detail to demonstrate a price under more than one method. A brief analysis under one or more alternative methods that supports a well established and documented transfer pricing policy determined under a primary pricing method will add further credibility to that transfer pricing policy and reduce the likelihood that Inland Revenue will examine the taxpayer’s transfer prices in detail. Summary 154.Several important principles have been outlined in this chapter: • Transfer pricing is not scientific. It requires judgements to be made on the extent to which differences in product and functions between a transaction of a multinational and one of a comparable independent firm would be expected to have on relative price. • There are five acceptable transfer pricing methods. The direct focus of the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method is on product similarities. The other four methods focus instead on rewards to economic functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed. • Both members of a multinational may own valuable intangible property, and valuation of this property may make application of the transactional or TNMM methods impractical. It may be appropriate to consider applying a profit split in such circumstances. • It is not essential that a transfer pricing analysis focus on the New Zealand operations as a matter of course. There may be circumstances where an analysis based on the foreign party to a transaction may be more appropriate. • Generally, a transfer pricing analysis would be ex- pected to result in a range of arm’s length outcomes, rather than a definitive arm’s length price. Taxpayers will then be able to adopt any reliable price or compara- ble within that range. • Taxpayers’ transfer pricing practices will be more persuasive if they are supported by analyses under more than one acceptable pricing method. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 18 Introduction 155.Applying the arm’s length principle involves an appraisal of whether the transfer price adopted by a multinational is consistent with the price adopted by independent parties in a benchmark transaction con- ducted at arm’s length. 156.This appraisal process involves three steps: •A transaction (or transactions) involving an inde- pendent firm has to be identified as a basis for comparison. •Any differences between the transaction of the independent firm and that of the multinational must be identified. To be useful as a basis for determining the arm’s length price, the transaction (or transac- tions) of an independent firm has to be sufficiently similar to the one undertaken by the multinational that either: – none of the differences between the situations being compared can materially affect the relevant price or margin being compared: or – reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of any such differences. •The effect any differences would be expected to have on relative prices must be quantified. The price adopted by the independent parties is then adjusted to reflect these differences in determining an arm’s length price for the transaction of the multinational. 157.The notion of comparability is fundamental to all three steps in this process. 158.Several factors affect comparability. At one end of the range is the relatively simple notion of product differentiation, when the characteristics of the property or services being transferred differ in some manner. In the middle of the range is functional differentiation, when the characteristics of the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed differ in some manner. At the other end of the range are complex notions such as business strategies when, for example, a new product may be legitimately priced at a level well below that of competing products in order to establish market share in a new market. 159.This chapter considers the principles of compara- bility, and how taxpayers might take these principles into consideration in determining transfer prices that are consistent with the arm’s length principle. Principles of comparability Key points ï Comparability is fundamental to the application of the armís length principle. Transactions involving an independent firm are used as a benchmark against which to appraise the transfer prices adopted by a multinational. ï For comparisons between an independent firm and a multinational to be useful, the economi- cally relevant characteristics of the situations being compared must be sufficiently comparable, or reasonably accurate adjustments must be able to be made to eliminate the effect of any differences. ï Functional differentiation between a multinational and a benchmark independent firm is often the most significant factor in analysing comparability. With the exception of the CUP method, which focuses directly on product differentiation, application of the acceptable transfer pricing methods hinges on the comparability of functions performed, assets employed and risks as- sumed. ï A functional analysis is a useful tool for finding and organising facts about a business in terms of its functions, risks and intangibles. It identifies how the economically significant activities undertaken by a multinational are divided between each member involved in a transaction under review, and for which respective members should expect to be rewarded. ï Economic theory predicts that when various functions are performed by a group of independ- ent enterprises, the enterprise that provides most of the effort, and more particularly, the rare or unique functions, should earn most of the profit. It is the relative importance of the func- tions performed, rather than their quantity, that determines the party to which returns should accrue. ï In determining the extent to which differences between the multinational and independent party should be identified and priced, taxpayers should be conscious of the materiality of the adjustments being made. If comparability is taken to extremes, there is a risk that the analysis will result in an absurd determination of the armís length price. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 19 Product differentiation 160.The starting point for discussing comparability is with product differentiation. As noted in the previous chapter, the actual characteristics of the product or service being transferred are most critical when the CUP method is to be applied. This is because it focuses directly on the market price for a product, whereas the other methods focus more on the functions performed by each party to the transaction. 161.The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 1.19, cite a number of features that may be relevant in comparing two products: Characteristics that it may be important to consider include the following: in the case of transfers of tangible property, the physical features of the property, its quality and reliability, and the availability and volume of supply; in the case of the provision of services, the nature and extent of the services; and in the case of intangible property, the form of transaction (eg, licensing or sale), the type of property (eg, patent, trademark, or know-how), the duration and degree of protection, and the anticipated benefits from the use of the property. 162.These characteristics can be illustrated by way of example. Consider an independent firm and a multina- tional that both manufacture 1.5 volt AA size batteries. Both batteries may have the same size and shape, but the similarities may end there. For example: • An alkaline battery would sell at a premium to a standard (zinc carbon) battery, because the superior quality alkaline battery would be expected to last significantly longer than the standard battery. • A battery with a known brand would sell for more than an unknown brand, even if the quality of the two batteries were identical. Other things being equal, consumers would be expected to prefer the battery with an established reputation for reliability. • A multi-coloured battery may sell for more (or less) than an equivalent black battery, depending on the extent to which consumer preference is influenced by packaging. 163.These characteristics are not exhaustive. Even so, they illustrate the extent to which even apparently superficial differences, such as external colouring, can influence the price set. If the multinational were to use the CUP method as a basis for determining its transfer pricing for tax purposes, it would first need to identify all of the differences between its batteries and those of the independent manufacturer, and determine whether these differences are likely to have a material effect on price. The price of the batteries sold by the independent manufacturer would then need to be adjusted to reflect these differences in determining an arm’s length price for the multinational’s batteries. Functional differentiation 164.In practice, functional differentiation will tend to be more important than product differentiation. This is because it is often difficult to locate CUPs on which a transfer pricing analysis can be based. In that case, recourse will have to be made to one of the other pricing methods instead. Those other methods focus more directly on the functions being performed, assets employed and risks assumed, than on the product or service being transferred. It is the comparability of functions performed by the multinational and by the comparable independent party, therefore, that become central to the transfer pricing analysis. 165.An important tool in appraising functional differences between a multinational and an independent party is the use of functional analysis. Functional analysis is a method of finding and organising facts about a business in terms of its functions, assets (includ- ing intangible property), and risks. It aims to identify how these are divided between the parties involved in the transaction under review. 166.Economic theory predicts that when various functions are performed by a group of independent enterprises, the enterprise that provides most of the effort, and more particularly, the rare or unique functions, should earn most of the profit. For example, a subsidiary may be responsible for the entire assembly of a product. However, if the trademark, know-how and the selling effort rest with the parent, the subsidiary is only acting as a contract manufacturer. It should therefore be entitled to only a relatively small part of the profit (representing a fair return on the functions it performs). 167.Functional analysis serves, therefore, to identify the economically significant activities (functions per- formed, assets employed and risks assumed) that are undertaken by the member of an multinational, and for which it should expect to be rewarded. This identifies the nature and characteristics of the related party dealings that have to be priced. 168.Functional analysis also serves to help appraise the validity of an independent firm as a benchmark for appraising the behaviour of a multinational. Consider, for example, an independent firm and a multinational that both sell toasters. The independent firm sells at the retail level with a liability for claims under warranty. By contrast, the multinational sells at the wholesale level with no liability for defects. In this case, the independent firm’s functions are quite different from those of the multinational and would not ordinarily be used as a comparable. The multinational should instead attempt to locate a comparable independent firm operating at its own level of the market and performing similar functions and assuming similar levels of risk to itself. 169.A functional analysis will help to highlight where such significant functional differences may exist. How- ever, it must be noted that functional analysis is not a pricing method in its own right. Rather, it is a tool that assists in the proper determination of an arm’s length price. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 20 Characteristics of a functional analysis 170.A taxpayer’s main aim in determining and docu- menting its transfer prices should be to present a persua- sive argument to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are arm’s length. A functional analysis can serve two important purposes in this regard. 171.First, the functional analysis should provide those considering the transfer pricing policy of the multina- tional with a quick overview of the organisation, to assist them in familiarising themselves with its general opera- tions. Second, the functional analysis should seek to identify the functions performed by each member of the multinational, and assess the importance of each function to the overall operations of the multinational. Outline of multinationalís operations 172.The overview of the multinational will outline the overall structure and nature of the business undertaken by a multinational. Some internal documentation, such as organisational charts, may be useful in this regard. 173.General commercial and industry conditions affecting the multinational may also be relevant. This could include information such as • an explanation of the current business environment and its forecasted changes; and • how forecasted incidents influence the multinational’s industry, market scale, competitive conditions, regula- tory framework, technological progress, and foreign exchange market. 174.The multinational itself is not necessarily the only source of such information. Trade associations, for example, may publish trade journals or other documents, or have conducted studies of the market, or have access to industry experts, which may provide valuable informa- tion. Competitors and academics may also provide useful information for describing the environment in which the multinational operates. Analysis of functions of members of multinational 175.The next step in the process would be to provide some more direct consideration to the transaction under review. Relevant information here could include: • the nature and terms of the transaction • economic conditions and property involved in the transaction • how the product or service that is the subject of the controlled transaction in question flows among the related parties • information that might indicate whether independent firms dealing at arm’s length under comparable circum- stances would have entered into a similarly structured transaction. Contractual terms 176.The actual contractual terms of the transaction will also be relevant. The explicit contractual terms of a transaction involving members of a multinational may provide evidence as to the form in which the responsibili- ties, risks and benefits have been assigned among those members. 177.For example, the contractual terms might include: • the form of consideration charged or paid • sales or purchase volume • the scope and terms of warranties provided • rights to updates, revisions or modifications • the duration of relevant licenses, contracts or other agreements, and termination or renegotiation rights • collateral transactions or ongoing business relation- ships between the buyer and the seller, including arrangements for the provision of ancillary or subsidi- ary services • credit and payment terms. 178.The contractual terms will be relevant in determin- ing the comparability of a controlled and uncontrolled transaction. Any differences between the contractual terms of the transactions being examined would need to be adjusted in determining an arm’s length price for the controlled transaction. 179.However, there may be a limit to the usefulness of the contractual terms. In dealings at arm’s length, the divergence of interests between the parties ensures that they will ordinarily seek to hold each other to the terms of the contract. The contractual terms will be ignored or modified after the fact generally only if it is in the inter- ests of both parties. 180.The same divergence of interests may not exist for related parties. It may be necessary, therefore, to evaluate whether or not the conduct of the parties conforms to the terms of the contract. In some cases, the conduct of the parties may suggest the contractual terms to be a sham, or that they have been amended or superseded by a subsequent oral agreement. 181.Thus even if members of a multinational enter into explicit contractual arrangements with each other, they should still examine the actual functions performed by each member as part of their transfer pricing analyses. This requires an identification of the critical functions in the multinational’s operations, and a determination of which member (or members) is responsible for performing that function. Examples of relevant functions 182.At its broadest level, a functional analysis would result in the identification of such general categories as: • research and development • product design and engineering • manufacturing, production and process engineering • product fabrication, extraction, and assembly IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 21 • purchasing and materials management • marketing and distribution, such as inventory manage- ment, warranty administration and advertising • transport and warehousing • managerial, legal, accounting and finance, credit and collection, training, and personnel management services. 183.Even so, dividing functions performed by a multinational into such broad category descriptions will not generally be sufficient. Activities within these categories may be divided between a number of members of the multinational. It is also necessary, therefore, to consider more specific functions performed within these general categories. 184.Tables 1, 2 and 3 list relevant functions that could be assessed for the manufacturing, administrative, and marketing functions respectively. These tables are included for illustrative purposes only. They are not intended to provide an exhaustive list of the functions a multinational should identify as being performed by one or another of its members. Instead, they illustrate the types of functions that it may be relevant to assess in relation to the administrative, manufacturing and market- ing operations of the multinational. The tables are neither exhaustive nor limiting, since in practice, the relevant functions in those areas may be more or less than those outlined below.

Relative contribution of various functions 185.The sheer weight of functions performed by a particular member of a multinational is not decisive in determining whether that member should derive the greater share of the profit. It is the relative importance of each function that is relevant. The functions of a member relative to the other members of a multinational may be few, but if they are the most significant functions in the multinational’s operations, the member should be entitled to the major share of the profit.

Establishes credit terms. 17. Responsible for customer contact. 18. Supervises sales force. 19. Performs market research and develops new markets, 20. Identifies need for product modification. 186.It is therefore also relevant and useful in identify- ing and comparing the functions performed to consider the assets that are employed or to be employed. This analysis should consider the type of assets used, such as whether it is plant and equipment, or valuable intangi- bles. It should also consider the nature of the assets used, such as their age, market value, location, and property right protections available. 187.When intangibles are identified, it is necessary to clearly establish their nature before attempting to attribute to them any value or to take them into account in applying an arm’s length pricing method. Intangibles with different strengths will need to be rewarded differ- ently. For example, a patented production process may be useful, but it may be fairly simple to design around the patented aspects in order to achieve a similar outcome. This type of intangible should not receive the same level of relative reward as a breakthrough patent that uniquely reduces production costs and improves the product so that there is greatly improved customer demand. 188.A functional analysis can assist in identifying the intangibles and the way in which they are used. While judgement will still be needed to determine an appropriate reward for their use, a better decision is likely to be made once the nature of the intangibles and their role in the profit making process are properly understood. 189.For example, an enterprise may be the legal owner of a trademark and the name that it legally protects. It may attribute a high value to these trademarks for which it seeks a direct reward. Under license, subsidiary enterprises in different countries may separately produce, market and support goods bearing this name and trade- mark. A functional analysis should identify each party’s contribution to any manufacturing intangible or market- ing intangible. If the economic contribution to the intangible is shared between the parties, but only one party enjoys legal ownership of the intangible, the other party would, at arm’s length, be expected to seek some form of reward for its contribution. This would need to be taken into consideration in determining the arm’s length price, and could influence the selection of a transfer pricing method or the manner by which comparability is assessed against uncontrolled license agreements. Treatment of risk 190.A significant portion of the rate of return earned by a company reflects the fact that the company is bearing risks of various kinds. In the open market, this assumption of increased risk will be compensated by an increase in the expected return (although this does not mean that the actual return must necessarily also be higher, because this will depend on the degree to which the risks are actually realised). 191.An appraisal of risk is also important in determin- ing arm’s length prices. For example, controlled and uncontrolled transactions and entities will not be compa- rable if there are significant differences in the risks assumed for which appropriate adjustments cannot be made. 192.The possible risks assumed that should be taken into account in the functional analysis include: • risks of change in cost, price, or stock; • risks relating to success or failure of research and development; • financial risks, including change in the foreign ex- change and interest rates; • risks of lending and payment terms; • risks for manufacturing liability; and • business risk related to ownership of assets, or facilities. 193.The functions carried out will determine, to some extent, the allocation of risks between the parties, and therefore the conditions each party would expect in arm’s length dealings. For example, a distributor taking on responsibility for marketing and advertising is risking its own resources in these activities. It would therefore be expected to have a commensurately higher anticipated return from the activity than if it did not undertake the functions. This is in contrast to a distributor acting merely as an agent, who is reimbursed for its costs and receives the income appropriate to that lower risk activity. Similarly, a contract manufacturer or a contract research provider that takes on no meaningful risk would IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 23 be entitled to a smaller return than if it had assumed the risk. Consistency of risk allocation with economic substance 194.It must also be considered whether a purported allocation of risk is consistent with the economic sub- stance of the transaction. In this regard, the parties’ conduct should generally be taken as the best evidence concerning the true allocation of risk. A manufacturer may, for example, sell property to a related distributor in another country and claim that the distributor assumes all of the exchange rate risk. However, if the transfer price appears to be adjusted to insulate the distributor from the effects of exchange rate movements, the purported allocation of exchange rate risk may be challenged on the basis that it is inconsistent with the conduct of the parties. 195.Examples 3 and 4, which further illustrate the economic substance of risk allocation, are adapted from the United States’ transfer pricing regulations (Reg. §1.482-1(d)(3)(iii)(C)): Example 3 A wholly owned subsidiary (Sub Co) enters into a contract with its parent company (Parent Co). Under the contract, it is required to buy and take title to 20,000 units of Product X for each of the next five years. The price is fixed at $10 per unit. Sub Co markets Product X under its own label, and is responsible for financing all marketing for the product. Sub Co has adequate financial capacity to fund its obligations under the contract under any circumstances that could reasonably be expected to arise. As it transpires, Sub Co is able to sell only 11,000 units in each of the first three years, at a price of $11 per unit. In year 4, Sub Co sells its entire inventory of Product X (47,000 units) at a price of $25 per unit. 196.In example 3, the contractual terms allocating risk were determined before the risk was known or reasonably knowable. Sub Co also had the financial capacity to bear the risk, and its conduct was consistent over time. The conduct of the parties therefore confirms the contractual allocation of the risk to Sub Co. Example 4 The facts are the same as example 3, except that Sub Co has only limited capital, and is able to finance its obligations under the contract only through the provision of credit from Parent Co. 197.In example 4, the assignment of the risk to Sub Co is inconsistent with the conduct of the parties. Parent Co has, in substance, assumed the market risk that a large number of Product X would remain unsold. This is because Sub Co would be unable to repay Parent Co in the event that sales of Product X did not eventuate. 198.An additional factor to consider in examining the economic substance of a purported risk allocation is the consequence of such an allocation in arm’s length transactions. In arm’s length dealings it generally makes commercial sense for parties to be allocated a greater share of those risks over which they have relatively more control, and from which they can insulate themselves more cheaply than can the other party. This is illustrated in example 5: Example 5 Company A contracts to produce and ship goods to Company B, and the level of production and shipment of goods are to be at the discretion of Company B. 199.In example 5, Company A would be unlikely, at arm’s length, to agree to take on substantial inventory risk. This is because it exercises no control over the inventory level, while Company B does. 200.There are many risks, such as general business cycle risks, over which typically neither party has significant control. At arm’s length, these risks could be allocated to either party to a transaction. Analysis is required to determine to what extent each party bears such risks in practice. 201.For example, when considering who bears any currency exchange or interest rate risk, it will be relevant to consider the extent to which the taxpayer or the multinational group has a business strategy that deals with the management of such risks. Financial arrange- ments such as hedges, forward contracts, and put and call options, both “on-market” and “off-market”, are now in common use. Failure on the part of a taxpayer bearing currency exchange and interest rate risk to address such exposure may result from a business strategy of the multinational group that seeks to hedge some or all of the group’s overall exposure to such risks, which indicates that the taxpayer may not actually be bearing the eco- nomic exchange rate risk. Such a practice, if not ac- counted for appropriately, could lead to significant profits or losses being made which are capable of being inappropriately sourced in the most advantageous place to the multinational group. Example of a functional analysis 202.A company resident in country Y (Parent Co) manufactures automobile wheel balancing weights. It sets up a subsidiary in country Z (Sub Co) which does some manufacturing and some processing. In most cases, sales by Sub Co are made to Parent Co and the output warehoused by Parent Co until it is on-sold to independ- ent parties. However, Parent Co on occasion instructs Sub Co to freight the completed wheel weights directly to large independent companies from which Parent Co has taken orders. The freight-inclusive price for sales to large IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 24 independent companies by Sub Co are the same as if the sales had been made directly by Parent Co. 203.An analysis of the respective functions of Parent Co and Sub Co is shown in table 4: Table 4: Functional analysis for Parent Co and Sub Co Functions performedParent CoSub Co (country Y) (country Z) Design and development of factory machineryX Product planning developmentX Purchase of raw materialsX Fabrication of clipsX Moulding of lead around clipsXX Boxing and packaging of completed wheel weights for shipment to customersXX Warehousing of finished wheel weights in country Y X Sales: • direct to large companiesX • through agents to othersX When orders received through agents: • issued shipping instructionsX • billed and collectedX Supply of technical service: • control of flow of raw materialsX • control of flow of finished productsX Payment of freight: • clips, raw materials fromX country Y to country Z • completed weights fromX country Z to country Y Manufacturing of standard weights (large volume)X Manufacturing of special weights (low volume) X Manufacturing of wheel balancing machines X Ownership and licensed user of patent for wheel balancing procedure X 204.The functional analysis suggests that most of the profits should accrue to Parent Co. The number of functions performed is not the controlling factor in this determination. The most important functions generate the profit, and none of the functions performed by Sub Co are sufficiently significant in the overall operation to justify a large share of the profit. 205.A review of the functions performed indicates that the only functions performed by Sub Co are simple operations. Any contract manufacturer, who would not expect to earn a very high rate of return on its operations, could perform these functions. 206.Having determined the essential elements in the operation, consideration could now be given to locating third party information for comparable pricing. In this case, it would be necessary to identify a firm that per- forms a similar function to that of Sub Co, which is to mould lead around other objects. For example, firms that make fishing sinkers and battery connectors could be comparable, since they perform a similar function to Sub Co. Firms that mould other materials, such as plastic, might also be comparable. The important point is that the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by the independent firms are comparable to those of Sub Co. Concluding comments on functional analysis 207.The preparation of a functional analysis is an important tool that can assist in ensuring that an arm’s length consideration is determined in accordance with internationally accepted principles. 208.A functional analysis can be performed with varying levels of detail and can serve a variety of purposes. The scope of the analysis will be determined by the nature, value and complexity of the matters covered by international dealings and the nature of the taxpayer’s business activities. These include the strate- gies that the enterprise pursues and the features of its products or services. Also, factors such as the pricing method that is used and availability of data will affect the extent to which the analysis can be conducted. 209.By determining the relevant functions to be priced, the functional analysis can assist in the selection of a transfer pricing method. It can also assist in the analysis of the level of comparability present in control- led and uncontrolled dealings, and in an assessment of the relative contribution of the parties when a profit split method is used. 210.It is important, however, not to confuse the use of functional analysis with the determination of a transfer price. Functional analysis is not an alternative to search- ing for comparables. It is a means to establish what sort of comparables should be sought. 211.The next chapter sets out a four-step practical approach for determining transfer prices. The discussion in that chapter further considers functional analysis in a practical context. Other factors affecting comparability 212.Factors other than product specification and functions performed may, at arm’s length, affect the returns derived by a party to a transaction. The two most important of these factors are: • economic circumstances • business strategies. 213.As with product specification and functions performed, an analysis of these factors involves an appraisal of whether, and to what extent, they would be expected, at arm’s length, to have a material effect on price. Economic circumstances 214.Arm’s length prices may vary across different markets, even for transactions involving the same property or services. To achieve comparability requires that the markets in which the independent and related parties operate are comparable. Any differences must IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 25 either not have a material effect on price, or be ones for which appropriate adjustments can be made. 215.The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 1.30, identify a number of relevant factors for comparing markets. They include: • the geographic location of the market • the extent of competition in the market • the availability of substitute goods and services • transport costs • the size of the market • the level of the market, such as whether it is at the retail or wholesale level. 216.These factors may have particular relevance for New Zealand. Because New Zealand is a small country, it may be difficult to obtain comparables from the New Zealand market. Inland Revenue will accept the use of overseas comparables (eg, data from the Australian and United States markets) in taxpayers’ transfer pricing analyses. However, taxpayers using such comparables would be expected to assess the expected impact geo- graphic differences on the price. 217.For example, there may be data to indicate that the gross margins paid to distributors of product X in the United States is 20%. This does not mean that 20% will necessarily be an appropriate gross margin for New Zealand distributors. There are a number of factors that may indicate an alternative gross margin to be more appropriate. For example: • Consumer preferences may result in a different retail price for a product in the two countries. This raises the question of which party to the transaction should capture any premium in price. • There may be higher transport costs associated with the New Zealand market. The relative gross margins may be affected by who bears this cost. • The relative competitiveness of the distribution industries in New Zealand and the United States may differ. This could result in lower gross margins being paid in the more competitive market. • There may be differences in accounting standards that, if not adjusted for, could distort the relative margins of the parties being compared. 218.Thus while overseas comparables may be useful, taxpayers will need to exercise caution to ensure that appropriate adjustments are made to reflect differences between the New Zealand and foreign markets. Business strategies 219.Business strategies are also relevant in determin- ing comparability for transfer pricing purposes. Business strategies would take into account many aspects of an enterprise, such as innovation and new product develop- ment, degree of diversification, risk aversion, and other factors bearing upon the daily conduct of business. 220.Business strategies could also include market penetration schemes. A taxpayer seeking to penetrate a new market or to expand (or defend) its market share might temporarily charge a lower price for its product than the price for otherwise comparable products in that market. Alternatively, it might temporarily incur higher costs (perhaps because to start-up costs or increased marketing efforts) and hence achieve lower profit levels than other taxpayers operating in the same market. 221.The important issue is how one should appraise whether a business strategy that temporarily decreases profits in return for higher long-run profits is consistent with the arm’s length principle. The relevant question here is whether a party operating at arm’s length would have been prepared to sacrifice profitability for a similar period under such economic circumstances and competi- tive conditions. 222.Taxpayers can expect business strategies to be subject to closer scrutiny by Inland Revenue. This is not because such strategies are illegitimate. A business strategy such as market penetration can, and does, fail. However, the failure does not of itself allow the strategy to be ignored for transfer pricing purposes. 223.The reason for closer scrutiny is because the time bar on reassessment (section 108, Tax Administration Act 1994) places a limit on the time within which the Commissioner can adjust a taxpayer’s transfer prices. If projected increased profits fail to materialise because a purported business strategy is not actually followed by the taxpayer, Inland Revenue would not want to be time- barred from adjusting the taxpayer’s transfer prices. 224.Inland Revenue may consider a number of factors in evaluating a taxpayer’s claim that it is following a strategy that temporarily decreases profits in return for higher long-run profits. 225.First, the conduct of the parties could be examined to determine if it is consistent with the professed busi- ness strategy. For example, a manufacturer may charge its related distributor a below-market price as part of a market penetration strategy. However, one would expect the cost savings to the distributor to be reflected either in the price charged to the distributor’s customers or in greater market penetration expenses incurred by the distributor. Furthermore, unusually intensive marketing and advertising efforts would often accompany a market penetration or market share expansion strategy. 226.Second, the nature of the relationship between the parties to the controlled transaction could be examined to see if it is consistent with the taxpayer bearing the costs of the business strategy. For example, in arm’s length dealings a company acting solely as a sales agent with little or no responsibility for long-term market develop- ment would generally not bear the costs of a market penetration strategy. 227.Third, Inland Revenue could examine whether there is a plausible expectation that the business strategy will produce a return sufficient to justify its costs within a period of time that would be acceptable in an arm’s IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 26 length arrangement. If the expected outcome is implausi- ble at the time of the transaction, the taxpayer’s claim may be doubtful. Similarly, Inland Revenue would question a claimed business strategy that is unsuccess- ful, but nonetheless is continued beyond what an independent enterprise would accept. Materiality in a practical assessment of comparability 228.There is a limit to how far differences in compara- bility should be assessed in practice. This chapter has had a strong theoretical emphasis, which has meant that the discussion has generally ignored the concept of materiality. 229.If taken to extremes, an assessment of comparabil- ity could be argued to require that even immaterial differences, such as perhaps the choice of a red letter to emboss an otherwise plain white handkerchief in prefer- ence to a green letter, should be priced if the arm’s length principle is to be applied properly. 230.To draw such a conclusion would miss the purpose of this chapter. The determination of an arm’s length price must be a practicable exercise. Although theory suggests that each difference in product, func- tions, assets and risks should be priced, irrespective of how important it is, transfer pricing remains a practical, rather than a theoretical, science. 231.The purpose of a functional analysis, for example, is to understand the qualitative nature of the functions, assets and risks, to enable a comparison to be made with other enterprises that have similar functions, assets and risks. Allocating actual income to specific functions, assets and risks may be far too difficult a task, and is likely to lead to complexities in analysis. 232.Taking comparability to extreme levels can lead to an absurd examination. Many factors should instead be assessed as part of the business risks, and comparisons made at that level. The application of the transfer pricing methods is ultimately concerned with creating an analy- sis that is capable of producing a quantifiable result. Some factors that cannot be quantified may need to be addressed indirectly instead. Summary 233.This chapter has addressed the following key points: • The principle of comparability is fundamental to the determination of arm’s length transfer prices. This is because the prices and returns of an independent firm are used to benchmark the expected prices and returns of an multinational, and a reliable comparison requires comparable products or functions between the two. • The aim of taxpayers should be to demonstrate to Inland Revenue that their transfer prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. This is likely to involve identifying an independent firm as a benchmark, determining what the material differences are between the transactions of the multinational and the bench- mark independent firm, and then pricing those differ- ences to determine an arm’s length price. • A functional analysis is a useful tool for finding and organising facts about a business in terms of its functions, risks and intangibles. It identifies how the economically significant activities undertaken by a multinational are divided between each member involved in a transaction under review. It identifies the activities for which each member should expect to be rewarded, and thereby the nature and characteristics of the related party dealings to be priced. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 27 Introduction 234.Previous chapters considered the theory behind the acceptable transfer pricing methods, and the princi- ples of comparability that underpin all transfer pricing analysis. This chapter aims to work these theoretical building blocks into a coherent process that can be followed by taxpayers to determine their transfer prices. 235.Inland Revenue’s view is that when taxpayers use the four-step process outlined in this chapter, it will help develop the reasoning and documentation needed to support their evaluation of their transfer prices. However, the process outlined is neither a mandatory nor a pre- scriptive approach. The process adopted by a taxpayer will still depend on that taxpayer’s individual circum- stances. 236.Credit must be given here to the Australian Tax Office (ATO). The four-step process below follows their process outlined in paragraphs 509 to 591 of their draft transfer pricing ruling TR 95/D22 (issued 29 September 1995). Caveats to four-step process 237.Several caveats must be borne in mind when considering the following process: (a) The approach outlined below assumes that the nature of the international dealings is fairly extensive and necessitates a thorough analysis. For enterprises with relatively simple and/or low value international dealings with related parties, the extent of any data collection and analysis may be minimal. (b) It may be possible in some cases to adopt either a pricing method or a specific price that has been developed and applied by a multinational on a global basis, after some confirmatory analysis and consid- eration of its suitability and reliability in relation to the New Zealand member of the multinational. However, the data used to support the pricing method will need to be carefully considered in terms of its relevance and reliability for New Zealand market conditions. (c) The analysis contained in this chapter complements the documentation created by enterprises in the normal course of their business dealings. Related parties need to show that their association has not inappropriately affected the nature and terms of their dealings. This requires them to undertake more analyses and keep specific records to demonstrate the arm’s length nature of their dealings in circum- stances where independent enterprises could merely rely on their normal business records. This additional requirement cannot be eliminated without sacrificing the integrity of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. 238.Table 5 summarises the four-step process. Step 1: Understand the cross-border dealings between related parties in the context of the business 239.The taxpayer and Inland Revenue staff will need to understand the nature and extent of the dealings between the taxpayer and related parties in the context of the taxpayer’s business. It is important for a taxpayer to be able to explain: • how the international related-party dealings of the enterprise are undertaken • the purpose or object of the dealings • what the taxpayer obtains from its participation in the dealings, such as products, services, or strategic relationships • the significance of the dealings to the taxpayer’s overall business activities and those of the multina- tional group. 240.At this stage of the process, therefore, the taxpayer should prepare some documentation that outlines these considerations. The insight developed in this process will assist in determining the extent of any Practical application of arm’s length principle Key points ï Practical transfer pricing generally involves following a process to determine armís length transfer prices. The four-step process developed by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) is one such process that may be followed. ï Inland Revenue endorses the four-step process as a useful tool for taxpayers to develop their reasoning and documentation needed to support their evaluation of their transfer prices. However, taxpayers are not obliged to use the process in determining their transfer prices. ï In developing a process for determining transfer prices, taxpayers need to be aware that their purpose is ultimately to be able to persuade Inland Revenue that their transfer prices are consistent with the armís length principle. Taxpayers are encouraged to consider discussing their transfer pricing processes with Inland Revenue if they are concerned about their accept- ability to the Department. continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 28 Table 5: the four-step process This is an illustration of the four-step process for setting or reviewing tr process is properly undertaken, the taxpayer should have a lower risk o f Step 1: Understand the cross-border dealings between the as enterprises in the context of the taxpayer’s business Identify cross-border dealing with associated enterprises and collect or maintain relevant documentation to explain the nature of those dealings in the context of the taxpayer’s business.

To utilise its excess capacity and to establish an arm’s length price, the firm increases its output to capacity. The additional output is then sold to an independent firm at a nominal margin above marginal cost, with that margin being established with a view to creating a desirable comparable for transfer pricing purposes. The sale to the independent firm would not represent a valid comparable for transfer pricing purposes because one of the principle purposes of the transaction is to establish an arm’s length price. Step 2: Select the pricing method or methods 247.Section GD 13 (8) requires that the choice and resultant application of a method or methods for calculat- ing an arm’s length price must be made having regard to: • the degree of comparability between the uncontrolled transactions used for comparison and the controlled transactions of the taxpayer • the completeness and accuracy of the data relied on • the reliability of all assumptions • the sensitivity of any results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. 248.The application of these criteria will depend on the quality of the information available to the taxpayer. Thus at this stage of the process, the taxpayer will need to make an assessment of the quality of the data it has available. This assessment should be made for the purpose of determining which pricing method (or meth- ods) is likely to provide the greatest consistency with the factors in section GD 13 (8), and result in the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price required under section GD 13 (6). 249.To this end, the information obtained in step 1 can assist with the: • determination of comparability when traditional transactional methods are appropriate; and/or • determination of comparability between enterprises when pricing methods using profit comparisons are appropriate; and/or • allocation of the consideration between the enterprises when a profit split method is applicable. Step 3: Application of the pricing method or methods 250.Once a pricing method (or methods) has been chosen, the preliminary functional analysis prepared in step 1 can be extended to reflect that choice of method. Figure 1 shows how the functional analysis may be used differently depending upon the method that is used. functional analysis that might be needed for an analysis of comparability in applying the arm’s length principle. 241.The taxpayer should also develop a preliminary functional analysis to consider the broad functions performed by the relevant members of the multinational. This will assist in determining an appropriate pricing method in step 2 of the process. 242.The functional analysis should not be comprehen- sive at this stage. As will be discussed in step 3 of the process, the detail included in a functional analysis is affected by a taxpayer’s choice of pricing method. At this stage, the aim of the functional analysis should be to determine which method (or methods) is likely to be appropriate to the taxpayer’s circumstances, and the nature of the information that will be required to apply that method. Location of comparables 243.A taxpayer should also, at this stage, begin to assess potential sources of information on which to base its analysis. These comparables may be identified internally within the group (if a member of the multina- tional transacts with an independent external party), or by reference to transactions between independent external parties. 244.If internal comparables can be located, it is likely that they will be more reliable than external comparables. This is because: • They are more likely to “fit” the affiliated transaction as they occur within the context of the group’s business. • More information about the comparable situation should be readily available. • One internal comparable may be sufficient to support a defence of the transaction under review, whereas a wider base of support may be required if external comparables are used. 245.It should be noted, however, that internal transac- tions may not provide reliable comparables if they do not occur on normal arm’s length terms. For example, internal transactions are unlikely to provide reliable comparables for determining an arm’s length price if: • they are not made in the ordinary course of business; or • one of the principle purposes of the uncontrolled transaction is to establish an arm’s length price in relation to the controlled transaction. 246.The following examples illustrate these points: Example 6: A company is forced into bankruptcy and, as a result, sells all of its products to unrelated distributors for a liquidation price. Because those sales are not made in the ordinary course of business, they will not represent a valid comparable for transfer pricing purposes. Example 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 30 251.If a pricing method involving external benchmarking with independent enterprises is being used, the functional analysis assists in determining the comparability of the dealings of the multinational with uncontrolled dealings of the independent parties. The main purpose of this is to establish the degree of compa- rability. It is not, therefore, necessary to value the functions, assets and risks of each of the enterprises separately. However, it is essential to ensure that if there are differences in the significance of the functions, assets and risks to each of the businesses that these differences be taken into account. 252.The functional analysis can be performed with varying levels of detail and can serve a variety of purposes. The analysis may be applied on a product or divisional basis for individual transactions, or it could be applied up to a corporate group basis. The scope of the analysis will be determined by the nature, value and complexity of the matters covered by international dealings. It will also be determined by the nature of the taxpayer’s business activities, including the strategies that the enterprise pursues and the features of its products or services. Step 4: Arriving at the arm’s length amount and introducing processes to support the chosen method 253.The taxpayer will be required to demonstrate how its data have been used in the application of its chosen pricing method to determine an arm’s length amount. 254.The process to date can deliver to a taxpayer an objective, documented and considered review of the available material and possible choices for arriving at an arm’s length outcome. However, the nature of the arm’s length principle is such that there are a number of practical problems in its application. Transfer pricing will always require an element of judgement, and taxpayers and Inland Revenue need to bear this in mind in under- taking their transfer pricing analysis. 255.It also needs to be noted that transfer pricing does not end with the initial analysis. Taxpayers will need to implement appropriate processes to: • ensure the availability of data for subsequent review analyses; and • allow modifications to be made in the choice and application of a pricing method to reflect changes in their circumstances or market conditions, or if the process followed does not result in a commercially realistic outcome given their facts and circumstances. Concluding comments 256.This chapter has outlined a four-step process that can be used to assist taxpayers develop their transfer pricing analysis. For a more detailed exposition of the process, reference can be made to the ATO ruling TR 95/D22. 257.The process in this chapter is not intended to be prescriptive. Each taxpayer’s circumstances are unique, and a taxpayer will there- fore have to develop a process that suits its individual circumstances. 258.If taxpayers are concerned about whether their transfer pricing process will be acceptable to Figure 1: Use of functional analysis with each methodology Are accurate comparables available, either from internal or external sources?

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 32 Introduction 259.A taxpayer’s main purpose in preparing and maintaining documentation should be to place itself in the position where it can readily demonstrate to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. 260.A number of factors must be considered in determining the extent to which taxpayers should prepare documentation. 261.First, Inland Revenue requires information to be able to appraise whether taxpayers’ transfer prices are arm’s length. Documentation makes Inland Revenue’s reviewing task easier and, to the extent that it readily demonstrates that taxpayers have complied with the arm’s length principle, reduces the likelihood that Inland Revenue will examine those transfer prices in detail. It will also assist in the resolution of any transfer pricing issues that may arise. 262.On the other hand, preparing documentation involves both time and financial cost to taxpayers. They should not be required to go to such lengths that the compliance costs associated with preparing documenta- tion are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk. 263.A balance between Inland Revenue’s need for information and the potential compliance costs faced by taxpayers is achieved in the legislation through the burden of proof rule in section GD 13 (9). That rule provides that the price determined by a taxpayer will be the arm’s length price, except if: • the Commissioner can demonstrate a more reliable measure of the arm’s length amount than that adopted by the taxpayer; or • the taxpayer does not co-operate with the Commission- er’s administration of the transfer pricing rules. 264.Taxpayers are still required to comply with the arm’s length principle. However, by documenting that their transfer prices are arm’s length, they can ensure that the statutory burden of proof remains on the Commis- sioner. This reduces the likelihood that a transfer pricing adjustment will be made by the Commissioner in terms of section GD 13 (9). 265.It is important to recognise Inland Revenue’s role in administering the transfer pricing rules. The latter part of this chapter sets out a number of options that can be pursued if Inland Revenue is to seek to challenge taxpayers’ transfer prices. The earlier part of the chapter sets out what taxpayers can do to reduce this risk. It is important to note, however, that Inland Revenue’s approach to administering the rules will not involve a presumption that taxpayers’ transfer prices are not set at arm’s length. 266.Whether or not Inland Revenue examines a taxpayer’s transfer prices in detail will depend largely on the extent to which its transfer prices are perceived to present a risk to the revenue. Taxpayers who are per- ceived to represent a high tax risk are more likely to have their transfer prices examined in detail than low risk taxpayers. Documentation Key points ï A taxpayerís main purpose in preparing and maintaining documentation should be to place itself in the position where it can readily demonstrate to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are consistent with the armís length principle. ï There is no explicit statutory requirement to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documen- tation. However, if, in Inland Revenueís view, a taxpayerís documentation inadequately ex- plains why its transfer prices are considered to be consistent with the armís length principle, Inland Revenue is more likely to examine those transfer prices in detail. The lack of adequate documentation may also make it difficult for the taxpayer to rebut an alternative armís length transfer price proposed by Inland Revenue. ï Inland Revenue considers it to be in taxpayersí best interests to prepare documentation that demonstrates the process followed in determining armís length transfer prices. ï If Inland Revenue adjusts a taxpayerís transfer prices, the quality of the taxpayerís analysis and documentation will be a factor in determining the extent to which penalties might apply under the compliance and penalties provisions enacted in 1996. ï Taxpayers are not expected to prepare levels of documentation that are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk in their transfer pricing transactions. The cost of preparing documentation should be weighed against the risk that Inland Revenue will make a transfer pricing adjustment in determining the extent to which documentation should be prepared. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 33 267.Importantly, however, if a taxpayer can demon- strate that it has set its transfer prices in accordance with the arm’s length principle and documented how those prices have been determined, Inland Revenue is likely to conclude that its transfer pricing practices represent a low tax risk. Inland Revenue’s role will then primarily be one of monitoring. While this does not necessarily preclude those transfer prices from being examined in detail, Inland Revenue considers the likelihood of a lower risk rating to be a compelling reason for taxpayers to determine and document their transfer prices adequately. 268.An important question is what documentation it is prudent for taxpayers to prepare if they are to demon- strate compliance with the arm’s length principle. Unfor- tunately, it is not possible to specify a comprehensive pre-defined set of documentation requirements that meet the requirements of all taxpayers because appropriate documentation depends on each taxpayer’s specific facts and circumstances. This chapter therefore can go no further than attempt to set out the factors that should be considered by taxpayers in determining an appropriate level of documentation in their specific circumstances. 269.As a general rule, however, Inland Revenue considers that taxpayers should look to document the process they have followed and their analysis in deter- mining transfer prices. This should include some justifi- cation of why those transfer prices are considered to be consistent with the arm’s length principle. 270.The extent to which taxpayers should undertake such analysis will be dependent on their assessment of the level of business risk they carry in their transfer pricing policies. Clearly, taxpayers do not want to incur costs that are disproportionate to the amount of tax at risk, nor does Inland Revenue expect such a level of costs to be borne. 271.However, it is not Inland Revenue’s place to specify the amount of analysis and documentation that would be prudent in a taxpayer’s circumstances. That is a business decision to be determined by the taxpayer, based on its assessment of risk and the degree of security it desires in relation to its transfer pricing policies. 272.This chapter is divided into two parts: • Part A considers statutory and other factors that must be considered by taxpayers in determining the amount and quality of the transfer pricing documentation that should be prepared and maintained in their particular circumstances. • Part B then considers Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing enforcement strategy and the tools available for obtaining and applying information if taxpayers’ transfer prices are to be examined in more detail. Part A: Statutory and other considerations in determining documentation to be maintained Statutory requirements to maintain documentation 273.The starting point for considering documentation is with taxpayers’ statutory obligations to prepare and maintain records. This sets the framework within which taxpayers’ transfer pricing documentation obligations must be established. 274.Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires taxpayers to maintain sufficient business records to enable the Commissioner to ascertain their net income. However, the general tenor of section 22 is to require the retention of source documents in relation to entries in a taxpayer’s books of account. It does not contemplate the preparation and retention of documentation to justify, on economic and commercial considerations, that those prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. Inland Revenue accepts, therefore, that section 22 has little direct application for the preparation and retention of transfer pricing documentation. 275.Section GD 13 also does not explicitly require taxpayers to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation. The onus is instead on the Commis- sioner, based on an analysis consistent with section GD 13 (6) to (8), to demonstrate a more reliable arm’s length amount than that adopted by a taxpayer. 276.However, section GD 13 does require taxpayers to determine their transfer prices in accordance with the arm’s length principle. To demonstrate compliance with this requirement, Inland Revenue considers it would be necessary for taxpayers to prepare and maintain docu- mentation to show how their transfer prices have been determined, and why these prices are considered to be consistent with the arm’s length principle. 277.The first consideration in reaching this conclusion is the burden of proof rule in section GD 13 (9). The burden of proof rule is important because it will influence whether an alternative price proposed by Inland Revenue will be acceptable to the Courts. It is therefore an impor- tant factor for Inland Revenue to consider in determining whether an alternative measure of the arm’s length amount can be substituted for the one adopted by a taxpayer. 278.Section GD 13 (9) provides that the price deter- mined by the taxpayer will be the arm’s length price, unless: • the Commissioner can demonstrate a more reliable measure of the arm’s length amount than that adopted by the taxpayer; or • the taxpayer does not co-operate with the Commission- er’s administration of the transfer pricing rules. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 34 price will be more persuasive in the face of an inquiry by Inland Revenue if its analysis is sound and is supported by good quality documentation. Inland Revenue is likely to use a taxpayer’s documentation (or lack of it) as an important factor in determining whether the taxpayer’s transfer prices present a risk to the revenue, and whether they should receive further attention. If a taxpayer has developed a sound transfer pricing policy, and that policy is clearly documented and made available to Inland Revenue, the risk of an in-depth audit and possi- ble adjustment will be diminished. 284.However, the creation and maintenance of documentation imposes costs on taxpayers. A prudent business manager would weigh the risk of a transfer pricing adjustment being made by Inland Revenue against the cost of developing and documenting an appropriate transfer pricing analysis in determining the extent to which documentation should be prepared. Inland Revenue does not expect taxpayers to prepare levels of documentation that are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk in their transfer pricing transactions. 285.This raises the important question of how the compliance and penalties provisions would apply if a taxpayer argued that it was prudent, on the basis of a sensibly prepared cost-risk analysis (an assessment of business risk), not to pursue a full transfer pricing analysis for the transactions in question. 286.In Inland Revenue’s view, if a taxpayer has reached the conclusion on the basis of a sensible cost- risk analysis that it is not prudent to pursue a fuller transfer pricing analysis, this would be strongly sugges- tive that reasonable care has been taken by that taxpayer. Inland Revenue would still expect to see, however, documentation explaining how the conclusion was reached. 287.However, more would be expected from the taxpayer if Inland Revenue is to be persuaded that the taxpayer has an acceptable interpretation. Section GD 13 requires a taxpayer to determine its transfer prices in accordance with the arm’s length principle. For an acceptable interpretation to exist, Inland Revenue considers that a taxpayer must have explicitly considered whether its transfer prices are at least broadly consistent with the arm’s length principle in assessing the risk of a potential transfer pricing adjustment. To demonstrate this, Inland Revenue would expect to see, at a minimum, the following documentation: • an identification of the cross-border transactions for which the taxpayer has a transfer pricing exposure • a broad functional analysis of the taxpayer’s opera- tions, to identify the critical functions being performed • an estimation of the business risk of not undertaking and documenting a more detailed transfer pricing analysis • an estimation of the costs of complying with the 279.A taxpayer electing not to prepare transfer pricing documentation leaves itself exposed on two counts. First, it is more likely that Inland Revenue will examine a taxpayer’s transfer pricing in detail if the taxpayer has not prepared documentation. Second, if Inland Revenue as a result of this examination substitutes an alternative arm’s length amount for the one adopted by the taxpayer, the lack of adequate documentation will make it difficult for the taxpayer to rebut that substitution, either directly to Inland Revenue or in the Courts. 280.The second consideration in concluding that it would be prudent for taxpayers to prepare and maintain documentation to show how their transfer prices have been determined is the required standards of care under the compliance and penalties provisions. Section GD 13 (9) contemplates that a taxpayer will do more than merely select an arbitrary transfer amount. Specifically, section GD 13 (9) contemplates that a taxpayer will determine its transfer prices for tax purposes in accord- ance with the rules in section GD 13 (6) to (8). Section GD 13 (6) requires a taxpayer to determine the arm’s length amount using whichever of the method or methods in section GD 13 (7) produces the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount. Further, section GD 13 (8) requires a taxpayer to determine the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount, having regard to: • the degree of comparability between the uncontrolled transactions used for comparison and the controlled transactions of the taxpayer • the completeness and accuracy of the data relied on • the reliability of all assumptions • the sensitivity of any results to possible deficiencies in the data and assumptions. 281.In Inland Revenue’s view, adequate documenta- tion is the best evidence that can be presented to demonstrate that these rules have been complied with. If a taxpayer has not prepared any transfer pricing docu- mentation, and Inland Revenue is able to demonstrate a more reliable measure of arm’s length amount, Inland Revenue’s view is likely to be that the taxpayer has, at a minimum, not exercised reasonable care (carrying a 20% penalty under section 141C of the Tax Administration Act 1994) or has been grossly careless (carrying a 40% penalty under section 141C of the Tax Administration Act 1994) in its determination of an arm’s length amount under section GD 13. Depending on the circumstances, Inland Revenue might even take the position that the stronger penalties are applicable. Trade-off between compliance cost and tax risk 282.An important issue that needs to be considered concerns the trade-off between the costs of complying in determining an accurate measure of the arm’s length amount and the risk that Inland Revenue will audit and adjust a taxpayer’s transfer prices. 283.A taxpayer’s determination of the arm’s length IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 35 transfer pricing rules. 288.Even if the taxpayer concludes that it is not prudent to undertake a full transfer pricing analysis, it must be noted that Inland Revenue is not precluded from examining and substituting a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price (although it should not be assumed that Inland Revenue will review a taxpayer’s transfer prices in detail merely because limited documentation has been prepared on the strength of a cost-benefit analysis). Further, a cost-risk analysis will be insufficient to avoid the unacceptable interpretation penalty (if applicable) if it is not a reasonable conclusion on the strength of the analysis that it is unnecessary to pursue a full transfer pricing analysis. The extent to which documentation should be maintained will be determined by the taxpayer. In making this determination, the taxpayer will need to weigh the benefits of having well-documented transfer pricing practices against the costs involved in producing the documentation and the consequences of having inadequate documentation. Evidence of adequate documentation 289.Assuming that a cost-risk analysis indicates that a taxpayer should pursue a full transfer pricing analysis, the question arises as to what documentation would indicate adequate consideration by a taxpayer of the factors in section GD 13 (8). In Inland Revenue’s view, this would be documentation that records the processes followed and the analysis undertaken by the taxpayer in the course of pursuing an adequate transfer pricing policy. 290.An adequate transfer pricing policy will seek to establish transfer prices based upon information reason- ably available to the taxpayer at the time of the determina- tion. For example, the OECD guidelines, at paragraph 5.3, note that a taxpayer ordinarily should consider whether its transfer pricing policy is appropriate for tax purposes before its transfer prices are set, and in doing so, could be expected to have: • made a determination regarding whether comparable data from uncontrolled transactions is available; and • examined conditions used to establish transfer pricing in prior years, if those conditions are to be used to determine transfer pricing for the current year (in New Zealand’s case, this is only likely to have application for prices set for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years under the new transfer pricing rules). 291.The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 5.4, go on to state that: The taxpayer’s process of considering whether transfer pricing is appropriate for tax purposes should be determined in accordance with the same prudent business management principles that would govern the process of evaluating a business decision of a similar level of complexity and impor- tance. Time for determining transfer prices 292.Ideally, a taxpayer will set and document its actual prices for a transaction in accordance with the arm’s length principle when or before the relevant transaction occurs. 293.However, Inland Revenue recognises that taxation transfer prices of a multinational can legitimately differ from the actual transfer prices it adopts for other pur- poses. From the perspective of operating the multination- al’s day-to-day business, it may not necessarily be important to determine arm’s length transfer prices at the time a transaction occurs if, for example, the transfer price adopted will not affect the level of output of members of the multinational. In that case, a transaction within a multinational might proceed on the basis of one price, with an arm’s length price being determined for tax purposes only once the taxpayer prepares an income tax return for the period in which the transaction occurs. Any transfer pricing documentation would then be fully compiled at the time the income tax return is completed. 294.In deciding whether taxation transfer prices should be determined when a transaction occurs or when an income tax return is being prepared for the relevant income year, a taxpayer will need to have regard to the persuasiveness of the resulting analysis in demonstrat- ing to Inland Revenue that transfer prices have been set at arm’s length. A particular consideration here will be the accuracy with which the facts and circumstances that existed at the time the transaction occurred can be determined, and valid comparables correspondingly identified. If there is insufficient relevant information available, it may be necessary to reconstruct the condi- tions under which the transaction occurred, which may reduce the quality of the transfer pricing analysis. 295.To avoid this difficulty, Inland Revenue considers that a taxpayer should, as far as practicable, seek to collect and retain documentation that is: • existing at the time the taxpayer was developing or implementing any arrangement that might raise transfer pricing issues; or • brought into existence close to the time the transaction occurs. 296.Such documentation might include books, records, studies, analyses, conclusions and any other written or electronic material recording information that may be relevant in the subsequent determination of transfer prices under section GD 13. 297.Inland Revenue views the maintenance of such documentation as a prudent business practice, which should make an evaluation of transfer prices at the time of preparing an income tax return more reliable than a prudential review performed after the event without the aid of such documentation. This would enhance the persuasiveness of a taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices, as it reduces the likelihood that the taxpayer’s transfer pricing analysis will seek to justify retrospectively its transfer prices without regard to the true facts and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 36 circumstances under which the transaction occurred. A taxpayer will need to weigh up the likely effect of delays between the time a transaction occurs and the time at which an arm’s length price is determined in deciding the appropriate time to determine and document its transfer prices. In any case, maintaining documentation that either existed at the time a relevant transaction occurred, or was brought into existence as close as practicable to the occurrence of that transaction, will improve the persuasiveness of the taxpayer’s transfer pricing analysis. Process for determining transfer prices 298.In determining the arm’s length price, a taxpayer would generally complete initially some form of func- tional analysis, and gather data on relevant comparables. This would be expected to point to some appropriate pricing method under which the arm’s length price will be determined. Once the appropriate method has been determined, the process becomes one of applying the relevant data to determine the arm’s length price. 299.Inland Revenue would expect, therefore, that a taxpayer’s documentation would generally reflect this process. The Department would expect to see: • some form of functional analysis • an appraisal of potential comparables • an explanation of the process used to select and apply the method used to establish the transfer prices, and why it is considered to provide a result that is consist- ent with the arm’s length principle • details of any special circumstances that have influ- enced the price set by the taxpayer. 300.A taxpayer may choose, for example, to document a process such as the ATO’s four-step process outlined in the previous chapter. The adoption of such a process would be acceptable to Inland Revenue. 301.Alternatively, the taxpayer may choose to develop its own process for determining arm’s length transfer prices. The key point, however, is that whatever process is adopted, a taxpayer should aim to evidence in its documentation how its transfer prices have been deter- mined, and why they are considered to be consistent with the arm’s length principle. Preparation of transfer pricing-specific documentation 302.The arm’s length principle imposes requirements on related parties that independent parties dealing at arm’s length would not have. For example, independent firms are not required to justify the price of their transac- tions for tax purposes, but multinationals are required to justify the price adopted in their controlled transactions to evidence compliance with the arm’s length principle. Taxpayers may therefore be required to prepare or refer to written materials to which they would not otherwise prepare or refer to, such as documents from foreign related parties. 303.The OECD guidelines, at paragraph 5.7, outline the general rule for the preparation of transfer pricing- specific documentation: While some of the documents that might reasonably be used or relied upon in determining arm’s length transfer pricing for tax purposes may be of the type that would not have been prepared or obtained other than for tax purposes, the taxpayer should be expected to have prepared or obtained such docu- ments only if they are indispensable for a reasonable assess- ment of whether the transfer pricing satisfies the arm’s length principle and can be obtained or prepared by the taxpayer without a disproportionately high cost being incurred. The taxpayer should not be expected to have prepared or obtained documents beyond the minimum needed to make a reasonable assessment of whether it has complied with the arm’s length principle. 304.In general, Inland Revenue agrees with the rule outlined by the OECD. However, Inland Revenue does not categorically endorse the OECD position that the taxpayer should provide information only if the cost of obtaining such information is not disproportionately high, if such information is being sought from a foreign related party and is indispensable to the transfer pricing analysis. 305.In Inland Revenue’s view, the close relationship between the parties prima facie discredits the argument that the costs of obtaining the information are dispropor- tionately high and that it should not, thererfore, be obtained. Inland Revenue will, therefore, not generally accept such an argument from a taxpayer. Retention of records 306.Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that records be kept for: • seven years after the income year for which they apply • if requested by the Commissioner in writing, for up to three more years. 307.To the extent that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing documentation is not governed by section 22, there is no direct statutory obligation on the taxpayer to retain that documentation for any specified period of time. However, consistent with section 22, it would seem prudent for a taxpayer to retain its transfer pricing documentation for at least the normal statutory period. 308.Further, it may be prudent to maintain some documentation beyond this period, if that documentation is relevant to the setting of transfer prices for a year later than that for which the documentation was originally prepared. Such documentation might include: • records in relation to long-term contracts; or • records to determine whether comparability standards relating to the application of a transfer pricing method in a subsequent year are satisfied. 309.The key issue to be considered in deciding IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 37 whether to retain documentation beyond a seven-year period is whether the documentation in question is likely to be important to support the integrity of a transfer pricing analysis for a subsequent year. Maintaining records other than in English 310.Section 22 requires certain records to be kept in New Zealand, and maintained in the English language. However, the Commissioner may approve a written request to keep some records outside New Zealand, or maintain them in a language other than English. 311.To the extent that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing documentation is not governed by section 22, there is no statutory requirement for transfer pricing documentation to be prepared and retained in English. However, for records retained in a language other than English that are indispensable to the transfer pricing analysis, Inland Revenue would expect the taxpayer to comply with reasonable requests for translation of those documents. Part B: Inland Revenue’s approach to transfer pricing administration Introduction 312.This part of the chapter considers several impor- tant issues in Inland Revenue’s administration of the transfer pricing rules. 313.Consideration is given first to Inland Revenue’s approach to transfer pricing audits. The discussion confirms that Inland Revenue will, prima facie, assign a taxpayer a low risk rating if the taxpayer has a considered and sustainable transfer pricing policy and is willing to demonstrate how its transfer prices have been deter- mined. 314.It then gives consideration to responses that are available to Inland Revenue if a taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices are to be reviewed, and those practices, or the taxpayer’s co-operation, are found to be inad- equate. Inland Revenue’s approach to transfer pricing reviews and audits 315.The transfer pricing rules enacted in New Zealand are designed to be effective, but are not intended to impose compliance costs beyond the minimum needed for a reasonable assessment of whether taxpayers have complied with the arm’s length principle. However, taxpayers must recognise that the Commissioner has a statutory obligation to quantify the correct amount of tax for all taxpayers, and this includes ensuring that taxpay- ers involved in cross-border transactions comply with the transfer pricing rules. 316.Resource constraints dictate that Inland Revenue cannot look at all transactions in detail. As a conse- quence, Inland Revenue’s Compliance Programme focuses its resources on perceived risk to the revenue. Taxpayers with a high perceived risk are more likely to be reviewed or audited than those perceived to have a low risk. 317.Inland Revenue’s general approach in developing a compliance strategy and determining the type of review or audit that is appropriate for a specific taxpayer is to identify and rate potential tax risk. Transfer pricing is only one of a number of potential risk areas that would be considered in determining whether or not a full tax audit of a taxpayer is warranted. 318.Transfer pricing-specific reviews or audits could be undertaken if Inland Revenue considers them appro- priate. However, their prevalence would ultimately depend on the extent of the perceived tax risk associated with the affected taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices. Inland Revenue’s assessment of risk 319.Several key factors can be identified to assist in the measurement of risk associated with transfer pricing. Using these factors, Inland Revenue will be able to assess whether a taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices represent a low, medium or high tax risk. A taxpayer falling in the medium to high tax risk brackets is more likely to have some attention focused on its transfer pricing practices. 320.Figure 2 provides a quick summary of the main factors Inland Revenue will consider in determining a company’s risk rating. It should be noted, however, that the facts of specific cases may mean either that additional factors become relevant to the rating of audit risk, or that they may alter the general indications given in the diagram. The factors outlined in figure 2 are given for guidance only. Low riskMedium riskHigh risk APA exists. Actively- negotiated transfer price Strong economic and commercial basis Very co-operative Documents clearly support most reliable method and are available Excellent compliance record Limited involvement in negotiations with parent Limited economic and commercial basis Moderate co-operation Documents support most reliable method and are available Good compliance record No involvement in negotiations with parent No economic or commercial basis Poor co-operation Limited documents made available Poor compliance record Figure 2: Rating of audit risk Low riskMedium riskHigh risk APA exists.

A company will not automatically be rated as a high risk taxpayer merely because it rates a high risk for one of the relevant factors. Binding ruling/Advance Pricing Agreement exists 322.If a taxpayer seeks a binding ruling or Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), Inland Revenue will be actively involved in the process of establishing whether the taxpayer’s transfer pricing practices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. Any Inland Revenue compliance activity for the income years for which the APA applies is therefore likely to be confined only to checking that the taxpayer is complying with the terms of the APA (and the assumptions on which the APA is based). Basis for establishment of transfer pricing practice 323.The way a taxpayer’s transfer prices have been established will also provide a guide to the potential tax risk of the taxpayer’s practices. Factors that may be considered here will be the extent to which there is real local input and negotiation of the transfer prices (al- though these factors do not, of themselves, necessarily lead to arm’s length prices) and the extent to which those prices conform to underlying economic and commercial considerations. 324. Internal financial analyses could prove useful in this regard, as they may act as compelling evidence that prices have been set on a commercial basis even if, in retrospect, the prices appear to have lead to unreason- able outcomes (for example, poor cost controls by one of the parties has resulted in that party making losses while the other party has remained profitable). Financial projections undertaken before a transaction occurs could also indicate whether the transfer prices adopted would provide sufficiently acceptable commercial returns that parties transacting at arm’s length might proceed with the transaction on those terms. Transactions involving non-DTA countries 325.Taxpayers should be aware that Inland Revenue may look at certain transactions more closely than other transactions. For example, Inland Revenue is likely to inspect a transaction involving an entity resident in a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement (and in particular, a low-tax jurisdiction country) more closely than a transaction involving tax treaty countries. 326.The existence of a double tax agreement is important here. The exchange of information provision in each of these agreements enables Inland Revenue to verify information provided by taxpayers. 327.It may therefore be prudent for a taxpayer to prepare a higher level of justification for the transfer prices it adopts in transactions with non-treaty countries, to reduce the likelihood that Inland Revenue will assign the taxpayer an unfavourable risk rating. 328.This consideration becomes even more important in relation to low-tax jurisdiction countries. Inland Revenue’s perception is that transactions involving these countries are often (but not always) motivated by tax, rather than strictly commercial, reasons. Taxpayers must be conscious of this perception in determining how much justification should be given to their transfer prices. Burden of proof rule 329.The two most important factors in Inland Rev- enue’s appraisal of a taxpayer’s risk rating will be the quality of a taxpayer’s documentation and the taxpayer’s co-operation with Inland Revenue’s enquiries. These two factors are closely linked to the burden of proof rule. Implicit in Inland Revenue’s consideration of these factors will, therefore, be an appraisal of the likelihood that a taxpayer’s transfer prices could be overturned if Inland Revenue is not satisfied that they are set at arm’s length. 330.The Income Tax Act 1994 formally places the burden of proof in New Zealand in transfer pricing matters initially on the Commissioner (although this does not remove the onus on a taxpayer to comply with the arm’s length principle). However, under section GD 13 (9), the burden can be shifted to the taxpayer in two situations: • The Commissioner can demonstrate a more reliable measure of the arm’s length amount than that adopted by the taxpayer; or • The taxpayer does not co-operate with the Commis- sioner’s administration of the transfer pricing rules. 331.Without adequate information, Inland Revenue will not be able to administer the transfer pricing rules effectively. Failure to voluntarily produce documentation that shows how transfer prices have been set is likely, therefore, to result in the taxpayer being assigned a higher risk rating by Inland Revenue. It may also result in the non-co-operation rule being invoked. 332.It will not be sufficient for Inland Revenue to attempt to substitute an arbitrary arm’s length amount if section GD 13 (9) applies. Section GD 13 (9) requires the Commissioner to determine an arm’s length price with reference to the factors in section GD 13 (6) to (8). However, if this onus is met, the burden of proof will be shifted to the taxpayer, and will take the form of a rebuttable presumption in favour of the adjustment IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 39 proposed by Inland Revenue. Demonstration of more reliable measure of armís length price 333.The first way Inland Revenue can overturn the taxpayer’s determination of the arm’s length price is to demonstrate a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price. In determining whether to investigate a taxpayer’s transfer prices further, Inland Revenue will appraise the likelihood of whether this onus to demonstrate a more reliable measure can be discharged. A key factor in this appraisal will be the extent to which the taxpayer can (and is willing to) demonstrate that its transfer prices are based on a well-considered appraisal of relevant factors affecting its operations. The quality of a taxpayer’s documentation will be an important factor here. 334.For example, if a taxpayer has merely selected an arbitrary amount as the transfer price, it may be a rela- tively straightforward matter for Inland Revenue to demonstrate a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price under section GD 13 (9)(a) than that adopted by the taxpayer. 335.By contrast, if a taxpayer has a thoroughly considered transfer pricing policy, with well-documented analyses and conclusions, it will probably be very difficult for Inland Revenue to discharge the burden of proof in demonstrating a more reliable measure of the arm’s length price. 336.Unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, a well-considered and documented transfer pricing policy is likely to result in the taxpayer being assigned a favourable risk rating. However, the same cannot be said for a taxpayer with inadequately documented transfer pricing policies. Such a taxpayer is likely to be assigned a high level of perceived risk, and is, therefore, more likely to be subject to a more in-depth audit inquiry. Co-operation 337.The extent to which a taxpayer co-operates with Inland Revenue will also have a significant influence on that taxpayer’s risk assessment. Importantly, if a taxpayer does not co-operate with the Commissioner’s administra- tion of the transfer pricing rules, and that non-co- operation materially affects the Commissioner’s adminis- tration of the transfer pricing rules, section GD 13 (9) permits the burden of proof to be transferred to the taxpayer. 338.Section GD 13 (9) is primarily intended to help Inland Revenue obtain information from a taxpayer to examine its transfer prices. In this context, Inland Rev- enue considers that non-co-operation occurs in its broadest sense if a taxpayer decides not to provide to Inland Revenue relevant information that it has reason- ably available. 339.The important point, however, is that access to information is required if the Commissioner’s statutory functions under the Act are to be administered. Inland Revenue considers that it is in a taxpayer’s best interest to prepare and retain documentation that indicates that it has adequately considered the factors in section GD 13 (8) in setting its transfer prices. If a taxpayer has undertaken such an approach and voluntarily produces its documentation to Inland Revenue, the application of the non-co-operation rule becomes irrelevant. 340.However, if a taxpayer does not prepare adequate documentation, and provide it to Inland Revenue if requested, it will, at best, result in a poor risk rating. At worst, it is possible that Inland Revenue may attempt to invoke the non-co-operation provision. Neither approach is conducive to the efficient administration of the transfer pricing rules, from either the taxpayer’s or Inland Rev- enue’s perspective. Despite the options available, Inland Revenue’s preference would clearly be for a co-operative environment in which transfer pricing issues might be readily resolved. Conclusions on burden of proof rule 341.Despite the burden of proof being placed initially on the Commissioner, Inland Revenue considers it to be clearly in a taxpayer’s best interests to make reasonable efforts to: • develop an appropriate transfer pricing policy • determine the arm’s length amount in accordance with section GD 13 (6) to (8) • voluntarily produce documentation to evidence their analysis. 342.If a taxpayer co-operates with Inland Revenue’s administration of the transfer pricing rules and has a considered, sustainable and well documented transfer pricing policy that supports an arm’s length price, it is likely to be very difficult in practice for Inland Revenue to discharge the burden of proof to substitute an alternative transfer price to the one adopted by the taxpayer. 343.A co-operative approach between taxpayers and Inland Revenue is considered the ideal way to administer the transfer pricing rules, and this will be borne in mind in Inland Revenue’s application of the rules. However, if co- operation breaks down as a result of an act or acts of the taxpayer, Inland Revenue may invoke the non-co- operation rule as necessary. Inland Revenue’s access to and use of documentation 344.There are two general sources from which Inland Revenue can obtain information. The first is from the taxpayer, by way of enquiries into its transfer pricing practices. Alternatively, information may be sought from sources external to the taxpayer, such as: • other taxpayers within the same or similar industry • other jurisdictions, through the exchange of informa- tion provisions in a double tax agreement. 345.In the context of a review of a taxpayer’s volun- IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 40 tary compliance with the transfer pricing rules, Inland Revenue’s primary source for obtaining information will be from the taxpayer itself. However, in certain circum- stances, Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain adequate information from this source may be limited for reasons other than that taxpayer’s non-co-operation. For example, Inland Revenue does not expect taxpayers to produce documents that are not available to the taxpayer because they are unpublished, and cannot be obtained by normal inquiry or from market data. 346.Inland Revenue will take these limitations into consideration in determining whether taxpayers have complied with their documentation obligations. However, taxpayers must recognise that despite limitations on their ability to obtain documentation, Inland Revenue may, if a risk assessment suggests that the taxpayer’s transfer prices should be examined in greater detail, have to seek information from alternative sources if the taxpayer is unable to provide complete information. 347.Consequently, taxpayers should take into consid- eration that adequate record-keeping practices and the voluntary production of documents can improve the persuasiveness of its approach to transfer pricing. This will be true whether the case is relatively straightforward or complex, but the greater the complexity and irregularity of the case, the more significance will attach to documen- tation. Obtaining information from foreign related parties 348.Specific mention needs to be made of obtaining information from foreign related parties. Two issues need to be considered here: • the relevance of the information to the transfer pricing analysis • difficulties that may be faced by taxpayers in obtaining the information. 349.If a non-resident parent dictates the transfer price adopted by its New Zealand subsidiary, and the subsidi- ary has limited, if any, documentation to demonstrate why its transfer prices comply with the arm’s length principle, then it may be necessary to have recourse to documentation held by the non-resident parent if the taxpayer’s transfer prices are to be reviewed. However, if a taxpayer has a well-documented policy for determining arm’s length transfer prices based on appropriate economic and commercial considerations, it is unlikely that Inland Revenue would need to have such recourse. 350.Inland Revenue acknowledges that taxpayers may face difficulties obtaining information from foreign related parties that would not be encountered if they were required to produce only their own documents. For example: • When the taxpayer is a subsidiary of a foreign related party, information may be difficult to obtain because the taxpayer does not have control of the related party. • Accounting standards and legal documentation requirements (including time limits for preparation and submission) may differ from country to country. • The documents requested by the taxpayer may not be of the type that prudent business management princi- ples would suggest the foreign related party would maintain. • Substantial time and cost may be involved in translat- ing and producing relevant documents. 351.In considering whether to request that taxpayers provide information from foreign affiliates, Inland Revenue will take these potential difficulties, and the relevance of the required documentation, into considera- tion. However, Inland Revenue considers that the integrity of the transfer pricing rules would be under- mined if such arguments were considered to be sufficient to justify the non-provision of relevant information from foreign affiliates. 352.To resolve issues efficiently, Inland Revenue considers it to be in taxpayer’s best interests for foreign affiliates to provide relevant information when requested. Because of the close relationship between the parties, Inland Revenue considers it reasonable to expect taxpayers to obtain such information. 353.If foreign affiliates do not co-operate in providing relevant information, it is uncertain as to whether the non-co-operation provision can be applied by Inland Revenue. However, regardless of whether the provision can be applied, taxpayers must be aware that the failure to provide information is likely to result in a higher risk rating. Further, Inland Revenue is likely to have a greater need to access information from alternative sources to test whether their transfer prices are arm’s length. 354.Taxpayers should also be aware of the provisions of section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, relating to payments made for acquisitions from a related foreign party. That section allows the Commissioner to deny a deduction in relation to an offshore payment made by a taxpayer if the taxpayer, or any other person, fails to provide information requested under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 within 90 days of the date that request is mailed. The information requested by the Commissioner would then not be admissible by the taxpayer as evidence in judicial proceedings. Taxpayers must be aware that Inland Revenue can invoke the provision if relevant information from foreign affiliates is not provided voluntarily. Storage and submission of records to Inland Revenue 355.It is prudent for transfer pricing documentation to be prepared by taxpayers as close as practicable to the time the relevant transactions occur. However, there will not be any obligation on taxpayers to provide this documentation to Inland Revenue for review at the time the pricing is determined or the tax return is filed. Inland Revenue’s ultimate interest will be satisfied if the neces- IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 41 sary documents are submitted in a timely manner if requested by Inland Revenue during an examination. The document storage process will therefore be subject to taxpayers’ discretion. For example, taxpayers may choose to store relevant documents as unprocessed originals, in a well-compiled book or in electronic form. Access to and protection of confidential information 356.Inland Revenue has strong information collection powers that enable confidential information (such as trade secrets) or commercially sensitive information to be obtained. One concern expressed by taxpayers in relation to these powers is the possibility that this information may be disclosed somehow to some third party, such as a competitor. 357.The Commissioner is bound by the secrecy requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that there is no public disclosure of trade secrets, scientific secrets, or other confidential data. This require- ment does not extend to disclosure required in court proceedings. However, every endeavour will be made to ensure that confidentiality is maintained as far as possi- ble in such proceedings. Inland Revenue’s use of non-publicly available information 358.Inland Revenue does not intend as a matter of course to use non-publicly available information in attempting to substitute an alternative measure of the arm’s length amount. There are procedural difficulties in using such information, such as the likelihood that such information could not be provided to taxpayers whose transfer prices are under review, because of the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act. 359.Inland Revenue does not rule out the possibility that non-publicly available information will be used in administering the transfer pricing rules, as the Tax Administration Act requires that the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount be determined. However, Inland Revenue accepts that it is desirable to rely on publicly available information to the greatest extent possible. Inland Revenue’s use of hindsight 360.A further concern is that, because Inland Revenue will often examine taxpayers’ transfer pricing practices well after the transactions under consideration have occurred, Inland Revenue may seek to use information that becomes available after the transaction occurs to assess taxpayers’ transfer pricing. This is effectively the use of hindsight. 361.The concern is that this hindsight might be used to appraise taxpayers’ transfer prices in light of the relative profits derived by the parties to a transaction over one or more income years. If one party earned a significantly higher profit that the other party, the use of hindsight might attempt to reallocate these profits without regard to the facts and circumstances under which the transactions occurred. This reallocation might then form the basis for a transfer pricing adjustment. 362.Such an approach is inconsistent with the arm’s length principle. 363.At arm’s length, events occurring after a taxpayer determines its prices would not, unless they can be reasonably predicted at the time those prices are set, affect the determination of those prices. 364.An examination of relative profits from a control- led transaction over a period of time should not, there- fore, form the basis for a transfer pricing adjustment. For example, a newly-developed intangible may be difficult to value because of uncertainty as to its future value. Even if time does prove the intangible to be valuable, this is not grounds for automatically adjusting the transfer price. Based on the projected probability of success at the time the transfer occurred, the transfer price may well have been arm’s length. Unless reasonably predictable, what eventuated after the transfer does not affect its arm’s length price at the time of transfer. 365.An appraisal of a taxpayer’s transfer prices must, as a starting point, focus on the conditions under which the taxpayer was operating at the time the relevant transaction occurred. Examining relative profits may, however, form the legitimate basis for Inland Revenue to identify potential review or audit cases. 366.The appropriate use of data from periods subse- quent to a transaction being examined is discussed in the OECD guidelines at paragraph 1.51: Data from years following the year of the transaction may also be relevant to the analysis of transfer prices, but care must be taken by tax administrations to avoid the use of hindsight. For example, data from later years may be useful in comparing product life cycles of controlled and uncontrolled transactions for the purpose of determining whether the uncontrolled transaction is an appropriate comparable to use in applying a particular method. Subsequent conduct by the parties will also be relevant in ascertaining the actual terms and conditions that operate between the parties. 367.The use of hindsight may therefore be valuable for appraising the reliability of comparables used by a taxpayer in its transfer pricing analysis. However, this is not of benefit only to Inland Revenue. It may be that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing policy gains greater persua- siveness as a result of such data becoming available if it supports the reliability of the taxpayer’s comparables. 368.The availability and use of documentation in a taxpayer’s transfer pricing analysis that is prepared when or close to when the relevant transaction occurs will also help preclude the possible use of hindsight by Inland Revenue in an appraisal of the taxpayer’s transfer prices. Summary of general documentation IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) ñ Appendix 42 principles 369.Several important principles have been expressed in this chapter: • To reduce the likelihood of an audit and a potential transfer pricing adjustment, it is in taxpayers’ best interests to document how they have set their transfer prices. That documentation should attempt to demon- strate adequately that the transfer prices adopted are consistent with the arm’s length principle. • Taxpayers should, as far as practicable, taxpayers should make reasonable efforts at the time their transfer prices are set to determine whether they are consistent with the arm’s length principle. At the very latest, arm’s length transfer prices should be deter- mined and documented for a transaction by the time taxpayers file their relevant income tax return. • Inland Revenue needs to have recourse to documenta- tion prepared by the taxpayer as a means of verifying compliance with the arm’s length principle. However: – More extensive documentation should not be required than would exist to support any other business decision of a similar level of complexity and importance. – Taxpayers are not expected to prepare or obtain documents beyond the minimum needed to make a reasonable assessment of whether they have complied with the arm’s length principle. – Documentation requirements should not impose on taxpayers costs and burdens disproportionate to their circumstances. • Taxpayers should recognise that adequate record- keeping practices and voluntary production of docu- ments improves the persuasiveness of their approach to transfer pricing. It also facilitates examinations and the resolution of transfer pricing issues that arise. • Inland Revenue and taxpayers should co-operate in dealing with documentation issues to avoid an exces- sive burden being placed on either party. Co-operation should help to: – determine what information will be adequate if taxpayers are to apply the arm’s length principle reliably and Inland Revenue is to review their analysis; and – avoid excessive documentation requirements on taxpayers.

Determination S7: Morgan Stanley OPALS – Financial Arrangement Income or Expenditure from Morgan Stanley OPALS This Determination may be cited as “Determination S7: Morgan Stanley OPALS – Financial Arrangement Income or Expenditure from Morgan Stanley OPALS.” 1. Explanation (which does not form part of this determination) (1)This Determination applies to Optimised Portfolios as Listed Securities (“OPALS”) issued by Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited (“MSC”). (2)OPALS is a financial arrangement in which the holder of the OPALS provides money to MSC and the obligation is discharged at a future date by the issue of shares (or stock) in any company or companies. The holder is also entitled to an Income Stream which is based on the dividends derived from the shares and income earned by the party which holds the shares prior to the shares being transferred to the holder. (3)Pursuant to section EH 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the amount of the gross income deemed to be derived or the expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a financial arrangement under the qualified accruals rules shall not include the amount of any income, gain or loss, or expenditure that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrange- ment that is part of a financial arrangement. (4)As a share is an excepted financial arrangement under section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, only the Income Stream and amount attributed to those payments by this Determination are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculating accrual income or expenditure. (5)This Determination prescribes the method to be used when calculating for accrual purposes the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of OPALS. It also details which amounts are to be included for this calculation, and which are attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. (6)This Determination does not provide for, negate or vary the application of the Foreign Investment Fund regime to the excepted financial arrangement compo- nent of an OPALS, in respect of those series of OPALS which relate to shares in countries not listed in Part A of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 2. Reference This Determination is made pursuant to sections 90(l)(c) and (g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope of Determination (1)This Determination shall apply to the issue, as more particularly set out in the relevant Offering Circular and Pricing Supplement, by Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited, of series of an investment product called OPALS. (2)OPALS are hybrid securities issued by a special purpose Cayman Island’s company (Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited, the “Issuer”), and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. OPALS are not shares in the Issuer. They are unsecured obliga- tions ranking pari passu with all other unsecured obligations of the Issuer. (3)OPALS provide investors with a return which tracks within agreed parameters the movement in a specified equity index (such as the S&P 500). This return is provided as follows. The issue proceeds from OPALS are indirectly invested in shares of companies making up the relevant index. The dividends received on these share baskets (net of any applicable withhold- ing taxes) plus a percentage of any fees generated from the lending of the shares are paid to the OPALS holder as an annual coupon. Similarly any gains made through adjusting the composition of the share baskets are paid out as a component of this coupon. These adjustments are made without the intention of attempting to outperform the relevant index. (4)OPALS have a stated maturity of between one and seven years. Redemption is effected by the delivery to the investor of the physical shares then comprising the basket. In certain circumstances investors with a prescribed minimum holding of OPALS can elect to redeem early, but redemption is always by delivery of shares and never by cash. (5)The actual hedging mechanism involves the holding of the share baskets in a Morgan Stanley group company resident in Luxembourg (“Counterparty”). The Counterparty issues an equity linked note to the Issuer thus hedging the Issuer’s position. Therefore, the balance sheet of the Issuer is composed of Counterparty notes on the asset side and the OPALS on the liability side balanced by share capital. The notes issued by the Counterparty are redeemable in cash or through the delivery of shares. continued on page 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 2 ascertained from the relevant Reuters or Bloomberg financial information service page for the balance date of the holder. (5)For the purposes of this Determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the shares between the issue date of OPALS and the conversion into shares is due to the equity component. Therefore the difference in share price can be ignored when calculating income and expenditure under the quali- fied accruals rules. 5. Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires: (1)Expressions used, except the expression “Income Year”, have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. (a)“Accrued Income”, in relation to any date, means the product of (a) the number of OPALS held by the holder and (b) the amount showing on the Reuters Multicontributor page “OPALS” or the Bloomberg Multicontributor page “OPAL” as “coupon” at the close of trading in relation to that date. (b)the “Act” means the Income Tax Act 1994. (c)“Income Stream” means any amount payable on the OPALS by the issuer to the holder and includes both cash received and Accrued Income, but does not include payments relating to the redemption or conversion of OPALS. (d)“Income Year” (i)when a taxpayer furnishes a return of income under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for an accounting year ending with a balance date other than the 31st day of March, “Income Year” means the period of twelve months ending on that balance date; (ii)for any other person, “Income Year” means the year ending on the 31st day of March in which the income has been derived or expendi- ture has been incurred by that person. (e)“OPALS” means the hybrid financial arrange- ments issued by Morgan Stanley Capital (Cayman Islands) Limited called Optimised Portfolios as Listed Securities. (f)“Underlying Shares” in relation to an OPALS means the shares or stock into which the OPALS is convertible, or in which it may be redeemed or paid. (2)A determination to which this Determination refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a refer- ence to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. (3)For convenience, words and phrases defined in this Determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone (6)Except where its application is specifically excluded in another determination, this Determination applies to every OPALS which: (a)Are acquired in the 1998 or later income years; and (b)Meet the following criteria: (i)Are issued at a price which is between 95% and 105% of the market value of the Underly- ing Shares. Any discrepancy between the price and the market value of the Underlying Shares will be due to transactional costs relating to the acquisition of the Underlying Shares, e.g. stamp duty and brokerage; and (ii)Income Stream payments are payable at regular intervals of not more than 12 months; and (iii)Income Stream payments are equal to or greater than the amount of all dividends received by the Issuer in respect of the Underlying Shares less all fees, taxes, charges, duties and expenses which are permitted to be deducted under the terms and conditions of the OPALS; and (iv)Those Income Stream payments are based on amounts which cannot be predicted at the time the financial arrangement is entered into; and (v)The OPALS are not part of another financial arrangement. 4. Principle (1)OPALS have both debt and equity components. They can be regarded alternatively as: (a)a loan to the Issuer with repayment in shares and interest payable at a variable rate (debt compo- nent); or (b)a forward purchase of shares (in which case the holder of the OPALS is buying shares in busi- nesses and has equity in them). The accruals rules are not intended to deal with equity, and therefore classify a share (equity) as an excepted financial arrangement (see section OB 1). (2)As OPALS have this dual character, when calculating income/expenditure in relation to the OPALS it is first necessary to separate the debt and equity compo- nents of the OPALS. (3)This Determination specifies that, apart from the Income Stream and amounts attributed to those payments by this Determination, all amounts relate to the Underlying Shares (equity component), and will not be included when calculating gross income or expenditure under the qualified accruals rules. (4)Income from OPALS in any income year will be the sum of the Income Stream actually received and the Accrued Income. The Accrued Income is to be from page 1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 3 imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6. Method (1)Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure with regard to OPALS to which this Determination applies: (a)in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, the amounts taken into account to calculate income or expendi- ture consist of: (i)Income Stream Payments; (ii)Accrued Income: (b)in respect of the acquisition price, the amounts to be included when calculating income or expendi- ture are those attributed to Income Stream Payments as set out in subclause 6(3). (2)The income derived or expenditure incurred in any Income Year, in respect of OPALS to which this Determination applies shall be calculated using the formula: a – b + c where: ais the amount of cash received in the Income Year; bis the amount of Accrued Income included as item c in this calculation for the preceding Income Year, if the OPALS in relation to which this calculation is carried out were held at the end of that year, or the amount of Accrued Income as at the date of acquisition of the OPALS, if the OPALS were acquired in that Income Year; and cis the amount of Accrued Income as at the last day of the Income Year. (3)For the purposes of the base price adjustment, the amount of the acquisition price of each OPALS shall be determined in accordance with the acquisition price definition as provided in section OB 1 of the Act, with no part of the core acquisition price being attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of that OPALS. (4)If the OPALS on which an Income Stream is payable are sold part way through an Income Stream period, then it is necessary to apportion the income amount between the seller and the purchaser. The seller’s income will include Accrued Income as at the date of sale. 7. Examples Example A On 13 September 1997, OPALS are issued for $100 with rights to a variable Income Stream payable half- yearly in arrears. The OPALS will mature on 13 Sep- tember 1998. The market value of the share basket at issue date is $90.00. By conversion date this has risen to $150.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date. The Income Stream payments are made as follows: 13 March 1998$6.00 13 September 1998$6.00 Year Ended 31 March 1998 On 31 March 1998 the Reuters financial information service page shows that to date the Accrued Income on the OPALS is $0.59. The income derived in respect of the OPALS is to be calculated using the formula in subclause 6(2): a – b + c a =$6.00 (amount received on 13 March 1998) b =$0.00 (OPALS were only issued in the current financial year) c =$0.59 (Accrued Income) Income/Expenditure$6.59 The aggregate amount, if the OPALS run full term, attributable to the debt component of the OPALS and therefore to be taken into account under the accruals rules, is $12, comprised of the Income Stream Payments. All fluctuations in the value of the Underlying Shares relate to the equity component of the OPALS and should not be taken into account in calculating income or expenditure. Example B On 13 November 2002, OPALS are issued for $100 with a variable income amount payable half-yearly in arrears. The first period is only for 5 months. The OPALS will mature on 13 October 2004. The market value of the basket of shares at issue date is $90.00. By conversion date this has risen to $150.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date. The Income Stream Payments are made as follows: 13 April 2003$4.15 13 October 2003$5.00 13 April 2004$5.00 13 October 2004$5.00 (a) Year Ended 31 March 2003 On 31 March 2003 the Reuters financial information service page shows that to date the Accrued Income on the OPALS is $3.79. The income derived in respect of the OPALS is to be continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 4 through an interest period, so it is necessary to apportion the Income Stream Payment between the seller and the purchaser. On 20 December, the Reuters financial information service page shows that to date the Accrued Income on the OPALS is $1.01. This amount of $1.01 is income to the original holder and acquisition price to the new holder and will have to be taken into ac- count under the accruals rules. The original holder would be considered to have sold the equity portion of the OPALS for $118.99. Income for the New Holder Year Ended 31 March 2003 On 31 March 2003 the Reuters financial information service page shows that to date the Accrued Income on the OPALS is $3.79. The income derived in respect of the OPALS is to be calculated using the formula in subclause 6(2): a – b + c a =$0.00 (No Income Stream yet received) b =$1.01 (amount of Accrued Income as at the date of acquisition) c =$3.79 (Accrued Income) Income/Expenditure$2.78 Year Ended 31 March 2004 As for Example B. Income $10.00 Year Ended 31 March 2005 The aggregate amount, if the OPALS run full term, attributable to the debt component of the OPALS, and therefore to be taken into account under the accruals rules, is $19.15 comprised of the Income Stream Payments. All fluctuations in the value of the underlying shares relate to the equity component of the OPALS and should not be taken into account in calculating income or expenditure. As $13.79 has already been taken into account in previous income years ($1.01 by the original holder and $12.78 by the new holder), when undertaking the base price adjustment, the new holder will be left with $5.36 to be taken into account in the last year of the OPALS. This Determination is signed by me on the 10th day of October 1997 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) calculated using the formula in subclause 6(2): a – b + c a =$0.00 (no Income Stream yet received) b =$0.00 (OPALS were only issued in the current financial year) c =$3.79 (Accrued Income) Income/Expenditure$3.79 (b) Year Ended 31 March 2004 On 31 March 2004 the Reuters financial information service page shows that to date the Accrued Income on the OPALS is $4.64. The income derived in respect of the OPALS is to be calculated using the formula in subclause 6(2): a – b + c a =$9.15 ($4.15 received 13 April 2003 + $5.00 received 13 October 2003) b =$3.79 (amount of Accrued Income in previous Income Year) c =$4.64 (Accrued Income) Income/Expenditure$10.00 (c) Year Ended 31 March 2005 The aggregate amount, if the OPALS run full term, attributable to the debt component of the OPALS and therefore to be taken into account under the accruals rules, is $19.15, comprised of the Income Stream Payments. All fluctuations in the value of the underlying shares relate to the equity component of the OPALS and should not be taken into account in calculating income or expenditure. As $13.79 has already been taken into account in previous income years, when undertaking the base price adjustment, the holder will be left with $5.36 to taken into account in the last year of the OPALS. Example C On 20 December 2002, the original holder of the OPALS described in Example B sells the OPALS for $120 to a new holder who holds the OPALS to maturity. The sale of the OPALS takes place part way from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 5 Transfer pricing – draft guidelines The appendix to this TIB contains the first of a series of draft guidelines on the application of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. The draft provides a general overview of the framework within which transfer pricing operates, including a discussion on documentation taxpayers should prepare if they are to evidence compli- ance with the arm’s length principle. Transfer pricing is not an exact science. For this reason, the guidelines have been drafted as a practical guide, rather than as prescriptive rules. Inland Revenue does not propose to issue the final guidelines as a binding public ruling. Inland Revenue welcomes submissions on the material in the draft guidelines. Please make these by 27 February 1998, addressed to: General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Inland Revenue proposes to follow these guidelines in administering the transfer pricing rules until such time as final guidelines are issued. On matters not addressed in this draft, Inland Revenue will continue to follow the OECD guidelines. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 6 Income Tax Act 1994 Tax sparing – Fijian tax credits We have recently received an enquiry about the availability of tax sparing credits under the New Zealand/Fiji double tax agreement (DTA). Under Arti- cle 20 of that DTA, a New Zealand resident is allowed a tax credit for Fijian tax which has not in fact been paid because of Fijian tax concessions. However, a tax sparing credit may only be allowed in relation to those concessions spe- cifically listed in Article 20(3)(a) or which have been incorporated into the DTA by way of agreement between the New Zealand and Fijian Governments under Article 20(3)(b). To date, no additional concessions have been so incorporated. The Fijian tax concession, which was the subject of the enquiry, was not listed in Article 20(3)(a); accordingly no credit would be allowed by New Zealand for tax spared by that concession. The Third Protocol to the New Zealand/Fiji DTA also allows the Commissioner to deny a tax sparing credit in certain circumstances. This protocol is intended to prevent misuse of tax sparing. Similar protocols have been incorporated into New Zealand’s DTAs with Singapore, Malaysia and India. A tax sparing credit is not available under the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime in relation to a tax concession of a foreign country utilised by a CFC. This is because a New Zealand resident taxpayer is allowed a credit under section LC 4 (the CFC tax credit provision) for income tax actually paid or payable by a CFC only, and the benefit of a tax sparing provision in a DTA is not extended to the CFC. A DTA allows a credit for tax paid (or deemed to be paid under a tax sparing provision) by a New Zealand resident only. Any person claiming a tax sparing credit under a DTA must separately disclose the claim in the prescribed tax sparing disclosure return form (IR 4TS). Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST and advertising purchased from a non-resident publisher Section 8(2) - Supply in New Zealand: An Australian company is considering selling advertising space in a magazine that is published in Australia. Several New Zealand companies subscribe to the magazine, and they have shown an interest in advertising in it. The manager of the Australian publishing firm has asked whether the company must charge GST on the advertising services performed for the New Zealand companies. Section 51 governs when a person must register for GST. In brief, a person must register when the total value of supplies made in New Zealand, in the course of carrying on all taxable activities, has exceeded or is likely to exceed $30,000 in a 12-month period. Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 7 To determine whether a supply is made in New Zealand, section 8(2) must be considered. It states: ...goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is resident in New Zealand, and shall be deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand if the supplier is not resident in New Zealand: Provided that - (a) Goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is not resident in New Zealand and either- (i)The goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply; or (ii)The services are physically performed in New Zealand by any person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed: (b)Where goods and services that are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand pursuant to para- graph (a) of this proviso are supplied to a registered person for the purposes of carrying on that person’s taxable activity, those goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand unless the supplier and the recipient agree that this paragraph shall not apply to that supply. In this case, the advertising services will be performed outside New Zealand by a non-resident, and will be deemed to have been supplied outside New Zea- land under section 8(2). Accordingly, Inland Revenue advised the manager that there is no requirement for the Australian publishing firm to register for GST or to charge GST on its advertising services. Collection of rents by an agent from domestic households Section 14 - Exempt supplies: A GST registered person provides a manage- ment/maintenance service as an agent for the landlords of commercial proper- ties. She intends to extend this service to domestic rental properties and won- ders if this will necessitate an apportionment of taxable and exempt supplies, given that the supply of a dwelling is an exempt supply. Under section 8, GST is charged on the supply of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Section 6 (1) defines a “taxable activity” as any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly, whether or not for a profit, and involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods or services. Section 6(3)(d) excludes from the definition of a taxable activity: Any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. The renting of a dwelling for use as a private residence is an exempt supply under section 14(c) and is not subject to GST. However, the provision of man- agement and maintenance services to landlords is a supply provided in the course of a taxable activity. In this case the registered person is supplying a service to the landlords and should account for GST on the fees she receives from them in the normal man- ner. The rents received from the lessees are not included in her GST return as she is merely receiving them as an agent for the landlords and passing them on. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 8 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Section 25 time limitation on assessments Case:Hutchison Brothers Limited v CIR Decision date:8 September 1997 Forum:Court of Appeal Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 25, 76 Keywords:rebates, limitation period Summary:The Court held that section 25 controls the exercise of section 76 due to the basic character of section 25 in the scheme of the legislation. Facts:The Taxpayer operates supermarkets and is a member of Foodstuffs Limited. Foodstuffs declared member rebates for the taxpayer of $1,642,987 for the 1987 to 1991 income years (inclusive). Until 1987, the taxpayer had treated those rebates as part of its income in the year of declaration. In February 1987, the taxpayer considered that these rebates should have been assessable in the income year in which they were paid. The taxpayer accord- ingly calculated what it saw as an overpayment of tax for the four years from 1982 to 1985 and sought an equivalent reduction of its next amount payable. The Commissioner agreed with that change and credited the adjustment against the tax payable on 7 March 1987. After 1987, the taxpayer treated the rebates as income in the year they were paid. Inland Revenue reviewed the matter in 1992 and decided that the rebates should be recognised as part of the taxpayer’s income in the year they were declared. In October 1993, the Commissioner issued an amended assessment for the 1991 income year. This included the rebates for the 1987 to 1991 income years (inclusive).That date is more than four years after the end of the year in which the original assessments for the 1987 and 1988 income years were made. Decision:The issue was whether section 76 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is subject to section 25 so as to prevent the Commissioner assessing rebates declared in the 1987 and 1988 year. Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 placed a general limitation on the power of the Commissioner to amend an original assessment.Section 76 of the Income Tax Act confers a power of adjustment on the Commissioner The Court held that in both sections, the wording is strong and plain, but the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 9 character of section 25 gives it priority over section 76. Also, there are many provisions currently in force which explicitly allow the Commissioner to act, notwithstanding section 25. This has been omitted from section 76, which must be seen as significant. Judicial Review – whether Disputes Tribunal can hear tax cases Case:CIR v The Disputes Tribunal & Jason David Platt Decision date:10 September 1997 Forum:High Court Act:Disputes Tribunal Act 1988 - sections 10(1)(b), 18(b) Keywords:Family Support Summary:The High Court declared that the Disputes Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the correctness of an assessment issued by the Commissioner. Facts:The Commissioner had reassessed Mr Platt for Family Support in March 1996, for the debit amount of $1,178.77 in the income year ending 31 March 1995. Mr Platt refused to pay the amount and lodged a claim under the Disputes Tribunal Act, alleging that it was unfair to require him to pay it. The Commissioner advised the Disputes Tribunal that he did not consider that the Disputes Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the claim. The Disputes Tribunal ruled that it did have jurisdiction under section 10(1)(b) of the 1988 Act to hear the claim. It also ordered that under section 18(b) of that Act, (and in accordance with the substantial merits and justice of the case), Mr Platt did not have to pay the Commissioner the sum of $1,178.77 The Commissioner lodged a Judicial Review application in the High Court seeking a declaration that the Disputes Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the claim. Decision:The High Court declared that the Disputes Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the claim lodged by Mr Platt and ordered that the decision be quashed. Salmon J stated that the Court of Appeal recently confirmed in Golden Bay Cement Company Limited v CIR \[1996\] 2 NZLR 665, that once an assessment has been made, its correctness can only be challenged in proceedings on objection. It is clear therefore that the Income Tax Act restricts the method by which assessments may be disputed. Thus, the limit to the Disputes Tribunals’ juris- diction is clear both from its own Act and from the Income Tax Act. Leasing by builder – activity other than making taxable supplies? Case:CIR v John David Morris Decision date:16 September 1997 Forum:High Court Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – section 14, 21(1) Keywords:Taxable activity, principle purpose, adjustment Summary:The Court found in favour of the Commissioner and held that the letting of the properties was a subsequent application for a purpose other than that of mak- ing taxable supplies. As such, it was a deemed supply by the objector under continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 10 section 21(1) of the Act. Facts:The taxpayer, a builder and developer, built two flats which he intended to sell. Although they were rented out, they remained on the market for sale. The taxpayer claimed input tax credits in respect of the construction of the flats. He regarded the letting as subsidiary to the main object of selling. The Commissioner considered that the letting of the flats was an exempt sup- ply under section 14 of GST Act. Inland Revenue assessed the taxpayer under section 21 of the Act on the basis that goods and services originally acquired by the taxpayer for the purpose of making taxable supplies had been subsequently applied by the taxpayer for the purpose of making exempt supplies. Decision:The Court found in favour of the Commissioner and held that the letting of the properties was a subsequent application for a purpose other than that of mak- ing taxable supplies. As such, it was a deemed supply by the objector under section 21(1) of the Act. The Court held that section 21(1) requires a purpose which need not be the principal purpose. There must however be a new purpose that is separate and distinct from the principle purpose. Here the letting of the flats was a separate and distinct purpose to selling them. The letting was not merely an incidental purpose but part of the overall princi- ple purpose. The flats were acquired for the principal purpose of making tax- able supplies. The purpose continued, but simultaneously the flats were used for another purpose, namely to make non-taxable supplies by way of residen- tial accommodation. Motel vacant when transferred – sale of a going concern? Case:Douglas Carrick Belton v CIR Decision date:23 September 1997 Forum:High Court Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 – sections 33, 11 Summary:The Court held that after weighing the totality of relevant factors, although the substance of the transaction had the potential to be the transfer of a going concern, on an objective view what actually happened was the sale of land, buildings and chattels. Facts:The Objector, who was registered for GST, was the owner and operator of the Huremoa Motel. In January 1994, the Objector purchased another motel known as Moturemu Springs. Contractually, the Objector was entitled to receive the land, building and chattels, therefore he could not enforce any rights for anything else. The agreement also specifically provided for vacant possession. At the date of settlement, the motel was closed down and transferred with vacant possession. However, from the first week of May the premises were again used as a motel business and have continued to be so used to this day. Decision:The Court held that although the substance of the transaction had the potential to be the transfer of the motel as a going concern, on an objective view what actually happened was the sale of land, buildings and chattels, not the sale and purchase of a going concern. The motel did not continue in its operation unin- from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 11 terrupted and vacant possession was a contractual obligation. The essence of a going-concern is that during the transfer of ownership, the business must be operating, or left in such a state that it may be carried on by the transferee. Here, it was held to be uncontraverted that at the date of settlement, the motel was closed down and there were no future bookings. The Objector received only the business’s assets, and not the business activity itself. The Court held that although at the time of the sale the motel was capable of being run as a going concern, that was not enough to, in fact, make it the sale of a going concern as section 11(1) (c) of the GST Act contemplates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.10 (October 1997) 12 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

This is an illustration of the four-step process for setting or reviewing transfer prices between associated enterprises. If this process is properly undertaken, the taxpayer should have a lower risk of audit adjustment or penalty. Step 1: Understand the cross-border dealings between the associated enterprises in the context of the taxpayer’s business Identify cross-border dealing with associated enterprises and collect or maintain relevant documentation to explain the nature of those dealings in the context of the taxpayer’s business. For example: •nature and extent of dealing with associates •business lines and the size, scope, value and types of dealings •nature of the industry •nature of the competition it experiences •business strategies and processes. Undertake a preliminary functional analysis of the functions undertaken, risks assumed and the assets employed to assist in understanding the business and selecting and applying a methodology. Step 2: Select the methodology or methodologies Broadly identify any comparable uncontrolled dealings. Assess the reliability of data on comparable dealings or comparable enterprises. Determine the most appropriate methodology or methodologies based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Ensure that sufficient documentation and data is available to support the application. Step 3: Apply the methodology or methodologies Use the detailed data to extend and improve the functional analysis of the taxpayer and of any comparables. Refine, examine and organise the data to enable comparability to be assessed properly. To improve comparability, it may be necessary to: Data points or a range of results may emerge. •Extend the analysis over a number of years •adjust the data to account for material differences in comparability •apply several methods. Step 4: Determine the arm’s length outcome and implement support processes. Instal review process to ensure adjustment for material changes. Decide on the arm’s length outcome. Record practical considerations such as: If the data used to establish the outcome changes then review process and methodology. Put system in place to support chosen method with a review mechanism to ensure adjustment if material changes occur. •Any judgments made •how data points or ranges were interpreted •how results from different methods were used. It may be necessary to review earlier steps if the approach initially adopted is unsuitable or produces an outcome that does not reflect commercial or economic reality. Document each step.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Trailers (Class TD – over 10 tonnes) – when rented for periods of 1 month or less Depreciation Determination DEP29 In TIB Volume Nine, No.8 (August 1997) at page 3, we published a draft general depreciation determination for heavy truck trailers (Class TD, as included in First Schedule to the Miscellaneous Transport Regulations, - over 10 tonnes) rented out for short periods. These trailers are usually rented to front line major transport and distribution companies to cover emergencies and excess workload requirements. The period of rental is short-term. Generally, for only 1-2 weeks at a time. We received only one submission in relation to this draft, which concerned the residual value of the trailers. That issue has now been resolved and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP29: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination General Determina- tion No. 29”. The determination is based on an esti- mated useful life (EUL) of 10 years and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP29 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP29: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 29”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2.

The Com- missioner has now issued the determination with one minor alteration – the asset class “Skidoo” was inadvert- ently included in the “Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafes, Taverns and Takeaway Bars” industry category, as well as the “Leisure” industry category. The asset class should only have been included in the “Leisure” industry category. The determination is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP30: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination Generals Determination Number 30”. The determination is based on the estimated useful lives set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP30 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP30: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 30”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2.

The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Wind Turbine Generators” into the “Power Generation and Electrical Reticulation Systems” industry category. Both “Wind Turbine Generators” and “Windmills” will have a depreciation rate of 18% DV (12.5% SL), based on an estimated useful life of 10 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life (EUL) set out in the draft determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

Copyright in sound recordings Draft General Depreciation Determination Copyright in a sound recording differs from most other assets in that it is generally not discarded and/or replaced when its income earning capacity is reduced. Rather, copies of the sound recording are produced as required from a master disc. Copies can be made from that master for as long as there is a demand for the recording. A depreciation rate already exists for the master under the “Audio and Video Recording Studios and Professional Photography” industry code. However, that rate applies only to the master and not to the copyright in the sound recording. In practice, as demand for a recording reduces, the likelihood of further copies being made also reduces. In turn, the value of the copyright is also reduced. Generally, most of the sales, (to retailers) of the sound recording occur within 12 months of the recording first being released for sale to the public. Recognising this, the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997, (“the Act”) has added the copyright in certain sound recordings to schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which lists intangible property that can be depreci- ated. The Act also amends the definition of “estimated useful life” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to provide for the copyright in a sound recording. The estimated useful life of the copyright in a sound record- ing is: the period from the time such a copyright might reasonably be expected to be first useful in deriving gross income until the end of the income year in which it might reasonably be expected that 90% of all the gross income that will be derived from such a copyright has been derived. We have established that the period in which the first 90% of sales occur is 12 months. As a result, the Com- missioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination. It will apply to all copyright in sound recordings in the following circumstances: •The copyright must have been produced, or purchased by the taxpayer from an unrelated party, on or after 1 July 1997; and •Copies of the sound recording must have been sold or offered for sale to the public. The determination is reproduced below, and will insert a new category into the “Audio and Video Recording Studios and Professional Photography” industry cat- egory. The determination will set a depreciation rate of 100% DV and is based on a residual value of 13.5%.

Interpretation guidelines are intended to clarify general points of interpretation that are causing, or may cause, difficulty for practitioners, taxpayers, and Inland Revenue. An interpretation guideline is Inland Revenue’s opinion as to the better view of the law. That view is developed from an appreciation and assessment of the law on a particular topic, as gathered from leading cases. “Sham” – meaning of the term Introduction The first critical step in working out the tax treatment of a transaction is to correctly understand the transaction. At times this can be a difficult and complicated activity. It is not uncommon for a court to remind us of the process of transactional analysis. For example, the courts talk about the difference between the “form” and the “substance” of a transaction, or that it is the actual transaction entered into that is important, not the de- scriptive name or label used by the parties. In New Zealand taxation issues are decided on the basis of the legal and equitable rights and obligations deriving from the transaction the taxpayer is a party to, or the circumstances in which the taxpayer is involved. A significant departure from this approach is when the essential genuineness of a transaction is challenged. This guideline on the meaning of “Sham”, examines and explains this situation. On occasions, some confusion has apparently existed as to the proper application of the term “sham”. The following statement sets out what “sham” means, at law, to provide guidance for those involved in tax practice and administration. As a preliminary point, when analysing a transaction it is common for the terms “form” and “substance” to be used interchangeably in different contexts. To minimise the confusion flowing from the different meanings that the terms have in different contexts, this guideline adopts the following definitions: •“Form” means the true legal character of a transaction. •“Substance” means the economic consequences of a transaction. Generally, a “sham” means acts done or documents executed by parties to the sham with the common intention of creating, for third parties, the appearance or illusion of particular rights and obligations different from the actual rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend. A sham may sometimes be confused with the situation where, by deceitful means, one party knowingly enters into a transaction to gain some fraudulent advantage over another. In this situation, statutes and rules of law exist to counter the advantage sought by those who knowingly enter into these transactions. While the law does discourage such transactions, this discouragement does not render them shams. Essential features of a sham The concept of “sham” has been defined and analysed in numerous decisions both in New Zealand and elsewhere. From these decisions it is possible to set out the essence and operation of the doctrine. 1.A common intention must exist between parties (to the sham) that the acts done or documents executed do not create the legal rights or obligations which they appear to create: (Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518.) 2.A sham is the act done or document executed that is intended to mislead. It is where the parties resort to a form of action or document which does not fit the real facts in order to deceive a third person: (Bateman Television v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd. \[1969\] NZLR 794). A sham is not the underlying motive or intention of the parties. 3.A sham does not apply to transactions that are intended to take effect, and do take effect, between the parties according to their tenor, even though those transactions may have the effect of fraudulently preferring, for example, one creditor to others, and notwithstanding that they are deliberately planned with this in view: (Paintin and Nottingham Ltd v Miller Gale and Winter \[1971\] NZLR 164). In this type of situation the transaction cannot be construed as giving a false or misleading impression to a third party. The appearance created by the act done or documentation is precisely the reality. 4.A sham may exist at the outset or emerge over time: (Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 586). For example, a document may be bona fide at inception, but the parties may depart from their initial agreement yet allow its shadow to mask the new arrangement. 5.Where a portion of a transaction is a sham, its effect is limited to that portion. It is incorrect to flavour the rest of the transaction a sham: (Case W49 \[1989\] continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 8 transaction can only be ascertained by careful considera- tion of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. Accordingly, before any issue of sham arises, it is important that a systematic and objective approach is undertaken to ascertain the true nature of the transac- tion. The following points, as set out by Richardson J. in Re Securitibank (No.2), provide guidance in this context: •The true nature can only be found by careful consid- eration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. •It is the legal character of the transaction which is decisive, not the overall economic consequences to the party. •The legal character is not determined conclusively by the nomenclature used by the parties. It is the inevita- ble effect of the contract that matters, not the form or language in which the parties chose to express it. •Consideration must be given to the whole of the contract to determine the true nature of the relation- ship. •Where the transaction is embodied in several interre- lated arrangements, all the arrangements must be considered together and one may be read to explain the others. •When considering the essence of, for example, the bargain disclosed by the document, the circumstances surrounding the entering into the transactions may be taken into account. However, this does not mean that evidence is admissible to vary or contradict the written agreement; only that before you construe the agree- ment you are entitled to understand the setting in which it was made and that it should be construed against that background. •Documents themselves may be brushed aside only if and to the extent that the parties had a common intention that they were not to create the legal rights or obligations which they gave the appearance of creating and in that sense were shams. •Finally, the concern is with the legal arrangements actually carried out. It is what the parties eventually did that counts, not what they may have initially agreed to do. In some cases the parties may have departed from the initial agreement, in which event questions of a new agreement or variation of the original agreement, or estoppel, or sham in operation may arise. If the issue of sham does arise, relevant evidence will be sought, looking primarily at extraneous factors outside the agreement or document under scrutiny. As a sham is an attempt to disguise the real legal position between parties, the examination focuses on testing the reality of the purported position. Whether a sham exists depends on the circumstances and it is not possible to highlight factors that apply in every ATC 460, applying by analogy the approach in Re Mill’s Declaration of Trust; Midland Bank Executor & Trustee Co. Ltd. v Mill and Ors (1950) 1 ALL ER 789) 6.There is no half-way house between a sham and an effective transaction. This means there is no legal principle supporting a concept where, even though the documents record the intention of parties, nevertheless the substance of the transaction can be interpreted so as to produce some different legal result: (Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) 1978 2 NZLR 136). In ascertaining the true nature of the transaction one must consider the legal character of the agree- ment which embodies the transaction. It is only if a challenge can be mounted on the basis of the genu- ineness of the agreement, \[as evidenced by the documents,\] that it is necessary to consider whether the meaning of the transaction as represented by the documents is not the true meaning of the transaction and the documents themselves are a cloak to conceal its true nature. 7.It may also be observed that the modern trend is for the courts to try to give business efficacy to commer- cial transactions. For example, if a court is satisfied that the real intention of the parties was to enter into a binding agreement, then the court will do its best to give effect to that intention: (Attorney-General v Barker Bros Ltd. \[1976\] 2 NZLR 495; unreported decision of Thorp J. in A.G.C. v Broadlands Ltd and General Motors Acceptance Corporation (NZ) Ltd v A.G.C. and Broadlands Finance Ltd (High Court Auckland A256/80)). This modern trend may be contrasted with an earlier judicial approach, when a finding of sham inevitably enabled a Court to infer the true nature of the arrangement in an “in sub- stance” manner. For example, in Polsky v S A Services \[1951\] 1 ALL ER 185, Lord Goddard had no difficulty inferring from the fact that there had not been payment of a deposit, as set out in a hire purchase agreement used in a refinancing situation, that he was dealing with a clear case of sham. As Thorp J. said in the A.G.C. case, “ That precedent can no longer safely be followed”. In a similar vein, North P. in the Bateman Television case said, “...carelessness in the preparation of conditional purchase agreements provides no evidence that they were not genuine documents.” Application When examining the tax treatment of a transaction, the first step is to ascertain the transaction’s true nature: (Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271). This is to be done in a systematic and objective way, so that there is no pre-judgment or, “...sinister desire to impute to transactions something which they do not contain”: (Re George Inglefield Ltd \[1933\] Ch 1; Old Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd \[1938\] 3 All ER 275). As was said in Re Securitibank (No. 2), the true nature of a from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 9 situation. Most cases are concerned with whether the parties intend to create the entitlements that appear on the face of the document. Areas that may be examined include the conduct or actions of the parties, the exist- ence and relevance of related documentation ( including financial records, correspondence, company minutes), actual cash flows, and property transfers etc. The purpose of any examination is to determine whether the reality of the parties’ relationship reflects what appears on the face of the document. Effect of a sham A document may be disregarded to the extent that the documentation amounts to a sham and the true arrange- ment between the parties to the sham is given effect: (Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR). This approach, of looking to the true arrangement between the parties, may be contrasted with an earlier approach adopted by the courts where a finding of sham inevitably enabled the courts to infer the true nature of the transaction. For example, in a string of finance cases dealing with the refinancing of existing liabilities, a finding of sham inevitably lead the courts to infer the true nature of the transaction was one of loan. This “in substance” ap- proach is no longer used. Today courts focus the enquiry on objectively discovering what is the true nature of a transaction. They look to the real legal rights and duties created by the transaction by ignoring the facade created by the sham. Therefore, a finding of sham means for third parties that the facade created by the sham disap- pears and the actual rights and obligations (if any) that the parties to the sham intended to make are given effect. Note that a sham will not occur simply because a taxpayer adopts one legally available form over another. This point was made clear by the Court of Appeal in Bateman Television v Coleridge Finance Co Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 794, 813, where Turner J said: I think the occasions on which Courts have set aside the form of a transaction as a ‘sham’ are confined to cases in which, really doing one thing, the parties have resorted to a form which does not fit the facts in order to deceive some third person, ..., into the belief that they were doing something else. ... but I cannot agree that the term is applicable to the form of a transaction into which the parties are legally at liberty to enter, and into which they do in fact enter, if what they do is simply to prefer this form of transaction to some other into which they might have entered, but did not. Further where Courts have set aside the “form” of a transaction as a sham, it is the literal form of the docu- ments that is brushed aside in favour of the true legal character of the transaction. The Courts will not allow the true legal character to be disregarded in favour of the economic substance. Cases involving sham transactions A finding of sham is clearly fact dependent. In the New Zealand context there have been very few reported tax cases holding that a sham exists. However, there are a number of Australian cases where courts have found a sham. For example, in Cranstourn v FC of T \[1984\] ATC 4876, the Supreme Court of Queensland found, on the facts, that the pre-payment of interest under a tax avoidance scheme was void on the basis that the underlying loan transaction was a sham. After considering the dicta of Diplock L.J. in Snook v London West Riding Investments Ltd., the Court in Cranstourn said: If two persons sign a document which on its face purports to be loan agreement evidencing a loan from one to the other for $180,000 but it is agreed either expressly or impliedly that the document is intended to give the appearance only of a loan transaction then it is, in my view, a sham: it something devised to delude, it is a trick or a hoax, an imposture, it is something that is intended to be mistaken for something else, it is not really what it purports to be, it is a spurious imitation or a counterfeit ... The Court continued: However one defines it, it is in law nothing, nor, in my view, can it be elevated to be something which the law will recognise and enforce merely because documents which are drawn in legal language appear, a series of bookkeeping entries is made and extensive use of the banking system involving debits and credits of the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars. No amount of professional ingenuity will make the agreement into what in fact it is not if the parties do not so intend. In a similar vein, the majority of the Full Federal Court in Faucilles Pty. Ltd. v FC of Taxation \[1990\] ATC 4,003 upheld the finding of sham by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Case W48 \[1989\] ATC 460. In this case the income of two family trusts purportedly distrib- uted to various overseas beneficiaries was never remitted to them. Instead, there was a “round robin” of book entry payments between the trusts, trustees, and benefi- ciaries to whom the trust funds’ income was purportedly distributed. The Tribunal found, on the evidence, that it was never intended that there be any real distribution to anyone other than one beneficiary - namely the taxpayer (and possibly his children). The taxpayer meant to use the discretionary distribution provisions of the trust deed and the default distribution provisions, if they ever took effect, to cloak the real transactions which he intended to undertake. The tribunal found that it was never intended that the default distribution provisions should create legal or equitable obligations and therefore they were a sham. Example The following example illustrates the practical operation of the sham doctrine. M works for P and is paid wages subject to, amongst other things, PAYE. M and P consider there may be advantages to both of them by opting out of their PAYE obligations, as P could stop deducting PAYE and M could take deductions not available to employees. Accordingly, M and P draw up a new continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 10 When queried on this, P produces the new agree- ment as evidence of the new relationship. The new employment relationship is clearly a sham. M and P intend the Commissioner to believe that an independent contractual arrangement exists when clearly there is no change in the relationship. On a finding of sham, the alleged new arrangement is ignored and effect is given to the real employment status. It is likely that M’s failure to deduct PAYE would be subject to the new penalty regime. If, in this example, M and P genuinely began to operate in accordance with the express terms in the new agreement then, of course, no sham would exist. Alternatively, if M and P entered into the new contract, did not implement its terms in practice, but continued to meet their legal and taxation obliga- tions on the basis that an employment relationship still existed, there would not be a sham. For a sham to exist, the parties’ common intention must be to mislead someone else (such as the Commissioner) as to the true legal or factual position. contract which states that the nature of the employ- ment relationship is one “for service” rather that “of service”. The contract specifically sets out that M is a self-employed independent contractor of P. Under its terms, P is not responsible for holiday pay or sick leave, and it is M’s responsibility to supply all equipment, plant etc., for the contract work. Following the signing of the new agreement, the only noticeable difference in the employment relationship is the contract. Everything else stays the same. M and P do not factually implement the clauses of the new contract nor do they intend to do so. The employment relationship maintains the same entitlements and obligations as before. While the new contract states that M is not entitled to holiday pay or sick leave, M continues to take paid holidays and sick leave. P continues to provide all the assets and make all the decisions as to what is to be done and how. In short, M and P continue to operate in a “master/servant” relationship. However, in terms of their tax obligations, P ceases to deduct PAYE. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 11 Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

Importers and GST input tax deductions Public Ruling – BR Pub 97/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “invoice” and “document” in section 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the importing of goods into New Zealand by registered persons for the purposes of making taxable supplies, the levying of GST on those goods by the New Zealand Customs Service under the Customs and Excise Act 1996, and the subsequent claiming of input tax deductions on that GST. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: A registered person who accounts for GST on an invoice basis may support a claim for a GST input tax deduction under section 20(3) for GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service on goods imported into New Zealand with: •The New Zealand Customs Service Electronic Entry document; or •A Customs import Entry Form; or •A Deferred Payment of Duty Statement. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to claims for input tax deductions on GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service on goods imported into New Zealand between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22nd day of October 1997 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) commentary on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 12 Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter of the Ruling was previously consid- ered in Public Binding Ruling 95/9 published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 7 (January 1996) at page 15 under the heading “GST: importers and input tax deductions”. The Ruling replaces that earlier ruling. Background In December 1995, following the Court of Appeal decision Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd. v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,163, Public Binding Ruling 95/9 was issued and published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 7 (January 1996). It provided that: A registered person may use either a Customs Import Entry Form or a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction under section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for GST levied by New Zealand Customs on goods imported into New Zealand. When that ruling was made the Customs Act 1966 was in force. On 1 October 1996 the Customs and Excise Act 1996 came into effect, repealing and replacing the Customs Act 1966. For some time the New Zealand Customs Service has operated an Electronic Direct Import (“EDI”) system whereby it retains no papers for approximately 97% of import entries. When goods are entered by a customs agent or broker, in most cases the New Zealand Customs Service no longer issues a piece of paper that is the Customs Import Entry Form. Instead, the entry is made electronically by the agent or broker and sent, electroni- cally, to the New Zealand Customs Service, where the entry is confirmed and cleared and delivery given. Once the import entry is cleared, an electronic message is sent back to the customs agent or broker, along with a delivery order. The customs agent or broker can then print out the electronic documents for the importer. The Customs and Excise Act 1996 specifically provides for this new electronic system. We are withdrawing the previous ruling which related solely to the manual procedure under the Customs Act 1966. The new Ruling incorporates both the old manual procedure and the new electronic procedure. Legislation Section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “invoice” as meaning: A document notifying an obligation to make payment: Section 2 also defines “document” as including: Any electronic data, computer programmes, computer tapes, and computer discs. Section 12 imposes GST on the importation of goods into New Zealand. It states: (1)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a tax to be known as good and services tax shall be levied, collected, and paid in accordance with the provisions of this section at the rate of 12.5 percent on the importation of goods (not being fine metal) into New Zealand, being goods that are - (a)Entered therein, or delivered, for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; or (aa)Entered for delivery to a manufacturing area licensed under section 12 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996; or (b)Before their entry, or delivery, for home consumption or, as the case may be, entry for delivery to a manu- facturing area licensed under section 12 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, dealt with in breach of any provision of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, - by reference to the value of the goods as determined under subsection (2) of this section. ... (3)Subject to this section, tax levied under subsection (1) of this section shall be collected and paid in accordance with the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Section 20(3) states: Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period- (a)In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - ... (ii)Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period. ... Under section 39 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, goods to be imported must be entered in a prescribed form (including by electronic means): Entry of imported goods - (1)Subject to any regulations made under section 40 of this Act, goods that are imported or that are to be imported must be entered by the importer - (a)In such form and manner (including by electronic means into a computer or other device) as may be prescribed; and (b)Within such time as may be prescribed or such further time as the Chief Executive may allow. ... IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 13 Section 86(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 states: Duty on imported goods a Crown debt - (1)The duty on all goods imported constitutes, immediately on importation of the goods, a debt due to the Crown. (2)Such duty is owed by the importer of the goods, and, if more than one (whether at or at any time after the time of importation) then jointly and severally by all of them. (3)Subject to this Act, such debt becomes due and payable when - (a)Goods have been entered in accordance with section 39 of this Act and the entry has been passed for home consumption; or (b)Goods have been entered in accordance with section 39 of this Act for removal to a manufacturing area; or (c)Goods have been wrongfully landed or otherwise wrongfully dealt with without having been entered pursuant to section 39 of this Act; or (d)An offence has been committed against this Act in respect of the goods. (4)Such debt is recoverable by action at the suit of the Chief Executive on behalf of the Crown. ... Under section 88 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, an entry for goods is deemed to be an assessment for the purposes of that Act: Assessment of duty - (1)An entry for goods made under this Act is deemed to be an assessment by the importer or licensee, as the case may be, as to the duty payable in respect of those goods. (2)If the Chief Executive has reasonable cause to suspect that duty is payable on goods by a person who has not made an entry in respect of the goods, the Chief Executive may assess the duty at such amount as the Chief Executive thinks proper. (3)The person liable for the payment of the duty shall be advised of the assessment by notice in writing. ... Application of the Legislation The New Zealand Customs Service levies GST on goods imported into New Zealand under section 12 of the Act. Under section 20(3)(a)(ii), registered persons who account on an invoice basis are permitted to claim input tax at the earlier of invoicing or payment (registered persons who account on a payments basis are not affected by the subject matter of the Ruling). Unlike other claims for input tax deductions, section 20(3)(a)(ii) only requires the importers to hold invoices to support their claims rather than tax invoices. This is because the New Zealand Customs Service does not make any supplies when it is levying GST on goods imported into New Zealand, and so is not required to issue tax invoices under section 24 of the Act. Given the new EDI proce- dure, the question arises as to what documentation issued by the New Zealand Customs Service is accept- able as an “invoice” for the purposes of the Act. The Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR considered the issue of when an importer could claim an input tax deduction for GST levied on goods imported into New Zealand. The Court of Appeal noted that an “invoice” is defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act as “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. The Court held that when the goods are entered, this constitutes the duty as a debt due to the Crown. At that point the Customs Import Entry Form provides notice of the obligation to make payment. Therefore, the Customs Import Entry Form, which stated the total duty, total GST and the total payable, fell within the GST definition of “invoice”. BR Pub 95/9 confirmed that an importer could use a Customs Import Entry Form to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction. The Customs Import Entry Form is now only issued for about 3% of import entries. It is principally used by private individual importers who do not have the necessary computer technology and so still use the manual forms. For such importers, the old form remains an acceptable form of documentation to support a GST input tax deduction claim, as confirmed in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR. The electronic entry document now used for approxi- mately 97% of import entries also constitutes an invoice sufficient to support a claim for input tax deductions. The information received on the electronic version of an import entry has not changed materially from that of the manual entry. The electronic entry document shows the total duty, total GST, and total payable. It identifies the supplier and the recipient of the goods and services, describes the goods supplied with a detailed coding system, and quantifies the consideration for the supply. Therefore, the electronic entry document contains the information thought necessary by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR to establish and identify the customs duty and GST owed by the importer to the Crown. Under the previous system, the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR stated that at the point that the Customs Import Entry Form was signed by the Customs Officer, the document was notice to the importer of the obligation to make payment. Under the present system, the electronic entry is cleared by the New Zealand Customs Service when “Lodgement” and “Delivery” numbers are issued. The debt due to the Crown is created when the entry is confirmed in this way. The clearing of the entry can be considered equiva- lent to the previous procedure for the signing and stamping of a manual import entry. When the broker receives the electronic entry document back on his or her system with no amendments and receives the delivery order, the importer is notified of the total duty and GST owing on each entry. Thus, the EDI procedure triggers importation and comprises both an obligation to make payment and continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 14 duty, total GST, and total amount payable on the importation of those cars. The taxpayer’s broker prints out copies of the electronic entry document and delivery order and gives them to the taxpayer. The taxpayer retains these for evidentiary purposes. The taxpayer is on the Deferred Payment Scheme operated by the New Zealand Customs Service, and receives a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement on 23 October. The payment is deferred for 21 working days. The statement lists all the goods she has imported for the period 23 September to 23 October, and states the total amount of duty and GST pay- able. The taxpayer’s taxable period ends on 30 Septem- ber. She is required to furnish her GST return for the months of August and September, stating the amount of GST she has to return for those two months. The taxpayer will include in her GST return for that taxable period an input tax deduction claim for the GST levied on the cars imported on 28 Sep- tember. The taxpayer only needs an invoice to substantiate her claim for an input tax deduction for the GST that the New Zealand Customs Service has levied on the imported cars. The taxpayer may claim the input deduction in the taxable period ending 30 Septem- ber, because the electronic entry document contains all the necessary details to constitute an invoice for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. She does not need to delay the claim until the period in which she receives the Deferred Payment of Duty Statement. Rural rental property owners – liability to register for GST Public Ruling – BR Pub 97/11 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “person”), 6(1), 51(1), and 57(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of land owned by a family group (the co-own- ers), which may or may not include a family trust, to a family farming partner- ship. The co-owners are merely tenants in common and do not otherwise have any terms or conditions regulating their relationship. The partnership carries on a farming business on the land. The partnership pays a market value rental in excess of the GST registration threshold (currently $30,000) to the co-owners. notification of that obligation. The electronic entry document constitutes an “invoice” for GST purposes so as to trigger the time of supply and the resulting input tax entitlement for GST invoice-based importers under section 20(3). The New Zealand Customs Service also operates an optional deferred payment scheme for importers, under which it issues a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement for the duty owed by importers on all the goods they import during a particular month. The Deferred Payment Scheme has four billing cycles within a one-month period. Payment is deferred for 21 working days from the end of an importer’s allocated billing cycle. The Deferred Payment of Duty Statement is created from the information contained in the electronic entry document and so is also acceptable documentation to support a GST input tax deduction claim. Example A taxpayer imports and sells European cars. She is registered for GST, accounts for tax payable on an invoice basis, and files GST returns on a two- monthly basis. The taxpayer imports cars worth $300,000 on 28 September. Her customs broker enters the details of the cars she has imported and their values into the correct electronic entry form and sends it electronically to the New Zealand Customs Service. Within a few minutes the New Zealand Customs accepts the import entry as correct, issues lodgement and delivery numbers, and elec- tronically sends the cleared entry and a delivery order back to the taxpayer’s broker stating the total from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 15 How the Taxation Law apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The co-owners are not an “unincorporated body” in terms of section 57(1). Neither are they a partnership, a joint venture, or trustees of a trust. •Therefore, the co-owners are not required, as a “group”, to register for GST in terms of section 51(1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies for the period from 31 October 1997 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of October 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Commentary on Public Binding Ruling BR Pub 97/11 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Binding Ruling BR Pub 97/11 (“the Ruling”). Background An item in TIB Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994) on pages 1–3 entitled, “GST: claims for secondhand goods input tax credits on property transactions between associated persons” set out Inland Revenue’s policy in relation to these transactions. Example 1, on page 3, concluded that the land owning group in the example was an “unincorporated body” for the purposes of section 51 of the GST Act 1985 and was required to register and pay output tax on the transaction. The example outlined an arrangement where a family group leased land to an associated farming partnership for an annual rental that exceeded the threshold requir- ing GST registration. Although Example 1 did not specifically mention details of land ownership, recent Taxation Review Authority decisions have prompted Inland Revenue to revisit the issue. This Ruling now confirms that the mere co-ownership of land will not necessarily result in the co-owners being treated as an “unincorporated body of persons” for GST purposes as indicated in the above- mentioned example. The Ruling clarifies when co- owners will not be treated as a “body” for GST purposes and supersedes the conclusion reached in the example. Legislation Section 51(1) requires persons to register, and states: Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered - (a)At the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and in the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $30,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): ... (b)At the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section: Definitions relevant to the Ruling are: Section 2 - “Person” includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority: 57(1) \[Definitions\] For the purposes of this section – “Body” means an unincorporated body of persons; and includes – (a)A partnership: (b)A joint venture: (c)The trustees of a trust: “Member” means a partner, a joint venture, a trustee, or a member of any body: “Partnership” and “partner” have the same meaning as in the Partnership Act 1908. Section 6 6(1)For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means – (a)Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club; (b)... 6(3)Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person, - continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 16 The owners of the farm freehold had granted a contractual licence to the relevant partnership to occupy the farmland and farm it. I agree with Mr Lang that the granting of that right was an ongoing and continuous process. It was positive in nature because it required the objectors to allow the relevant partner- ship to have the continuing access to the farmland to the exclusion of the objector owners over a substantial period of time. In my view, that placement is the carrying on of an activity for the purposes of s 6 (1). The supply of a lease of land to the partnership is an activity that is carried on “continuously or regularly”. Is there a consideration involved in the activity? In this case there is payment by the partnership to the land owners by way of an annual rental. It is clear that the supply of the land, by way of lease, to the farming partnership is a taxable activity for the purposes of the Act. Is the taxable activity carried on by a “person”? Section 51(1) further requires that the taxable activity has to be carried on by a “person”. “Person” is defined in section 2, and includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local author- ity. The co-owners in this case are clearly not a company nor a public or local authority. A “body” is defined, in section 57, as an “unincorporated body” and includes a partnership, a joint venture, and the trustees of a trust. It is clear that the courts will not accept that the co-ownership of land can be construed as an unincorporated body, a partner- ship, or a joint venture. In Case S57 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,368, Barber J approved the approach taken in Case P70 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,469 that co-ownership does not create an unincorporated body, a partnership, or a joint venture. In relation to each category of “body”, the following comments are relevant from the decisions of recent TRA cases. Unincorporated body of persons Willy DJ in Case P70 at page 4,476: ...this argument is untenable for much the same reason as the joint venture argument failed because it is based on the proposition that co-ownership of land is sufficient to constitute the co-owners an unincorporated association. Willy DJ also quotes the following passage from the judgement of Bisson J in Taunton Syndicate v C of IR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,106, who said: When persons associate together for a common purpose it is essential that they should agree on certain basic terms and conditions to regulate their association, otherwise they are but a collection of individuals and not an association. In this sense, their association in an organisation which they have formed to effect their purpose in the manner agreed upon ... A random number of individuals is not an association until they have (d)Any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. Supplies that are “exempt supplies” for GST purposes are set out in section 14. None of the items listed in the section exempts the supply of land by way of rental that is not rental of a dwelling. Application of the Legislation Is there a taxable activity? To be liable to register under section 51(1) there must be a “taxable activity”. Taxable activity is defined in section 6(1)(a). There are three requirements in the definition that must be met: •There must be an activity; •which is carried on continuously or regularly; •which involves or is intended to involve supplies made to another person for a consideration. Is there an activity? “Activity” is not defined in the Act, but is given a wide interpretation by the courts. In Newman v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 at page 11,233 Fraser J said: \[Activity\] is a word of considerable breadth. The new Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1993 ascribes a number of varying meanings or shades of meanings, none of which is exactly apposite to the word in s 6. The nearest thing, I think, is ‘an occupation, a pursuit’ and (in plural) ‘things that a person animal or group chooses to do’. The leasing of land is an “activity” for the purposes of the GST Act. Is the activity carried on “continuously or regularly”? The courts have considered the phrase “continuously or regularly” in a number of cases. In Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 at page 3,238 Bathgate DJ stated that: “Continuously” means that the activity has not ceased in the permanent sense or has not been interrupted in a significant way.... The object and purposes of any physical break in the activity, whether it be for rest, recreation, health and such like may be of importance in determining whether the activity is being carried on continuously.... “Regularly” embodies a steadiness or uniform action, or occurrence of action, so that it recurs or is repeated at fairly fixed times, or at generally uniform intervals, to be of a habitual nature and character. In Allen Yacht Charters Limited v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270 Tompkins J said: The activity must be carried on “continuously or regularly”. This indicates that the activity must either be carried on all the time, i.e., continuously, or it must be carried on at reasonably short intervals, i.e., regularly. An activity that is intermittent or occasional does not qualify. That the supply of lease of land from the joint owners to the partnership is a taxable activity is supported by some recent cases. In TRA Case S72 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,446 at 7,449 Barber DJ stated: from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 17 formed themselves into an association and this formation does not occur until they have agreed upon an organisation whereby their relationship one with the other is determined and organised. Although Taunton Syndicate discussed the term “unincorporated association” in the context of the Income Tax Act, Bisson J commented on matters that needed to be resolved between co-owners before there could be said to be an unincorporated association: One co-owner cannot by merely leaving the management of the property to the other impose upon the other an obligation of a fiduciary character. One co-owner cannot compel the others to contribute towards the cost of repairs, nor can he recover from them a portion of the money which he has voluntarily spent upon improvements. One co-owner who has failed to exercise his right of possession is not entitled to claim rent from another co-owner even though that other occupies the whole of the land... These are all matters which one might expect to be resolved if co-owners formed an unincorporated association.... The courts have determined that there must be some degree of formalisation or regulation governing the relationship between co-owners before there can be an unincorporated association. Partnerships In Case S57 at page 7,376, Barber J said: They ...simply co-owned the land together but as separate co- owners of an equal undivided half share as tenants in common of each section ... I would not have regarded the joint owner- ship of land by the trusts as a partnership. (emphasis added). This decision is consistent with section 5 of the Partner- ship Act 1908 which states: In determining whether or not a partnership does or does not exist regard shall be had to the following rules: (a)Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property, or part ownership does not in itself create a partnership as to anything so held or owned, whether the tenants or owners do or not do share any profits made by the use thereof: (b)The sharing of gross returns does not of itself create a partnership, whether the persons sharing such returns have or have not a joint or common right or interest in any property from which or from the use of which returns are derived. ... If land is held as tenants in common, each co-owner can mortgage or charge his or her interest in the property without binding the other co-owners. This is inconsistent with general partnership principles (see section 8 of the Partnership Act 1908), where each partner of a firm can bind the other partners. Joint ventures “Joint venture” is not defined in the Act. However, the meaning of joint venture has been considered by the courts in both an income tax and GST context. In Case P70 it was held that the objectors had proved to a satisfactory standard that there was no joint venture. In this case the Commissioner sought to rely on the grounds that the property co-owned by the two family trusts was owned or operated as a joint venture. At page 4,475 Willy DJ held that: At best there was joint ownership of a farm without any of the other indicia discussed in the foregoing cases. \[United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd (1985) 60 ALR at 746-747 and Commerce Commission v Fletcher Challenge Limited (1989) NZLR 554\]. It was not, for example, an association for the purpose of a particular trading. There was no contractual arrangement between the parties as to how the particular business would be carried on. This was not a contractual association of persons for the purposes of a particular trading commercial undertaking with a view to mutual profit. Each trust received its own share of income and dealt with it as it saw fit. ...mere joint ownership is not of itself sufficient to constitute a joint venture although of course it may together with other relevant facts be conducive to that conclusion. It is clear from the above that a mere co-ownership, as tenants in common in equal shares, will not constitute a “person” under the expanded definition of that word. The courts have maintained that a mere co-ownership, as tenants in common, will not constitute an unincorporated body, a partnership, or a joint venture. Are the co-owners, as individuals, required to register for GST? It has been determined that the co-owners are not a “body” for the purposes of section 57, and, therefore, are not required to register as a “body” for GST purposes. It therefore remains to establish whether or not the co- owners as individuals (“persons”) are required to register. The registration threshold in section 51 is $30,000 per annum. Provided that the respective share of the rents by each co-owner (in addition to any supplies from any other taxable activity of that individual) is less than the threshold, the individuals are not required to register. This will be a question of fact in each case. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 18 Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited’s shares and options for policyholders Product Ruling – BR Prd 97/76 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections HH 3, HH 6, and the definitions of “beneficiary income”, “taxable distribution” and “corpus” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (“Colonial”) whereby policyholders of Colonial received shares and options in Colonial Limited. Policyholders voted on a proposal under which Colonial was to demutualise. Once demutualisation was approved, policyholders received shares and options in Colonial Limited in exchange for relinquishment of their membership rights in Colonial. The Directors of Colonial fixed an “implementation date” at which time shares and options were issued by Colonial Limited to policyholders of Colonial. However, Colonial does not know the whereabouts of all the policyholders entitled to receive shares and options. Accordingly, the Colonial Foundation Trust has been established to hold these shares and options in a fund called the transitional fund, for the benefit of these policyholders, referred to as “uncon- firmed members”. In addition to this fund, the trustee is required to establish a separate fund into which 3.5 million shares and options will be placed. This fund is established for charitable purposes only. With regards to the shares and options issued to the Colonial Foundation Trust for the benefit of unconfirmed members, the trustee will continue to search for these members. Subject to the unconfirmed member satisfying the trustee as to his or her identity, the shares and options (or proceeds from the sale of the options) and any accretions attributable to that member will be distributed to that member. Only one distribution to such an unconfirmed member will be made. No part of the trust property will be deferred for later distribution. Specific details of the operation of the Trust are contained in the draft Trust Deed dated September 1996. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •This Ruling only applies to distributions made from the Transitional Fund to a policyholder who was a New Zealand resident as at the date the Transi- tional Fund was established and who is a New Zealand resident at the time of distribution. •The trusts in respect of each New Zealand resident unconfirmed member will remain “foreign trusts” as that term is defined in section OB 1. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) 19 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •In respect of each New Zealand resident unconfirmed member, the shares and options (or proceeds from the sale of such securities) and any income attribut- able to that property are held on separate trusts for the benefit of each New Zealand resident unconfirmed member. Accordingly, section HH 6 will apply to each of these trusts separately in characterising the distribution made to an unconfirmed member. •The corpus of each trust relating to a New Zealand resident unconfirmed member will be equal to the market value, as at the date of settlement, of the shares and options settled on each trust in accordance with the definition of “corpus” in section OB 1. •Distributions made to a New Zealand resident unconfirmed member must be included in the gross income of that member under section HH 3 to the extent the distribution is “beneficiary income” and “taxable distribution” as those terms are defined in section OB 1. Neither “beneficiary income” nor any “taxable distribution” will include: •The corpus (being an amount equal to the market value of the shares and options as at the date of settlement); and •Any capital gains or capital profits from the realisation by the trustee of the shares and/or options settled on each trust in respect of each New Zealand resident unconfirmed member. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 3 October 1997 to 3 October 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3rd day of October 1997.

We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers.
