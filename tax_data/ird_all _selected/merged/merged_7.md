Rewriting the Income Tax Act: objectives, process, guidelines was published in 1994, followed in 1995 by Core provisions: rewriting the Income Tax Act. The latter proposed new core provisions that were enacted in 1996. The present discussion document deals with the rewrite of Parts C, D and E, the most frequently used parts of the Act. It outlines proposals encompassing structure, language and presentation for this next, important stage of the rewrite. Samples of draft legislation have been included to show readers what to expect of the new style, and how the rewrite principles will be put into practice. The objective of the rewrite is to ensure that the law is applied in the way Parliament intended and to make it easier for taxpayers to meet their tax obligations. The release of this discussion document is part of the Government's generic tax policy process, which formally subjects major tax policy reforms to public consultation at key points in their development. We thank all those who have been involved so far in the consultation process that has formed part of the rewrite of the Act, and look forward to receiving submissions on the changes proposed here. Hon Winston PetersRt Hon Bill Birch Deputy Prime Minister andMinister of Finance and TreasurerMinister of Revenue 2 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. This discussion document describes the Government’s proposals for the next phase of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The Parts to be rewritten in this phase are Parts C (gross income), D (allowable deductions), and E (the timing of gross income and allowable deductions). 2. As part of the continuing consultative process for tax reform, the Government welcomes submissions on the proposals. It is intended that legislation rewriting the three Parts will be introduced next year. Why rewrite the Income Tax Act? 3. The current state of the Act can make it difficult for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations and for Inland Revenue to ensure the legislation is applied in the way Parliament intended. Significant costs are imposed on the economy as a result. 4. The rewrite is intended to remove unnecessary complexity from the Act, thereby reducing these costs. This involves: •developing a coherent, logical and flexible structure for the Act; •rewriting provisions in plain language. 5. The rewrite will help users of the Act to find and understand all the rules that apply to a particular situation, and to determine the underlying policy intent of the law. 6. In creating a clearer Act it is inevitable that some policy issues will, for practical reasons, need to be dealt with as part of the rewrite process. However, the rewrite is not a forum for any substantial policy reform. What is this document about? 7. This discussion document is divided into three parts. •Part One contains a discussion of the proposed approach to the rewrite of Parts C, D and E. It sets out the implications of the core provisions for the rewrite of those Parts and the main structural and drafting principles to be applied. •Part Two presents the proposed structures for the three Parts in more detail, using flowcharts, organisational charts and commentary. It also contains draft legislation for Subpart B of each Part. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 •Part Three contains illustrative drafts of legislation from Parts C, D and E rewritten in plain language within the structures proposed earlier in the document. The legislation included is that relating to dividends, employer expenditure, films and a proposed valuation approach for Part E timing rules. Part Three also discusses a proposed approach to rewriting the depreciation rules under the structure proposed for Part E and to rewriting the associated persons rules. Why is structure important? 8. A sound structure is essential to creating a more coherent scheme for the Act. A coherent scheme can clarify the policy intent of provisions and thus aid interpretation. 9. Although the reordering of the Act and the new core provisions have improved the Act’s structure, structural weaknesses at the Part level still need to be resolved. Part C 10. Part C of the Act lists amounts that are gross income and amounts that are not gross income. The list will be organised in a more coherent manner by having regard to the type of transaction, as well as the subject matter. For example, there will be a Subpart including all amounts recovered in respect of a loss, such as a bad debt, for which a deduction has previously been taken. Part D 11. One of the main difficulties with the current Part D is the uncertainty in the relationship between the general rules for deductibility and the more specific deduction provisions. 12. Under the proposed structure, the current general deductibility rule and the prohibition on deductions for amounts of a capital nature will operate as pivotal rules. The relationship between the general rule and the more specific rules will be clarified largely by classifying the specific rules as limitations to or expansions of the general rule. 13. In line with the proposed structure for Part D, it may be desirable to remove provisions that replicate the general rule (for example, the first two limbs of the interest deductibility rule). 5 Part E 14. The current Part E contains a number of timing rules that have similar goals but are subject to different sets of rules. It is proposed to bring these rules together under two main standardised approaches (the valuation basis and a derived/incurred basis). 15. It is proposed to place the rules on trading stock, accrual expenditure, revenue account property, and depreciation and a number of spreading provisions on the valuation basis. This basis allows for clearer expression of the rules without changing their result. What is plain language drafting about? 16. Plain language drafting is about conveying the intended message of the legislation in the plainest possible manner. It involves, among other things, using words according to their commonly understood meaning, sentences that contain only one central message, and consistent formatting. 17. In the rewrite, methods other than conventional narrative, such as flowcharts, diagrams and schedules, will be used to convey information if they are likely to assist the reader. 18. Plain language cannot remove all complexity from the Act, but it will ensure that complex subjects are expressed as clearly as possible. 6 7 PART ONE THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 8 9 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Summary The next phase of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act involves rewriting Parts C, D and E together. This discussion document sets out broad proposals for structuring these Parts and for expressing them in plain language. Rewriting the Act will reduce the costs imposed on the economy by the way the Act is structured and expressed. It will ensure that the Act more clearly reflects the intended policy and how to comply with tax law. Although the rewrite aims to reduce complexity in the way the legislation is expressed, it cannot reduce the complexity of the underlying concepts. Existing ambiguities may need to be clarified in the rewrite. Substantial tax policy issues, however, will be considered by means of the generic tax policy process, the Government’s formal process for developing tax policy. Submissions are sought on the structural and drafting proposals in this document. 1.1. This discussion document describes the approach proposed by the Government for the rewrite of Parts C, D and E of the Income Tax Act 1994. Part C will contain the provisions that designate amounts as gross income, and Part D will contain the provisions that determine deductibility. Part E will contain the provisions that determine the income year in which amounts of gross income are to be returned, and deductions are to be allowed. 1.2. Parts C, D and E are the three most commonly used Parts of the Act, since they contain the fundamental rules that taxpayers must observe when calculating their taxable income. 1.3. The rewrite of these Parts is the next phase of the progressive rewrite of the Act. It follows the reordering and renumbering of the Act in 1994 and the enactment of new core provisions of the Act in 1996. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 10 Background and context 1.4. The Land and Income Tax Assessment Act 1891 was 24 pages in length. By contrast, the Income Tax Act 1994 spanned approximately 1300 pages when the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 was enacted in July 1996. To some extent the length of today’s Act reflects the growing complexity of the business environment over the years, especially in the last two decades. 1.5. Even so, much of the growth in the Act is a result of adding a great many new provisions to a structure unable to accommodate such changes easily. 1.6. As a result, the Act lacks both structural cohesion and clear expression. This in turn imposes various costs on individual taxpayers and society generally. The rewrite project seeks to reduce these costs by better expressing both Parliament’s objectives in enacting the legislation and the actions taxpayers must take to comply with these objectives. This will be achieved primarily by imposing a more coherent and logical structure on the Act, and by drafting the legislation in language that is as clear as possible. 1.7. These changes are essential given the tax system’s increasing reliance on self-assessment, and the associated introduction of new compliance, penalty and interest provisions designed to place more responsibility on taxpayers for the accurate calculation of their income tax liabilities. As a result, taxpayers must be able to understand the Act sufficiently to be able to identify their obligations and the process they are expected to follow to discharge these obligations. This makes it even more important that tax law is as clear as possible. 1.8. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act is being completed in stages in order to make the exercise more manageable and to allow taxpayers to comment on and absorb the changes progressively. The first stage involved the reordering and renumbering of the legislation; like provisions were grouped together and an alpha-numeric numbering system was introduced. This stage was completed with the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the incorporation of most of the administrative provisions into the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.9. The second stage culminated in the enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. The key objectives of the new core provisions are to: • introduce a global/gross approach to determining income tax liabilities; 1 1 Net concepts, such as profit or gain, are placed on a gross footing when possible. For example, the full amount received from the sale of certain land is now gross income, the cost is deductible, and the timing of the deduction is more clearly set out in the legislation. All items of gross income and allowable deductions that are timed to an income year are added together and the total deductions subtracted from the total income to give the net income figure for the year. 11 • specify the key steps taxpayers must follow to determine and satisfy their tax obligations; • provide for the application of the later Parts; • provide an overview of the scheme and purpose of the Act. 1.10. The developing structure of the Act began with the reordering exercise and the core provisions, which set the framework for a clearer scheme of the legislation. Clarification of the scheme will remain a key focus of the rewrite of the rest of the Act. Benefits of the rewrite 1.11. Improved structure and language will enable people who need to apply the legislation to: • better understand the processes for satisfying their obligations; • find the legislation that affects them; • ensure that relevant rules are not overlooked; • better understand the policy intent of the legislation as enacted by Parliament. 1.12. Clearer legislation will reduce the scope for strained or artificial interpretations and help ensure that the law is applied as intended. The rewritten Act will also provide a flexible framework within which future policy initiatives can readily be accommodated. Rewriting Parts C, D and E together 1.13. Under the new core provisions, the first step in calculating an income tax liability is to subtract annual allowable deductions from annual gross income to determine net income. To calculate annual allowable deductions and annual gross income taxpayers must: • determine gross income under Part C; then • determine allowable deductions under Part D; and • allocate those amounts to an income year under Part E. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 12 1.14. This interrelationship between the three Parts provides the rationale for rewriting them together. Rewriting Parts C, D and E together also means that: • It will be easier to achieve consistent and coherent structures for the three Parts. • Fewer consequential amendments will be needed than if they were tackled separately. 1.15. An objective of this phase of the rewrite is to ensure that each Part contains the statutory rules relating to its subject matter. This will enable users to find the respective rules relating to income, deductions or timing in their dedicated locations. Scope of the rewrite 1.16. Although the objective of the rewrite is to enhance the readability of the legislation, some complexity is inevitable because the legislation must cater for a wide range of complex commercial transactions and situations. The rewrite aims to reduce complexity in the way the legislation is expressed, but it cannot reduce the complexity of the concepts that need to be expressed. 1.17. There are two aspects to improving the way the legislation is expressed: making the Act’s scheme more apparent and writing the provisions more clearly. Both aid interpretation. 1.18. Because of the complexity of the subject matter, drafters may sometimes have to choose between a clearer scheme and the use of plain language. In such cases the drafting style may need to be adapted to suit the subject matter. 1.19. The rewrite is not a forum for substantial tax policy reform or initiatives. Even so, a necessary part of the rewrite is the resolution of existing ambiguities and the clarification of poorly drafted provisions. Some of these issues will, for practical reasons, need to be dealt with in the rewrite itself. 1.20. Substantial matters of policy will progress through the generic tax policy process. When possible, these policy issues will be addressed in tax policy initiatives undertaken in tandem with the rewrite (for example, the updating of the trading stock rules, the review of the accrual rules, and the move to codified self-assessment). These initiatives also have clarification of the law as their main objective. 13 Submissions 1.21. Rewriting the Income Tax Act involves the development of coherent structures and drafting in plain language. This discussion document makes proposals for restructuring Parts C, D and E and illustrates the advantages of plain language drafting with sample pieces of rewritten legislation from these Parts. The Government seeks submissions on both the structural and drafting proposals in this document. 1.22. Submissions should be addressed to: Rewrite Project C/o the General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Facsimile: (04) 474 7217 1.23. Submissions should be made by 7 November 1997. They should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. Submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. 1.24. Following the Government’s consideration of submissions on this discussion document, the next step in the consultation process for the rewrite of Parts C, D and E will be the release of three papers containing illustrative draft legislation and proposals in relation to some policy issues. 1.25. Draft legislation rewriting Parts C, D and E is planned for introduction in Parliament in 1998. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 14 CHAPTER 2 DEVELOPING THE STRUCTURE Summary The work begun by the core provisions in establishing a more coherent structure for the Act now needs to be continued in each subsequent Part. The main structural weaknesses that remain in Parts C, D and E are: • the lack of a logical ordering of provisions; • lack of clarity of relationships between provisions; • the overlap of provisions with similar functions. The main structural principles used in the rewrite to make the Act more coherent are: • ordering provisions from the general to the specific; • clarifying relationships between provisions by using a pivotal rule followed by expansions and limitations to show departures from that rule, when possible; • minimising overlap of provisions and reducing repetition. 2.1. Creating a clearer scheme for the Act requires a logical organisation of the material that takes into account both the function of provisions and their subject matter. The 1994 reordering process, and the enactment in 1996 of the core provisions, significantly clarified the Act’s scheme. Further improvements will be made as the rewrite progresses. This chapter: • notes the progress made to date in reorganising the legislation; • identifies remaining structural problems; • outlines some general principles that will be applied in the remaining phases of the rewrite to resolve these problems. Progress to date 2.2. The reordering process and the new core provisions have significantly improved the Act’s structural coherence. 15 2.3. The new core provisions give the Act a more consistent scheme and confirm that the global/gross approach to calculating taxable income underpins the Act. Consequential amendments consistent with this approach have been made to the remainder of the Act. 2 2.4. The core provisions also provide the blueprint for an improved structure. Each Part of the Act will have a specific function, and the Parts contain the relevant rules for their subject matter. 2.5. The challenge now is to apply the structural principles used in the core provisions to the rest of the Act. Remaining structural problems 2.6. Despite the improvements made to date, the Act still contains a number of structural weaknesses: • At a level more detailed than the core provisions, it does not always demonstrate a consistent scheme. • It is often difficult to discern the relationships between provisions. • It is sometimes unclear which rules apply to a particular situation because provisions seem to overlap or are linked with each other in a way that is not clear. • It can be difficult to find the relevant rules, particularly those with a function that is inconsistent with their current location. 2.7. Resolving these problems through more robust structuring of the legislation is critical to achieving a more coherent Act. A sound structure also provides the framework for addressing drafting weaknesses in the legislation. General structural principles 2.8. The main objective in structuring the legislation is to make it more coherent. To achieve this, legislation should be organised in a manner that makes intuitive sense to users. The Government intends to adopt several structural principles to achieve this objective in the rewrite of the Income Tax Act: 2 Such amendments include the consistent use of terms (for instance, “gross income” in place of “assessable income”, as appropriate, and “net loss” in place of “loss”, as used in the sense of a loss for an income year). PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 16 Organising from the general to the specific 2.9. Parts, Subparts and sections of the Act will generally begin with more widely used rules and conclude with less widely used rules. 3 2.10. An allied principle is to organise the Act so that users are presented with a defined path that they can follow easily to comply with the legislation in any given circumstance. The steps along the path will usually become more limited in their application, and users will be able to tell when they have reached their destination. Using general rules to perform a pivotal role 2.11. General rules will be used in a number of instances to form a pivotal role for a group of more specific rules. Pivotal rules assist in clarifying relationships between the provisions in the group. They can also articulate the underlying policy intent of a group of provisions. 4 Minimising overlap 2.12. When possible, the categories within which items are grouped will be self- contained and exclusive. This will provide greater certainty as to which rule applies to a particular set of circumstances. 5 Grouping like with like 2.13. Grouping provisions with like functions or subject matter produces two benefits. The first is convenience, because users will be able to find more readily all provisions that may be relevant in a particular case. Second, it allows users to rely with confidence on the context provided by the surrounding provisions when interpreting an unfamiliar section. 6 Reducing repetition 2.14. Repetition in the legislation will be reduced as far as possible. Provisions that replicate an effect that is achieved elsewhere in the legislation will generally be deleted. 7 In other cases, a common set of rules will be used to govern provisions that achieve the same policy effect. 8 3 For example, exempt income provisions (which are generally of limited application) will be placed towards the end of Part C rather than at the beginning, as at present. Employment income will appear early in the Part, with the more specialised provisions, such as life insurance, appearing towards the end. 4 For example, the general deductibility rule and capital prohibition will operate as pivotal rules in Part D to clarify the relationship between those rules and other deduction provisions. 5 For example, Part E will contain three categories of timing rules – valuation, derivation/incurrence and retrospective spreads – based on the broad function of the various rules. 6 For example, Part C will contain a Subpart that brings together all provisions on gross income attributable to a disposition of property. 7 For example, provisions that replicate the general deductibility rule, discussed in chapter 5, will be deleted. 8 The trading stock, accrual expenditure, and revenue account property rules lend themselves to this kind of rationalisation. 17 Using a consistent format 2.15. Adopting standard formats can make the Act more accessible. For example, inclusions, exclusions and other rules relating to the relevant subject matter will be used consistently when possible. Providing an overview of each Part 2.16. As envisaged during the reordering process, Subpart A of each Part will contain a provision setting out the main function or functions of the Part. 2.17. Subpart B of each Part will form the basis for the application of the remaining Subparts. It will direct readers to the information in the Part that is relevant to their circumstances. It will also provide a link back to the core provisions. 2.18. Aspects of plain language that will be used to overcome weaknesses in the drafting style in the current Act are discussed in chapter 7. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 18 CHAPTER 3 THE FUNCTIONS OF PARTS C, D AND E Summary Together, Parts C, D and E define the elements that determine net income. To help readers find the relevant rules quickly, statutory rules on gross income, allowable deductions and timing will be identified in Parts C, D or E respectively. One consequence is that the rules in Subpart BD of the core provisions will be moved to one of the three Parts. The words “derived” and “incurred” will become more clearly identified with timing in Part E and used more sparingly in defining gross income and allowable deductions in Parts C and D. The qualified accrual, controlled foreign company, and foreign investment fund rules will remain on a net basis. The structure developed for Parts C, D and E, however, is flexible enough to place the qualified accrual rules on a gross basis in the future if it is desirable and feasible to do so. 3.1. What are the respective functions of the Parts? This is the first question to be answered in applying structural principles to Parts C, D and E. The starting point for determining these functions is the core provisions. 3.2. Under the core provisions, the first step in calculating an income tax liability is to subtract annual allowable deductions from annual gross income. This requires that the amounts of gross income and allowable deductions be identified and timed to income years. 3.3. The function of Parts C, D and E in the tax calculation process is, therefore, to provide the necessary ingredients to determine annual gross income and annual allowable deductions. General function of Parts C, D and E 3.4. For consistency with the approach envisaged by the core provisions, Parts C, D and E should contain the statutory rules for ascertaining whether an amount is gross income or an allowable deduction, and the timing of gross income and allowable deductions. This approach will give users of the Act confidence that they have obtained all the information they need for any given step in the calculation process. 19 3.5. In some instances it will not be practical in this phase of the rewrite to remove all rules relating to gross income, allowable deductions, and timing from their current context in other Parts of the Act. As an interim solution, the Parts should provide signposts to the current location of those rules. This will ensure that Parts C, D and E nevertheless perform their respective functions until the provisions can be later absorbed in the relevant Part in a subsequent phase of the rewrite. Implications for the core provisions 3.6. A consequence of rewriting the legislation in phases is that the rewrite of later Parts necessitates changes to Parts rewritten in earlier phases. Changes to the core provisions will, therefore, be required as part of the rewrite of Parts C, D and E. 3.7. If Parts C, D and E are to perform their intended functions, it is necessary to locate all the rules relating to income, deductions and timing in the appropriate Part. 3.8. This proposed approach will result in most of the current Subpart BD shifting to Part C, D or E as appropriate. The principal changes are: • The general deductibility rule and the main prohibitions on deductibility currently contained in section BD 2 will be moved to Part D. • The content of sections BD 3 and BD 4, which give legislative recognition to the derived and incurred concepts, will be moved to Part E. 3.9. Gross income will continue to be defined in the core provisions as excluding amounts that do not have a New Zealand source and that are derived by non-residents. This ensures that if the Act does not apply to a person because of these rules, the person does not have to read any further than necessary. 3.10. The proposed relocation of most of the Subpart BD provisions will result in core provisions that are clearly focused on their main function, which is to prescribe the process to be used to calculate annual tax liability. The role of each Part in the net income calculation 3.11. The individual functions of Parts C, D and E are determined by their role in ascertaining annual gross income and annual allowable deductions and, consequently, in calculating net income. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 20 3.12. The core provisions will, as at present, direct readers to each Part in the appropriate order. To ascertain annual gross income and annual allowable deductions, a taxpayer has to: Step 1:identify whether an amount is gross income (Part C) or an allowable deduction (Part D); Step 2:apply any specific quantification and apportionment rules to determine the amount of gross income (Part C) or allowable deduction (Part D); Step 3:determine whether an amount of gross income or an allowable deduction is to be allocated to one or more income years on a prospective or retrospective basis, or on a common law or statutory derived or incurred basis (Part E); Step 4:if the gross income or allowable deduction is to be allocated on a prospective or retrospective basis, make the allocation using the relevant method (Part E); Step 5:if the gross income or allowable deduction is to be allocated on a derived or incurred basis, make the allocation accordingly (Part E). 3.13. Finally, the timed amounts are added together to determine annual gross income and annual allowable deductions in order to begin the calculation of net income and the income tax liability. 3.14. Figure 1 sets out the relationship between the core provisions and Parts C, D and E. The concepts of derived and incurred 3.15. The concepts of “derived” and “incurred” have two aspects. The derivation of income and the incurrence of expenditure can determine their quality as income or expenditure. The concepts of derived and incurred can also determine the income year in which the amount in question should be recognised. Under common law, amounts have historically been recognised as income when “derived” and expenditure allowed as a deduction when “incurred”. 3.16. In terms of the functions of Parts C, D and E, concepts of derivation and incurrence will become more clearly identified with timing. The legislation will make it clear (as do the current sections BD 3 and BD 4) that in the absence of any statutory rule the common law concepts of derivation and incurrence will determine timing. In addition, some statutory timing rules will be expressed in terms of a deemed time of derivation or incurrence. 21 3.17. Because the existence of income and expenditure, for tax purposes, depends on the amount in question having been derived or incurred, the non-timing aspects of derivation and incurrence will necessarily remain part of the determination of gross income and allowable deductions. However, the extent to which it is necessary to retain the terms “derive” and “incur” in Parts C and D will be considered in this phase of the rewrite. Apportionment 3.18. If income or expenditure serves both taxable and non-taxable ends it may need to be apportioned. Apportionment is an integral part of the quantification of gross income and allowable deductions. 3.19. A number of provisions that require the apportionment of expenditure operate on the basis of allowing a deduction for the expenditure and subsequently disallowing part of the deduction. The scheme of the core provisions, however, precludes the concept of negative deductions. The rewritten deduction provisions will, as far as possible, adopt the form of either allowing or denying a deduction, with apportionment rules expressed as adjusting the amount of the expenditure rather than the deduction. 3.20. This approach arguably removes the need for the words “to the extent that” in the general deductibility rule currently contained in section BD 2(1)(b). This issue, along with other issues relating to apportionment, will be dealt with in a later review of the apportionment rules. The review will be undertaken before the rewrite of the current apportionment rules in Part F of the Act. 3.21. A variation of this approach will be developed if apportionment adjustments are required on a continuing basis. This currently requires reductions to allowable deductions. For example, under the depreciation rules the part of the cost of the asset that is attributable to an income year must be apportioned if the asset is used for private purposes. It is proposed that instead of reducing allowable deductions, apportionment adjustments be treated as gross income of the taxpayer claiming the deduction. Net regimes 3.22. The global/gross approach signals a move to greater codification of the law in that it specifies the steps involved in determining tax liabilities – something that the legislation previously did not expressly do. Therefore the focus is now more clearly on what the legislation determines to be gross income, rather than on the ordinary concept of income. 3.23. In that context, an issue that must be dealt with is whether remaining net rules, such as the controlled foreign company, foreign investment fund and qualified accrual rules, should be put on a gross basis by the legislation. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 22 3.24. These regimes can be regarded as sitting uncomfortably with both the global/gross approach, and the five-step process outlined earlier in this chapter, since they involve the offset of one amount against another to yield a net figure. On the other hand, it is possible to view them as providing a mechanism for determining an amount that is treated as gross income or an allowable deduction of a taxpayer. Viewed in this manner, the regimes can be accommodated within the general scheme proposed. Therefore it is not proposed to place the regimes on a gross basis at this stage. 3.25. The proposal to leave the accrual rules on a net basis is consistent with current accounting practice. For example, in the case of a financial arrangement which is a loan, an advance or repayment is not treated as income or expenditure, as would occur if the qualified accrual rules were put on a gross basis. 3.26. However, a key objective in developing a structure for the various Parts of the Act is to ensure that the structure is sufficiently flexible to accommodate future tax policy developments. The structure developed for Parts C, D and E will have the flexibility to place the qualified accrual rules on a gross basis in the future if it is desirable and feasible to do so. 23 FIGURE 1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CORE PROVISIONS AND PARTS C, D AND E OF THE ACT PART B - CORE PROVISIONS BC 4 Annual gross income Is amount gross income?

Items of gross income will be placed in one of the following categories: • general gross income (employment and entitlement income, amounts from sales or dispositions, and amounts from investments and other transactions); • the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules; • industry rules; • recoveries and adjustments. Amounts that would be gross income but are exempt or excluded from gross income will be placed in separate categories. Items of gross income attributed to another taxpayer will be separately identified. Rules defining items charged with taxes other than income tax (for example, fringe benefit tax and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax) will be moved to Part C because they are equivalent to gross income. The charge is generally, in substance, a final withholding tax. The definitional rules will be rewritten later with the other Part N rules. 4.1. The proposed function of Part C is to enable taxpayers to readily determine their gross income. This will be achieved by grouping within the Part all gross income provisions, including provisions that prescribe what is not gross income and provisions that attribute gross income to a particular taxpayer. Gross income will be quantified in Part C on an untimed basis and then allocated to an income year under Part E. 4.2. Part C will also include “income equivalents”, which are items such as fringe benefits that are subject to tax because they are income of a person other than the person charged with the tax. 25 Current rules 4.3. The current Part C includes a long list of items that are gross income. Items in the list have been introduced over time to expand the income tax base, often by clarifying the capital/revenue boundary. Accordingly, Part C is now an itemised account of amounts that are within the income tax base. 4.4. The current organisation of Part C provisions is largely based on their similarity of subject matter. However, it can be difficult to ascertain from the Subpart heading what provisions are likely to be found in the Subpart. The organisation of the provisions would be improved if, in addition to subject matter, account were taken of the type of transaction that gives rise to the gross income. Proposed structure 4.5. One of the main aims in restructuring Part C is to create Subparts with headings from which readers can readily ascertain the likely content. 4.6. A further aim is to create Subparts that are self-contained and do not, therefore, overlap with other Subparts. This will provide readers with the certainty that they do not need to read further. 4.7. Basing the categories on the type of transaction rather than subject matter alone also affords greater scope for the rationalisation of provisions under more general or widely applicable rules – for example, provisions relating to recoveries, as discussed below. 4.8. The structure proposed for Part C is based on the groupings discussed in the remainder of this chapter. General gross income categories Employment and entitlement income 4.9. This category includes amounts received as an employee, such as wages and accommodation benefits, and other forms of payment (“entitlement income”) such as ACC, social welfare benefits and the like. The rationale for locating employment and entitlement income together is that entitlement income can substitute for employment income in that it is (often for social policy reasons) provided to those not in paid employment. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 26 Amounts from dispositions 4.10. This category includes amounts from land and personal property transactions if a disposition triggers a tax liability. It will not include all provisions that bring sale proceeds into the tax net. For example, it will not include the dividend rules to the extent that they apply to dispositions between companies and shareholders, because the trigger for the liability is the company/shareholder relationship rather than the disposition itself. 4.11. Provisions that apply both to dispositions and other situations may need to be split and their various elements placed into the relevant categories. The main example of this is the current section that includes amounts derived from a business as gross income (section CD 3). Amounts from investments and other transactions 4.12. This includes investment income other than dividends. A separate Subpart for dividends is required because of the extent of the legislative detail involved. Controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds 4.13. This category includes the definitional aspects of these rules relating to gross income. Timing and quantification aspects will be moved to Part E. Industry rules 4.14. This category includes the gross income aspects of the life insurance and other industry rules. Recoveries and adjustments 4.15. Amounts recovered and apportionment add-backs will be included in this category. It will contain several specific provisions relating to recovered amounts that perform essentially the same function and thus could readily be replaced with a general provision. Amounts that are not gross income Exempt income 4.16. This category includes items that are specifically exempt from tax, such as the income of charities. 27 Excluded income 4.17. Excluded income means amounts that the statute excludes from tax other than by specific exemption. Even though they are similar in nature, it may be necessary to retain the distinction between excluded income and exempt income. This is because if the expenditure incurred relates to the derivation of both gross income and exempt income, apportionment principles apply. However, the position with excluded income is less clear. Submissions are invited on the issue. Attributed income 4.18. The focus of the core provisions is on gross income that “belongs” to a particular taxpayer. Therefore readers need to find out from Part C not only what constitutes gross income but also what constitutes their gross income because of their status. For example, taxpayers who are beneficiaries under a trust should be able to ascertain from Part C that beneficiary income must be included in their gross income. 4.19. This category needs to deal only with amounts derived by a person other than the recipient. It does not include amounts such as trustee income that are derived by a person in a different capacity because the person is a separate taxpayer in each capacity and explicit attribution is not necessary. Items charged with taxes other than income tax 4.20. These items are included in Part C because they are equivalent to income or would be gross income were it not for the fact that another person is charged. Charges on these items are generally, in substance, a final withholding tax. 4.21. Although these items will appear in Part C, it is not proposed to rewrite all the rules relating to them in this phase of the rewrite. This is best left until Part N is rewritten. Gross income under ordinary concepts 4.22. Although gross income under ordinary concepts referred to in the current section CD 5 does not sit easily with a codified approach, it will be retained as a catch-all for those occasions when an amount falls outside the specific provisions but nonetheless has revenue characteristics. 4.23. As noted in the May 1995 discussion document Core Provisions: Rewriting the Income Tax Act, key areas of taxation, such as the existing boundaries between capital and revenue, are not intended to be altered by the rewrite. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 28 CHAPTER 5 PROPOSED STRUCTURE OF PART D Summary The proposals for restructuring Part D are: • The general deductibility and capital prohibition rules will be moved to Part D from the core provisions and become the pivotal rule for organising the Part. • Other deduction provisions will be expressed as expansions of or limitations to the pivotal rule to clarify their relationships • Provisions that replicate the general deductibility rule, such as the interest provisions, could be removed under the structure proposed. Submissions on the effect of this proposal are invited. Deductions allowed independently of the general deductibility rule will be separately grouped as “supplementary deductions”. Limitations with wider application to all deduction provisions will also be separately grouped as “general limitations”. Part D will allow a deduction for an amount equal to the estimated decline in the value of depreciable assets (as opposed to the annual depreciation deduction currently in Part E). The allocation of this deduction to income years will be made in Part E. This will not change the effect of current law. 5.1. The proposed function of Part D is to enable taxpayers to determine, on an untimed basis, all amounts that are allowed as a deduction under the Act. Part D should, therefore, contain all allowable deduction provisions in the Act. Current rules 5.2. Section BD 2 provides that an amount (if not excluded from being deductible by another provision) is an allowable deduction: • if it is an allowance for depreciation under Part E; or • if it is an expenditure or loss that satisfies the general deductibility rule (nexus with the derivation of gross income) specified in section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii); or • to the extent that it is allowed as a deduction under any other Part. 29 5.3. Thus allowable deductions are determined solely by the legislation. Through grouping all the entitlement and exclusory provisions together, Part D will govern allowable deductions. 5.4. Under the proposed scheme for Parts C, D and E, it will not be appropriate to continue to describe the depreciation allowance in an income year as an allowable deduction because this amount is a timed concept. To serve its function, Part D will allow a deduction for the estimated decline in the value of a depreciable asset over its expected useful life. In light of the proposed functions of the three Parts, this will not involve a change in the way in which the law operates, but only a change in the expression of the law. It will not necessitate changes in accounting practice. 5.5. Most of the present rules in Part D are exceptions to the rule that denies a deduction for expenditure of a capital nature. A theoretical option for structuring Part D, therefore, would be to replace most of the existing rules with rules specifying only those amounts that are not allowed as a deduction. However, it would be impossible to identify all amounts for which a deduction is not currently allowed, so this approach is not proposed. 5.6. Within the existing structure for Part D it is difficult to work out the relationship between the specific deductibility rules and the more general deductibility rules. The approach proposed for clarifying that relationship is discussed in the remainder of this chapter. Proposed structure 5.7. The structure proposed for Part D centres around expansions of and limitations to the general deductibility rule in section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii). Grouping expansions and limitations on the basis of their relationship to the general deductibility rule has the advantage of providing a context within which to interpret provisions. Thus if a specific rule expands the general rule, the structure will clarify that the specific rule allows as a deduction an amount that Parliament has recognised would not be deductible in the absence of the specific rule. 5.8. The proposed structure for Part D also recognises that some deductions are allowed independently of the general deductibility rule, and some limitations apply to nearly all deduction provisions. The general deductibility rule as a pivotal rule 5.9. The general principle of deductibility can be regarded as an amalgam of the general deductibility rule in section BD 2(1)(b) and the capital prohibition rule in section BD 2(2)(e). It is proposed that Part D be structured with this amalgam as its pivotal rule. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 30 5.10. Rules that seem merely to replicate the existing general deductibility rule will be removed from the Act by the rewrite. The most significant of these is probably in section DD 1(b)(i) and (ii), which relates to deductions for interest payable in deriving gross income or necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. 5.11. A consequence of the proposed change is that the deductibility of interest would be expressly subject to the capital prohibition rule. The view this document takes is that this would not have any practical impact in most cases. 5.12. For example, a hotel chain borrows money to finance the construction of a new hotel to be used in its business. Interest incurred during the construction period would not be immediately deductible because the capital is not used in the production of income until the hotel is operational. 5.13. As a consequence of the proposed change, expenditure under the qualified accrual rules will not generally continue to be deemed to be interest payable. Deductions for this expenditure will flow through the pivotal deductibility rule or, when applicable, under the rule that currently allows a deduction for interest in acquiring group company shares. 5.14. The rules governing interest deductibility are obviously a very important part of the Act. Submissions on the proposed change are therefore welcomed. Expansions of and limitations to the general deductibility rule 5.15. Expansions of the proposed general deductibility rule include: • amounts that are allowed even though they do not come within the rule; • amounts that are allowed even though they offend against the capital prohibition aspect of the rule. 5.16. Distinguishing between the two categories could give rise to technical issues at the margin without providing any apparent structural benefit. An example is section DJ 11 (expenditure in borrowing money), which could either override the capital prohibition or allow (otherwise non-deductible) expenditure of a preliminary nature. Therefore it is not proposed to structure the expansions separately. 5.17. Rules that are expressed as limitations to the pivotal rule will either be rules that are currently expressed as such or rules that are essentially limitations. An example of the latter is the treatment of bad debts under both the qualified accrual rules and the general rules. 31 Supplementary deductions 5.18. Some deductions are allowed independently of the general deductibility rule. These are generally deductions that do not depend on expenditure having been incurred but are incentives provided by Parliament through the legislation. Examples include notional interest deductions for loans by an employer on behalf of an employee to share purchase schemes and deductions for appropriations by mineral miners. 5.19. Part D will, therefore, include a Subpart dealing with supplementary deductions. General limitations 5.20. The principal limitation provisions in section BD 2 apply to most amounts that might otherwise be allowed as deductions. These include employee expenditure and private or domestic expenditure. These limitations will be set out in Subpart DB. 5.21. A limited category of items will not be subject to the general limitations. The main example of these items is the rule that allows a deduction for interest in acquiring group company shares. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 32 CHAPTER 6 PROPOSED STRUCTURE OF PART E Summary The proposals for restructuring Part E rationalise timing rules that have the same effect under two main standardised approaches (allocation on a prospective or retrospective basis, or a derived/incurred basis). Rules that allocate prospectively will be rationalised using a valuation method that compares opening and closing book values. They include the rules on depreciation, trading stock, accrual expenditure, revenue account property and those that “spread” gross income or allowable deductions. The effect of these rules will not change, and all necessary detail in the legislation will be retained. Retrospective allocation rules will be placed in a separate category and rationalised as far as possible. Rules that extend or modify the common law concepts of when income is derived or expenditure incurred will be brought together and logically ordered. Because the qualified accrual rules and the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules will not be placed on a gross basis, it is proposed to link them to the derived and incurred approach rather than place them under the valuation method. However, the valuation method may be one way to rationalise the qualified accrual rules (including those in the determinations) if all the practical issues involved in rewriting them can be addressed. 6.1. The proposed function of Part E is to allocate amounts of gross income and allowable deductions to an income year either under specific prospective or retrospective allocation rules, or as derived or incurred in that year (including amounts deemed to be derived or incurred). Part E will contain the rules that are relevant to this function. Current rules 6.2. Part E contains a number of regimes that have similar goals but are subject to different sets of rules. This obscures the scheme of the Act and creates difficulties in determining which rules apply in a given circumstance. 6.3. One of the objectives in restructuring Part E is to rationalise the rules under common themes in order to: • reduce the repetition of provisions that have the same objective; 33 • reduce current difficulties in determining which regime applies; • assist future policy development. Any new requirement for gross income or allowable deductions to be allocated can be implemented within the then prevailing legislative framework. 6.4. The current Part E contains three broad groups of provisions: • rules that allocate gross income and allowable deductions prospectively over a number of income years (for example, the depreciation, trading stock and accrual expenditure rules); • rules that deem, or effectively deem, income to be derived or expenditure to be incurred in a particular income year (for example, the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules, the qualified accrual rules and rules relating to single items such as bad debts); • rules that allow the allocation of gross income or allowable deductions to income years earlier than the year of derivation or incurrence (for example, dispositions of timber and assignments of copyright). Proposed structure 6.5. For rules that allocate prospectively, the Government proposes a single allocation method based on the opening and closing book values of deferred amounts of gross income or allowable deductions. The proposed method will achieve the same timing result as under current law, but the way it is set out in legislation will change. 6.6. Rules that extend or modify the common law concepts of when income is derived or expenditure is incurred will be set out more clearly in Part E as deemed derivation and incurrence rules. 6.7. Retrospective allocation rules will be placed in a separate category. The valuation method 6.8. The valuation method focuses on liabilities (amounts of gross income not yet allocated to an income year) and assets (amounts of allowable deductions not yet allocated to an income year). It requires the identification of opening and closing values and the subtraction of the closing value from the opening value in order to determine the amount to be allocated to an income year. The closing value for an income year determines the amount of the gross income or allowable deduction that must be allocated to one or more later income years. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 34 6.9. The main rules that will fall within the valuation method are depreciation, trading stock, accrual expenditure and revenue account property. This method will also apply to a number of spreading provisions such as those relating to premiums on leases and development expenditure of petroleum miners. The substance of these rules will not change, and all the specific detail that is necessary to their operation will be retained in the legislation. 6.10. It will be necessary to allow a deduction in Part D for an amount equal to the estimated decline in the value of depreciable assets to enable that amount to be allocated in accordance with the proposed valuation method. The opening and closing tax book values of depreciable assets can be readily ascertained from the existing depreciation schedules, so there will be little change in practice in the way depreciation is calculated. The proposed method also reflects accounting practice in addressing the disposal of depreciable assets by effectively setting off the gross income from disposal of the asset against the opening tax book value. 6.11. The current trading stock approach treats closing book value as gross income and opening book value as an allowable deduction within Part E. This is inconsistent with the roles proposed for Parts C, D and E. The identification of the opening and closing book values will simply become part of the timing function, and it will no longer be necessary to designate them as either income or expenditure. 6.12. The rules to which the valuation method applies will be split into gross income and deductions rules, with the allocation mechanism applying in the same manner to each category. The derived and incurred basis 6.13. Defining when an amount is derived or incurred will continue as the preserve of the courts. 6.14. Even so, the legislation contains a number of rules that currently deem the time of derivation or incurrence. In general, these rules will advance the time at which allocation would otherwise occur if the common law concept of derived or incurred applied. In addition, there are several “one off” timing rules that put amounts into income years on a basis that is neither derivation nor incurrence. It is proposed that these rules be incorporated in non-exhaustive definitions of “derived” and “incurred”. 35 The qualified accrual, controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules on a derived and incurred basis 6.15. As discussed in chapter 3, it is not proposed to rewrite the controlled foreign company, foreign investment fund and qualified accrual rules so they operate on a gross basis. 6.16. The controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules measure an amount that is gross income or an allowable deduction for a particular income year. The present form of the rules is thus more analogous to the rules that deem a time of derivation or incurrence. Therefore it is proposed to link these rules to the derived and incurred approach rather than to place them on a valuation basis. 6.17. In accordance with the proposed functions of Parts C and E, the provisions in the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules that deal with the quantification of attributed income will be moved from Part C to Part E. The quantification and timing processes in the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules are so closely related that it would be difficult to separate them. However, the definitional aspects of these rules will remain in Part C. 6.18. The qualified accrual rules operate on a net basis, in that annual net outcomes are gross income or an allowable deduction. Therefore it is proposed at this stage to treat the gross income or allowable deductions allocated to a year on a deemed derived or incurred basis. 6.19. The qualified accrual rules themselves, and the determinations issued in accordance with those rules, however, rank highly among the legislation with which taxpayers and advisors have the greatest difficulty. 6.20. The determinations themselves vary in approach and presentation, which suggests that rationalisation of determinations should be explored. 6.21. One possibility would be to use the valuation method if the Government can develop answers to all the practical issues involved in rewriting the qualified accrual rules. In the meantime, the rules will remain substantially as they are now. Retrospective allocation basis 6.22. Several provisions allow a taxpayer to elect to allocate amounts of gross income or allowable deductions to a given number of previous income years. 6.23. It is difficult to place these rules within a valuation method or on a deemed derived or incurred basis because they involve retrospective adjustments that are not contemplated by those approaches. A common approach will be adopted for these provisions, when appropriate. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 36 CHAPTER 7 EXPRESSING LEGISLATION MORE CLEARLY Summary Plain language drafting is about conveying the intended message of the legislation in the plainest possible manner. The words themselves will provide the primary source of meaning, assisted by purpose provisions when necessary. Words will be used according to their ordinary meaning, sentence length minimised, provisions formatted consistently and information arranged logically. Flowcharts, diagrams, formulas, tables and schedules may also be used. Principles discussed in this chapter are illustrated in Part Three of the discussion document, which contains illustrative draft legislation from Parts C, D and E. 7.1. The words of the legislation should provide a clear idea of its policy intent, but in some cases the policy can be obscured by the need to set out a process for achieving the intended result. Therefore purpose provisions may sometimes be necessary to assist interpretation, as envisaged by section AA 3(1): AA 3(1) The meaning of a provision of this Act is found by reading the words in context and, particularly, in light of the purpose provisions, the core provisions and the way the Act is organised. 7.2. Purpose provisions may be included at either a Part, Subpart or section level if they are likely to be of use to the reader. A carefully drafted purpose provision is a useful aid to interpretation because it conveys to readers the reasons a particular area of the law was enacted and how Parliament intended it to function. The language of the rewritten Act 7.3. As set out in the December 1994 discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, Process, Guidelines, and implemented in the new core provisions, the features of plain language that are being applied in the rewrite project include: • drafting provisions using common words, applied in a way that is consistent with their ordinary meaning; 37 • minimising sentence length when possible so that a sentence contains only one central message; • using grammar that is consistent with that normally used; • formatting the provisions consistently throughout the Act; • arranging information so that it can be found where the reader expects it to be found. 7.4. These aspects of plain language drafting reflect a style that conveys the intended message to readers in the plainest possible manner. Flowcharts, tables and other alternatives for presentation 7.5. Given its complexity, the Income Tax Act can benefit from the use of methods other than the conventional narrative to convey information. They include the careful use of flowcharts, diagrams, formulas, tables and schedules. Flowcharts 7.6. Flowcharts are a useful means of summarising rules that have a number of complex procedural steps (and were used for this purpose in the core provisions). They help readers find the correct answer to their particular question quickly, by providing an overview of the process and by showing the relationships between different aspects of the process. 7.7. Flowcharts demonstrating the processes involved in Parts C, D and E are set out in Part Two of the discussion document. As with the flowcharts in Part B of the Act, they will not form part of the legislation itself but rather act as an aid to interpretation. Diagrams 7.8. Part Two also contains diagrams that set out the Subpart structure for Parts C, D and E in a manner similar to that of the diagram preceding section BA 1 in the core provisions. Again, diagrams will act as aids to interpretation rather than as part of the legislation itself. Formulas 7.9. Formulas are a practical way to express a complex series of calculations, as in section EG 11, which relates to the pool method of depreciation. They can also be used to convey the relationship between items, such as that between income interests and branch equivalent income in section CG 7. This practice will continue as appropriate. PART ONE: THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO REWRITING PARTS C, D AND E 38 Tables 7.10. Presenting information in tabular form is an effective way of bringing together provisions that perform similar functions or have common elements. It allows readers to locate the relevant rule quickly. Tables can be either part of the legislation or an aid to interpretation, depending on the context. They are linked to the rest of the Act by a reference in the appropriate provisions. 7.11. Part Three explores the use of tables in defining “associated persons” and brings together the various provisions that use the definition. Schedules 7.12. A schedule can be used to separate material from the body of an Act for reasons of clarity or convenience. Often the material separated is not less important, but is incidental to understanding the law. For example, the rates of income tax are presented in Schedule 1 of the Act. Schedules are part of the legislation, not aids to interpretation. 7.13. The form and content of a schedule can vary. It can take the form of a list, such as the current Schedule 8 (Types and Classes of Livestock), or it can contain detailed rules, as in Schedule 2 (Fringe Benefit Values – Motor Vehicles). 7.14. When detailed rules are put into schedules, key principles are emphasised. This will increase the Act’s readability. Limits to clear expression 7.15. The rewrite process cannot eliminate all the complexity and inconsistencies that are inevitably part of tax legislation because the subject is inherently complex. The challenge for the rewrite is to ensure that any complexity is a result of genuinely difficult concepts, rather than the way the information is presented. The Government is confident that it can meet that challenge and develop an Income Tax Act that accurately reflects the intention of Parliament in a way that makes it easier for users to read, understand and apply the law. 39 PART TWO DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURES OF PARTS C, D AND E 40 41 Part Two of the discussion document illustrates how Parts C, D and E will be restructured using the principles discussed in Part One. Each chapter in this part contains: • process flowcharts and commentaries from which readers can find out whether an amount is gross income or an allowable deduction and if so, when that amount is to be recognised; • a new draft Subpart B for each Part to form the basis for the application of the remaining Subparts. As in the core provisions, Subpart B directs readers to the information that is relevant to their circumstances; • an organisational chart for each Part showing the structures at a Subpart level; • lists of the main provisions that will be contained in each Subpart. PART TWO: DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURES OF PARTS C, D AND E 42 CHAPTER 8 PART C: GROSS INCOME 8.1. The purpose of the new Part C will be to define amounts that are gross income and to identify the taxpayer to whom that gross income belongs. It will also define amounts that would be gross income but are exempt or excluded from gross income. The process for determining whether an amount is or is not gross income is shown in figure 2. General gross income categories 8.2. There will be three general categories of gross income under the proposed structure: • employment and entitlement income; • an amount from a disposition of property; • an amount from investments and other transactions. 8.3. The categories are intended to be mutually exclusive; only one of the three will be applicable to a particular transaction. A new Subpart CB that will include core rules for the Part should make it clear to readers which of the three applies. 8.4. Which category applies will depend on the nature of the event that triggers the tax liability. For example, an amount is a royalty if it is consideration for the use of a particular asset, irrespective of whether it arises from a disposition. Accordingly, royalties will be placed in the category for amounts from other transactions. 8.5. A subcategory of amounts from investments and other transactions will be dividends. This additional Subpart is needed because of the amount of detail involved. Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules 8.6. This Subpart will contain the specific rules that define attributed foreign income and foreign investment fund income to be included in a taxpayer’s gross income. Provisions in this Subpart that calculate the amount of gross income for recognition in a particular income year will be moved to Part E. 43 Industry regimes 8.7. These are specific rules relating to: • the taxation of the business of life insurance in New Zealand; • the treatment of other industries. 8.8. In accordance with the function of Part C, only rules that define items of gross income will be located here. Again, provisions in this Subpart that calculate the amount of gross income for recognition in a particular income year will be moved to Part E. Recoveries and adjustments 8.9. A separate Subpart will be established for provisions that treat an amount as gross income for the purposes of either: • negating the effect of a deduction previously allocated to an income year; or • limiting the effect of a deduction in the income year to which it is allocated. 8.10. The first group of recoveries and adjustments is triggered by a subsequent event that occurs in relation to the transaction. For example, a bad debt may be allowed as a deduction. If the debt is subsequently recovered, the amount repaid is gross income. 8.11. The second group operates concurrently with the deduction provisions in determining the amount of an allowable deduction. Consistent with the global/gross approach, this category will be extended to encompass some items currently expressed as limitations to deductions. For example, if a taxpayer receives a government grant to which section DC 1 applies, the allowable deductions related to the grant are reduced by the amount of the grant, and the grant is not gross income. Under the proposed treatment, the grant will be an item of gross income to the extent of the deduction allowed for grant-related expenditure. Ordinary concepts 8.12. An amount not included in one of the previous categories may be gross income under ordinary concepts. PART TWO: DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURES OF PARTS C, D AND E 44 Exempt and excluded income 8.13. Amounts are not gross income if they are exempt or excluded income. Attribution 8.14. In most cases an amount will be gross income of the taxpayer who derives it. The main exception to this principle relates to gross income derived by a trustee. Under the provisions currently in Subpart HH, gross income may be vested in, or applied for the benefit of, a beneficiary. That amount will be the beneficiary’s gross income rather than gross income of the trustee. 45 FIGURE 2 PART C SUBPART B - PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN AMOUNT IS GROSS INCOME Not gross income Gross income In a general gross income category?

The purpose of the new Part D will be to define amounts that are allowable deductions, which will fall into three categories under the proposed structure: • deductions for expenditure or loss that satisfies the general deductibility rule; • deductions for expenditure or loss that does not satisfy the general deductibility rule (expansions); • deductions for amounts created by statute (supplementary deductions). 9.2. The deduction can be denied if a general limitation applies (such as that for private and domestic expenditure). 9.3. Deductions are also subject to specific limitations. Limitations may apply to deny a deduction either for all or part of the expenditure incurred. 9.4. The process is shown in figure 4. Principles underlying the structure 9.5. The structure proposed for Part D seeks to clarify relationships within the Part by: • indicating whether a specific deductibility rule narrows or expands the general deductibility rule; or • making explicit the relationship between expansions and prohibitions – provisions that expand the general deductibility rule are not subject to the capital prohibition, but are usually subject to the general limitations. 9.6. The new general deductibility rule will be an amalgam of the current section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2)(e). 53 FIGURE 4 SUBPART B – PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN AMOUNT IS AN ALLOWABLE DEDUCTION No Capital?

Yes No Yes No Yes Yes No Yes No DB 2(2) Specific limitations Yes No No No No DB 2(1) General limitations PART TWO: DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURES OF PARTS C, D AND E 54 Expansions 9.7. Expansions will allow deductions for expenditure or losses that do not satisfy the proposed general deductibility rule. Examples of provisions that will be included as expansions are those relating to losses from misappropriation by employees, and the proposed allowable deduction based on the cost of depreciable property. 9.8. Expansions override the new general deductibility rule, but are subject to general limitations and specific limitations. 9.9. Overlaps between the new general deductibility rule and expansions will be removed as far as possible. The new rule will be applied first, with the expansion applying only if the rule is not satisfied fully or in part. Supplementary deductions 9.10. Supplementary deductions will apply independently of the new general deductibility rule. They are generally notional amounts created by the statute and do not require the incurrence of an expenditure or loss. Therefore no overlap with the new general deductibility rule is possible. Examples of notional amounts are notional interest on interest-free loans provided by employers under employee share purchase schemes, and appropriations for mineral miners. 9.11. Supplementary deductions will be subject to general and specific limitations. General limitations 9.12. In most cases general limitations will override all three deduction streams (the new general deductibility rule, expansions and supplementary deductions). General limitations will be one of the following: • expenditure or loss of a private or domestic nature; • expenditure or loss incurred in deriving exempt income; • expenditure or loss incurred in deriving income from employment; • expenditure or loss incurred in deriving schedular gross income subject to final withholding. 9.13. The main instance in which the general limitations will not apply is the provision that allows a deduction for interest incurred in acquiring group company shares. 55 Limitations to the new general deductibility rule 9.14. These limitations deny deductions for amounts that would normally fall within the new general deductibility rule. They will be expressed positively when possible. For example, section DJ 1(a) currently denies a deduction for bad debts, except when (among other things) the bad debt is actually written off. In the rewritten Part D the limitation will simply deny deductions for amounts that are not written off. Amounts of bad debts that are written off will be allowed under the new general deductibility rule, and will not be affected by the limitation.

The main purpose of the new Part E will be to provide for the timing of gross income (as determined under the new Part C) and allowable deductions (as determined under the new Part D) to appropriate income years. This will be achieved through allocating gross income and allowable deductions to a particular income year, as set out in Part E, on: • a valuation basis (prospective allocation); • a retrospective basis; or • on the basis of a derived or incurred test (the default rule). 10.2. Figure 6 shows how the new Part E will operate. Steps in the timing process 10.3. Before they can allocate gross income and allowable deductions to an income year, taxpayers must determine whether a specific allocation rule in the legislation applies to them. If not, the default basis of allocation will apply. Specific allocation rules 10.4. If gross income or an allowable deduction are subject to a specific allocation provision, the method of allocation depends on the nature of that provision. In broad terms, the specific allocation provisions either: • defer all, or a portion of an amount of gross income or an allowable deduction from one income year to one or more subsequent income years; or • permit the retrospective allocation of all or a portion of an amount of gross income or an allowable deduction from one income year to one or more prior income years. 10.5. The result is the allocation of amounts of gross income and allowable deductions to an income year. This allocation can be to a single income year or to more than one income year. Amounts allocated to an income year are aggregated to calculate the annual gross income or annual allowable deductions for that income year. 63 FIGURE 6 SUBPART B – PROCESS FOR ALLOCATING GROSS INCOME AND ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS Does a specific allocation rule apply?

A valuation method of allocation is proposed for provisions that defer amounts of gross income or allowable deductions to a later income year. 10.7. An amount of gross income that is derived in one income year but recognised for income tax purposes in a later income year is treated as a liability. Similarly, an allowable deduction for which the expenditure is incurred but recognised for income tax purposes in a later income year is treated as an asset. 10.8. The valuation method adopts the financial accounting method for measuring the cost of trading stock allocated to a financial year (the cost of goods sold). By adopting the financial accounting method for measuring the cost of goods sold, the valuation method should lead to tax accounting better reflecting the approach set out in the Statements of Concepts for General Purpose Financial Reporting, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, for the measurement of net income. This leads to greater harmonisation of tax and financial accounting. 10.9. Accountants treat the cost of goods sold as an expense for a financial year. The financial accounting method for calculating the cost of goods sold addresses the allocation of the cost of trading stock to the year in which the trading stock is sold. The amount of the cost of goods sold is measured by subtracting the closing value of trading stock from the sum of the opening value of trading stock and purchases of trading stock made in that year. This approach can be applied to all timing provisions that defer completely, or in part, the recognition of an amount of gross income and allowable deductions to years after the gross income is derived or the expenditure or loss that gives rise to the allowable deduction is incurred. 10.10. A transaction may give rise to an amount of deferred gross income or allowable deduction. For any transaction, the allocation of an amount of gross income is made separately from the allocation of an allowable deduction. 10.11. The allocation method for the valuation method in the year in which the transaction occurs is as follows: • The closing value of the deferred gross income is subtracted from the gross income derived in that year. • The closing value of the deferred allowable deduction is subtracted from the allowable deduction for expenditure incurred in that year. 10.12. In subsequent years, unless there are further amounts of gross income or allowable deductions relating to the transaction in question, the valuation approach will normally determine the amount to be allocated. This will be done by measuring the difference in the opening and closing values of the deferred gross income or allowable deduction. 65 Example Taxpayer A has a 31 March balance date. On 1 April 1997, the taxpayer derives $12,000 by way of a premium on a three-year lease. Applying the valuation method to the premium on the lease has the following result. In the first year, the opening value is zero, the closing value is $8,000, and the amount of gross income derived is $12,000. Subtracting the closing value from the sum of the opening value and gross income derived results in $4,000 being allocated to the income year. In subsequent income years, the amount of gross income derived will be zero. This means the amount allocated in subsequent income years is measured by subtracting the closing value from the opening value and will result in the allocation of $4,000 to each of the remaining years of the lease term. 10.13. If there are further amounts of gross income or allowable deduction relating to the transaction in question in a subsequent income year, they must be taken into account in the allocation process. This will apply to transactions such as purchases of trading stock and capital additions to depreciable property. Example Taxpayer B begins business in 1998 and purchases trading stock in each of the 1998 to 2000 income years. The allocation of the allowable deduction for trading stock for each income year is measured by subtracting the closing value of the trading stock from the sum of the opening value of the trading stock and the cost of purchases incurred in the income year that are allowable deductions. 10.14. The valuation method will value most assets or liabilities by reference to historic cost principles. Generally, this method assumes that the value of a deferred amount of gross income or allowable deduction will decline over time. However, for some types of gross income or allowable deductions (for example, trading stock valued at market value) the closing values are not determined by reference to historic cost principles, and it is possible that the closing value may exceed the opening value. The new section EC 1 provides for this possibility by permitting the result of the calculation of the amount of gross income or allowable deduction to be allocated to an income year to be more or less than zero. PART TWO: DETAILS OF PROPOSED STRUCTURES OF PARTS C, D AND E 66 10.15. The detailed provisions in Subparts ED to EF will set out the rules that determine the closing values. Generally, the closing value is measured by reference to the unexpired historic cost information and to the ratio of the unexpired period to the total period relevant to the asset or liability. In the year in which the last portion of an amount of gross income or allowable deduction is allocated, the closing value is zero. Ensuring the closing value is zero may eliminate the need to prohibit the double allocation of gross income or allowable deductions as envisaged in the current sections BD 3(4) and BD 4(4). This possibility will be reviewed. 10.16. The valuation method can be applied to the depreciation rules and focuses on the opening and closing tax values calculated using tax depreciation schedules. This allows for the use of consistent timing approaches and facilitates simpler legislation. An amount equivalent to the estimated decline in value of a depreciable asset over its expected useful life is allowed as a deduction. The estimated decline in value will continue to be measured by reference to the cost of the asset. Consideration from disposals of those depreciable assets is treated as gross income. 10.17. This approach to depreciable assets reflects the current policy and practice of: • amortising the cost of a depreciable asset over its estimated useful life; • making adjustments for a change in the use of a depreciable asset based on the taxation effect of the change; • netting off proceeds from the disposal of a depreciable asset against its opening tax book value to determine the depreciation recovery or loss on disposal. The retrospective allocation rules 10.18. The retrospective allocation rules change the way annual gross income and annual allowable deductions would otherwise be calculated. Since these provisions retrospectively alter a previously calculated and assessed tax position, they will be placed in a separate Subpart to reflect this difference. The default rule 10.19. If the amount is not subject to a specific allocation rule, the allocation to an income year is made under a default rule. Gross income is allocated to the income year in which it was derived, and allowable deductions are allocated to the income year in which the expenditure or loss giving rise to the deduction was incurred. 67 10.20. For the purposes of the default rule, the time of derivation or incurrence is determined under the common law approach or, for certain types of transactions, under a legislative extension to the common law approach. Extended approach to derivation and incurrence 10.21. Some provisions currently provide that, for taxation purposes, an amount may be deemed to be derived or incurred in a particular income year irrespective of common law principles. Generally, these rules require taxpayers to: • calculate an amount for an income year in relation to certain transactions or events (as in the qualified accrual rules); or • alter the time at which a specific type of expenditure is incurred (as happens to employer superannuation contributions under the 63-day rule, for example). 10.22. They will be rewritten more clearly as rules that deem a particular time for derivation and incurrence. These provisions include: • the qualified accrual rules; • the international tax rules; • other rules relating to amounts that are deemed, or effectively deemed, to be derived or incurred in an income year other than that in which they are derived or incurred under common law.

A dividend is defined conceptually as a transfer of value from company to shareholder, rather than prescriptively by way of lists of payments and credits which are or are not dividends. • It clarifies relationships between provisions by setting out expansions of and limitations to the pivotal rule. • It makes the shareholder capacity test implicit in the pivotal rule, rather than explicit. • It uses language that is plain relative to the complexity of the subject matter, accompanied by a flowchart and diagrams to assist readers understand the law. 11.1. The illustrative draft of the dividend provisions in this chapter shows the benefits of structuring a set of provisions around a pivotal rule. Here the pivotal rule is based on the concept of a benefit passing from the company to the shareholder. The other rules are then grouped according to whether they expand or limit the pivotal rule. The main advantage of this approach is that an exhaustive list of what is and what is not a dividend is not required. 11.2. The proposed approach for dividends is shown in three ways in this chapter. The first is with charts (figures 8 to 10) showing the organisation and application of the dividend definition and of the current Subpart CF. The other two are the legislation itself, and commentary on the legislation. The comments are mainly on the opening sections, where the major changes have been made. 11.3. Finally, as discussed in Part Two, Subpart CB will have a core provisions- like role within Part C. Therefore the current section CF 1, which treats dividends as gross income, will be moved to that Subpart.

Expansions to the general rule (2)The term “dividend” includes (a)in Parts B, C, E, F, and Subpart LE, but subject to section LB 1, any imputation credit or dividend withholding payment credit attached to a dividend; (b)a taxable bonus issue; (c)a cash distribution of a statutory producer board or co-operative company if the board or company makes a determination under section ME 30 or ME 35 to attach an imputation credit to the distribution; (d)a notional distribution of a statutory producer board or co-operative company if the board or company makes a determination under section ME 30 or ME 35 to attach an imputation credit to the notional distribution; (e)a rebate paid by a mutual association to a member thereof, to the extent that it is deemed to be a dividend by section HF 1(5); (f)an attributed repatriation of a person who has an income interest in a controlled foreign company; (g)a foreign tax credit of a kind specified in section CF 4; (h)a refund of foreign tax on a dividend of a kind specified in section CF 4. Limitations to the general rule (3)The term dividend does not include (a) the part of an amount, paid in respect of the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation of a share, that satisfies section CF 6, 7, 8, or 9; PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 82 (b)an amount that is otherwise subject to tax under any of the provisions listed in section CF 5; (c)a non-taxable bonus issue; (d)property received from, or relief from an obligation owed to, an amalgamating company by the amalgamated company if the amalgamating company does not exist after the amalgamation; (e) an amount paid for services provided to the company, other than an amount that is deemed to be a dividend by section GD 3 or section GD 5; (f)services provided by the company; (g)the making available of property by a flat-owning company. Defined:amalgamated company, amalgamating company, amount, attributed repatriation, company, controlled foreign company, co-operative company, dividend withholding payment credit, flat-owning company, imputation credit, income interest, non-taxable bonus issue, person, share, shareholder, statutory producer board, tax, taxable bonus issue Commentary on section CF 1 11.4. This section is the key to the Subpart. Subsection (1) defines “dividend” in a generic manner. Subsections (2) and (3) then amend the definition by, respectively, including or excluding specific amounts that do or do not otherwise come within the generic definition. 11.5. The main benefits of this approach are that it: • allows taxpayers to tell at a glance whether they need to delve further into the Subpart; • focuses on the essential characteristic of a dividend, which is a transfer of value from the company to the shareholder; • facilitates future changes to the definition, since they can readily be accommodated through changes to the expansions and limitations lists as necessary. 83 11.6. Moving to a generic approach also highlights the different ways in which property and services are treated under the current law. There is no obvious policy reason why services provided to the company at over-value or by the company at under-value should not be dividends in the same manner as goods. However, since this reflects current law, the exclusion of services has been expressly incorporated in the draft legislation by section CF 1(3)(e) and (f). Submissions on this treatment are invited. 11.7. The section contains most of the definitional aspects of the current sections CF 2 and 3, and some that are currently found in other parts of the Act. With two notable exceptions, the other matters currently dealt with in sections CF 2 and 3 (primarily concerning timing, valuation, and ancillary definitions) will be moved according to their subject matter. Schedules will be used when appropriate, for example, for the detailed valuation rules and associated definitions for capital return amounts. 11.8. The two exceptions are the explicit shareholder capacity test and the provisions that allow certain dividends to be reversed with retrospective effect. Shareholder capacity 11.9. The case law on shareholder capacity 10 has focused on whether or not the shareholder provided consideration for the benefit received from the company. The courts have held that a transfer of value from a company to a shareholder for no (or inadequate) consideration is a dividend, irrespective of the company’s motive for entering into the transaction or the fact that the shareholder is also related to the company in another capacity (such as being an employee). 11.10. The Valabh Committee on the Taxation of Distributions from Companies was apparently of the same view when recommending that the shareholder capacity test be enacted: In essence, a capacity rule is directed at excluding from the dividend definition “benefits” received from a company for which consideration is provided by the recipient either in the form of money, goods or services. 11 10 CIR v Lactagol (1954) 35 TC 230, Campbell v CIR \[1967\] NZLR 1, Holland v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,323, Davis v CIR (1983) 61,655. 11 The Taxation of Distributions from Companies (Final Report), July 1991, p.48. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 84 11.11. The shareholder capacity test in the illustrative draft is inherent in the generic rule, so the explicit test has been removed. In other words, a transfer of value to a shareholder must be in the shareholder’s capacity as such. In addition, the current test implies that the company must have intended to confer a benefit on a person in the person’s capacity as a shareholder. However, the company may not have done so in every case. For example, the dividend can arise even if a company believes that it has sold property at market value and did not, therefore, intend to confer a benefit. (Section CF 2(9A) provides for adjustments in such circumstances.) This can create confusion over the application of the test. Retrospective reversals 11.12. The Act currently allows a dividend to be reversed with retrospective effect in a number of circumstances. Taking the example used above, a company may transfer property to a shareholder believing that the transaction is at market value. If the property was transferred at undervalue and the shareholder pays the company the difference, section CF 2(9A) reverses the dividend that would otherwise arise. 11.13. In these cases, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required to amend the shareholder’s assessment for the year in which the dividend arose so as to disregard the dividend. (It may also be necessary for the Commissioner to make amendments to various tax credit accounts.) The Commissioner must refund any amount of tax that has been overpaid in terms of the amended assessment. 11.14. Measures of this nature are inconsistent with the self-assessment environment. One option would be to modify them so that the reversal is made for the income year in which the payment is made. This proposal is beyond the ambit of the rewrite but could be undertaken as part of the move to codify self-assessment. The reversal provisions have not been included in this illustrative draft. 85 CF 2 Extended meanings of “share” and “company” The provisions of this Act that deal specifically with dividends apply to the type of interest listed as if it were a share and the fund, producer board, or mutual association were a company: (a) an interest in a group investment fund if - (i)the fund is not a designated group investment fund, and (ii)the interest is not the result of an investment from a designated source, and (iii)the investor’s interest is not the result of an investment made in the fund on or before 22 June 1983, including an amount that is deemed to be invested at that date under paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of “protected amount” in section HE 2(3) (definitions concerning unit trusts); (b)membership of a statutory producer board; (c)membership of a mutual association (for the purposes of an excess rebate benefit only). Defined:amount, association, company, designated group investment fund, dividends, group investment fund, share, statutory producer board Commentary on section CF 2 11.15. This section deems certain interests to be shares in a company. It is not necessary to also deem the interest holder to be a shareholder because section OB 1 defines “shareholder” to include any holder of a share. 11.16. Two of the three interests covered by the section, namely membership of a statutory producer board and membership of a mutual association, are currently included as a precaution. It is likely that most, if not all, such entities are companies in terms of the Act in any case. 11.17. Consideration is being given to integrating this proposed provision with the appropriate definitions in Part O. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 86 CF 3 Amount of dividend General rule (1)The amount of a dividend is the difference between the amount of consideration (if any) provided by the shareholder to the company and the fully adequate consideration amount in respect of the transaction. Schedularised rules (2)Despite subsection (1), the amount of the dividend arising from the following transactions is calculated under Schedule XY: (a) a transfer of property to or from the shareholder; (b)the making available of property (including a loan) to or by the shareholder; (c) a taxable bonus issue. Services (3)Despite subsection (1), the amount of a dividend that is excessive remuneration for services under sections GD 3 or GD 5 is determined in accordance with those sections. Consideration for share (4)Neither the amount paid in respect of the acquisition of a share nor the value of the share itself is to be taken into account when the adequacy of the consideration provided by the shareholder is determined. Defined:amount, company, dividend, loan, shareholder, taxable bonus issue Commentary on section CF 3 11.18. This section details some of the valuation rules for dividends and directs users to the location of the remainder of the rules. 87 CF 4 Certain foreign tax credit amounts and refunds are dividends Foreign tax credit (1)A foreign tax credit is a dividend if the shareholder is entitled to the credit (a) under United Kingdom law for a dividend paid by a company resident in the United Kingdom, or (b)under a double tax agreement with a foreign country for a dividend paid by a company resident in the foreign country. Refund (2)An amount refunded to a shareholder is itself a dividend if the shareholder (a)derives a dividend from a foreign country, and (b)is paid the amount on account of a refund of tax of the foreign country for which the taxpayer was not personally liable and the company was authorised to deduct the tax from the dividend. Defined:amount, company, dividend, double tax agreement, income year, shareholder, tax, taxpayer Commentary on section CF 4 11.19. This section details the kinds of foreign tax credits and refunds referred to in CF 1(2)(g) and (h). 11.20. The timing rule for credits will be relocated to Part E. 11.21. The provision allowing the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time, despite the time bar, in order to give effect to the timing rule will be moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994. An alternative is to treat the dividend as being derived in the year it is paid, in which case the time bar is not an issue. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 88 CF 5 Amounts taxed elsewhere The following are not dividends: (a)an amount that is taxed as a fringe benefit; (b)an amount that is gross income because of paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” (an accommodation benefit); (c)an amount distributed by a statutory producer board or a co-operative company of the type in section CF 1(2)(c); (d)an amount derived by a shareholder in a foreign investment fund if the shareholder used either the comparative value or the deemed rate of return method to calculate its income or loss from the fund, unless section CG 22 (taxation on distributions from foreign investment funds) applies to the amount distributed; (e)a financial arrangement being a low-interest loan that has given rise to an attributed repatriation, except if (i)section CG 8(12) (transitional relief in respect of contracts entered into prior to the introduction of the controlled foreign company legislation) applies to the controlled foreign company and the low interest loan, or (ii)section DJ 19(c)(i) or (ii) (loan matures within 5 years or becomes unenforceable) applies to the financial arrangement and the shareholder has taken a deduction in terms of that section. Defined:amount, attributed repatriation, comparative value method, co-operative company, controlled foreign company, deemed rate of return method, dividend, financial arrangement, foreign investment fund, fringe benefit, gross income, loan, monetary remuneration, shareholder, statutory producer board Commentary on section CF 5 11.22. The proposed section DJ 19 will allow a current year deduction when an attributed repatriation loan matures within five years of being issued, or the shareholder is released from the obligation to repay the loan. 89 CF 6 Exclusion from dividend treatment for certain amounts paid on off-market share cancellations Amount excluded (1)The term “dividend” does not include the part of an amount, paid by a company on an off-market cancellation, that is not greater than the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the ordering rule, if (a)one of the bright line tests in subsection (2) is met, and (b)the company is not an unlisted trust that has chosen the slice rule for the share under subsection (3). Bright line tests (2)The following are the bright line tests: (a)the cancellation is part of a pro-rata cancellation that results in a 15% capital reduction for the company; (b)the cancellation is part of a pro-rata cancellation that involves a 10% capital reduction and the Commissioner has given a clearance notice under subsection (5); (c)the cancellation is not part of a pro-rata cancellation and results in the shareholder suffering a 15% interest reduction, (d)the company is an unlisted trust and the cancellation is not part of a pro-rata cancellation; (e)the share is a non-participating redeemable share. Unlisted trust may use slice rule (3)A company that is an unlisted trust may issue a share on terms that the ordering rule does not apply to the share and that the slice rule does apply. In such cases “dividend” does not include the part of an amount, paid by the company on the off-market cancellation of the share, that is not greater than the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 90 Insufficient information on certain trusts (4)If a company is an unlisted widely-held trust not resident in New Zealand and a shareholder cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate the available subscribed capital per share under the ordering rule, the share is treated as if the slice rule applied to the issue and schedule XX applies to determine the amount calculated under the slice rule. Payment in lieu of dividend (5)Subsections (1) and (3) do not apply to an amount paid by a company on cancellation of a share if the Commissioner considers that any of the payment is paid instead of a dividend, having regard to (a)the nature and amount of dividends paid by the company before or after the cancellation, and (b)the issue of shares in the company after the cancellation, and (c)the expressed purpose or purposes of the cancellation, and (d)any other factor the Commissioner considers is relevant. Notification that subsection (5) does not apply (6)The Commissioner may notify a company in writing that the Commissioner does not regard subsection (5) as being applicable to a cancellation.

Sections CF 6 to 9 detail the limitations to the dividend definition referred to in section CF 1(3)(a). PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 98 CHAPTER 12 EMPLOYMENT EXPENDITURE Summary The redrafted employment expenditure legislation removes the current section DF 1 so that the remaining rules in the Subpart are no longer expressed as exceptions to a rule denying deductions. The legislation illustrates how the sections in Subpart DF might instead be structured around the proposed general deductibility rule. The legislation groups the employment expenditure rules into the following categories: • Limitations to the general deductibility rule - for example, contributions to employee superannuation schemes are deductible only if the superannuation scheme is a superannuation fund or a company. • Expansions of the general deductibility rule - for example, deductions for pensions and retiring allowances payable to former employees may not be allowed under the general deductibility rule, but are specifically authorised. • Supplementary deductions - for example, specifically authorised deductions for notional interest on interest-free loans made to employees under an employee share purchase scheme are allowed even though deductions would not be allowed under the general deductibility rule because there is no actual expenditure or loss. 12.1. The illustrative draft of the deductibility rules in this chapter demonstrates how the sections in Subpart DF (employment expenditure) might be structured around the pivotal general deductibility rule discussed earlier. 12.2. The current section DF 1 is intended to restrict deductions for certain items unless the later sections in the Subpart allow a deduction. However, section DF 1 lacks a precise correlation with the later sections and tends to mask their true purpose. Removing section DF 1 and structuring the remaining sections in the Subpart as discussed in this chapter makes the policy intent of each section more evident. Limitations to the general deductibility rule - employment costs 12.3. The proposed sections DC 5 and DC 6 (current sections DF 3 and DF 2 respectively) cover the deductibility of: 99 • contributions to employee superannuation schemes; • contributions to employee benefit funds. 12.4. The current sections allow a deduction to an employer for contributions, amounts or payments made to employee superannuation schemes and benefit funds if: • the contribution is made to a superannuation scheme that is either a superannuation fund or a company (section DF 3(2)); or • the “rights of the employees to receive the benefits” have been fully secured (section DF 2(1) proviso). 12.5. Employer contributions to an employee superannuation scheme or an employee benefit fund are normally deductible under the current general deductibility rule because they are made in the continuing interests of the business. (The current section DF 3 is expressly made subject to section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii).) 12.6. The current general deductibility rule is, therefore, restricted by sections DF 2 and DF 3 to circumstances where the stated criteria are met. 12.7. The proposed general deductibility rule includes the capital prohibition (currently section BD 2(2)(e)). The proposed structure for Part D requires “limitation” provisions to flow through all aspects of the general deductibility rule, including the capital prohibition. Although sections DF 2 and DF 3 are not currently subject to the capital prohibition, it is not clear in what circumstances contributions to such schemes and funds could, in fact, be precluded as capital. Comments on the issue are invited. Expansions of the general deductibility rule 12.8. The proposed sections DH 3 and DH 4 (current sections DF 4 and DF 5 respectively) cover the deductibility of: • pensions payable to former employees; • retiring allowances payable to former employees. 12.9. Although the current sections also contain restrictions, their main purpose is to allow deductions for payments made to former employees irrespective of whether they would be ordinarily deductible. Consequently, the rewritten sections are expressed as expansions of the proposed general deductibility rule. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 100 Supplementary deductions 12.10. The proposed section DI 1 (current section DF 7 - Notional interest on loans made to employees under employee share purchase scheme) creates deductions for notional interest independently of the general deductibility rule. 12.11. The proposed section DI 2 (current section DF 8 - Payments to partners for services performed for the partnership) also operates independently of the general deductibility rule. Payments to partners for services performed for the partnership are precluded from deduction by general partnership law, and thus from the general deductibility rule. Section DF 8 overrides this position to give an express deduction. 101 FIGURE 11 SUBPART DF - EMPLOYMENT EXPENDITURE Provisions which restrict the general deductibility rule GENERAL DEDUCTIBILITY RULE (BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii) plus the capital prohibition BD 2(2)(e)) SUPPLEMENTARY DEDUCTIONS Contributions to employee superannnuation schemes - DC 5 (current DF 3) Provisions which expand the general deductibility rule Pensions payable to former employees - DH 3 (current DF 4) Payments to partners for services performed for the partnership - DI 1 (current DF 8) Contributions to employee benefit funds - DC 6 (current DF 2) Retiring allowances payable to former employees - DH 4 (current DF 5) Deduction for notional interest on loans made to employees under employee share purchase scheme - DI 2 (current DF 7) PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 102 DRAFT LEGISLATION AND COMMENTARY Rewritten version DC 5 Employer contributions to employees’ superannuation schemes A taxpayer who makes a superannuation contribution is allowed a deduction for the contribution only if it is an employer superannuation contribution made to a superannuation scheme that is either a superannuation fund or a company. Defined: company, employer superannuation contribution, superannuation contribution, superannuation fund, superannuation scheme, taxpayer Current version DF 3 - Contributions to employees' superannuation schemes - (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4) of this section and to sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and EO 1, a deduction shall be allowed to a person in respect of any employer superannuation contribution made by that person in that income year; and except as provided in section EO 1 any such contribution shall be deemed to be expenditure incurred at the time when the contribution is made. (2) No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (1) in respect of an employer superannuation contribution made to a superannuation scheme where the superannuation scheme is neither a superannuation fund nor a company. Commentary on section DC 5 12.12. By classifying the rewritten section DF 3 as a restriction to the proposed general deductibility rule, it is not necessary to retain the specific reference to section BD 2. 12.13. The phrase “only if” in the proposed section DC 5 incorporates the prohibition in the current section DF 3(2). 12.14. The recovery and timing aspects of section DF 3 in subsections (1), (3) and (4) (not rewritten or included here) will be moved to Parts C and E. 103 Rewritten version DC 6 Employer contributions to employees’ benefit funds An employer is allowed a deduction for amounts paid to, or set aside as, a fund to provide individual personal benefits to one or more employees of that employer only if (a)the fund is not a superannuation scheme, and (b)the rights of the employees to receive the benefits have been fully secured. Defined: amount, employee, employer, fund, superannuation scheme Current version DF 2 - Contributions to employees' benefit funds - (1)The Commissioner may allow a deduction to an employer of any amount set aside or paid by the employer as or to a fund (not being a superannuation scheme) to provide individual personal benefits to employees of that employer: Provided that a deduction shall not be allowed under this section unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the fund has been established or the payment made in such a manner that the rights of the employees to receive the benefits have been fully secured. (2)The Commissioner shall have an absolute discretion as to whether or not a deduction should be allowed under this section of the whole or any part of any amount set aside or paid by an employer and there shall be no right of challenge to any determination of the Commissioner under this section. Commentary on section DC 6 12.15. The “Commissioner discretions” have been removed in the rewritten version because they are inconsistent with a self-assessment approach. This issue will be considered further as part of the codification of self- assessment. 12.16. Structuring the rewritten section DF 2 as a restriction to the general deductibility rule requires the general deductibility rule to be satisfied in addition to any requirements of section DF 2 before a deduction is available. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 104 Rewritten version DH 3 Pensions payable to former employees A taxpayer who carries on a business is allowed a deduction for an amount paid as a pension to a former employee of the taxpayer in that business, or to the employee’s surviving spouse, if (a)the amount paid is reasonable in the circumstances, and (b)the amount is paid for past services of the employee in the business, and (c)the recipient has a right to receive the pension under a deed for a fixed period or for life or, in the case of a surviving spouse, until the spouse remarries, and (d)the employee’s employment by the taxpayer ended because the employee retired or was redundant. Defined: amount, business, employee, spouse, taxpayer Current version DF 4 - Pensions payable to former employees - (1)Subject to this section, the Commissioner may, in any income year, allow a deduction to a taxpayer who carries on a business in respect of any amount (being an amount that is not allowed as a deduction otherwise than under this section and which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case) paid by the taxpayer in that income year by way of a pension to any former employee of the taxpayer in that business, or to the surviving spouse of any such employee, in consideration of the past services of that employee in that business of the taxpayer, where subject to section FF 17 the Commissioner is satisfied that: (a)The pension is receivable by the recipient as of right under a deed for a fixed period or for life, or, in the case of a pension receivable by a surviving spouse, for a fixed period or for life or until the surviving spouse remarries; and (b)Either - (i)The employee retired from that employment; or (ii)The employee ceased to be employed by the taxpayer by reason of redundancy or other similar circumstances. 105 Commentary on section DH 3 12.17. The current section DF 4 overcomes the fact that a pension paid to a former employee may not have a direct connection with the business of the employer. Therefore section DF 4 expands the general deductibility rule. 12.18. This means that these pensions do not have to satisfy the general deductibility rule in order to be deductible under section DF 4. However, pensions that do satisfy the general deductibility rule may be deducted under that provision without the need for the taxpayer to look further. 12.19. The “Commissioner discretions” in the current section DF 4 have been removed in favour of an objective “reasonableness” test. 12.20. The reference to “similar circumstances” in the phrase “redundancy or similar circumstances” of section DF 4(1)(b)(ii) has also been removed because it was not clear precisely what other similar circumstances could exist. Moreover, the phrase seems to have been included in the original subsection out of an abundance of caution. 12.21. The link to section FF 17 (Pensions paid to someone other than the employee under a matrimonial property agreement) has not been replicated. The overriding effect of these re-characterisations will be made clearer in the rewrite of Part F. In the interim, consequential amendments will be necessary to section FF 17 to ensure that it applies to the rewritten section DF 4, as intended. 12.22. The current section DF 4(2) contains an associated persons restriction (not rewritten or included here) on the application of section DF 4. This will be rationalised with other associated persons provisions in Part G. The timing element in subsection (1) will be moved to Part E. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 106 Rewritten version DH 4 Retiring allowances and redundancy payments payable to employees Deduction for lump sum retiring allowance or redundancy payment (1)A taxpayer who carries on a business is allowed a deduction for a lump sum retiring allowance or redundancy payment that is made on the occasion of the retirement or redundancy of an employee if (a)the employee is an employee or former employee of that business, and (b)the payment is made because the employee retired or became redundant. Non-renewal of seasonal employment contract (2)In this section, “redundancy” includes a situation in which a former seasonal employee cannot be re-employed by the taxpayer because a position of the kind previously held by the employee with the taxpayer is not available. Defined: business, employee, redundant, taxpayer Current version DF 5 - Retiring allowances payable to employees - (1)The Commissioner may, in any income year, allow a deduction to a taxpayer who carries on a business in respect of the amount of any payment (being a payment which is not allowed as a deduction otherwise than under this section) made in a lump sum by the taxpayer in that income year by way of a bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance to any employee of that business on the occasion of the retirement of that employee. (2)For the purposes of this section, where the Commissioner is satisfied that - (a)Any employee of a taxpayer has ceased to be employed in the employment or service of the taxpayer by reason of redundancy or loss of office or employment or other similar circumstances; or 107 (b)Any former employee of a taxpayer is unable to be re-employed in any seasonal employment or service of the taxpayer by reason of the occurrence of circumstances that, had they resulted in a cessation of that seasonal employment or service, would have been circumstances to which the provisions of paragraph (a) would have applied, - any payment made to that employee in a lump sum by reason of that employee ceasing to be so employed, or any payment made to that former employee by reason of that former employee being unable to be so re-employed, shall be deemed to be a retiring allowance paid on the occasion of that employee's or that former employee's retirement, and that employee or that former employee shall be deemed to have retired on that date. Commentary on section DH 4 12.23. Section DF 5 allows a deduction for retirement and redundancy payments if they cannot be deducted under the general deductibility rule. The rewritten section is, therefore, presented as an expansion. 12.24. The “Commissioner discretion” has been removed in the rewritten version in light of the move towards self-assessment. 12.25. The words “bonus or gratuity” in section DF 5(1) arguably do not add anything to “retiring allowance” and have been omitted in the draft. Comments on this proposed change are invited. 12.26. The phrase “on the occasion of” has been retained because of the comment by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Smythe (1981) 5 NZTC 61,038 to the effect that the term was not intended to denote a particular point in time. 12.27. The proposed section DH 4(1) now specifically refers to a deduction being allowed for a “redundancy payment”. This means it is unnecessary to deem a redundancy payment to be a retiring allowance (current section DF 5(2)). The words in current section DF 5(2)(a), in effect, defining “redundancy” as arising “by reason of redundancy or loss of office or employment or similar circumstances” are circular and have been omitted from the draft as unnecessary. 12.28. The effect of section DF 5(2)(b), relating to seasonal employment, has been retained in a considerably simplified form in the rewritten version in an inclusive definition of redundancy (proposed section DH 4(2)). The focus is now on whether a position is available to the employee. 12.29. The reference to an employee being deemed to have retired on the date of the occasion of the employee’s retirement (DF 5(2)) has been omitted as unnecessary. 12.30. Again, the timing element contained in the current section DF 5(1) will be moved to Part E. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 108 Rewritten version DI 1 Payments to partners for services performed for the partnership Deduction for share of payment made by partner to working partner (1)A partner in a partnership is allowed a deduction, for the partner’s share of any payment made to a working partner for services performed for the partnership if (a)the partnership is not a partnership that is engaged exclusively or principally in the investment of money or the holding or dealing in shares, securities, interests in land or other investments, and (b)the payment is for services that are personally performed by the working partner as a working partner, and (c)the payment is made under a contract of service. Amount allowed as a deduction (2)The deduction allowed under subsection (1) cannot exceed the amount specified in the contract. Deduction for bonus payment (3)In addition to the deduction under subsection (1), a deduction is allowed for any bonus payment made to the working partner to which subsection (1)(b) and (c) apply. Contract of service (4)In this section “contract of service” means an agreement in writing among all the partners in the partnership that specifies the terms and conditions under which the partner is a working partner, including the amount payable for the working partner’s services and the period of the contract. Defined: amount, shares 109 Current version DF 8 - Payments to partners for services performed for the partnership – (1)Subject to section GD 3, where any payment is made by any partnership to any working partner of the partnership for services performed by that working partner as a working partner of the partnership in any period in any income year (being a period commencing not earlier than the date on which the contract of service in relation to that partner becomes binding, and ending not later than the date on which that contract of service terminates), the amount of that payment shall, to the extent that it does not exceed, as the case may be, - (a)Such amount as, in accordance with that contract of service, is the amount payable to that partner in respect of that period; or (b)The aggregate of - (i)The amount referred to in paragraph (a); and (ii)The amount (being an amount additional to the amount referred to in paragraph (a) payable to that partner in respect of the period referred to in that paragraph) of any payment of bonus or further bonus made by the partnership to that working partner for the services performed by that partner as a working partner, - be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be an amount of expenditure of the kind referred to in section BD 2(1)(b)(ii). (2)Nothing in this section shall apply in relation to any partnership which is engaged exclusively or principally in the investment of money or the holding of or dealing in shares, securities, investments, or estates or interests in land. (3)In this section - "Contract of service", in relation to a partnership and to any partner who is a working partner of the partnership, means a binding agreement in writing, entered into by all the partners, which specifies the terms and conditions under which the partner is to be a working partner of the partnership, including any amount payable to the working partner for services performed by the working partner in the carrying on of the business of the partnership under that agreement, whether or not - (a)The amount so specified includes any amount, so payable for those services, by way of bonus to the working partner; and (b)There is so payable for those services, by way of bonus to the working partner, an amount additional to the amount so specified: "Land" includes - (a)Any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal, freehold or chattel; and (b)Any option to acquire land or any such estate or interest in land: "Working partner", in relation to a partnership and to any period in an income year, means any partner of the partnership who, in that period, personally and actively performs any of the duties required to be performed in the carrying on of the business of the partnership. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 110 Commentary on section DI 1 12.31. The rewritten section DF 8 will be placed before the rewritten section DF 7 because it is more widely used. 12.32. The rewritten section DF 8 (proposed section DI 1) will be expressed as a supplementary deduction allowed independently of the general deductibility rule. 12.33. Express reference to the payment being “in respect of” a period has been removed as unnecessary. 12.34. The proposed section DI 1 deals with bonuses in a separate subsection (subsection (3)). Bonuses are treated as an additional amount allowed as a deduction rather than as part of the sum allowed. The proposed subsection is intended to have the same effect as the current section, while streamlining the existing wording. 12.35. The definition of “working partner” and aspects of the definition of “contract of service” have been incorporated into the operative provision. 12.36. The specific definition of “land” has been omitted at this stage. The possibility of including it in the more general definition of “land” will be explored. 111 Rewritten version DI 2 Notional interest deduction Deduction for notional interest (1)If an employing company makes an interest-free loan to an employee under an employee share purchase scheme, the company is allowed a deduction for an amount of notional interest on the loan calculated as if the company were the borrower. Amount of the deduction (2)The amount of notional interest allowed as a deduction under subsection (1) to the employing company is 10% per year, with monthly rests. Limitation (3)On and after the fifth anniversary of the date of the loan, no further notional interest deductions are allowed to the employing company for that loan. Group companies (4)If a company is part of a group of companies and the shares issued under the employee share purchase scheme are not shares of that company but of another company in the group, that other company is the employing company. Employee transferring to company in same group (5)An employee whose employment is transferred from one company in a group of companies to another company in the same group is considered to be in the employment of the original employing company for the purposes of deducting notional interest on the loan. Section OB 1 “shares” means fully-paid ordinary shares in a company that rank equally for all purposes with all existing ordinary voting shares of that company: Defined: amount, company, employee, employee share purchase scheme, group of companies, loan, shares PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 112 Current version DF 7 - Notional interest on loans made to employees under employee share purchase scheme - (1)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where in any income year there has been provided, or there has continued to be provided, under any employee share purchase scheme, financial assistance, whether directly or indirectly, by means of an interest free loan to any employee, the employing company in that income year is allowed a deduction of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have been payable by the employing company for that income year if - (a) An amount equal to the amount of the loan to that employee had been borrowed by the employing company at the rate of 10% per annum; and (b) Repayments made by that employee in respect of that employee's loan had been repayments made by the employing company in respect of the amount borrowed; and (c) The interest had been calculated with monthly rests: Provided that no such deduction shall be allowed in relation to any loan for any period commencing 5 years or more after the date of the loan. (3) In this section - “Employee” means... "Employing company", in relation to any employee, means the company by which that employee is employed: Provided that, for the purposes of subsection (1), in any case where that company is included in a group of companies and the shares issued to or purchased by the employee under the employee share purchase scheme are not shares of that company but are the shares of another company included in that group of companies, that other company shall be the employing company in relation to that employee instead of that first-mentioned company: “Normal retiring age”, in relation to any employee, means - “Restrictive period", in relation to any shares purchased or subscribed for by an employee under an employee share purchase scheme, means: (a)... Provided that an employee of any employing company, being a company included in a group of companies, shall, in any case where the employee transfers or is transferred to another company included in that group of companies, be deemed not to have ceased the employee's employment with that employing company, and shall be deemed to continue in the employment of that employing company so long as the employee continues to be employed by any company included in that group of companies:... "Shares", in relation to any company the shares of which are made available for purchase or subscription by any employee under any employee share purchase scheme, means fully paid ordinary shares in the capital of that company, being shares which rank equally for all purposes with all existing ordinary voting shares of that company and which have the same designation as those existing shares:... “Trustee of the scheme”, or “trustee”, means... 113 Commentary on section DI 2 12.37. Section DF 7 (proposed section DI 2) allows a deduction to a company for notional amounts. The proposed general deductibility rule does not apply. The section is expressed as a supplementary deduction provision. 12.38. The five-year limit on deductibility of the notional interest has been expressed in a manner that highlights the distinction between claiming and calculating the deduction. 12.39. An employee share purchase scheme must meet the requirements that are currently (for the most part) listed in section DF 7(2) before a company can deduct the notional interest on the loan. 12.40. These requirements must also be met under section CH 2(3) for a benefit received by an employee under the scheme to be valued at nil in calculating monetary remuneration (third proviso to section CH 2(3)). 12.41. It is proposed to move the detailed requirements of section DF 7(2) and (3) (which are not included in the illustrative draft) to Part C (proposed Subpart CC), where the first reference to them is made. The requirements may be better presented in a table in Part C. 12.42. The provisos in the current definitions of “employing company” and “restrictive period” have been included as part of the section. There is no definition of “employing company” in the section because, after moving the proviso, the meaning of the term becomes obvious. 12.43. In the definition of “shares”, the requirement to have the same designation has been omitted as unnecessary. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 114 DF 6 Payments to employees or former employees while on naval, military, or air service 12.44. The current section DF 6 allows a deduction of up to $8 per week for payments made to a former employee of a business who has been called up for service in any naval, military or air forces of the Crown. The current section CC 2 correspondingly treats these payments as gross income. 12.45. It is proposed to repeal sections CC 2, DF 6 and the corresponding definition of “serving employee”, since they now appear to be redundant. 115 CHAPTER 13 FILMS Summary The redrafted film expenditure legislation: • separates the deduction and timing elements of the current legislation and moves them to Parts D and E respectively; • minimises overlap between rules; • arranges the information in a more logical order; • illustrates how a provision’s location within a structure reflects its underlying policy; • uses plain language. 13.1. The illustrative legislation in this chapter is an attempt to clarify, through plainer expression, what are among the most confusing and overlapping sets of rules in the Act. There are no intentional policy changes in the draft. 13.2. Deductibility elements have been more clearly placed in Part D and timing elements more clearly placed in Part E. This is consistent with the functions envisaged for Parts D and E. 13.3. Unlike the current provisions, the proposed rules clearly indicate which deductibility and timing rules apply to each category of film, owner and expenditure. Although this approach gives the legislation a repetitive flavour, it will help taxpayers find the rules that apply to their particular circumstances. 13.4. The rules provide for the cost of producing or acquiring a film to be written off over a period of not more than twenty-four months, with deductibility beginning from the point at which the film is completed. These rules were intended to regularise the taxation of films by addressing incentives and loopholes in the law. 13.5. Given the concessionary treatment of film-related expenditure, the provisions do not fit into the depreciation rules. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 116 13.6. The current provisions contain a number of administrative rules such as section EO 4(10) (Revocation). These provisions have not been included in the rewritten version. It is proposed to locate them in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 13.7. The current section EO 4(12) (Expenditure deemed to occur at time of payment) has not been included in the rewritten version. It will be brought together with the current section GC 11(1) (Excessive time for payment). 13.8. The current sections EO 3(8) (Adjustment for depreciation loss) and EO 4(8) (Adjustment after asset disposal) have not been included in the rewritten version. These provisions are being addressed as part of the move towards legislative self-assessment. The allowable deduction 13.9. To reflect the concessionary treatment of film-related expenditure, the deduction for this expenditure is expressed as an expansion of the general deductibility rule. The proposed section DD 7 sets out the criteria for the deductibility of film-related expenditure, all of which must be met: • The expenditure must be incurred by the taxpayer. • The expenditure must be either “cost of production” or “cost of acquisition expenditure”. • The film must be completed. 13.10. Expenditure incurred before completion of a film meets only two of the tests. Therefore, in order to make such expenditure deductible, the proposed section EH 1 deems expenditure incurred before completion to be incurred in the year of completion. The allocation of the allowable deduction 13.11. The proposed section EL 1 sets out the rules that govern the allocation of allowable deductions. This is consistent with the approach envisaged by the core provisions (section BD 4(2)). 13.12. No specific timing rules apply to New Zealand film owners, so the expenditure is deductible when it is incurred (in the year of completion). 13.13. The illustrative legislation does not attempt to place the film-allocation provisions on the valuation basis discussed earlier. A guide to the application of the valuation approach is discussed in chapter 14. 117 DRAFT LEGISLATION AND COMMENTARY Rewritten version DD 7 Expenditure relating to a film Cost of production – film owner (1)A taxpayer who owns a completed film is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the cost of production. Cost of production – owner of right in feature film (2)A taxpayer who owns a right in a completed feature film is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the cost of production. Cost of production – owner of right in other film (3)A taxpayer who owns a right in a film that is not a feature film is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the cost of production of the film if (a)the expenditure is in the cost of production of the film that is incurred in the first income year in which the film is completed, and (b)the taxpayer incurs the expenditure in the first income year in which the film is completed. Acquisition cost - feature film or right in feature film (4)If a taxpayer acquires a feature film or a right in a feature film and the feature film is completed at a time before or after the acquisition, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in acquiring the feature film or the right. Acquisition cost – other film or right in other film (5)A taxpayer who acquires a completed film that is not a feature film or acquires a right in such a film is allowed a deduction for the cost of acquisition expenditure that the taxpayer incurs in the year of acquiring the film or the right. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 118 Current version EO 4 \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(1).\] (4)Where, - (a)In any income year any taxpayer has incurred any film production expenditure in relation to a film in relation to which the taxpayer is a film owner; and (b)That film has, by means of a final certificate issued by the New Zealand Film Commission, been certified as a New Zealand film,- the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount of that film production expenditure in the later of – (c)The income year in which that New Zealand film is completed: (d)The income year in which that film production expenditure is incurred. (5)Where in any income year any film other than a New Zealand film is completed, and any taxpayer who is a film owner in relation to that film has, whether in that income year or in any income year preceding that income year, incurred any film production expenditure in relation to that film, that taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction, in the following proportions and in the following income years for the amount or the aggregate of the amounts of the film production expenditure, - (a)The income year first mentioned in this subsection, 50%, and (b)The income year immediately succeeding that first-mentioned income year, 50%: EO 3 \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(2), and (4).\] (4)Subject to sections EO 4 and GD 12, where in any income year any taxpayer who is or becomes in that income year a film owner, owns or becomes the owner of any completed feature film or any right in such a film and remains the owner of that film or right until the end of that income year, a deduction shall be allowed to the taxpayer in that income year of an amount that, in relation to that feature film, is equal to the lesser of, - (a)The amount of the specified deduction in relation to that income year; (b) An amount equal to the residual value in relation to that income year: EO 3 \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(2), and (4).\] (9) "Residual value", in relation to a film and to any right in relation to a film, and to any taxpayer, and to any income year, means the amount of the cost of acquisition of the film or the right in relation to a film incurred prior to the end of the income year, reduced by so much of the amount as has been allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer in any income year preceding that income year; "Specified deduction", in relation to an income year and to any feature film, means an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: 119 x y where - x is the number of complete months in the period that commenced on the later of the first day of the month in which the film is completed and the first day of the income year, and ends on the last day of the income year; and y is 24, reduced by such number (if any) as is equal to the number of complete months in the period that commences on the first day of the month in which the film is completed and ends on the last day of the income year that immediately precedes the income year first mentioned in this definition; and z is an amount equal to the sum of the residual value, in relation to that income year, in relation to that film and to any right in that film. EO 3 \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(3), and (5).\] (5) Subject to sections EO 4 and GD 12, where, at any time during an income year, a taxpayer becomes the owner of any completed film other than a feature film, or of any right in any completed film other than a feature film, that taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction for the cost of acquisition of that film or of that right (to the extent that cost of acquisition was incurred by that taxpayer during that income year) in that income year and in the immediately succeeding income year in the following proportions, - (a)50% in the income year in which that film or that right was acquired; and (b)The balance in the income year immediately succeeding the income year in which that film or that right was acquired, - x z PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 120 Rewritten version Exception for broadcaster or advertising programme (6)Subsections (1) to (5) apply to a taxpayer unless (a)the taxpayer is a broadcaster whose main purpose at the time the taxpayer incurs the expenditure is to broadcast the film in New Zealand, or (b)the taxpayer’s purpose at the time the taxpayer incurs the expenditure is that the film be exhibited as an advertising programme or as a commercial. Current version EO 3(1) - Proviso \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(6)(a).\] Provided that this subsection shall not apply to any person, being a broadcaster, who has in any income year incurred any expenditure consisting of the whole or any part of the cost of production of that film, or incurred any expenditure in acquiring that film or any right in that film, and that film or that right was acquired primarily and principally for the purpose of enabling that broadcaster to broadcast that film in New Zealand. OB 1 (This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(6)(b)) “Film” – the final phrase of Paragraph (b) (b)but does not include a film that is intended for exhibition as an advertising programme or as a commercial: 121 Commentary on section DD 7(6) Paragraph (a) 13.14. The proposed provision would represent a minor change in the law because, at present, this category of broadcasters is required to deduct “film production expenditure” under section EO 4 (Cost of producing films). 13.15. The removal of these broadcasters from the ambit of the film provisions would mean that the deductibility or otherwise of their film-related expenditure would be determined under the general deductibility rules. 13.16. Currently, the provision that excludes this category of broadcasters from the present section EO 3 (Costs of acquiring any film or any right in any film) is contained in the proviso to section EO 3(1). However, the rule’s central function is to provide an exception to the main principles relating to the deductibility of film-related expenditure outlined in subsection (1). It is more appropriate, therefore, to locate it directly after the general statement of principle. Paragraph (b) 13.17. At present, advertisers are taken out of the film rules (the present sections EO 3 and EO 4) by being excluded from the definition of “film”. However, excluding advertisers in this way does not place enough emphasis on what is an important qualification to the deductibility of film-related expenditure. Therefore, in the redrafted provisions, this rule has been placed directly after the general principle that it qualifies. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 122 Rewritten version Reimbursement of amount (7)If a taxpayer incurs expenditure before a film is completed in reimbursing a person for expenditure in the cost of production, the reimbursement is expenditure in the cost of production. Defined: broadcaster, completed, cost of production, feature film, film, income year, New Zealand, right, taxpayer Current version EO 4 \[This corresponds to proposed section DD 7(7).\] (1)For the purposes of this section, any film production expenditure incurred by any taxpayer, prior to the film being completed, in reimbursing any other person for film production expenditure incurred by that other person in relation to that film shall be treated in the same manner as though it were film production expenditure incurred by that taxpayer in producing that film. Commentary on section DD 7(7) 13.18. At present this rule is contained in section EO 4(1) (reimbursement expenditure). The proposal represents a minor change because section EO 4(1) applies only to the “cost of production” of film owners, not “right” owners. The change is consistent with the underlying policy of section EO 4(1). 123 Subpart EL 1 - Expenditure relating to types of film Rewritten version EL 1 Allocation of deduction for types of film Owner of non-New Zealand film - cost of production (1)A taxpayer who becomes the owner of a completed film that is not a New Zealand film may only allocate the allowable deduction for the cost of production of the film for the taxpayer as follows: (a)to the income year in which the taxpayer becomes the owner of the completed film, an amount equal to the lesser of (i)the amount of the cost of production that relates to expenditure that the taxpayer incurs in or before the income year, and (ii)the greater of: (A)the gross income that the taxpayer derives in the income year from exploiting the right or the film, and (B)50% of the amount of the cost of production that relates to expenditure that the taxpayer incurs in or before the income year; (b)to the next income year, the amount of the cost of production that the taxpayer may not allocate to an earlier income year and that relates to expenditure that the taxpayer incurs in or before the income year in which the taxpayer becomes the owner of the completed film.

Commentary on section EL 2 13.19. The proposed section EL 2 contains two timing rules that have a more specific application than the general allocation rules stated in section EL 1.

The following definitions will no longer be included in the legislation as defined terms because their substance has been incorporated into the main provisions or other definitions: • “cost of acquisition” • “depreciation loss” • “double head finecut stage of production” • “film expenditure” • “film owner” • “film production expenditure” 139 CHAPTER 14 VALUATION APPROACH TO ALLOCATION Summary Various rules relating to the allocation of gross income and allowable deductions will be rationalised on a valuation basis. • A proposed section EC 1 will contain the mechanics for the allocation of amounts of gross income or allowable deductions on the allocation basis. This provision will link up with the individual rules for determining the closing value of gross income or an allowable deduction. • A common rule for determining closing value, if the allocation takes place over a known period of time, is proposed. How the changes will operate in relation to the depreciation rules is shown in an example. 14.1. A number of valuation rules that have a similar effect will use a common method to determine closing value. The following method could be used for determining the closing value for provisions that allocate the gross income or allowable deduction over a known period of time: x gross income (or allowable deduction) 14.2. Adopting this common valuation method allows a number of rules to be rationalised. This will lead to the removal of the current approaches to allocating gross income and allowable deductions on a prospective basis. These rules will be rewritten to provide the elements that feed into the common method for determining closing value. The rationalisation and rewriting of these rules should reduce complexity and improve consistency of approach to allocation issues. Application of the valuation method 14.3. Rationalising the many rules to which the valuation method is applicable will have major benefits.

ABC Chemical Processing Ltd bought a pump on 1 April 1997 for $50,000. Owing to the nature of its business, a special depreciation rate of 20% has been authorised under section EG 10. Therefore the pump is amortised on a straight line basis over five years. The pump is sold on 1 April 1999 for $35,000. The company has a 31 March balance date for tax purposes. The tax treatment of the asset under the new structural approach is described in 14.6-14.14. 14.5. Table 6 compares the tax treatment of this depreciable property under the current and proposed legislation. 143 Year of acquisition: deduction allowed 14.6. Part D provides that $50,000 is allowed as a deduction (step one). Year of acquisition: allocation of deduction 14.7. Part E determines when that amount is recognised in the calculation of taxable income for an income year. 14.8. An allowable deduction is allocated on the basis of a specific allocation rule if one applies. Otherwise the allocation is made on the basis of when it is incurred (the default basis). A specific allocation rule means any provision in Subparts ED, EE, EF (the depreciation provisions) or EG. 14.9. Under the proposed section EC 1(2) deductions subject to a valuation rule will be allocated in accordance with a valuation based method that compares opening and closing values of an allowable deduction listed in Subpart EE. 14.10. The valuation approach will, therefore, apply to the amount allowed as a deduction for a depreciable asset ($50,000). 14.11. Applying the rules in Subpart EF and the definition of opening and closing values of allowable deductions, the amount allocated to the 1998 income year is $10,000, being the opening value of $50,000 less a closing value of $40,000 (step two). Subsequent years: allocation of deduction 14.12. Applying the proposed valuation method for the 1999 income year gives the same result ($40,000 less $30,000). Year of disposition: allocation of deduction and gross income Sale proceeds less than allowable deduction 14.13. The amount to be allocated in the 2000 income year (the year the pump is sold) is $30,000 (step three). Therefore the opening value of the allowable deduction is allocated to the year of sale. However, under Part C the sale proceeds of $35,000 are gross income (step four). Under section EB 1 the gross income is recognised when it is derived, the year the pump is sold (step five). Sales proceeds exceed allowable deduction 14.14. If, for instance, the pump were sold to a manufacturer for $55,000, the amount of gross income would be limited to the amount allowed as a deduction under Part D ($50,000). The difference of $5,000 is non-taxable.

The relocated rules will be grouped according to two functions: rules that impute the status or action of one person to another person, and rules that deem transactions between associated persons to take place at market value. Within those two groups, rules are ordered according to whether they relate to income, deductions or timing. • It uses plain language and tabular formats. The current definitions of associated person are expressed in language which is dense and repetitive. Two proposals are presented that consolidate common elements and use plainer language and tabular formats are presented. Under the first proposal, a self-contained table enables readers to ascertain whether they are associated with other persons. Under the second proposal, the definitions continue to be expressed in narrative, but a table is included to assist interpretation. The associated person rules themselves are also expressed in tabular form. 15.1. Taxpayers may seek to avoid tax by operating through an associated person - an entity or person under the control or influence of the taxpayer. The associated person rules in the Act neutralise that practice by imputing the status or actions of the associated person to the taxpayer or by deeming transactions with associated persons to have been conducted as though the parties were at arm’s length. For example: • Certain amounts received by a taxpayer from the disposition of land are gross income if the taxpayer carried on the business of developing or subdividing land when the land was acquired. The amounts are also gross income if a person associated with the taxpayer carried on such a business, even if the taxpayer did not (section CD 1(2)(c)). • If a mining company disposes of an asset which it has acquired as a result of exploration or development expenditure, an amount equal to the consideration received is gross income. If the asset is disposed of to an associated person, the consideration is deemed to be the value of the asset at the date of disposal (section DN 1(10)). PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 148 Definition of associated person Current method 15.2. The Act contains five separate definitions of "associated person". The definitions are referred to in section OB 1 and set out in sections OD 7 and OD 8. They have built up in an ad hoc manner and each applies to a separate group of substantive provisions, as shown in table 7. 15.3. The circumstances in which two entities are associated differ from definition to definition, as shown in table 8. 15.4. The current definitions contain numerous overlaps and inconsistencies: • The boundaries between definitions are often arbitrary. For example, the section OD 7 definition treats two persons as associated if they are relatives. The section OD 8(3) definition extends application to two persons “habitually acting in concert with respect to certain matters”. The section OD 8(4) definition restricts application to a person and the person’s spouse or infant child, but then extends application to a trustee for either of those. • The same definition often applies in several unrelated areas. For example, the second section OD 8(3) definition applies in the international tax rules and in provisions addressing the valuation of bailed specified livestock. • A definition is sometimes adjusted by a substantive provision. For example, section CG 4(3) provides that for the purposes of section CG 4(2), a relative is not an associated person if the relative is a non-resident. • A substantive provision sometimes substitutes an alternative definition. For example, section CG 11(8) provides that for the purposes of section GD 13, the appropriate associated person test is the test in section OD 7 and the second section OD 8(3) test, not the first section OD 8(3) test, which would ordinarily apply. Above all, the text of the definitions is dense and repetitive. 149 TABLE 7 HOW THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS WORK Category and definition section Substantive provisions to which definition applies Category 1 OD 7 All situations not covered by the four following definitions Category 2 OD 8(1) Income from sale of shares or trust interests in controlled petroleum mining entity (CJ 6) Deductions allowed to persons associated with petroleum miners (DK 2) Deductions on dispositions of timber between associated persons (DL 1) Deductions for petroleum mining expenditure (DM 1 to DM 10) Avoidance provisions relating to petroleum mining (GC 12) Distribution of trading stock by company to shareholders and associated persons (GD 2) Category 3 OD 8(3) International tax rules Depreciation deduction on acquisition of depreciated asset from associated person Cost price option for valuing specified livestock bailed or leased between associated persons (EL 7(3)(b)) Set off of farmer forgiveness of debt against losses of associated person (EZ 9) Category 4 OD 8(3) Base value of depreciable property acquired by taxpayer (Paragraph (a) of definition of “adjusted tax value” in OB 1) Repatriations by controlled foreign companies (CG 8) Apportionment of interest costs if NZ taxpayer controlled by single non-resident (Subpart FG) Cross-border arrangements (GD 13) Liability for tax of company with insufficient assets (HK 11) Underlying foreign tax credits (Subpart LF) Category 5 OD 8(4) Gross income from land transactions (CD 1) Transfer of land under Matrimonial Property Act (FF 6) Land transfers between associated persons (GD 9) PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 150 TABLE 8 HOW PERSONS ARE ASSOCIATED Associated entitiesCategory 1 OD 7 Category 2 OD 8(1) Two companies Group of persons with: aggregate voting interests of at least 50% in each company aggregate market value interests of at least 50% in each company control of both companies by any other means Group of persons with: aggregate voting interests of at least 50% in each company aggregate market value interests of at least 50% in each company control of both companies by any other means Company and non-company Voting interest of at least 25% Market value interest of at least 25% -

There are two methods for improving the definitions: • Method 1. Express the definitions in a table, with limited subordinate text. This method substantially dispenses with narrative. Instead, readers plot their circumstances on a table and obtain a "yes" or "no" answer to the question of whether they are associated with another person in their particular circumstances. • Method 2. Continue to express the definitions in narrative, but with an accompanying interpretative table. This method is more conventional and is essentially a plain language rewrite of the current text of sections OD 7 and OD 8. The table is an aid to interpretation. 15.6. Illustrative drafts of both methods are set out on the following pages. Both methods endeavour to: • avoid repetition by consolidating common elements; • highlight the boundaries between definitions; • highlight the substantive differences between definitions; • highlight when persons are not associated. 15.7. Beyond that, each method has its own particular advantages. Submissions on which method is preferred, or on further methods, are invited. 153 DRAFT LEGISLATION AND COMMENTARY - Method 1, as a table Two persons are associated when: Category 1Category 2Category 3Category 4Category 5 Both persons are companies If a group of persons has: • aggregate voting interests of at least 50% in each company • aggregate market value interests of at least 50% in each company (if a market value circumstance exists in either company) • aggregate income interests of at least 50% in each company • control of both companies by any other means \* except if one of the companies is not resident in New Zealand X X X X X X X\* X\* X\* X\* X X X X X X X One of the persons is a company and the other person is not a company If the other person has: • voting interests of at least 25% in the company • market value interests of at least 25% in the company (if a market value circumstance exists in the company) • voting interests of at least 50% in the company • market value interests of at least 50% in the company (if a market value circumstance exists in the company) • income interests of at least 50% in the company If the company and the other person are each associated, under the relevant category, with a third person If the other person, the spouse of the other person, an infant child of the other person, or a trustee of a trust under which the other person, the spouse of the other person or an infant child of the other person has benefited or is eligible to benefit, or any two or more of those, has or have: • voting interests of at least 25% in the company • market value interests of at least 25% in the company (if a market value circumstance exists in the company) X X X X X X X X X Defined: company, group of persons, income interest, market value circumstance, market value interest, person, trust, trustee, voting interest PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 154 Commentary on method 1 15.8. The definitions are expressed in a table. For illustrative purposes the model extends only as far as association between two companies and a company and non-company. Categories of association 15.9. Five formal “categories of association” are established. The categories match the five meanings of “associated person” that are currently contained in sections OB 1, OD 7 and OD 8. 15.10. The associated person rules themselves are currently scattered throughout Parts C, D and E, but will be extracted and moved to the anti-avoidance and non-market transaction Part of the Act (see 15.17, Operative associated person rules). Each rule will be flagged with the definitional category relevant to the rule. For example: • Associated person rules currently located in section CD 1(2), relating to gross income from land transactions, will have a “Category 5” flag. • The rule currently in section DM 6, relating to dispositions of shares or trust interests in a controlled petroleum mining entity, will have a “Category 2” flag. Using the table 15.11. The table presumes users know both their own status (such as company and non-company) and the status of the other person with whom they might be associated. Users begin by locating the relevant combination heading (shaded). They then scroll down the various circumstances under which that combination of persons is associated. Finally, the “category” columns advise whether the relevant circumstances apply in the category to which the relevant operative rules apply. Supplementary narrative 15.12. A small amount of supplementary narrative will be required to address the holding of rights and interests (material currently contained in sections OD 7(2), OD 8(2) and OD 8(5)). 155 Clarifications 15.13. The following ambiguities and inconsistencies in the present definitions have been clarified: • The words “unless the context otherwise requires” currently appear at the beginning of section OD 7, but not at the beginning of section OD 8. To provide greater certainty, that qualification is now eliminated. The rules of association are simply those which appear in the table. • Three of the existing definitions refer to two companies being associated if there is “a group of persons who have control” of both companies. The other two definitions refer to the group itself having control, rather than the persons. The latter approach is the correct one and is now adopted. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 156 DRAFT LEGISLATION AND COMMENTARY - Method 2, as narrative XX X When are persons associated? General rules (1) Two persons are associated with each other when one or more of the circumstances described in this section occur at the time in question. 2 companies (2) A company is associated with another company when one group of persons has: (a) aggregate voting interests of 50% or more in each company; or (b) aggregate market value interests of 50% or more in each company if a market value circumstance exists in either company; or (c) control of both companies by any other means. Company and non-company (3) A company and a person that is not a company are associated when the person has: (a) a voting interest of 25% or more in the company; or (b) a market value interest of 25% or more in the company if a market value circumstance exists in the company. Defined: company, group of persons, market value circumstance, market value interest, person, voting interest 157 XX Y Exceptions to the rules of association in section XX X Changes for the purposes of section GX B (1) For the purposes of section GX B, the rules in section XX X are changed so that: (a) a company and a person that is not a company are associated only when the person has: (i)a voting interest of 50% or more in the company; or (ii)a market value interest of 50% or more in the company if a market value circumstance exists in the company. Changes for the purposes of section GX C (2) For the purposes of section GX C, the rules in section XX X are changed so that: (a) a company is not associated with another company when one of the companies is not resident in New Zealand; Subject to paragraph (a), a company is also associated with another company when one group of persons has an aggregate income interest of 50% or more in each company; (b) a company and a person that is not a company are associated only when: (i)the person has an income interest of 50% or more in the company; or (ii)the company and the person are each associated under this subsection with a third person. Changes for the purposes of section GX D (3) For the purposes of section GX D, the rules in section XX X are changed so that: (a)a company is also associated with another company when one group of persons has an aggregate income interest of 50% or more in each company; PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 158 (b) a company and a person that is not a company are associated only when: (i) the person has an income interest of 50% or more in the company; or (ii) the company and the person are each associated under this subsection with a third person. Changes for the purposes of section GX E (4) For the purposes of section GX E, the rules in section XX X are changed so that a company and a person that is not a company are associated only when the person, the spouse of the person, an infant child of the person, or a trustee of a trust under which the person, the spouse of the person, or an infant child of the person has benefited or is eligible to benefit, or any two or more of them: (a) have a voting interest of 25% or more in the company; or (b) have a market value interest of 25% or more in the company if a market value circumstance exists in the company. Defined: company, group of persons, income interest, market value circumstance, market value interest, New Zealand, person, trust, trustee, voting interest Commentary on method 2 15.14. The narrative part of the definitions begins by stating the general rules, material currently set out in section OD 7. For illustrative purposes the model extends only as far as association between two companies and a company and non-company. The rules currently set out in section OD 8 are then expressed as exceptions to the general rule. 15.15. Very wide-ranging exceptions which appear at the beginning of the current definitions, out of an abundance of caution, are not replicated, but will be included if such qualifications are found necessary. 159 TABLE 9 TABULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR METHOD 2 Company Person (non-company) →→ Company Group of persons with: Aggregate voting interests or aggregate market value interests of 50% or more in each company or control of both companies (GX 1, 2, 3 (except if one company is non-resident), 4 and 5) Income interest of 50% or more in each company (GX 3 (except if one company is non-resident) and 4) Voting interest or market value interest of 25% or more in company (GX 1) Voting interest or market value interest of 50% or more in company (GX 2) Income interest of 50% or more in company (GX 3 and 4) Company and person each associated with third person (GX 3 and 4) Voting interest or market value interest of 25% or more in company by person, spouse of person, infant child of person, or trustee for any 2 or more of those (GX 5) Person (non-company) ↓↓ Voting interest or market value interest of 25% or more in company (GX 1) Voting interest or market value interest of 50% or more in company (GX 2) Income interest of 50% or more in company (GX 3 and 4) Company and person each associated with third person (GX 3 and 4) Voting interest or market value interest of 25% or more in company by person, spouse of person, infant child of person, or trustee for any 2 or more of those (GX 5) Commentary on tabular arrangement for method 2 15.16. The tabular arrangement presumes readers know their own status (such as company and non-company) and enables them to ascertain all other persons with whom they are associated. PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 160 Operative associated person rules 15.17. Operative associated person rules qualify substantive rules and are scattered throughout Parts C, D and E. A clear example occurs in section CG 6, where a substantive rule, located in subsection (1), provides that a person must calculate attributed foreign income or loss if the person has an income interest of 10% or greater. Subsection (2) then contains a qualifying associated person rule which provides that the person is deemed to hold any income interest of an associate. Advantage of current method 15.18. In so far as an associated person qualification is merely part of the rules applicable to a particular area, all the rules appear together and can be read together. Section CG 6 is a good example of a substantive and associated person qualification appearing together. Disadvantages of current method 15.19. Disadvantages of the current method are that: • The qualifying rule can clutter the substantive provision and make it difficult to read. (Section CG 8, which deals with the calculation and attribution of a controlled foreign company repatriation, is a good example. Associated person qualifications are scattered throughout the section.) • The qualifying rules clutter Parts C, D and E as a whole by using repetitive language to effect the same policy in a multitude of situations. • The true anti-avoidance character of the qualifying rules is masked. Proposal for improvement 15.20. It is proposed to bring the qualifying rules in Parts C, D and E together and locate them in the Act's anti-avoidance and non-market transaction Part (currently Part G). 15.21. The rules would be grouped according to their function: • those that impute one person's action or status to another person; • those that govern transactions between associated persons. 15.22. The rules in the latter category have different functions: some deem values, some adjust deductions, and others adjust timing. 161 15.23. Advantages of the proposed method are that it: • makes the true anti-avoidance character of the rules more apparent; • clears clutter from the substantive provisions. 15.24. The illustrative draft on the following pages brings together and groups according to function a selection of qualifying rules from Parts C, D and E. A tabular format is used to better identify the groups and functions.

If a person acquires timber, or a right to take timber, from an associated person, the person is allowed a deduction for the aggregate of: • the cost of the timber to the person, and • the amount for which the associated person would have been allowed a deduction but for the limitation imposed above. 2 Disposal and acquisition of petroleum mining assets If a petroleum miner disposes of a petroleum mining asset, any deductions otherwise allowed to the petroleum miner in respect of the petroleum mining asset are limited to the gross income which the petroleum miner receives from the disposition. If a person acquires a petroleum mining asset from an associated person who is a petroleum miner, the person is allowed a deduction for the aggregate of: • the cost of the petroleum mining asset to the person, in the income year of acquisition, and • the amount for which the associated person would have been allowed a deduction but for the limitation imposed above. 2 PART THREE: THE REWRITE PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE 164 Timing Category of association Disposal and acquisition of timber If a person acquires timber, or a right to take timber, from an associated person, the deduction allowed to the person for the aggregate of: • the cost of the timber to the person, and • the amount for which the associated person would have been allowed a deduction but for the limitation imposed above, is allowed in the income year of acquisition. 2 Disposal and acquisition of petroleum mining assets If a person acquires a petroleum mining asset from an associated person who is a petroleum miner: • the deduction allowed to the person for the cost of the petroleum mining asset is allowed in the income year of acquisition. • the deduction allowed to the person for the amount for which the associated person would have been allowed a deduction but for the limitation on deduction imposed above is allowed in the income year in which the person first disposes of the asset to a person not associated with the petroleum miner or in which the person ceases to be associated with the petroleum miner. 2 Commentary on associated persons 15.25. The associated person rules, extracted from substantive provisions in Parts C, D and E, are brought together and located in the Act's anti-avoidance and non-market transaction Part. For illustrative purposes the model is limited to a selection of rules. 15.26. The relevant definitional category (see "Definition of associated person: Method (1)) is noted beside each rule. (This flagging will not be required if definitional Method (1) is not adopted.) 165 15.27. The rules are grouped according to function: • imputation of an associate's action or status to the other person; • transactions between associates: -deemed value -adjustment of deduction -adjustment of timing 15.28. The "deductions" and "timing" categories acknowledge the overall scheme of Parts C, D and E.
Simplifying taxpayer requirements A Government discussion paper on proposals for change ii First published in December 1997 by the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, New Zealand. Simplifying taxpayer requirements; a Government discussion paper on proposals for change. ISBN 0-478-10325-5 iii FOREWORD The proposals set out in this discussion paper reflect the Government’s continuing commitment to simplification of the tax system and reducing compliance costs for the taxpayers of New Zealand. If adopted, the measures proposed here would significantly reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers. They would remove many of the onerous, repetitive requirements that the current tax system places on salary and wage earners and employers. They would eliminate the need for IR 5 income tax returns, many of the Family Assistance forms and procedures that are part of the tax system, and a number of tax- related employer forms. This would have significant benefits for the 1.2 million individuals who file IR 5 returns each year. The only requirement for about 400,000 of them would be to check an Inland Revenue-generated statement compiled from information provided by employers. Employers would also benefit. The 200,000 PAYE reconciliations and 4 million tax deduction certificates they process each year would no longer be needed. Improved technology would be essential to the success of the proposals. To this end, Inland Revenue intends to provide new services such as electronic transfer of information with employers, and improve services such as telephone technology. We welcome submissions on the proposals.

This takes each of them an average of one hour. About 50 percent of them need some help to complete their form – half an hour’s worth, on average. That adds up to 1.5 million hours each year devoted to filling in the nation’s IR 5 tax returns. 1.2This discussion paper presents for public consideration a series of proposals to eliminate the IR 5 tax return. The proposals depend on information provided to Inland Revenue by third parties, such as employers and banks, and improvements in both the way it is provided and the detail. The principal benefit of the proposals is the removal of the obligation for salary and wage earners to file a tax return. 1.3Under the proposals, employers would provide Inland Revenue with a monthly schedule detailing each employee’s salary and wage income and deductions such as PAYE, student loan repayments or child support payments. Both the PAYE reconciliation obligation and the requirement to issue IR 12 and IR 13 forms would be removed. The PAYE information from employers would be used by Inland Revenue to issue an income statement if required. The income statement would replace the annual IR 5 return and certain social policy forms. 1.4The proposals represent the most significant reform of tax administration since the introduction of the PAYE system in 1958. Implementation of the proposals would also reduce the extent to which the tax system intrudes on the lives of most individual taxpayers. For this reason the Government welcomes the views of taxpayers, their advisers and other interested parties on the proposals outlined here. 1.5The Government aims to achieve significant reductions in the compliance cost burden on wage and salary taxpayers, but not at the cost of the integrity of the tax system or failure to meet its social policy objectives. SUMMARY OF KEY PROPOSALS Income statements IR 5 income tax returns would be eliminated. Inland Revenue would create income statements from the information supplied by employers and send an income statement to taxpayers who: • have a student loan repayment obligation; 2 • receive, or are entitled to receive, Family Assistance; • had PAYE or resident withholding tax (RWT) deducted at an incorrect rate. Income statements would be pre-printed with taxpayers’ wage and salary information and related details. All taxpayers would have the right to request a certificate confirming their total earnings. If taxpayers consider they have overpaid or underpaid tax, they could request an income statement for confirmation. Taxpayers with more than $200 income incorrectly taxed at source should request an income statement. Taxpayers who earn income that does not have tax deducted at source, such as business or rental income, would have to complete an individual income tax return in the same way as they do now. Inland Revenue would issue these taxpayers with a pre- printed return showing all source deductions for the year. Improvements to the PAYE system A simplified employee declaration form would replace the IR 12 and IR 13 tax deduction certificates and would be completed only when employees started work or had a change in their tax code. Easier tax codes would help taxpayers select the correct code for use during the year. The non-declaration rate for taxpayers who do not provide their tax code and/or IRD number would be increased from 33 percent to 45 percent. The tax codes for special circumstances would be removed. This would affect employees currently using the following codes: • casual agricultural worker (CAW); • election day worker (EDW); • shearer (SHR); and • shed-hand (SSH). Improvements to the RWT system Taxpayers would be able to elect a new 33 percent withholding rate if their total income is expected to exceed $38,000. Those who chose the correct tax rate would avoid end-of-year debts and the need to request an income statement. The non-declaration rate for taxpayers who do not give their bank their IRD number would increase from 33 percent to 45 percent. Overview 3 Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) certificates issued by banks would contain a statement reminding taxpayers that they need to request an income statement if insufficient tax has been deducted. A letter would also be sent in certain circumstances. Monthly schedule A new monthly schedule would: • combine all information provided by employers in one form; • remove the year-end reconciliation undertaken by employers; and • remove the obligation to provide IR12 and IR13 deduction certificates. Large employers would be required to provide information electronically, and small employers would be encouraged to do so. Employer group schemes would cease. The monthly schedules would be used to identify invalid IRD numbers and the incorrect use of tax codes. Rebate claim form Taxpayers claiming donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates would complete a new annual rebate claim form. The annual maximum rebate would not change. Family Assistance All taxpayers claiming Family Assistance would complete a registration form which would replace the current annual application. For those wishing to claim during the year, Inland Revenue would provide a suggested estimate of income on which entitlement should be based. The Family Assistance renewal date would be moved from 1 April to 1 July. Family Assistance would be calculated on the basis of information contained in the income statement. Overpayments of Family Assistance would be remitted automatically if taxpayers have used Inland Revenue’s income calculation and have advised any changes in circumstances. Overpayments of Family Assistance that do not qualify for automatic remission would be recovered from the current year’s entitlement. 4 BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS 1.6As a package, these proposals are expected to achieve further reductions in the compliance costs imposed on employees and provide administrative savings. 1.7Research shows that 25 percent of taxpayers find it difficult to complete their IR 5 return. The proposals would eliminate this tax return. 1.8Pre-coding the income statement with wage and salary information would reduce compliance costs for those who received them. 1.9The proposals would, at the same time, reduce the compliance cost burden on employers. 1.10The new rebate claim form process would allow taxpayers to receive their refunds without having to complete income tax returns. It would also allow those filing individual returns (previously IR 3) to receive refunds for rebates before the due date for the return. CONTEXT OF THE REFORMS 1.11Over the last decade there have been extensive reforms of both tax policy and tax administration in New Zealand. These reforms include broadening the tax base, the implementation of various social policy measures through the tax system, and the modernisation of the tax system through the increased use of technology and a new organisational structure for Inland Revenue. 1.12The Government has been seeking ways to minimise the compliance costs associated with paying tax. Compliance costs consist of both the monetary and non-monetary costs imposed on taxpayers when complying with their tax obligations. Compliance costs do not include tax itself. For taxpayers who earn income from salary, wages, interest and dividends, compliance costs are mainly the costs associated with completing forms and dealing with Inland Revenue. There are also minor costs associated with making the tax payment and meeting various PAYE and RWT obligations. 1.13In considering measures to reduce the compliance costs of individual taxpayers, the Government is not simply imposing the costs on others. Although the Government has attempted to look for compliance cost reductions and simplifications for all taxpayer groups, it is inevitable that any tax system will impose some compliance costs, and it therefore becomes a matter of balancing those costs. Overview 5 1.14The Government has been reviewing simplification opportunities since the publication of the discussion paper Tax Simplification Issues. The first step of this review was to establish the minimum information required for the tax system to achieve its goals in relation to IR 5 taxpayers. Information is required to: • provide accurate revenue forecasting; and • ensure the integrity of the income tax base. 1.15The next step was to establish the best source from which to obtain that information. Although in some cases this was the individual taxpayer, often it was a third party such as an employer or a bank. Finally, the review considered the best way of providing the information, placing an emphasis on methods involving low compliance and administrative costs. 1.16Research has identified those tasks that taxpayers and third parties consider repetitive and onerous. In considering new ways of providing information to Inland Revenue, an objective was to remove or reduce these tasks. BACKGROUND TO THE SIMPLIFICATION PROPOSALS 1.17In 1992 the International Monetary Fund reported that it was in favour of countries installing final withholding systems so as to reduce the number of returns to be processed. Adoption of such a system in the United States was considered feasible with improved technology. 1.18This is the second of the Government’s discussion papers on reducing the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers. The first discussion paper, Tax Simplification Issues, published in August 1996, proposed reductions in the requirement to file IR 5 returns. It proposed that employees on the top marginal tax rate not be required to file income tax returns if they chose to have interest, bonuses and secondary employment withheld at 33 percent. The paper also proposed to transfer the required income information to a new social policy return. Information technology 1.19Information technology is an essential part of business and it is becoming an essential component of the tax system. It provides a significant opportunity to reduce the compliance costs imposed by the tax system. 1.20The proposals contained in this discussion paper rely on information technology to reduce both compliance and administrative costs. In fact, some proposals, such as that to process information provided by employers monthly, would not be possible without the use of improved technology. 6 1.21The proposals incorporate simplified methods for those who use manual systems, such as smaller employers. The proposals would, however, require large employers to provide all information to Inland Revenue electronically. Supporting the transition 1.22The Government recognises that some employers could face implementation and compliance difficulties during the transitional period. Inland Revenue would support employers during this period and would adopt a flexible approach to the application of penalties where appropriate. KEY QUESTIONS 1.23Before making final decisions on whether to proceed with the various simplification proposals discussed in this paper, the Government wishes to seek the views of interested people. Key areas for comment are: • the proposed elimination of IR 5 returns; • the introduction of the income statement, the rebate claim form and the monthly schedule; • suggestions for further simplification; and • suggestions for further compliance cost reduction. 1.24These suggestions do not have to be limited to the proposals in this discussion paper but may cover any legislative or administrative issue. TIMELINE 1.25The Government recognises the substantial changes required by employers and financial institutions to give effect to the proposals and the system constraints caused by the year 2000 issue. However, the benefits to employers and taxpayers arising from the proposals would also be significant and would outweigh the transitional costs. Therefore the Government supports a general 1 April 1999 application date. 1.26The proposed timeline is as follows: ProposalProposed Implementation Date Income statement (chapter 2)1 April 2000 PAYE changes (chapter 3)1 April 1999 Resident withholding tax changes (chapter 4)1 April 1999 Monthly schedule (chapter 5)1 April 1999 Rebate claim form (chapter 6)1 April 2000 Family Assistance (chapter 7)1 July 2001 Overview 7 SUBMISSIONS 1.27The Government seeks public submissions on the proposals contained in this discussion paper. Submissions should be addressed to: Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements General Manager (Operations) Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON OR sent via e-mail to: Feedback@ird.govt.nz 1.28Submissions should be made before 27 February 1998. They should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact those making the submission to discuss their submission if required. 8 2 THE NEW INCOME STATEMENT PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a certificate confirming total earnings. • Replace the income tax return (IR 5) with an income statement issued automatically by Inland Revenue to taxpayers who meet certain criteria, or on request. • Pre-code income statements with wage and salary information and other taxpayer-specific information obtained from employers during the year. • Require taxpayers who now complete an IR 3 tax return to complete a simplified version of the tax return. The main difference between the returns would be that wage and salary information would be pre-coded on the simplified return. • Require taxpayers to advise Inland Revenue of income that has had tax incorrectly deducted at source only if it exceeds $200. • Regard the income statement as an assessment at the terminal tax due date. • Credit refunds into a bank account rather than issue them by cheque. 2.1At present, those who file IR 5 tax returns are individuals who earn income solely from salaries, wages and resident withholding income (New Zealand sourced interest and dividends). For other forms of income they must file an IR 3 return. 2.2Taxpayers must file an IR 5 return if they: • earn more than $38,000 gross income; • derive gross income as a shearer or shearing shed-hand; • are absentee but still considered resident for tax purposes; • participate in some way in one of the various social policy measures administered through the tax system (for example, the student loan scheme). 2.3Unless they meet the current non-filing criteria, they must file an IR 5 tax return by 7 June. They are required to include in that tax return their salary or wage income and interest and dividend income. The new income statement 9 2.4The main purpose of the income tax return is to confirm their income and allow any rebates to which they are entitled. The information they provide is also used to assess obligations relating to income tax, Family Assistance, child support and student loans. 2.5Once Inland Revenue processes the return, it issues a Notice of Assessment in relation to these obligations. Those who agree with their assessment either receive a refund or have to pay the amount assessed by 7 February of the following year. If the amount assessed is not paid by this date, Inland Revenue imposes a late payment penalty and use of money interest. THE INCOME STATEMENT 2.6The Government proposes to replace the IR 5 tax return with an income statement. The income statement would be prepared from the information supplied by employers and financial institutions. It would show the gross income, taxes deducted, and any refund or payment due. 2.7Inland Revenue would send an income statement to individuals if: • they have a student loan; • they receive Family Assistance or Inland Revenue believes they are entitled to receive it; • they have a special tax code or are covered by one of the special PAYE codes such as the shearing shed-hand code (if these are retained); • they used an incorrect PAYE or RWT tax code, or an incorrect rate, at any time during the year that resulted in an underpayment of tax; or • they request it. 2.8The statement would inform them of any refund or tax to pay. 2.9About 1.2 million people currently complete an IR 5 tax return. Under these proposals, the IR 5 return would be replaced by the income statement for 400,000 of these taxpayers. The remaining 800,000 taxpayers would be freed of the annual obligation to complete a tax return. 2.10Taxpayers with income over $38,000 a year would not receive an income statement unless they met one of the criteria outlined above. In other words, the return filing obligation on those taxpayers with more than $38,000 income would be removed. To gain the benefit of this measure, they would have to ensure that any extra emoluments or secondary employment had PAYE withheld at 33 percent and that RWT applied to their interest income at 33 percent. Otherwise they would receive an income statement and have to pay the tax shortfall. 10 2.11The income statement would detail an individual’s salary and wage income and the amount of PAYE deducted from that income, using information provided by employers during the year on monthly schedules (see chapter 5). Inland Revenue would calculate income-related rebates such as the low-income rebate on the basis of information it holds. Inland Revenue would also calculate whether someone was due a refund or had tax to pay. The income statement process is outlined in figure 1. 2.12Inland Revenue would issue the statements by the end of May of each year, along with a guide so taxpayers could check the calculations if they wished. 2.13With the proposed improvements to the PAYE system, and the introduction of the rebate claim form, the number of taxpayers owed a refund would decrease. 2.14The success of eliminating return filing envisaged by the proposals is largely dependent on people accepting the accuracy of the PAYE system. If they did not accept its accuracy, they could request an income statement to verify their tax position. However, if it resulted that they had tax to pay, it would have to be paid. 2.15Taxpayers who thought they might be entitled to a refund could request a certificate of earnings to determine whether this was so. (The certificate is discussed later in this chapter.) Then, after checking it, if they still believed they were due a refund they could request an income statement, and any refund would be paid into their bank account. Figure 1: The income statement process The new income statement 11 2.16Taxpayers would have to check their statement to ensure their income was complete. They would have to declare other income exceeding $200 from which tax had been incorrectly deducted but not shown on their income statement. The $200 threshold would provide the non-filing system with a degree of flexibility, reducing both compliance and administrative costs. Taxpayers would be required to return any income they earned that was not taxed at source (which would mean they would receive an individual tax return in subsequent years). 2.17Taxpayers could make amendments to an income statement up to, and including, the terminal tax due date, at which point the income statement would become an assessment. After the terminal tax due date, taxpayers who disagreed with an income statement/assessment would have to contact Inland Revenue to make any necessary amendments or file a Notice of Proposed Adjustment and start dispute proceedings, as at present. 2.18The next step for those who accepted the income statement as correct would depend on whether the statement showed: • a nil balance, in which case no further action would be required; • a refund, which would be direct-credited to their bank account; or • tax to pay as well as any liability in relation to one of the social policy measures administered through the tax system. This would be payable by the terminal tax due date. Any income tax debt under $20 would not be payable, as at present. Individual tax return 2.19Individual taxpayers who now complete an IR 3 tax return would instead be required to complete an individual tax return (a simplified version of the current IR 3 tax return). The principal difference is that the front page of the new return would be pre-coded with the taxpayer’s wage and salary information. Treatment of donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates 2.20The donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates would be claimed through the new rebate claim form. Chapter 6 outlines this new process. Treatment of expenses 2.21The IR 5 return allows taxpayers to claim various expenses such as the return preparation fee charged by tax agents or accountants or income protection insurance. Under the proposed system, taxpayers wishing to claim these expenses would need to advise Inland Revenue and their income statement would be amended accordingly. 12 Certificates of earnings 2.22Anyone would be entitled to request a certificate of earnings as a permanent record of their income for the year. A record would be available from Inland Revenue because, with the introduction of the monthly schedule, employers would no longer provide the IR 12 and IR 13 tax deduction certificates. The certificate of earnings would detail a taxpayer’s wage and salary income and PAYE deductions but, unlike income statements, would not show tax calculations. BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS 2.23The principal benefit of these proposals is the outright removal of the obligation to complete a tax return by over 1.2 million salary and wage earners. 2.24About 400,000 salary and wage earners would not have to complete a tax return but would instead receive an income statement with their wage and salary details already included. The compliance costs involved in checking an income statement would be considerably less than those incurred in completing an IR 5 tax return. Further, it is expected that most income statements would be correct, meaning only a small minority of taxpayers would be required to contact Inland Revenue with further information. 2.25Since individual tax returns would also be pre-coded with wage and salary information, taxpayers completing these returns would also have their compliance costs reduced. TIMELINE 2.26The proposals outlined in this chapter would apply from 1 April 1999. This would see the last IR 5 returns filed for the income year ending 31 March 1999. The first income statements would be issued in May 2000, with simplified IR 3 returns being received from the year 2000. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • the introduction of a certificate of earnings; • the introduction of an income statement to replace the income tax return (IR 5); • the impact on taxpayers of the introduction of a $200 threshold; • the proposal that income statements would be deemed assessments as at the terminal tax due date; and • the proposed timeline. 13 3 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE PAYE SYSTEM PROPOSED POLICY • Simplify the employee declaration form. • Introduce a new system of tax codes that are easier to understand. • Increase the non-declaration rate from 33 percent to 45 percent. • Remove the tax codes for special circumstances. 3.1The object of the PAYE system is to deduct tax on salary and wage income at source. It was introduced in 1958 and is administered by Inland Revenue and employers. Previously, taxpayers had to declare their income each year and pay their total tax liability in a lump sum. The PAYE system assists taxpayers by allowing them to pay their tax throughout the income year. 3.2Since 1958 the PAYE system has remained largely untouched, except to incorporate the collection of employee premiums on behalf of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Company (ACC), child support contributions, and student loan repayments. 3.3Employees are required to complete a tax deduction certificate (IR 12 or IR 13 form) when they start work, and if their employers do not operate a computer payroll, at the beginning of each new tax year. These certificates require employees to provide details of their name and address, IRD number and tax code. They select the tax code appropriate for their employment and circumstances. 3.4Employers use the tax code to calculate the correct PAYE deduction. If employees fail to complete the IR 12 or IR 13 form before the first pay-day, employers are required to deduct tax at the currently higher 33 percent non- declaration rate. 3.5At the end of each tax year, employers total the income received and deductions made for the year on the IR 12 or IR 13 certificate and return it to the employees. Employees attach the IR 12 or IR 13 form to their IR 5 tax return and send it to Inland Revenue, where their tax liability for that year is assessed and balanced. Not all taxpayers are required to file returns, although anyone may do so if they wish. 14 3.6A non-filing system would require a more accurate PAYE system. This is because PAYE would become more like a final tax than a withholding tax that requires checking at the end of the year. 3.7Although the PAYE system satisfies its purpose, it is not entirely accurate, resulting in individual taxpayers paying either too much or not enough tax at the end of the year. 3.8The objective is to increase the accuracy of the PAYE system, minimising the need to undertake an end-of-year “square-up”. 3.9The IR 5 tax return allows Inland Revenue to work out how much tax the individual taxpayer is liable to pay compared with the amount actually paid through the PAYE system. The difference is an amount either overpaid (which is refunded to the taxpayer) or underpaid (paid by the taxpayer). SECONDARY INCOME 3.10The Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1997, currently before Parliament, proposes that employees may elect to have a 33 percent tax rate apply to secondary employment. From 1 July 1998, the secondary employment rate will be 21 percent. This will result in an underpayment of tax by those whose income from all sources exceeds $38,000. 3.11The bill proposes a new tax code (SH) to support the new secondary employment rate. DEDUCTIONS FOR EXTRA EMOLUMENTS 3.12From 1 July 1998 extra employment income such as annual bonuses, back-pay and other lump sum payments will be taxed at 21 percent. This raises issues similar to those relating to the secondary employment rate, principally that under-deduction of PAYE for employees who earn over $38,000 will occur on all extra emoluments taxed at 21 percent. 3.13Research conducted by Inland Revenue shows that under-deduction of tax on extra emoluments paid to employees earning more than the top tax rate threshold is a significant source of tax to pay at the end of the income year. The average tax bill for taxpayers who fall into this category is $179.79. 3.14As a solution, the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1997 also proposes that employers apply a 33 percent extra emolument rate if the combined total of the annualised value of an employee’s last four weeks’ pay and the extra emoluments exceeds $38,000. Employees may also elect to use this rate. Improvements in the accuracy of the PAYE system 15 EMPLOYEE DECLARATION FORM 3.15A tax deduction certificate (IR 12 or IR 13 form), which employees fill in when they start a new job, serves two purposes: • as a signed declaration of personal details including their name and address, IRD number and tax code; and • an end of the year tax deduction certificate providing confirmation of total yearly income and deductions. 3.16Employers complete the form in duplicate: one copy is given to employees to include in their tax return, and the other copy is sent to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year with the employer’s IR 68P PAYE Reconciliation forms. 3.17It is proposed that Inland Revenue receive all income and deduction information for employees from employers by means of the monthly schedules (chapter 5). This would eliminate the need for employers to do the end-of-year reconciliation and prepare IR 12 and IR 13 forms. Inland Revenue would use this information from the employer to assess a taxpayer’s liability rather than having the taxpayer file an IR 5 return. 3.18The proposal is to introduce a simplified declaration form to replace the IR 12 and IR 13 forms. The sole purpose of this form would be for employees to make a formal declaration of their name, address, IRD number and tax code. 3.19Unlike the current IR 12 and IR 13 forms, which apply to specific years and are therefore completed annually, the simplified employee declaration form would continue to apply until changed by the employee. 3.20Since employees are rarely required to change tax codes, many would only ever complete one form, resulting in compliance cost savings for both employers and employees. When an employee’s tax code did change, the employee would simply provide the employer with a new form. NON-DECLARATION RATE OF DEDUCTION 3.21The non-declaration rate is used by employers when employees do not complete their IR 12 or IR 13 form in full. The current non-declaration rate is 33 percent and represents the top marginal tax rate for individuals. 3.22This rate prevents an under-deduction of tax when the employee’s total income exceeds the $38,000 top tax rate threshold. It encourages employees to provide their IRD number so that Inland Revenue can associate income with the correct taxpayer and ensure the correct tax rate is applied throughout the year. 16 3.23The Government considers the 33 percent non-declaration rate insufficient to achieve these objectives. The current rate of 33 percent results in insufficient deductions when taxpayers have social policy responsibilities such as student loan and child support payments, and does not provide sufficient incentive for them to comply. 3.24For these reasons it is proposed that the non-declaration rate be increased to 45 percent, to be applied when employees fail to complete the proposed declaration form in full, including the provision of their IRD number. 3.25Taxpayers could arrange to have any overpayment of tax refunded after the end of the tax year provided they eventually furnished their IRD number. If they did not provide their IRD number, Inland Revenue would not be able to credit the tax paid to their account. 3.26The Government is aware that an increased non-declaration rate might increase compliance costs for employers. The increase in costs should diminish over time, given the strong incentives on employees to provide their number promptly. 3.27This proposal would require supporting administrative measures. Inland Revenue would give priority to applications for IRD numbers. In urgent cases Inland Revenue would confirm an IRD number by telephone, which would allow an employer to apply the correct tax code until the employee received formal notification of his or her IRD number. TAX CODES FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 3.28At present, a number of special PAYE tax codes apply to specific employment types: election-day workers, casual agricultural workers, shearers and shed- hands. There are two reasons for this. 3.29The first is to ensure an accurate level of PAYE deduction for employees when the standard PAYE codes are likely to result in an over-deduction or under- deduction of tax. However, the benefit of special rates has declined in line with the reductions in income tax rates. Further, these rates have not been reviewed recently and it is likely that in many cases more PAYE is being deducted than would be under the standard PAYE rules. 3.30The second reason for these special tax codes is that the 20 percent and 25 percent rates reduce the compliance costs imposed on employers of election-day workers, casual agricultural workers, shearers and shed-hands. Otherwise, the transitional nature of these types of employment would mean relatively high compliance costs for employers. 3.31Tax deductions using standard tax codes are expected to be more accurate, reducing the need to complete an end-of-year “square-up”. This would reduce the overall administrative and compliance costs imposed by retaining these special codes. Improvements in the accuracy of the PAYE system 17 3.32On this basis the Government is considering removing all special PAYE codes. However, if a clear compliance cost benefit from a particular code is identified it would be retained. In this case the codes would be reviewed to ensure they were accurate in light of current tax reductions, and any changes would come into effect in July next year. EASIER TAX CODES 3.33Inland Revenue research indicates that about 9 percent of PAYE errors arise through the use of incorrect tax codes. This results in an average end-of-year debt of approximately $215 for employees using the wrong codes. 3.34The Government proposes to improve the tax codes to make it simpler for taxpayers to select the right code by changing to more descriptive and self- explanatory codes. The proposed codes are shown in table 1. Table 1: Proposed tax codes CodeDescriptionEquivalent old code MMain source of income. Only one job can have this code. G M SLMain source of income with a student loan. Only one job can have this code. G ED MLMain source of income if annual taxable income is less than $9,880 a year from all sources. To use this code the employee must work full-time (more than 20 hours per week). T SSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is less than $38,000. SEC SHSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is higher than $38,000. S SLSecondary source of income if taxpayer’s annual taxable income is less than $38,000 and he or she has a student loan. SEC ED SH SLSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is higher than $38,000 and he or she has student loan. STC 99Special tax code rate issued by Inland Revenue (99 indicates the special tax code rate in cents per dollar). IR 23 3.35Student loan holders would continue to select the student loan code only if their income was expected to exceed the minimum repayment threshold. 18 3.36The selection of the correct code would reduce the need for employees to have any end-of-year tax “square-up” and result in significant compliance cost and administrative savings. 3.37There would be a transitional education cost for both employers and employees. To ease the transition from the old codes to the new codes, employers would be able to make the following changes automatically: • Employees using the G tax code would now use the M tax code. • Employees using the G ED code would now use the M SL code. 3.38All employees using any of the remaining tax codes would need to confirm their tax code using the simplified employee declaration form. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 3.39At its core the PAYE system assumes an employee’s pay, for a single pay- period, can be grossed up to give an accurate representation of annual income. While this is reasonable for most employees, it can lead to errors, mainly for those who have a fluctuating source of income. 3.40From 1 April 2001 the Government will consider implementing a more accurate cumulative PAYE calculation method for employers using computer payroll systems. 3.41Under the proposal an employer would gross up an employee’s year-to-date earnings to represent a full year’s income, add any extra emoluments paid year- to-date and calculate the PAYE on that income. The annual PAYE figure would then be scaled downward to determine the total current PAYE liability. Any PAYE paid in an earlier pay-period would then reduce this amount. The amount remaining would be the amount of PAYE to be deducted in the current pay-period. 3.42The principal advantage of this measure is that it would provide an accurate and self-balancing level of PAYE deduction during the year, reducing under- deductions and over-deductions of tax. The system would also automatically take lump sum payments into account, eliminating the need for a separate extra-emolument rate of deduction, thus reducing compliance costs on employers. 3.43By increasing the accuracy of PAYE deductions this measure would increase the integrity of the tax system. There would also be a reduction in compliance and administrative costs because some taxpayers would no longer have their PAYE over-deducted and be required to get that over-deduction refunded by requesting an income statement. Improvements in the accuracy of the PAYE system 19 3.44Only employers with computerised pay systems would have to use the cumulative PAYE calculation method. Because of the time needed for the relevant systems changes, the Government would aim to introduce the method from 1 April 2001. TIMELINE 3.45The changes to the withholding rate for secondary income and extra emoluments proposed in the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1997 have an application date of 1 July 1998. 3.46The cumulative PAYE system for employers using computer payroll packages would be timed for an application date of 1 April 2001. 3.47The balance of the proposals in this chapter would have an application date of 1 April 1999. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • the introduction of a simpler employee declaration form; • an increased non-declaration rate; • the impact of the removal of tax codes for special circumstances, especially on employers; • the introduction of easier to understand tax codes; and • the proposed transitional measures for moving employees from existing tax codes to the new tax codes. 20 4 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE RWT SYSTEM PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a new 33 percent withholding rate which taxpayers will be able to select if their income is expected to exceed $38,000. • Increase the non-declaration from 33 percent to 45 percent. • Incorporate a statement in RWT certificates issued by financial institutions, informing taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue if insufficient tax has been deducted from their interest. 4.1Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) is deducted by financial institutions each time interest is credited to taxpayers’ bank accounts. The measures outlined in this chapter would help to ensure that it is deducted correctly. 4.2From 1 July 1998, RWT will be deducted from interest income for all taxpayers who do not have a certificate of exemption, at the rate of 19.5 percent (decreased from 21.5 percent) provided they have supplied their IRD number to their financial institution. If they have not supplied their IRD number, the financial institution will deduct RWT at the existing non-declaration rate of 33 percent. 4.3This means those taxpayers with income over $38,000 who receive interest will either: • have their interest under-deducted at the rate of 13.5 cents in the dollar (33 percent - 19.5 percent); or • if they have not supplied their IRD number to their bank, have their interest taxed at the non-declaration rate of 33 percent, which is the correct rate for income over $38,000. ACCURATE DEDUCTION OF RWT 4.4In a non-filing system, the RWT flat rate of 19.5 percent would result in considerable under-deduction of tax from those who should be on the 33 percent tax rate. 4.5 Improvements in the accuracy of the RWT system 21 The existing system also encourages some taxpayers not to provide their financial institution with an IRD number, so that the non-declaration rate of 33 percent is used and the correct amount of tax paid. Taxpayers do this to avoid a year-end tax bill. However, the absence of an IRD number restricts Inland Revenue’s ability to associate this income with the correct taxpayer. 4.6To encourage taxpayers to provide financial institutions with an IRD number, it is proposed: • to allow taxpayers to elect a 33 percent withholding rate if their total income exceeds $38,000; and • to increase the non-declaration rate for failure to provide an IRD number from 33 percent to 45 percent, making the non-declaration rate consistent with the PAYE rate. 4.7This proposal would require financial institutions to update their systems to provide for the following RWT deduction options: • 19.5 percent - if the IRD number has been provided; • 33 percent - if the IRD number has been provided and the taxpayer has elected the higher deduction rate (which means the taxpayer probably earns more than $38,000 taxable income); and • 45 percent - if the IRD number has not been provided. 4.8Financial institutions would not be required to verify the accuracy of the RWT rate provided. JOINT BANK ACCOUNTS 4.9Ensuring that the correct rate of tax is applied to joint accounts is difficult because the rate to be applied may differ, depending on the holders’ respective taxable income. 4.10To minimise compliance costs to financial institutions and taxpayers, joint account holders are currently required to provide the IRD number of only one of the account holders. Under the proposals, the rate applied would either be 19.5 or 33 percent, depending on the deduction rate elected by the account holder. 4.11One option would be to require each joint account holder to provide IRD numbers to their financial institutions and select the appropriate withholding rate. This was not considered a viable option because of the compliance costs it would impose on financial institutions. 22 4.12The Government proposes to continue with the single IRD number for joint accounts. Taxpayers would be required to advise Inland Revenue if the wrong amount of tax is deducted from their interest. RWT certificates issued by financial institutions would incorporate a request for taxpayers to do this. The statement would indicate when the low deduction rate of 19.5 percent had been applied. 4.13The income statement would be used to balance any overpayments or underpayments of RWT. This is explained in chapter 2. THE NEW PROCESS 4.14At the end of the income year financial institutions would issue RWT deduction certificates, as they do now. These certificates would contain details of account holders’ total gross interest and resident withholding tax deductions. Nothing would be required of taxpayers who elected the correct tax rate before the start of the tax year, since their correct amount of tax would have been withheld. 4.15Interest income would not automatically be included in income statements unless taxpayers advised Inland Revenue of that income. Some taxpayers might be unaware that RWT had been insufficiently withheld, and that they were required to advise Inland Revenue of the situation. This would happen mainly to those earning over $38,000 who were using the lower RWT withholding rate, a common problem for people with joint bank accounts. 4.16To help overcome this difficulty, Inland Revenue would write to all taxpayers earning over $38,000 and receiving over $200 in interest income, informing them of their interest and RWT deductions, as supplied to Inland Revenue by their financial institutions. If this information is correct the taxpayer need do nothing. In this case, and if RWT had been under-deducted, Inland Revenue would send the taxpayer an income statement including interest income and the tax owing. 4.17If the information is not correct - for example, if the taxpayer has a joint bank account to which his or her IRD number is not attached - the taxpayer would need to amend the letter and return it to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would update its information and then send the taxpayer an income statement including the correct interest information. 4.18Taxpayers using the higher 33 percent withholding rate but earning less than $38,000 might be entitled to a refund. In this case they would need to advise Inland Revenue of their total investment income and RWT for the year. Inland Revenue would then generate an income statement. Improvements in the accuracy of the RWT system 23 DIVIDENDS 4.19The process relating to dividends would be similar to that for interest except that the provision of two deduction rates and an increase in the non-declaration rate would not apply. This means RWT would be deducted at the single rate of 33 percent during the year. Taxpayers with a taxable income of less than $38,000 would receive a refund for any overpaid RWT through the income statement process. BENEFIT OF THE PROPOSALS 4.20The principal benefit is the accurate deduction of RWT during the year for those whose income is over $38,000 and who select the RWT rate of 33 percent. TIMELINE 4.21The proposals outlined in this chapter would have an application date of 1 April 1999. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • the proposal that taxpayers be able to elect the higher 33 percent withholding rate; • the increase in the non-declaration rate from 33 percent to 45 percent; • the compliance cost to financial institutions of updating their systems; and • the proposal to include a statement on RWT certificates. 24 5 SIMPLIFYING EMPLOYER PAYE OBLIGATIONS PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a simplified monthly schedule. • Require employers to provide information on gross wages and PAYE deductions for all employees on a monthly basis. • Eliminate IR 12 and IR 13 forms. • Eliminate the end-of-year PAYE reconciliation. 5.1Employers make deductions every pay-period, on behalf of employees, for: • PAYE; • earner premium; • student loan repayments; and • child support. 5.2Employers also record the dates employees started and stopped working for them, as well as their tax codes. They give this information to Inland Revenue once or twice a month. 5.3The IR 66N form includes details of the gross earnings and PAYE deductions accumulated for all employees for the PAYE period. Information on child support, student loan and start/finish dates is provided by the employer to Inland Revenue on separate schedules. This form, which is due by the 20th of the month following the deduction, is sent to Inland Revenue along with the payment. In the case of large employers, PAYE is due twice a month, on the 5th and 20th of the month. 5.4At the end of each tax year employers provide their employees with an IR 12 or IR 13 tax deduction certificate which shows the total income and deductions (including earner premium) for that year. A second copy of these certificates is attached to the IR 68 PAYE reconciliation form. Its purpose is to balance the PAYE remitted to Inland Revenue on the IR 66N form throughout the year. Simplifying employer PAYE obligations 25 THE NEW SCHEDULE 5.5Employers provide much of the information also supplied to Inland Revenue by taxpayers in their IR 5 tax return. The information is provided either during the year on schedules, or at the end of the year on the PAYE reconciliation form. Obtaining the same information from two sources imposes unnecessary compliance costs. 5.6The Government believes the best source of this information is the employer. Making a number of improvements to the PAYE system operated by employers would remove the need for individual employees to supply this information. These improvements would simplify the requirements, as well as reducing employers’ compliance costs. The proposed changes would also increase the level of accuracy and improve the timeliness of PAYE information. 5.7It is proposed that employers complete monthly schedules combining the start/finish dates, and student loan and child support information on one form. This schedule would replace the IR 66N or IR 66W forms. The main difference between the current system and the proposed system is that under the latter, employers would need to provide individual employees’ gross earnings for that period and deduction details on the monthly schedule. This is all information employers hold in their wage books. 5.8The aim is to reduce the overall cost of the tax system, not to simply transfer compliance costs from one group - individuals - to another group - employers. The Government is aware of the compliance cost burden currently faced by employers, especially small employers. It therefore considered an approach that would both satisfy the information needs of the Government in order to implement a non-filing system for salary and wage earners, and reduce the overall burden on employers. 5.9Recent Inland Revenue research shows employers’ main concerns relating to PAYE are: • completing multiple forms; • issuing IR 12 and 12 forms to employees; • replacing lost IR 12 and 13 forms; • completing the annual reconciliation process; and • answering questions about tax bills from employees. 5.10The proposed schedule would deal with employers’ main concerns by: • combining all the information most employers currently have to provide on multiple forms on a single page; • removing the end-of-year reconciliation process (IR 68P returns); 26 Figure 2: Example of the proposed monthly schedule Simplifying employer PAYE obligations 27 • removing the requirement for employers to provide employees with an IR 12 or IR 13 tax deduction certificates at the year’s end; and • requiring that the information be provided monthly. 5.11Because the ACC Employer Premium Statement (IR 68A) is used to calculate any yearly ACC employer premium, no changes are proposed to this form. 5.12Employers would complete the monthly schedule with all details about gross earnings, PAYE, student loans, child support and start/finish dates for each employee. Figure 2 shows what this schedule might look like. THE NEW PROCESS 5.13Figure 3 illustrates the current and proposed filing requirements for employers. Figure 3: The current and proposed system 5.14The new process would differ for employers operating a manual payroll system and employers operating a computer payroll system. Employers with manual systems filing monthly 5.15For employers using manual payroll systems, Inland Revenue would issue the schedules pre-printed with each employee’s name, their IRD numbers, their x codes and their start dates taken from information previously provided. 28 5.16Employers would then record the following information about each of their employees (if applicable): • gross earnings/withholding payments; • PAYE deductions/withholding tax; • student loan deductions; • child support deductions; • child support variation code; and • start and/or finish date(s). 5.17They would take most of this information directly from the wage records. 5.18When a new employee started work, the employer would write the employee’s name, IRD number, tax code and start date at the end of the schedule. Future schedules would have the employee’s details pre-printed on them. 5.19Once the schedule was completed, the employer would return the schedule, a payment slip, and any payment to Inland Revenue for processing. As a supporting measure, Inland Revenue would set up a new electronic payment reference system to allow employers to make payments using their bank’s telephone banking service. 5.20The process would continue each month, with the pre-printed information showing only current employees. Once the employer entered a finish date for any employee, he or she would appear on only one further schedule. This would allow the employer to check that the correct finish date had been recorded by Inland Revenue. 5.21Inland Revenue would continue to contact employers regarding any schedules that had been completed incorrectly, and schedules with major discrepancies would be returned to the employer for correction. 5.22Once Inland Revenue had processed the March schedule (the final for the tax year), it would send employers a schedule showing total gross earnings and deductions for each employee for the year. Employers would be able to use the gross earnings figure when completing their ACC Employer Premium Statement (IR 68A). 5.23The intention is this schedule should be readily available if employees wish to know their total earnings and PAYE deductions, or if employers prefer to use Inland Revenue’s records rather than their own for the purposes of calculating their ACC employer premiums. It would reduce employer compliance costs because employers would not have to determine these totals for themselves. Simplifying employer PAYE obligations 29 Employers with computer systems filing monthly 5.24Employers with a computer payroll would supply the same information to Inland Revenue as those operating a manual payroll, but they would be able to extract the information from their computer payroll system instead of having to prepare it manually. 5.25To minimise both compliance and administrative costs, employers with computer systems would be encouraged to use electronic methods for communicating with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is considering ways of doing this, which include E-file (Inland Revenue’s current electronic tax return service), magnetic tapes, Internet E-mail, and world-wide web page access. Electronic transfer would remove transcription and transposition errors, improving the overall integrity of the system as well as the speed with which Inland Revenue processes the information received. Employers with computer systems filing twice a month 5.26Although these employers would still be required to calculate and make a payment of PAYE twice a month, to avoid unnecessary compliance costs, the schedule would be required only once a month. There would be a small compliance cost reduction from this measure. 5.27The example shows how the new schedule process would work: Example Deduction periodDue date for paymentInformation required 1-15 April20 AprilPayment only 16-30 April5 MayPayment and schedule On 20 April employers would pay their total deductions for the period 1-15 April to Inland Revenue using a payment slip only. On 5 May they would pay their total deductions for the period 16-30 April to Inland Revenue. Their monthly schedule would accompany this payment and would include details for the entire month (1-30 April). 5.28The balance of the process would remain the same as described for employers with computer systems who file monthly. 5.29Although most New Zealand employers have a small number of people working for them, most employees are employed by a small number of large employers. For example, the 100 largest employers issue over 1.7 million of the 4 million IR 12 and IR 13 forms annually. To work effectively, the proposed system requires timely and accurate information, which can best be achieved through the electronic transfer of information. Therefore it is proposed that all employers with an electronic payroll who file twice a month provide the monthly schedule information electronically. 30 5.30Inland Revenue would be able to allow those filing twice a month to continue to provide information manually if the compliance costs of providing it electronically were excessive. This exemption would not be available to any such employers with more than 50 employees. 5.31The late filing penalty would be amended so that it would apply to employers who were required to provide information electronically but who provided it on paper or did not provide it at all. The penalty would reflect the importance placed on dealing with taxpayers in an electronic format. 5.32The penalty would not be imposed automatically but at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The penalty would be the greater of $250 or $1 per employee covered by the paper statement. Employers in PAYE group schemes 5.33Group schemes would no longer operate because each employer would be required to supply the monthly schedule. Transitional impact 5.34One-off compliance costs would be incurred in the transition to the new process but would be justified given the longer-term benefits to employers and employees. 5.35Employers with manual systems would be required to provide all their employee details on their first schedule because Inland Revenue would not have the up-to-date information required for pre-printing the forms. 5.36Employers with computer payrolls would have costs associated with upgrading their systems to provide an acceptable format for transmission to Inland Revenue. BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS 5.37The principal benefit for employers of the proposed system is a reduction in compliance costs. The monthly schedule would remove the end-of-year reconciliation process and the requirement for employers to complete and issue end-of-year tax deduction certificates. Research by Inland Revenue shows that many employers find these tasks time-consuming and complex. 5.38The IR 12 and IR 13 forms would no longer be required, thus removing the problems of replacing lost forms and locating employees who have left without a forwarding address. Simplifying employer PAYE obligations 31 5.39PAYE would become a monthly process, removing the need for special training of staff for the end-of-year reconciliation. Many employers also seek the help of a tax agent at the end of the year to deal with the annual activities, so professional fees associated with this would not be incurred. 5.40The benefits of this schedule combined with the proposed simplifications of the current fortnightly and monthly schedule process would outweigh the compliance costs associated with increased provision of information. It would be of substantial benefit to salary and wage earners, who would not be required to file income tax returns. 5.41Other benefits for the PAYE system would arise from the monthly provision of information: • Invalid IRD numbers would be identified early. The use of an invalid IRD number by an employee would prevent that employee’s name and number being pre-printed on subsequent schedules. To minimise the resulting compliance costs, Inland Revenue would tell employers about this problem as quickly as possible so they could follow it up with their employee and correct the number. While also reducing errors, early correction would substantially reduce abuse of the tax system. • Incorrect use of tax codes would be identified and corrected during the income year. This would prevent over-deductions or an unexpected year-end tax liability for employees. For example, if a student loan holder had income over the repayment threshold and was not using a student loan tax code, the employee would be advised by Inland Revenue to use the correct code. • More accurate deductions would also minimise the number of requests to employers for an explanation of a deduction error which resulted in an end-of-year liability. • Because Inland Revenue would be receiving each taxpayer’s individual information, transposition and mathematical errors could be identified and the employer informed accordingly. 5.42Using the information provided through the proposed new process would allow Inland Revenue to build customer profiles which would allow information to be tailored to meet individual taxpayer needs. TIMELINE 5.43The proposals outlined in this chapter would have an application date of 1 April 1999. 32 SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • the compliance cost impact of the proposed changes on employers; • the preferred method by which information could be delivered electronically to Inland Revenue; • the criteria for employers who must provide PAYE information electronically; • any other impact of the proposals which might require consideration; and • the proposed timeline. 33 6 THE NEW REBATE CLAIM FORM PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a new claim form for donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates. • Continue the existing annual maximum claim thresholds. • Limit the amount of donations and housekeeper-childcare payments that can be claimed to the amount of taxable income, up to a maximum of $1,500 for donations and $940 for the housekeeper-childcare rebates in the year before payments. • Repeal the extra pay rebate. 6.1The Government uses tax returns for several reasons. Their main use is to “square up” taxpayers’ residual tax and social policy liabilities at the end of a financial year. They also serve as a mechanism to provide rebates for people who have made donations or paid for childcare or a housekeeper. To continue to deliver these rebates under a non-filing system requires a new mechanism, a rebate claim form. 6.2These rebates are limited to the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer. This means taxpayers without any tax to pay during the year cannot benefit from the rebates they claim. DONATION REBATE 6.3The donation rebate was introduced on 1 April 1978. It provided a special exemption for charitable donations and school fees. It was initially a flat rebate of 50 percent up to a maximum amount of $175 but has become a rebate equal to 33 percent for each dollar donated to a charity up to a maximum rebate of $500. 6.4The amount of the donation must exceed $5, and the taxpayer must hold a receipt. The receipts must be attached to the taxpayer’s income tax return and the rebate is calculated on the basis of the total amount of donations made. 6.5If the total amount donated was less than $1,500, the rebate claimed is one- third of the total amount. If the total amount was more than $1,500, the rebate is $500. This is the maximum annual rebate a taxpayer can claim. 34 6.6Over 400,000 taxpayers claimed the rebate in the 1995/96 income year, with the cost to Government being approximately $68.6 million. CHILDCARE-HOUSEKEEPER REBATE 6.7This rebate was originally introduced to provide relief to widows and widowers who engaged a housekeeper to care for their child or to tend their home. A later amendment extended the exemption to apply to those who engage someone to care for their child, or to tend their home if they or their spouse are incapacitated. The rebate was also extended to allow it to be claimed for childcare costs if both parents work. 6.8This rebate is also claimed in the income tax return, but taxpayers are not required to attach the receipts to the return. 6.9If the total amount paid was less than $940, the rebate claimed is one-third of the total amount. If the total amount was more than $940, the rebate is $310. This is the maximum rebate a family can claim. 6.10Over 69,000 taxpayers claimed this rebate in the 1994/95 income year, with the total cost to the Government being approximately $17.7 million. THE NEW PROCESS 6.11To claim either a donation or housekeeper-childcare rebate, taxpayers would be required to complete a new rebate claim form. It would allow taxpayers to claim their rebates without having to complete a tax return, as they must do now. 6.12At present, 15 percent of IR 5 returns are filed simply so taxpayers can claim these rebates. This places compliance costs on taxpayers, costs which could be avoided by using a stand-alone form. 6.13The current eligibility rules, including maximum rebate entitlements, would remain unchanged. As at present, receipts would continue to be required for donations but not for the housekeeper-childcare rebate claims. 6.14Taxpayers would file a rebate claim form after the end of the income year in which they made donations or incurred housekeeper or childcare expenses. Because the rebate claim process would be separated from the current income tax returns, it is necessary to set a date by which any claim must be made. Currently, this date is effectively set by the due dates for filing the various tax returns. Given the simplicity of the new process, the Government proposes that all rebate claim forms for a year must be filed by 30 September of the following year. No claim for donations or housekeeper-childcare expenses could be made after that date. The new rebate claim form 35 6.15The present legislation limits the rebate which may be claimed to the amount of tax payable in any given year. Because taxpayers would not necessarily know their tax position without tax returns, it is proposed the new process limit the amount of gross payments upon which rebates could be claimed to taxable income. 6.16The taxable income in the year before the year of the claim would be used because the current year’s income information might not be available before the terminal tax due date. This would also apply to individual return filers who use tax agents, since they generally have an extension of time to file their returns. 6.17Once a rebate claim form had been processed, Inland Revenue would issue a confirmation of Rebate Claim Notice. This notice would detail the amount of rebate claimed and the amount deposited into the taxpayer’s bank account. 6.18Rebate claim forms would be automatically distributed to taxpayers who made a claim in the previous year. Those not receiving a claim form automatically would be able to request a blank form from Inland Revenue. 6.19The example in figure 4 shows how the proposed system would work. 6.20The new rebate claim form would be available to everyone wishing to make a claim, including those who would still be required to file individual returns. 6.21The Government accepts that under the proposed system some taxpayers might be required to complete an individual return for income tax purposes and a rebate claim form for rebate purposes. However, this approach would eliminate the need for people to make special adjustments in years they changed between receiving income statements and filing returns. It would also provide clients of tax agents with the benefit of the rebate refund before the due date for the individual return. For these reasons the Government believes most taxpayers would favour this approach. 36 Figure 4: The rebate claim process In June 2000 a taxpayer completes a rebate claim form, with donations of $600 and housekeeper-childcare costs of $1,000 for the income year ended 2000. The claim relates to payments made for donations, housekeeping and childcare during the income year 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. The entitlement would be based on taxable income for the year ended 31 March 1999. In this example, the taxpayer has claimed $200 of a $500 maximum donations claim and the maximum $310 housekeeper-childcare rebate. The annual maximum childcare rebate is $310 because the rebate allowed has been limited to this amount. Because Inland Revenue has received a claim for the 2000 income year, a blank rebate claim form will be issued automatically in the year 2001. The new rebate claim form 37 REMOVAL OF EXTRA PAY REBATE 6.22The extra pay rebate compensates taxpayers for the loss, in an annual assessment, of the rebates allowed in any extra pay-period or periods. The rebate is available to employees who received more than 52 weekly, 26 fortnightly or 13 four-weekly full and regular pays in an income year. Employers enter the number of pays employees receive during the year on their IR 12 form. The granting of the rebate is a matter for Inland Revenue’s discretion. 6.23The Government proposes removing the extra pay rebate to streamline the tax return process in readiness for the introduction of income statements. The extra pay rebate, in its current form, could not be successfully incorporated into the proposed income statement without placing high compliance costs on employers and individual taxpayers who receive an extra pay. 6.24Removal of this rebate would correct a minor administrative inconsistency because it is the only rebate subject to Inland Revenue’s discretion. It is also arguable that because employees pay tax on a cash basis, rather than an accrual basis, it would be inappropriate to make an accrual-type adjustment by means of this rebate. 6.25Inland Revenue information shows that the impact of removing the rebate would be small. A total of 6,060 taxpayers claimed this rebate in the 1994/95 income year, at a cost to the Government of $62,000. BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS 6.26The main benefit of the proposal is that the claiming of these rebates could be separated from the income statement process. This means that income statements would not have to be issued to taxpayers only because they wished to claim one of the rebates. This would bring both administrative and compliance cost benefits. Inland Revenue would not be required to process information to prepare an income statement and the taxpayer would not be required to check that information. 6.27Research by Inland Revenue shows that 15 percent of taxpayers filed a tax return mainly to claim a rebate. TIMELINE 6.28The proposals relating to the introduction of the rebate claim form would need to have application dates corresponding to the introduction of the income statement. Accordingly, this would apply from the income year beginning 1 April 1999. This would mean donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates would be claimed for the last time in the 1999 tax returns. From the year 2000 the rebate claim form would be used. 38 6.29The extra pay rebate would be repealed from 1 April 1999. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • whether the requirement that all claims for donations and childcare and housekeeper expenses made in an income year had to be claimed by the following 30 September provides sufficient time for taxpayers to finalise their claims; • the implications of the proposed removal of the extra pay rebate; and • the proposed timeline. 39 7 RECEIVING FAMILY ASSISTANCE UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a once-only registration form for all Family Assistance recipients. • Change the Family Assistance renewal date from 1 April to 1 July. • Calculate end-of-year entitlement to Family Assistance on the basis of information from the income statement for the previous year for salary and wage earners. • Automatically remit overpayments of Family Assistance if recipients have used Inland Revenue’s income calculation and advised of any changes in circumstances which affect entitlement (for income statement taxpayers only). • Recover overpayments of Family Assistance which do not qualify for automatic remission from the current year’s entitlement. 7.1The aim of the proposals for assessing and paying Family Assistance is to: • remove the need for recipients to complete annual application forms, returns and statements; and • improve the accuracy of family income estimates to avoid Family Assistance overpayments. 7.2The Government provides Family Assistance through the family support tax credit, the independent family tax credit, and the guaranteed minimum family income tax credit. Family Assistance is directed at low-income and middle- income families and provides them with additional cash support during an income year. 7.3There are two ways to claim Family Assistance from Inland Revenue, depending on how taxpayers receive their income. They can claim it: • during the income tax year, by completing an application form, FS1; or • at the end of the income tax year in a lump sum, by completing an annual tax return and end of year family support statement, FS2. 40 7.4Social welfare beneficiaries may receive Family Assistance either from the New Zealand Income Support Service, with their benefit, or from Inland Revenue. 7.5Once a taxpayer’s total family income exceeds $20,000 the full entitlement starts to abate. 7.6The process is the same regardless of the type of income tax return filed. The Family Assistance year currently runs from 1 April-31 March. 7.7Applications to receive Family Assistance during the year must be renewed annually. An FS1 form is sent to all taxpayers who have previously applied for Family Assistance during the year. This application form is issued in January of each year. Inland Revenue requires applications to be completed by 3 March, to ensure payments start from the beginning of the new tax year. The application form, end-of-year statements and returns require taxpayers to provide excessive and repetitive information. APPLICATIONS DURING THE YEAR 7.8The FS1 application form requires principal caregivers to provide information on their children, their estimated family income for the year, and other custodial information. Inland Revenue issues a certificate of entitlement and makes fortnightly payments into their bank account. During the year recipients are required to advise Inland Revenue of any changes in circumstances which affect their entitlement, by letter or completion of an amended FS1 form. 7.9At the end of the income tax year Family Assistance recipients and their partners must complete an end-of-year statement (FS2) and tax return. This is followed by a “square-up” process in which the actual annual entitlement, based on end-of-year circumstances, is calculated and the amount paid during the year subtracted. The difference is either underpaid or overpaid Family Assistance. 7.10Underpaid Family Assistance is refunded to the taxpayer, and overpaid Family Assistance is payable by the terminal tax due date. Taxpayers who cannot pay and can prove hardship may have their overpayment remitted. 7.11Those receiving Family Assistance during the year must provide the same information in their application form that is required in their end of year statement. Income information is estimated 14 months in advance of assessing actual entitlement at the end of the income year. This frequently causes inaccurate estimates of family income that lead to overpayments, which in turn discourages people from claiming future support during the year. Receiving Family Assistance under the new system 41 APPLICATIONS AT THE END OF THE YEAR 7.12Taxpayers can claim Family Assistance at the end of the income tax year by completing a tax return and a Family Assistance statement. If they claimed Family Assistance in the previous income tax year Inland Revenue will automatically send them the appropriate documentation. Actual entitlement is calculated and paid in a lump sum. 7.13Although this method of claiming provides greater certainty and is of less risk to the taxpayer, it compromises the Government’s intent, which is to provide assistance at the time of need. Even so, some recipients prefer end of year payments. Recent research identified that the most common reasons for claiming at the end of the year were: • so recipients would not have to pay money back; • because it was easier or more convenient; • because they wanted to receive it in a lump sum. 7.14Therefore, under the proposals, recipients would continue to be able to claim Family Assistance at the end of the year. THE NEW PROCESS 7.15Income details and information regarding family circumstances, such as number of children, custody and marital status, are required to determine the amount and type of Family Assistance entitlement. This information is currently collected through the annual application form, income tax returns and Family Assistance statements. 7.16Under the proposed system, the Government would use the income statement to finalise Family Assistance for the year. Inland Revenue would also use the income statement to estimate a family’s next year’s entitlement, incorporating an “uplift” to reflect general increases in wages and salaries. 7.17The Family Assistance year would remain 1 April-31 March, but the renewal date would change to 1 July. This would allow time for the previous year’s income to be finalised through the income statement process. 7.18An estimated income calculation based on actual income from the previous year would be more accurate than a straight estimate of income 14 months before the actual income is known. Allowing Inland Revenue to calculate estimated family income would lessen the compliance burden on taxpayers and employers. 7.19Taxpayers would still have the option of providing their own estimate if they thought a calculated estimate did not take into account their current circumstances. To do this they would provide payslips or statements from employers as evidence of earnings, as is done at present. 42 7.20Towards the end of June, once the income statement was finalised, Inland Revenue would still undertake the Family Assistance “square-up” process for last year. The difference is that Inland Revenue would also calculate the current year’s entitlement based on the calculation method of estimating family income. The Government welcomes suggestions on the most appropriate base for estimating current year income. 7.21Information collected from the monthly schedule during the year would be used to track a taxpayer’s income throughout the year. If Inland Revenue identified a potential underpayment or overpayment during the year it would contact the taxpayer and make a new estimate of income when appropriate. This would greatly reduce the chance of an overpayment at the end of the year. 7.22Those who would rather continue to claim their entitlement in a lump sum at the end of the year would be able to do so by using the income statement process. They could do this by indicating on the registration form that they wished to receive their Family Assistance at the end of the year. Information on family circumstances 7.23Details of family circumstances such as number of children, custody and marital status would be obtained through the completion of a registration form that would contain the same information as the current application form. Taxpayers would need to complete this form only once. 7.24Inland Revenue would hold the details from the application form and apply them each year until advised by the taxpayer of a change in circumstances. If a taxpayer ceased to be eligible and then became eligible again, the last known details would be sent to the taxpayer for confirmation. 7.25To further reduce the information Family Assistance recipients have to provide, the Government proposes to allocate an IRD number for each child who does not already have one, and for whom Family Assistance is being claimed. This process would also be applied to taxpayers registering for child support. This is possible because the allocation of an IRD number would be enough to confirm that satisfactory evidence of a child’s existence had already been received. 7.26Allocating IRD numbers to children would prevent recipients having to satisfy repeated requests for birth certificates, or other forms of identification, from different areas within Inland Revenue. It would mean that recipients would have to contact Inland Revenue only if there was a change in initial registration details or a change in circumstances. Receiving Family Assistance under the new system 43 Overpaid and underpaid Family Assistance 7.27The Government is considering automatically remitting any overpayment of Family Assistance if the recipient has used the calculated estimate of earning and advises Inland Revenue of changes in circumstances affecting his or her entitlement. This measure would be deferred one year so the revenue impact could be assessed. 7.28If the taxpayer does not inform Inland Revenue of these changes, any overpayment would be recovered from the current year’s entitlement, which would reduce the burden on low-income and middle-income taxpayers to pay lump sums with their terminal tax. Those no longer entitled to Family Assistance would still be required to repay their overpayments on their terminal tax due date. 7.29If Inland Revenue underpaid Family Assistance during the year, it would automatically refund that amount as a lump sum by direct-crediting the taxpayer’s bank account. The individual return 7.30The proposed once-only Family Assistance registration process would also apply to taxpayers who filed individual returns. Actual entitlement to Family Assistance would continue to be calculated on receipt of the return. For those wishing to claim throughout the year, the option to accept a calculated estimate of family income would also be available but would be based on the last available information. 7.31Families in which one or both partners file individual returns would not be eligible for automatic remission because Inland Revenue would not be able to monitor the accuracy of an individual return filer’s estimate. Encouraging taxpayers to claim entitlement 7.32Not all who are entitled to Family Assistance apply for it. The present tax returns and supporting guides encourage taxpayers to check if they are entitled to Family Assistance. The elimination of returns for salary and wage earners might mean it would be more difficult for taxpayers to recognise they are entitled to financial support. The Government welcomes suggestions in this regard. 7.33If the proposed system were implemented, Inland Revenue would continue to use existing advertising media, such as television, radio and targeted mail drops, to encourage those entitled to apply for Family Assistance to do so. 44 GUARANTEED MINIMUM FAMILY INCOME 7.34Information held by Inland Revenue would be used to identify taxpayers who meet new entitlement criteria such as increases in maximum income thresholds. 7.35To qualify for the guaranteed minimum family income (GMFI) individuals must be in work full-time (either 20 or 30 hours a week) and earn less than $18,320 a year. At present, 3000 people qualify for GMFI. The number of weeks they worked full time during the year is collected from the Family Assistance statement. The requirement to know the number of weeks worked full time would remain, so it is proposed to ask for this information on the income statement. 7.36Those who are entitled to GMFI and receive their Family Assistance during the year would also need to tell Inland Revenue how many weeks they expected to work full time during the following year. Inland Revenue would use the information it has on file to identify and contact taxpayers potentially entitled to GMFI to obtain the required information. BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSALS 7.37The main aim of these proposals is to minimise the amount of information taxpayers have to provide. They would no longer be required to complete annual application forms, income tax returns and Family Assistance statements. Moreover, Family Assistance would continue uninterrupted between years in which family circumstances remain largely unchanged. 7.38The new monthly schedule would allow Inland Revenue to maximise the use of third party information by helping taxpayers identify where underpayments or overpayments might occur during the year. Taxpayers would still have the right to use their own estimation of income if they believed the calculation method was not appropriate for their circumstances. If they used the estimation method to calculate family income they would no longer have to provide payslips annually and repay overpayments. 7.39The monthly schedule would allow Inland Revenue to monitor current earnings to ensure entitlement was not overstated or understated, to prevent overpayments of Family Assistance. Receiving Family Assistance under the new system 45 TIMELINE 7.40It is proposed the changes outlined in the chapter be implemented 12 months after the income statement. This lagged implementation would allow officials sufficient time to review the operation of the income statement process and provide certainty that Family Assistance payments could be paid out in an accurate and timely manner under the new process. Accordingly, the proposed implementation date for these proposals is 1 July 2001. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks public submissions on: • the introduction of a once-only registration form for all Family Assistance recipients; • changing the Family Assistance renewal date from 1 April to 1 July; • calculating end-of-year entitlement to Family Assistance on the basis of information from the income statement for the previous year for salary and wage earners; • using a calculated method to estimate family income on which entitlement for the current year should be based; • the automatic remission of overpayments of Family Assistance if recipients have used the calculation method for family income and have advised of any changes in circumstances which affect entitlement (for income statement taxpayers only); • the Government’s intention to delay the application of automatic remission of overpayments until the revenue impact is assessed; and • recovering overpayments of Family Assistance which do not qualify for automatic remission from the current year’s entitlement.

The tax credit system; taxing superannuation fund and life office savings through tax credits. A Government discussion document ISBN 0-478-10321-2 PREFACE On 3 July 1997 the Government released for public information a report prepared for it by the Working Party on the Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannuation Fund Savings - generally known as TOLIS. The Working Party had been set up to investigate means of taxing the income from these savings at rates appropriate to individual savers. In its report, TOLIS put forward three taxation options for further consideration by the Government. Of the three options, the Government favours that involving a system of tax credits. The tax rate on fund earnings would remain at a flat 33%, but savers on lower tax rates could have the difference between 33% and their normal rate credited to their own fund account. The Government wants a workable answer to the problem by the year beginning 1 April 1998 and is consulting with the public and industry on the implementation of the tax credit proposal. If it results that the tax credit system cannot be available by then, the Government will consider adopting a flat rate lower than 33% as a temporary measure until the tax credit system is available. This discussion document is our main means of consulting with the public and the industry on the tax credit proposal. The proposal it outlines inevitably has some complexities, although it may be possible to simplify it as a result of consultation. The discussion document also represents a key part of the Generic Tax Policy Process, by which major tax policy reforms are formally opened to public consultation at key points in their development. The Government welcomes submissions on the changes outlined in this discussion document. 11 CONTENTS Preface 1.Introduction1 2.The current taxation of savers5 3.How the tax credit system will work9 4.Attributing and allocating tax credits11 5.Superannuation funds and life offices13 6.Tax credits from the saver’s perspective 17 7.

Investment in wholesale superannuation funds14 5 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1This discussion document outlines proposed changes to the taxation of income from superannuation and life office savings. Under the proposal, a system of tax credits will be introduced to allow savers in these products to have their investment earnings taxed at their personal tax rates. The discussion document seeks submissions on the design of the proposal. The key questions it poses to readers are: • Are the tax law changes outlined in this document in the most workable form? • Can the proposal be modified to produce a better result? In particular, it may be possible to modify the proposal to make it simpler. The need to tax savers at the right rate 1.2The Government’s objective is to introduce measures that, as far as practicable, will allow people who save through superannuation scheme membership or life insurance policies to pay income tax on their return from savings at the correct tax rate. This is the tax rate at which they would be taxed if they earned a return on their savings directly. Existing tax rules for superannuation and life insurance products do not always do this because they levy tax at the scheme and life office level at a flat 33% rate. This does not reflect the varying effective marginal tax rates 1 actually applying to individuals. For example, most lower income savers will have an effective marginal tax rate of 21% in the 1999/2000 income year as a result of the further tax cuts legislated to come into effect on 1 July 1998. The main problem, then, is how to reduce the tax rate on savers who are not on the top tax rate of 33%. The TOLIS options 1.3A joint private and public sector working group chaired by the Retirement Commissioner, Mr Colin Blair, was set up in July 1996 to investigate this problem. As it was asked to do, the Working Group on the Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannuation Fund Savings (TOLIS) identified and developed various suitable policy options to deal with the problem. The Government released the report of the Working Group, generally known as the TOLIS report, on 3 July 1997. 1.4The TOLIS report did not recommend one course of action for the Government. Instead it identified three options for the Government's consideration. This 1 Effective marginal tax rate is the income tax rate payable on the last dollar of one’s income. The calculation of this tax rate includes the tax-like effect of income targeting of government transfers (that is, the abatement of these transfers as income rises). 6 response was anticipated at the time TOLIS was established, since there is no perfect solution to the problem. 1.5The three options identified by the TOLIS report for further consideration were: • Retention of a flat and final income tax rate levied at the scheme or life office level but at a lower rate than the existing 33% rate – referred to as the “revised-rate proxy option”. • The tax credit option, which would allow schemes and life offices to allocate taxable income to individual scheme members and policyholders so that excess tax could be refunded to the fund, for the benefit of savers on lower tax rates. • The qualifying fund option, which would allow different superannuation and life funds to operate for savers on different tax rates. 1.6Of these options, the revised-rate proxy option and the tax credit option were considered the most viable. The main advantage of the former was that it was seen as relatively simple to operate, had low compliance costs, and was comprehensive in that it could be applied to most schemes and policies. However, it had the major disadvantage of taxing most savers at the wrong rate. Low and middle income savers would be over-taxed, and high income savers would be under-taxed. A system of tax credits was seen as more complex and less comprehensive but more accurate. 1.7A key matter of concern to superannuation and life office managers was how quickly any proposal could be put into practice. In particular, they thought that it would take longer to make the tax credit system available. 1.8After considering the TOLIS report in detail, the Government concluded that the accuracy of a system of tax credits outweighed any advantages of having a revised flat tax rate. Tax credits would allow lower tax rate savers to pay tax on their returns at this lower rate. Revising the flat tax rate could not achieve this without giving a substantial tax concession to higher tax rate savers. 1.9The Government is also confident that it could make available a tax credit system for the income tax year beginning 1 April 1998. This would make it available for use when the next round of tax cuts comes into effect and by the time the Retirement Savings Scheme begins, should that be the result of the September 1997 referendum. 1.10The tax credit system will apply to defined benefit schemes but only to the extent that investment income vests in members. It will not apply to term life insurance because such policies have no surrender value. 1.11Implementing the proposal should not significantly increase the number of tax returns that have to be filed. 7 Implementing the tax credit system 1.12This discussion document describes how a tax credit system might work. Key features of proposal The tax rate on superannuation fund and life office earnings will remain at 33%, but savers on lower tax rates can get the difference between 33% and their rates by means of a new system of tax credits. Tax credits will therefore allow savers to pay tax on this investment income at their personal tax rate. Life offices and superannuation funds will decide whether they will offer tax credits to their savers, and savers can choose to receive them. Savers on tax rates of 21% or below are likely to choose to receive tax credits. When a fund decides to allocate tax credits it must attribute its tax paid proportionately across all savers. Annuity providers can also use the tax credit system. This will result in higher annuities for the same lump sum payment for savers on lower tax rates. The tax credit system will apply to Retirement Savings Scheme funds, lowering the target savings level and making it easier to reach that target level. 1.13The discussion document begins by describing how superannuation and life insurance savings are taxed under current rules, and how this creates a problem. After summarising the tax credit proposal, it outlines how the tax credit system would work from the perspective of providers, and that of savers. Finally, it considers how the tax credit system would operate under the Retirement Savings Scheme outlined in the white paper You and your retirement savings; the proposed compulsory retirement savings scheme. 1.14Throughout the text the term saver is used to mean both members of superannuation funds and policyholders in life offices. Similarly, fund can mean both a superannuation fund and a life office, unless otherwise specified. Timing of legislation 1.15The Government will consider submissions and take them into account when drafting the relevant legislation for introduction into Parliament in early 1998. Since it is proposed that the tax credit system take effect from the beginning of the income tax year starting on 1 April 1998, it would come into effect for some funds before the legislation is enacted. Although the new tax credit system would be elective and a reform that should be favourable to taxpayers, it would be useful if submissions considered any issues that could arise from retrospective legislation of this type. 8 Making submissions 1.16The Government seeks submissions on the design of this proposal. Submissions should be addressed to: Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannuation Project C/o The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Facsimile: (04) 474 7217 1.17Submissions should be made by 12 September 1997. Submissions over one page in length should contain a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. 9 2 THE CURRENT TAXATION OF SAVERS 2.1Under current tax rules, income from savings invested in superannuation and life insurance products is taxed at a flat and final rate of 33%. This tax is paid by superannuation funds and life offices on behalf of savers. Figure 1. The current system 2.2Superannuation funds and life offices pool savers' contributions and invest them. Likewise, they calculate the taxation on income arising from these investments on an aggregate basis. They do not attribute investment income, and the tax on that income, to individual savers. This is the main reason for taxing all funds at a flat and final rate. 2.3This obviously creates a problem for savers whose personal tax rates are lower than 33%. They are over-taxed because they pay more tax on their superannuation and life office income than they do on other types of income. Taxation of savers in superannuation funds and life offices 2.4Recent research suggests that 45% of savers in superannuation funds and life offices have effective marginal tax rates of less than 33% in the 1997/98 income year. It also indicates two main clusters of contributors - those whose effective marginal tax rate is 24% and those whose rate is 33%. This is shown in figure 2. 2 Purchase of Investment with Saver's Contributions 3 Income 4 Tax Paid on Income 1 Saver’s Contribution SAVER SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE OFFICE INLAND REVENUE 5 After-tax Return Paid to Saver INVESTMENT 10 Figure 2. Effective marginal tax rates faced by 25+ year-olds contributing to superannuation and/or life insurance schemes 2.5Superannuation and life insurance savers whose taxable income exceeds $34,200 face the top statutory tax rate for individuals of 33%. Those with effective marginal tax rates over 33% are savers subject to social policy measures which include the New Zealand superannuitant surcharge, student loans and family support. 2.6The next most common effective marginal tax rate in figure 2 is 24%. This represents savers whose taxable income is over $9,500 but less than $34,200. They qualify for the low income rebate on income from salary, wages or New Zealand Superannuation. The low income rebate reduces the statutory rate of 21.5% on the first $9,500 of income to an effective rate of 15%. However, the low income rebate abates on income over $9,500 and under $34,200 and increases the statutory tax rate of 21.5% to an effective marginal rate of 24%. The savers with an effective marginal tax rate of 15% are those who earn under $9,500 and qualify for the low income rebate. 2.7Those who earn less than $34,200 will not qualify for the low income rebate if they earn investment income only, unless they receive New Zealand Superannuation. They have an effective marginal tax rate of 21.5%, which is the same as the statutory tax rate. Taxation of savers in superannuation funds only 2.8Figure 3 shows that the problem of over-taxation is not quite as significant when life insurance savers are excluded from the analysis and only savers in superannuation funds are considered. Although a high proportion of superannuation savers are on an effective marginal tax rate of 33% or more, 36% are still on a tax rate of less than 33%. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 <151516-232425-323334-535455-6970+ Effective marginal tax rate 1997/98 11 Figure 3. Effective marginal tax rates faced by 25+ year-olds contributing to superannuation schemes The Government's proposal 2.9To resolve the problem of over-taxation of these savings, the Government favours a system that gives tax credits to savers on tax rates lower than 33%. Under this system, the tax rate on fund earnings will remain at 33%, but savers on lower tax rates can get the benefit of the difference between the 33% tax paid by the fund and their own tax rates. Taxation of savers from 1999/2000 2.10Tax cuts coming into effect on 1 July 1998 will reduce the lower statutory tax rate from 21.5% to 19.5%. The annual tax rates for the 1998/99 income year take into account the tax reductions and will be composite tax rates. The new tax rates become fully effective in the 1999/2000 income year. Taxpayers who do not receive social assistance such as family support will be subject to one of four effective marginal tax rates: • The 33% rate for those whose taxable income exceeds $38,000. • A 21% rate for those on incomes over $9,500 but less than $38,000 who qualify for the low income rebate. • A 19.5% rate for those on incomes less than $38,000 who do not qualify for the low income rebate. • A 15% rate for those on incomes less than $9,500 who qualify for the low income rebate. 2.11The largest group of superannuation and life insurance savers will remain on the 33% effective marginal tax rate. It is envisaged that these people will not choose to receive tax credits. Their superannuation and life insurance income will thus remain taxable at the correct 33% rate. 2.12The tax credit system will provide for a refund or a reduction in the tax of the fund for the excess tax levied at the fund and life office level. This excess is the difference between the flat 33% rate and a lower rate reflecting the likely effective marginal tax rate of savers. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 <151516-232425-323334-535455-6970+ Effective marginal tax rate 1997/98 Percentage of People 12 2.13By making this lower rate as accurate as possible, the need for savers to file tax returns and pay any deficiency of tax or receive a refund for excess tax is minimised. The rate that best meets these criteria for the 1999/2000 income year is 21%. In the 1998/99 income year the corresponding rate is 21.75%. The tax credit system and imputation 2.14The proposed tax credit system is not the same as the imputation system that applies to companies and unit trusts. Under the imputation rules, all amounts received from a company or unit trust are generally taxable dividends of the shareholder or unit holder. Tax paid at the company or unit trust level is available to offset the tax liability on the dividends. However, if the dividend represents a distribution of non-taxed income, such as some foreign earnings, the shareholder or unit holder must pay the difference in tax. Since the imputation system taxes all dividends received, this amount must be measured as accurately as possible. 2.15By contrast, the proposed tax credit system is optional and will apply only if the fund and the saver have chosen to adopt it. Only allocated income that is fully credited at the 21% rate will be brought into the individual saver's taxable income. Thus a superannuation fund that made a capital gain could continue to distribute that gain to savers tax-free under the tax credit system, something that would not happen under imputation. 2.16The tax credit system is best viewed as a system for allocating tax credits for superannuation and life office tax payments, together with corresponding income, to individual savers. The imputation system, on the other hand, is best seen as a system of taxing all company and unit trust distributions, but with imputation credits to avoid double taxation. 2.17Although there are important differences between the two systems, there are also similarities in their mechanisms. For this reason, the new tax credit rules will be based on the imputation rules when appropriate. 2.18The tax credit system is discussed in detail in the following chapters. 9 3 HOW THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM WILL WORK 3.1Under the tax credit system, the tax rate on fund earnings will remain at a flat rate of 33%. If a fund chooses to offer the tax credit system, savers can choose to have credits, known as tax credits, allocated to them for the tax paid on their behalf by their fund. Tax credits will allow investment income to be taxed at savers' personal tax rates. 3.2The tax credit system will not be available to non-residents and tax-exempt bodies. Figure 4. The proposed tax credit system Choosing the tax credit system 3.3The tax credit system will be optional for funds and savers. If a fund offers tax credits, savers in the fund can choose to have credits allocated to them. 3.4When a fund allocates tax credits to the savers who have chosen to receive them it must, at the same time, attribute tax credits proportionately across all savers, including those who have chosen not to receive tax credits. This is so the tax paid by the fund is proportionately attributed across all savers in the fund, and not just to the low income savers. (Attribution across savers is an anti-streaming measure and for the purposes of this proposal it is distinct from the allocation of tax credits to savers who choose to receive them.) 3 Income 2 Purchase of Investment with Saver's Contributions 4 Tax Paid on Income 5 Tax Refund (or tax reduction ) 1 Saver’s Contribution SAVER SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE OFFICE INLAND REVENUE 6 Tax Credits and Income Allocated to Saver INVESTMENT 14 3.5The fund may choose to allocate tax credits at any time during an income year. However, it is likely to allocate them at year end, given that it must attribute the tax credits proportionately across all savers. 3.6For savers who have chosen to receive them, tax credits will be allocated by the fund at 21% (21.75% in 1998/99) as a credit against their personal tax liability. This reduces the need for these savers to file income tax returns. 3.7It is expected that savers on a tax rate of 21% or below will choose to receive tax credits. Naturally, a saver's decision to receive tax credits will depend on his or her tax rate. In determining tax rates, social assistance based on taxable income, such as family support, needs to be considered. 3.8Under the legislation, funds will be allowed refundable tax credits (as referred to in the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994) for that part of the full 33% tax credit that is not allocated to savers (the credit multiplied by the difference between the fund tax rate of 33% and the rate at which tax credits are allocated to savers). A fund will be able to pay less provisional tax in anticipation of a refundable tax credit, effectively gaining a refund for the difference between tax payable at the fund rate and the tax that would have been paid at the saver’s personal tax rate. This refundable credit will be credited by the fund to the account of the saver who receives the tax credit. Attribution and allocation of tax credits 3.9The fund decides how many tax credits and how much income it will attribute across savers. This is similar to the decision a company makes in declaring a dividend to shareholders. However, unlike dividend income, only income with full tax credits can be attributed. Funds that choose to operate under the tax credit system will be legally required to attribute the tax they pay across all savers in the fund, in proportion to each saver's share of fund income. 3.10Funds will allocate 21% tax credits, with corresponding income, to savers who choose to receive them. Implications for savers 3.11Savers who choose to receive tax credits will be notified by their fund of any allocation of tax credits and income made to them. Savers will need to include these amounts in their tax returns if they are required to file returns. 15 4 ATTRIBUTING AND ALLOCATING TAX CREDITS 4.1Funds that choose to allocate tax credits will be legally required to attribute the tax they pay across all savers in the fund, in proportion to each saver's share of fund income, at a rate appropriate to each class of saver. The details of these rules will be determined after consultation. Consideration will also need to be given to whether it is necessary to limit the allocation of tax credits on the basis of change in surrender value. 2 4.2The simplest scenario is one in which a fund attributes tax across savers on the basis of a 33% tax rate, and then seeks a refund for its 21% savers who choose to receive tax credits. In practice, however, the operation is likely to be more complex. A fund will doubtless want to attribute the benefit of the tax credits to savers for purposes of calculating the surrender value of their policies, since surrender values are determined by the allocation of after-tax investment income to individual savers. Moreover, when calculating its tax payments, the fund is likely to take into account the fact that it will effectively pay tax at 21% on investment earnings attributed to 21% savers, and at 33% for the others. 4.3A possible process that a fund might use to attribute tax paid across savers and allocate tax credits, as in the more complex scenario described above, is set out in the appendix. This process is merely illustrative, showing how funds could achieve a proportionate attribution of tax paid. How savers get the benefit of the tax credit 4.4Only savers who choose to receive tax credits will be allocated tax credits and taxable income. Other savers in the fund will be attributed tax credits so that tax payments are proportionately spread across all savers in the fund, and not just to those who choose to receive tax credits. Savers who choose not to receive tax credits will not necessarily be notified of these amounts and cannot take them into account in their tax return. It is likely that the attribution to all 33% savers will be on a pooled basis. The tax credit account 4.5The tax credit account will record tax paid and refunds, imputation credits received, and tax credits received (as happens with wholesale superannuation funds). This account will be a memorandum account whose operation will be similar to that of an imputation credit account. The tax credit account will also record the 21% tax credits that have been allocated to savers, and the 33% tax credits attributed to savers who do not choose to receive tax credits. Funds may carry forward unused tax credits for allocation in later years. 2 Surrender value , which is a term more often used in relation to life insurance, is the amount payable to a saver on a particular day if the policy is discontinued. Surrender value will not include amounts that have not yet vested in the saver, such as employer contributions that have not yet vested. 16 4.6Funds will need to provide a reconciliation of their tax credit account to Inland Revenue each year. The reconciliation will be at 31 March, the same as for imputation credit accounts. Funds will also need to provide details of the income and tax credit allocations made in the year to 31 March 4.7It is not proposed to include shareholding continuity requirements in the tax credit legislation. This differs from the imputation system, which has continuity requirements in its rules. When tax credits and income can be allocated 4.8The fund can choose to allocate tax credits and income at any time, as long as it holds a valid election form from the relevant saver. An election will be valid until it is revoked. The fund may choose to confirm the election annually or before making an allocation . No specific rules will be included in legislation, apart from the requirement for the fund to obtain the saver's IRD number and declaration relating to allocations. As a practical matter, funds may place limits on when savers can provide and revoke an election. An election is likely to be required by the fund, for example, when it wants to rely on the election to pay its provisional tax. 4.9A fund may seek a refund or reduce its tax liability in the income year in which it allocates a tax credit. Likewise, savers who file income tax returns must include the allocations in their tax return for the year in which they receive them. This income is akin to dividend income, so is not taken into account for purposes of the low income rebate. As with imputation credits, if savers receive excess tax credits that they cannot use against any other income, they cannot have the excess tax credits refunded to them. They can carry forward the excess tax credits as a loss carry forward for offset against their future income. 17 5 SUPERANNUATION FUNDS AND LIFE OFFICES 5.1Superannuation funds and life offices both pay tax on behalf of savers, although they operate under different tax rules. 5.2The tax rules for superannuation funds are relatively straightforward, simply requiring funds to pay 33% tax on income. 5.3Life offices, on the other hand, operate under a two-tier tax system. They are taxed on the business income of the life office and on the income of the policyholders, in both cases at 33%. Tax paid on the life office business income may be used as a credit to offset tax payable on behalf of policyholders to remove double taxation. 5.4The suggested process outlined in the appendix could apply to both superannuation funds and life offices. Differences in their treatment under the tax credit system are covered in this chapter, together with life annuities and multiple tax credit accounts. Life offices and policyholder credit accounts 5.5Tax paid on the life office business income may be used as a credit to offset tax payable on behalf of policyholders to remove double taxation. This is done through a policyholder credit account. It records credits (referred to as policyholder credits) for tax paid at the life office level and passed to the policyholder level. For the purposes of the tax credit system, policyholder credits can be attributed and allocated like tax credits. A tax credit account will consequently record policyholder tax credits treated in this way. The details of these rules will be determined after consultation. Imputation credits received by life offices and superannuation funds 5.6Life offices and superannuation funds will include in their tax credit accounts the imputation credits they receive from their company or unit trust investments. This is analogous to making a tax payment. Under the tax credit system, this treatment may allow a refund to the fund of 12 cents of the 33 cent imputation credit received. Re-investment by life offices of 12% benefit 5.7An issue for life offices is the potential for double taxation when the 12% is re- invested for the saver. The Government proposes to treat the re-investment as a premium for the purposes of calculating policyholder income. This will ensure that the 12% benefit provided to the saver is not taxed again at the policyholder level. 18 Investment in wholesale superannuation funds 5.8If a retail superannuation fund were to invest in a wholesale superannuation fund the latter could provide it with tax credits of 33% rather than 21%. The retail fund would include these tax credits in its tax credit account for attribution and allocation to savers. For allocation to 21% savers Inland Revenue would refund the balance of 12 cents to the fund, which would re- invest it for the appropriate 21% savers. Figure 5. Investment in wholesale superannuation funds Life annuities under the tax credit system 5.9As well as benefiting those saving for retirement through superannuation and life insurance, the tax credit system will also benefit those in retirement receiving life annuities. A life annuity is a pension or regular lifetime payment made by a fund in exchange for an upfront lump sum payment. An annuity operates in a similar way to a normal home table mortgage. The fund or life office invests the lump sum payment it receives from the annuitant. It then makes regular payments to the annuitant. These payments are a mix of interest (investment earnings) and capital, as in a table mortgage. In the initial years, the payment will consist of a higher portion of investment earnings, and in the later years it will consist largely of capital. 5.10Under current tax rules, the investment income derived by a fund and used to pay the annuity is taxed at a 33% rate. Normally this is under the life insurance tax rules, but employer qualifying superannuation schemes can offer annuities and be taxed under the superannuation rules. 7 Tax Refund 2 Investment made with Saver's Contributions 1 Saver’s Contribution SAVER SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE OFFICE INLAND REVENUE 8 Tax Credits and Income Allocated to Saver WHOLESALE SUPER-FUND 5 Tax Credits at 33% and Income Allocated 6 Tax Payable On Income INVESTMENT 4 Income 3 Purchase Investment 19 5.11It is likely that most annuitants will receive taxable income of less than $38,000 and thus be on an effective marginal tax rate of less than 33%. Since New Zealand Superannuation qualifies for the low income rebate, and most annuitants are likely to be New Zealand superannuitants, the most common effective marginal tax rate will be 21% (using the 1999/2000 tax scale). 5.12For these reasons, the tax credit system should be allowed to apply to annuities. A difficulty is that the system for applying tax credits to savers cannot apply so easily to annuitants. By definition, annuities have no surrender value. 5.13It is proposed that funds and life offices offering annuities be able to use the tax credit option. The objective is that 33% taxpayers pay the appropriate rate on their share of annuity fund income, and 21% taxpayers do the same. As with the tax credit option, this generally involves a contribution of: • Tax paid by the annuity provider at either the 21% or 33% rate. • Tax paid by the annuitant through individual assessment if tax paid by the annuity provider is inaccurate. 5.14It is expected that annuity providers will establish a separate tax credit account for annuity business to which the tax credit system applies. Investment income will then be taxed at the 21% rate for annuitants electing into the tax credit system. Higher after-tax investment income will allow higher annuities to be paid. However, it would not be appropriate for the excess tax (the difference between tax at 33% and 21%) to be automatically re-invested in the annuity fund. That would provide a gain to the annuity provider, not the individual annuitant. Instead, this excess tax will have to be refunded to the annuitant by the annuity provider in the form of a higher annuity. The annuitant would receive a tax-free annuity (as happens now) plus a taxable amount backed by tax credits. The maximum tax credits available to each annuitant would be the tax associated with his or her proportion of investment income. This can be measured over a year as: • The decrease in actuarial reserves associated with that annuity policy. • Plus annuity payments. • Less any premium. 5.15Obviously, investment income and associated tax refunds will vary over the course of an annuity. Initially, investment income will be a large proportion of the annuity but this will fall over time. Annuity providers should be able to vary capital and income components of the annuity to maintain a constant annuity payment, as they do now. In effect, the tax credit system is merely an increase in investment income, but one that has to be passed on to annuitants. 20 Multiple tax credit accounts 5.16To allow for different types of policies, a fund may establish separate tax credit accounts for each type of policy. These separate accounts will record the tax paid in respect of the particular policies involved. An annuity fund, as mentioned above, could be one of these separate accounts. Separate accounts may also reflect different investment and tax profiles of policies. For example, a life office may operate, within the one life fund, a set of policies limited to foreign equity investment and another set of policies limited to bonds. The tax profile of the investments backing these different policies will vary, making it desirable for different levels of tax to be associated with each product type. It will be necessary to have actuaries verify these separate accounts, just as they do under the current life insurance tax rules. It is envisaged that this will reflect the accounting policies of the fund. 21 6 TAX CREDITS FROM THE SAVER'S PERSPECTIVE 6.1The tax credit system will allow savers to pay tax on their investment income at their personal tax rate. This means taking into account savers' other income, the low income rebate when applicable, and social assistance such as family support. 6.2The following examples show the effects of tax credits on savers with different incomes. They take into account the fact that both the individual tax rate scale and the low income rebate will change from 1 July 1998. The examples cover the 1999/2000 tax year. 6.3The savers in the examples have chosen to receive tax credits. They have been advised by their fund that $1500 in income, including $315 in tax credits, has been allocated to them for the income year ended 31 March 2000. Saver whose income is under $9,500 6.4Saver A has employment income of $6,000. She has attributable income from her superannuation fund of $1,500, which includes tax credits of $315. How the tax she has to pay is calculated and how she meets the payment - through a combination of tax credits and PAYE deductions - are shown below. Saver A: income under $9,500 1999/2000 Taxable income$7,500.00 Calculating tax to pay: Tax payable on income (at applicable statutory rate, 19.5%)$1462.50 Less low income rebate($270.00) Tax payable$1,192.50 Payment of tax: Deduct tax credit($315.00) PAYE deductions($900.00) Tax to pay (refund)($22.50) 22 Saver A will be entitled to a refund of $22.50. This happens because the tax credit is 21% of $1,500, whereas the marginal tax rate on this income is only 19.5% because it does not qualify for the low income rebate. Saver whose income is over $9,500 but under $34,200 6.5Saver B’s employment income is $18,000. His superannuation fund attributes income of $1500 to him, a sum that includes tax credits of $315. How the tax he must pay is calculated and how he pays the tax – through a combination of tax credits and PAYE deductions – are shown below. Saver B: $9,500 - $34,200 1999/2000 Taxable income$19,500.00 Calculating tax to pay: Tax payable on income (at applicable statutory rate, 19.5%)$3,802.50 Less low income rebate($277.50) Tax payable$3,525.00 Payment of tax: Deduct tax credit($315.00) PAYE deductions($3,210.00) Tax to pay$0.00 He will have no extra tax to pay because his effective marginal tax rate and the tax credit rate are both 21%. 23 Saver whose income is over $34,200 but under $38,000 6.6Saver C has employment income of $36,000. He has attributed income of $1,500 from his superannuation fund, which includes tax credits of $315. How the tax he has to pay is calculated and how he meets that payment - through a combination of tax credits and PAYE deductions - are shown below. Saver C: $34,200 - $38,000 1999/2000 Taxable income$37,500.00 Calculating tax to pay: Tax payable on income (at applicable statutory rate, 19.5%)$7,312.50 Less low income rebate$7.50 Tax payable Payment of tax: $7,305.00 Deduct tax credit($315.00) PAYE deductions($6,990.00) Tax to pay$0.00 He will have no extra tax to pay because his effective marginal tax rate will also be 21%. Saver whose income is over $38,000 6.7Saver D's employment income is $50,000 a year. She has attributed income of $1,500 from her superannuation fund, which includes tax credits of $315. How the tax she has to pay is calculated and how she pays it - through a combination of tax credits and PAYE deductions - are shown below. 24 Saver D: income over $38,000 1999/2000 Taxable income$51,500.00 Calculating tax to pay: Tax payable on income (at applicable statutory) (rates, 19.5% and 33%) $11,865.00 (33%) Tax payable$11,865.00 Payment of tax: Deduct tax credit($315.00) PAYE deductions($11,370.00) Tax to pay$180.00 She will have to pay extra tax because her marginal tax rate is 33%, whereas the tax credit rate is 21%. Had she not elected to receive tax credits, her taxable income would have consisted only of employment income. Social assistance 6.8Some Government social assistance is based on the level of the recipient's taxable income. Social assistance includes family support, student loans, student allowances and child support. Savers who receive this sort of social assistance will need to be aware that if they receive tax credits they will increase their taxable income. Consequently, these savers may be advised not to choose to receive tax credits. 6.9Take the example of a saver who receives family support. She has one dependent child and her income is over $20,000 a year. Consequently, the income allocated to her so she can receive a tax credit will also reduce her family support. If she chooses not to receive tax credits, there will be no effect on her family support. 6.10The reason for this is that family support is targeted to low-income earners and begins to abate when a recipient's income is over $20,000. 25 7 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND THE RSS 7.1The tax credit system described in the preceding chapters would operate in the same manner under the Retirement Savings Scheme (RSS). 7.2The detailed design of the RSS proposal was announced on 7 July 1997 through the release of the white paper You and your retirement savings; the proposed compulsory Retirement Savings Scheme. 7.3The white paper stated that RSS fund earnings would be subject to the same tax treatment as existing superannuation funds. The white paper noted that such earnings are now taxed at a flat and final rate of 33 cents in the dollar, but that future decisions by the Government on the tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance would be incorporated into the RSS regime. How the RSS would operate 7.4Under the RSS, people who earned over $5,000 a year would pay a percentage of their earnings into a private sector retirement fund of their choice. RSS contributions would start at 3% of earnings in 1998/99. In subsequent years, contribution rates would increase, as long as it was possible to make fiscally sustainable tax cuts that broadly matched the overall increase in contributions. The intention would be to increase contributions to 8% of earnings as soon as possible, and within five years if fiscally sustainable. How the tax credit system would operate under the RSS 7.5The tax credit system described in this discussion document would not directly affect the required RSS contribution rate or the basis for determining required RSS contributions. 7.6Nevertheless, it would enable savers to pay the correct level of tax on the investment earnings of an RSS fund in the same way that they could pay the correct rate of tax on any other superannuation scheme or life office earnings. Advantages of the tax credit system under RSS 7.7The main advantages of taxing superannuation and life insurance income through tax credits under the RSS are: • Income attributed under the tax credit system by RSS funds would not be included in income subject to required RSS contributions. • The RSS target savings level would be lower by about $9,000. • More people would reach the target savings level, and faster, because the returns on RSS savings of lower income earners would be taxed at a lower rate. 26 The tax credit system and RSS contributions 7.8Under the tax credit system, tax refunds would be returned to the RSS fund, not the contributor, and re-invested. Just as the fund's investment earnings would not be counted as a required RSS contribution, so reduced tax on those earnings re-invested in the fund should not be counted as a required RSS contribution. The reduced tax on the fund would simply represent higher after-tax earnings of the fund. This means that a saver’s attributed income from RSS savings would not be included in the income on which the RSS contribution requirement would be based. Nor would the attributed income, re-invested in the scheme, be counted as an RSS contribution. 7.9On the other hand, attributed income from a non-RSS superannuation scheme or life policy would be counted as income subject to the RSS contribution requirement. The income from a non-RSS fund would be investment income similar to that from a bank account, unit trust or company under normal RSS rules. Interest and dividend income would be subject to the RSS contribution requirement from 1 April 1999. Attributed income from a non-RSS fund would be treated under the same RSS rules as normal interest or dividend income. Reaching the target savings level faster 7.10If savers who chose to receive tax credits had a tax rate lower than 33%, the excess tax would be refunded to the RSS fund and re-invested in that fund. As a result, the fund would build up to the target level, stated in the white paper to be not more than $120,000, faster than it would otherwise. 7.11Indeed, the tax credit system would work better for RSS funds than for many existing superannuation schemes and life office policies. This is because, under the RSS, 90% of fund earnings would have to be attributable to individuals within two years of being derived by the scheme. This means that most RSS income could be attributed to individual scheme members within a short period of time. A lower savings target level 7.12The RSS target level would be lower under the proposed tax credit system. The target level in the white paper was based on existing law, under which annuity providers are taxed at a flat 33% rate on their income. Under the proposed tax credit system, the tax rate on annuity providers would generally fall to 21% in 1999/2000. With a lower tax rate, a lower lump sum could provide the RSS guaranteed annuity level of 33% of the average ordinary time wage (after tax) for an individual and 66% for a married couple. It is estimated that the target savings level under RSS would reduce under the tax credit proposal by about $9,000. 27 The surrender value of an RSS fund 7.13Under the RSS rules, RSS savings could be withdrawn from a registered fund only in limited circumstances, to buy an annuity or to transfer to another RSS fund. For the purposes of the tax credit proposal, the surrender value of an RSS fund would be the amount that could be transferred to another RSS fund. RSS annuities and the tax credit system 7.14Under the tax credit proposal, a recipient of an RSS annuity would be treated the same way as a recipient of any other annuity. If he or she chose to receive tax credits, the annuity provider would be taxed at the 21% rate. The difference between tax at 33% and 21% would be refunded by the annuity provider directly to the annuitant. This would increase the annuity payment, thus reducing the target savings level under the RSS. 7.15Annuitants on a 33% tax rate could still choose to enter the tax credit system. They would then, in effect, be treating investment income on the annuity as their first dollars of taxable income. Provided they paid tax on the remainder of their investment income up to $38,000 at the 19.5% tax rate, with income over that being taxed at the 33% rate, they would have no further tax to pay. Of course, they might choose not to receive tax credits and therefore to pay tax at 33% on their RSS investment annuity income, with a corresponding lower tax on their other investment income. 7.16In none of these cases would people be disadvantaged relative to the current New Zealand Superannuation scheme. The current scheme sets the minimum after-tax superannuation payment for a married couple at 65% of the after-tax average ordinary time wage. The 65% would, in effect, be increased to 66% under the RSS. 28 APPENDIX POSSIBLE PROCESS FOR ATTRIBUTION AND ALLOCATION The process described here should serve to confirm that tax credits have been attributed proportionately to fund income. The process has three main parts: • Calculation of an individual saver's share of fund income (referred to as tax credit value). • Attribution of tax paid (tax credits) across all savers. • Allocation of tax credits to 21% savers. A.Saver’s share of fund income (1) Determine tax credit value for each saver Tax credit value approximates the after-tax income of the saver. This value needs to be calculated to determine the individual saver’s share of the fund’s income. This is also the maximum amount of a fund’s investment income that could be attributed to each saver under this proposal. The TOLIS report suggested that what is referred to in this document as tax credit value was the annual change in surrender value less contributions plus claims or withdrawals for that year. This is the basic formula: Closing surrender value (at time of allocation or end of year) - Opening surrender value (later of opening surrender value at the beginning of the year or closing surrender value at time of last allocation) - Contributions made in that period + Claims paid in that period =Tax credit value However, the calculation above does not take into account tax credit values from previous periods that have not carried tax credits. This could create technical difficulties. For example, the surrender value of a policy could increase as a result of investment earnings that do not give rise to a tax liability until a later year. In that later year there may be no rise in surrender value and thus no attributed income to match the tax payable. Similarly, losses in one year would not be able to offset gains in a subsequent year. Therefore a fund could choose to determine and record tax credit values that do not carry tax credits. It would then carry forward these amounts, which could be positive or negative. If it wishes to do this a fund could use a more complex formula for calculating tax credit value, as follows: Closing surrender value (at time of allocation or end of year) - Opening surrender value (later of opening surrender value at the beginning of the year or closing surrender value at time of last allocation) - Contributions made in that period + Claims paid in that period +/- Unallocated tax credit value brought forward =Tax credit value 29 If a fund is unable to calculate the carry forward amount or considers the compliance costs of determining and recording these amounts too onerous it can choose to use the basic formula. If the fund chooses to use the more complex formula it must use it consistently. In the first year of offering the tax credit system, the opening surrender value will be as at the beginning of that income year. The tax credit system will be available for funds to offer from the income year beginning 1 April 1998. If savers choose to receive tax credits in subsequent years their opening surrender value will be as at the beginning of the income year they choose to receive tax credits. The opening surrender value will be re-set if a saver goes in and out of the system. In practice, a fund will usually need to attribute tax credits before calculating the tax credit value. That is because surrender values are determined by the allocation of after-tax investment income to individual savers. The fund will need to know, therefore, what tax is to be attributed to individuals in order to calculate changes in surrender value. One way to achieve this is for the fund, when determining surrender values, to allocate pre-tax earnings to individual savers, then deduct tax at 21% for savers choosing to receive the tax credits and 33% for other savers. A simple example of the calculation of a saver’s tax credit value for two years follows. An individual saver’s surrender value in a life policy at 1 April 1998 is $5,000. The saver chooses to receive tax credits. The fund decides to allocate tax credits at the end of its income year, 31 March 1999. The saver’s surrender value at 31 March 1999 is $6,500. The saver has made contributions during the year of $500. She has made no claim under her policy in the income year. Since this is the first year that the fund has offered the tax credit system there is no unallocated tax credit value to carry forward. Therefore the tax credit value is $1,000, calculated as follows: Closing surrender value at the time of allocation$6,500 - Opening surrender value (as at the beginning of the year when tax credit system is first offered)$5,000 - Contributions $500 = Tax credit value$1,000 Instead of attributing $1,000 of income, the fund, in fact, decides to attribute $800 of income plus tax credits at 31 March 1999. This will leave $200 of unallocated tax credit value to carry forward. The fund then decides to allocate further tax credits at 31 December 1999. The saver’s surrender value at 31 December 1999 is $7,300. She has made contributions of $500 during the period. She has made no claim under her policy for that period. Therefore the tax credit value is $500, calculated as follows: 30 Unallocated tax credit value carried forward$200 +Closing surrender value at the time of the allocation$7,300 - Opening surrender value$6,500 - Contributions$500 =Tax credit value$500 B.Attribution of tax credits across all savers (2) Calculate total tax credit values for savers who choose to receive tax credits and those who do not Since it is assumed that the fund will pay tax through the year on the basis that it will get a tax reduction for those electing to pay tax at 21%, the fund must calculate how much income and tax are attributable to 33% and 21% savers respectively. It does this first by calculating the post-tax income (represented by the total tax credit values) for savers who choose to receive tax credits. This total is referred to as the 21% savers tax credit value pool. It also calculates total tax credit values for savers who choose not to receive tax credits. This total is referred to as the 33% savers tax credit value pool. For the purposes of our example, in the 1999/2000 income year the 21% savers tax credit value pool is $158,000. This would include our individual savers tax credit value from the example in (1) above, $500. The 33% savers tax credit value pool is $134,000. (3) Calculate pre-tax income attributable to both pools based on tax credit value In (2), above, post-tax income attributable to the two groups of savers is calculated. In (3) these amounts are grossed up to pre-tax figures. For the sake of simplicity, this example assumes full tax has been paid on the income. Amounts not covered by tax credits should be removed from the tax credit value before the following formula is applied. After this calculation, amounts not covered by tax credits should be included in the remainder of the calculations in this process. For the 21% savers tax credit value pool this pre tax amount would be calculated as follows: 21% savers tax credit value pool 0.79(=1-tax rate of 21%) $158,000 = $200,000 0.79 31 This amount is referred to as the 21% savers’ taxable income based on the tax credit value pool. For the 33% savers tax credit value pool this would be calculated as follows: 33% savers tax credit value pool 0.67(=1-tax rate of 33%) $134,000 =$200,000 0.67 This amount is referred to as the 33% savers’ taxable income based on the tax credit value pool. (4) Calculate total taxable income for both pools based on tax credit value This is simply the total fund pre-tax income using the previous calculations. $200,000 + $200,000 = $400,000 It is referred to as total taxable income based on the tax credit value pools. (5)Calculate actual taxable income attributable to each pool By dividing each pool’s taxable income based on the tax credit value pool (3) by total taxable income based on the tax credit value pools (4) the proportion of taxable income attributed to both pools is calculated. Multiply this by the actual taxable income of the fund (which excludes untaxed fund income such as capital gains). This apportions actual taxable income fairly across both pools. 21% savers’ taxable income based on the tax credit value pool x actual taxable income Total taxable income based on the tax credit value pool income For the purposes of this example actual taxable income for the 1999/2000 income year is $400,000. $200,000 x $400,000 = $200,000 $400,000 33% savers’ taxable income based on the tax credit value pool x actual taxable income Total taxable income based on the tax credit value pool income $200,000 x $400,000 = $200,000 $400,000 32 In this case no untaxed fund income is reflected in the savers’ surrender values and thus in their tax credit values. If there were such untaxed income but the fund wanted to ensure tax credit values were fully attributed, the fund could calculate the above with an increased actual taxable income amount. (6)Calculate tax on each pool’s taxable income This is simply the actual taxable income for each pool (5) multiplied by the appropriate tax rate. $200,000 x 0.21 = $42,000 (for the 21% pool) $200,000 x 0.33 = $66,000 (for the 33% pool) TOTAL$108,000 (for both pools) These figures are referred to as the tax liability of each pool. The total is the amount the fund should pay in tax. This is not necessarily the actual tax paid by the fund. (7)Determine tax paid by each of the pools The next step is to reconcile tax liabilities (6) with actual tax paid by the fund since only actual tax paid can give rise to credits. This is done by apportioning actual tax paid to each pool based upon its tax liability (6). For the purposes of this example, the actual tax paid by the fund is $108,000. 21% savers’ tax liability x actual tax paid Total savers’ tax liability $42,000 x $108,000 = $42,000 $108,000 This amount is referred to as the 21% savers’ tax paid. 33% savers’ tax liability x actual tax paid Total savers' tax liability $66,000 x $108,000 = $66,000 $108,000 This amount is referred to as the 33% savers’ tax paid. The tax credits available for attribution across all savers equal the tax payments made by the fund. Tax credits can be attributed to savers before making the tax payment. However, the fund will be required to reconcile the tax credits attributed and the tax paid annually, as for imputation credits. Tax payments will not include foreign tax credits, penalties or use of money interest. Tax payments from the beginning of the income year in which the fund offers the tax credit system can be included. 33 C.Allocation of tax credits to 21% savers (8)Determine amount of tax paid at the 21% rate for each of the 21% savers The 21% savers’ tax paid must now be allocated to each 21% saver. This is done on the basis of the proportion of tax credit value each saver has, compared with the 21% savers tax credit value pool. The amount of tax paid at 21% by a 21% saver with a $500 tax credit value, as in the example in (1), above, is calculated as follows: Individual saver's tax credit value x 21% savers’ tax paid 21% savers tax credit value pool $500 x $42,000 = $132.91 $158,000 This is the maximum tax credit that can be allocated to the 21% saver if there is sufficient tax credit value with which to allocate it. (9)Determine the maximum income that can be allocated to the 21% saver based on the maximum tax credit All income allocated to individual savers must be credited at the maximum rate of 21%. The maximum credited amount is calculated as follows: Tax credit = maximum allocated income 0.21 (tax rate of 21%) This is similar to the maximum imputation credit formula of: Imputation credit = maximum imputed dividend distributed 0.33 $132.91 = $632.91 0.21 This is the saver’s maximum tax credit income based on 21% tax credits. 34 (10) Compare saver's maximum tax credit income with individual savers’ grossed up tax credit value The saver’s maximum tax credit income is $632.91. His grossed up tax credit value is $632.91. Given that the saver’s maximum tax credit income is not greater than his grossed up tax credit value, his maximum tax credit value can be allocated as income with tax credits. The 21% tax credit included in this amount is $132.91. (11)Determine the amount of tax credits to be allocated The amount of 21% tax credits allocated with tax credit values must be in proportion to the tax credits attributed to the 33% savers. (12)Determine the income and tax credits to be attributed to the 33% savers Based on the 33% savers’ tax paid being the maximum tax credit attributable to 33% savers, the maximum income that could be attributed is calculated as follows: 33% saver's tax paid 0.33 (tax rate of 33%) $66,000 =$200,000 0.33 Compare this amount to the 33% savers’ grossed up tax credit value pool, which is $200,000. Given that the maximum tax credit income is not greater than the 33% savers’ grossed up tax credit value pool, the maximum tax credit value for the pool can be attributed to the 33% savers. The tax credits attributed to the 33% savers would be $66,000. The tax credits will be attributed to the 33% savers on the same basis as the allocation in (11), above, that is, in the same proportions. Saver’s benefit Using the example above, taxable income of $632.91 will be allocated to the 21% saver. This amount includes $132.91 of tax credits (9). The benefit of the tax reduction or refund to the fund, re-invested for the saver, is $75.95 (0.12 x $632.91). This is the difference between tax at 33% and 21%.

The aim of the amendments is to resolve problems, anomalies and inadequacies in the accrual rules that have been identified over recent years. The basic policy objectives underlying the rules will not change. The objectives are sound and essential to the protection of the tax base. Most of the amendments in this bill are aimed at simplification and clarification of the law. They should improve the administration and application of the accrual rules and make the rules more workable. The main proposals in this category are to: • expand the list of transactions not subject to the accrual rules; • remove the legislative distinction between different parties to a transaction to simplify the calculation of income and expenditure; and • limit the definition of “finance leases” and bring them within the accrual rules. Application date The amended accrual rules apply only to financial arrangements entered into on or after the date of enactment. The accrual rules will be set out in two divisions. The current accrual rules will apply to financial arrangements entered into before enactment of the amendments. These rules will be contained in Division 1, that is, sections EH A1 to EH 15. Definitions unique to the operation of the current accrual rules, such as “core acquisition price”, “holder”, and “issuer”, will be moved to section EH 11. The rules will be set out in the new drafting style being used to rewrite the Income Tax Act. Division 2 will be inserted after section EH 15 and will contain the amended accrual rules. These rules will generally apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after the date of enactment. Taxpayers will have the option of moving all financial arrangements onto the new rules if they perform a transitional calculation under section EH 14. However, if the arrangement is not subject to the accrual rules in Division 2, because, for example, it is a small variable principal debt instrument, the transitional calculation will require the taxpayer to treat the arrangement as transferred at market value. The taxpayer must therefore do a base price adjustment. 4 Although most of these new rules apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after the date of enactment, there are several exceptions to the general application date. The following additions to the list of excepted financial arrangements will apply from 1986, when the accrual rules came into effect, unless a taxpayer has taken a contrary position in tax returns already filed: • cash basis persons providing on demand loans without interest, discount or premium; • employment contracts; • interests in group investment funds; • interests in joint ventures; • interests in partnerships; • travellers cheques; and • warranties over goods or services. These additions to the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” clarify the original intent of the rules and bring the law into line with existing practice of taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Other exceptions to the general application date relate to transfers of debts at a substantial discount to an associate of the debtor, and the disclosure requirements. These amendments will apply from the date of enactment, regardless of when taxpayers entered into the financial arrangements. Key features Policy features • The definition of “financial arrangement” governs the type of arrangements that are within the accrual rules. This definition will be clarified and the definition of “excepted financial arrangement”, which excludes certain transactions from the rules, will be expanded. • The accrual rules currently distinguish between holders (usually lenders) and issuers (usually borrowers). This distinction will be removed, to simplify the calculation of income and expenditure. • The allowable deduction available under the base price adjustment to holders of financial arrangements will be removed. • The cash basis concession will be extended to all parties to financial arrangements, and the thresholds under which the cash basis rules apply will be raised to $1,000,000. • The treatment of assignments of income and defeasances of debt will be clarified. • The debt remission rules will remain in place, and opportunities to avoid the rules will be closed down. 5 • Leases with financing characteristics will be brought within the rules. • A transfer of a financial arrangement, necessitating a base price adjustment, will be deemed to occur on the death of a party to a financial arrangement and on the distribution of the arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. • The disclosure requirements will be repealed. • When they leave New Zealand, temporary residents who are cash basis persons will no longer be required to do a base price adjustment for any financial arrangement they held when they became resident, and continue to hold when they become non-resident. Rewriting the accrual rules As well as implementing policy changes, the accrual rules in Division 2 will be rewritten in plain language. The new drafting style minimises complexity, repetition and the use of redundant words. Wherever possible, the bill uses words that are commonly used. To assist readers, descriptive subsection headings will be included and a list of terms defined in section OB 1 will be included at the end of each section. Flowcharts and readers’ notes will also be included in the legislation, although they are interpretational aids only. Amounts arising under the accrual rules will be treated as income derived or expenditure incurred. The term “income derived” is used in the accrual rules to refer to income arising from applying the spreading methods (including by way of a transitional adjustment calculation under section EH 14 or section EH 41), the cash basis adjustment or the base price adjustment. An additional provision will be added to section CE 1 to treat the “income derived” under the accrual rules as gross income for the purpose of the core provisions. Background The accrual rules were introduced in 1986. The main purpose of the rules is to standardise the timing of recognition of income and expenditure associated with financial arrangements. This provides a better measure of income, reducing economic distortions and opportunities for tax avoidance. Before the introduction of the accrual rules, expenditure from debts could be deducted well in advance of the period in which income from the same transaction was recognised. This was a major threat to the tax base. The rules that were introduced were consistent with accrual methods used in financial markets and, where appropriate, reflected accounting treatment. In the early 1990s, the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) made many suggestions to improve the operation of the accrual rules. This bill contains several amendments arising from the proposals of that committee. 6 The Government’s initial proposals for change were set out in the discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, released in December 1997. The discussion document generally focused on simplification of the accrual rules. That approach recognised that although the policy objectives underlying the rules are sound, the rules are complex and in some cases difficult to apply. Main changes from the proposals in the discussion document The final proposals contained in this bill reflect feedback from the tax community on the discussion document. The main changes from the proposals set out in the discussion document are: • withdrawal of the proposal to clarify that gross income or expenditure will be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement only to the extent the income or expenditure could be expected to arise without the support of the wider financial arrangement; • extensions of the option to treat excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements to facilitate varying business practices; • increases in the thresholds originally proposed; • adopting the definition of “legal defeasance” in Financial Reporting Standard 26 for tax purposes; • removal of the proposal to treat amounts remitted on the winding up of an insolvent company as having been remitted immediately before the winding up; and • withdrawal of the proposal to extend the definition of “finance lease” to real property. Section DJ 1(c) provides that no deduction is allowed for any expenditure or loss recoverable under any insurance or right of indemnity. The discussion document proposed that deductions for “in-substance” defeasances that may be characterised as an indemnity should not be restricted by section DJ 1(c). However, as a drafting matter it appears difficult to characterise the difference between indemnity, in- substance defeasance and financial arrangements. The proposal has therefore been withdrawn. Work is continuing in a number of areas, including the appropriate treatment of security arrangements, extending the availability of the market valuation method as a method of accrual, and the integration of accrual determinations and binding rulings. These issues will be consulted on further and the necessary amendments included in a future taxation bill. 7 Detailed analysis Division 1 Subpart EH contains the provisions relating to the taxation of financial arrangements. The Subpart will be broken down into two divisions. Division 1 contains the current accrual rules that will be re-enacted with minor modification to reflect the new legislative style. These modifications include subsection headings and a list of defined terms at the end of each section. The rules will be self-contained and will apply to financial arrangements entered into before the date of enactment. A number of changes will be introduced to ensure that the rules in Division 1 are self-contained. The old terms that have been repealed or amended (such as “acquisition price” and “qualified accruals rules”) will continue to be relevant to Division 1. These terms will be moved from section OB 1 to section EH 11. Provisions that relate only to the current accrual rules, such as sections OB 7 and GD 11, will also be moved into Division 1. Two remedial amendments will be made. Section EH 3(6)(a) refers to “trustee income or beneficiary income under the trust rules and sections HI 1 to HI 5”. Sections HI 1 to HI 5 deal with Maori Authorities. The “and” between “trust rules” and “sections HI 1 to HI 5” will be replaced with “or”. The section is meant to exclude trusts, as well as Maori Authorities, from the cash basis concession. Therefore the two provisions should not be inter-related. Section EH 4(7)(a)(ii) applies if a person is released from an obligation to make a payment under a financial arrangement by operation of any of the Inland Revenue Acts. The purpose is to ensure no remission income will arise. Section EH 4(7)(a)(iii) applies if a person is released from an obligation to make a payment under a social assistance suspensory loan. There is currently an “and” between these subparagraphs. The provision in subparagraph (ii) has application beyond debts associated with loans from the Government for social assistance purposes. The two provisions should not, therefore, be related. The “and” will be replaced with an “or”. Transfer of financial arrangement to associate of the debtor A new section EH 5A will be inserted into Division 1 to reflect the proposed rules for debt parking. This section contains the provisions relating to the transfer of a debt at a substantial discount to an associate of the debtor. This provision will apply to transfers of debts after the date of enactment for financial arrangements entered into before that date. The definition of “remitted” has been amended to account for transfers of debt to an associate of the debtor. This will trigger a base price adjustment for the debtor. The base price adjustment will be amended to take into account payments made on behalf of the debtor. Section EH 5A (4) will deem a new interest-free loan to have been extended by the associate to the debtor for the amount paid for the debt. 8 Transitional adjustment Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into before the changes in this bill are enacted. Taxpayers will be able to elect, under section EH 14, to apply the accrual rules in Division 2 to those arrangements. This will be useful if they wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. The election will apply to all the financial arrangements to which they are a holder or issuer. In the year they elect to move onto the new rules, they will be required to calculate a transitional adjustment for each financial arrangement. The result of the adjustment will be their income or expenditure from the financial arrangements in that year. Differences between the old and new accrual rules that could result in an adjustment to income or expenditure include: • extension of the cash basis concession; • changes to the remission income rules; and • extension of the market valuation method. Terminology in other provisions of the Act References in other provisions of the Act have been changed to reflect the new terms used in Division 2 of Subpart EH. For example, references to “holder” and “issuer” will generally be changed to “party”, and references to “acquisition price” will be changed to “consideration”. Where consequential amendments are made, section EH 15 will guide taxpayers who are parties to a financial arrangement subject to the current rules when applying other provisions in Inland Revenue Acts if the terminology has been amended. If a holder or issuer of a financial arrangement to which the rules in Division 1 apply is required to apply other provisions of the Act, those other provisions will be applied as they were before the amendments in this bill were made. Division 2 Division 2 contains the amended accrual rules that will apply to financial arrangements entered into after the date of enactment. Purpose provision A purpose provision has been included at the beginning of the new accrual rules. The provision aims to assist taxpayers and other users of the legislation understand the general intent of the accrual rules, which is to allocate a fair and reasonable amount of expected income or expenditure from a financial arrangement over its term. The provision may also assist in the resolution of any unforeseen ambiguities. Application of the accrual rules No major changes will be made to the rules governing the persons to whom the accrual rules apply. 9 A minor amendment, in section EH 18(1)(c), ensures non-resident trustees are subject to the accrual rules. Trusts are generally taxed on the basis of the residence of the settlor. The residence of the trustee is disregarded for New Zealand tax purposes. A trustee, whether resident or non-resident, is liable to income tax on all trustee income that the trustee derives from New Zealand if the settlor is a New Zealand resident. This ensures consistent treatment between non-resident trustees deriving foreign- sourced and New Zealand-sourced income from financial arrangements. FIGURE 1: WHETHER THE ACCRUAL RULES AND THE SPREADING PROVISIONS APPLY Do the accrual rules apply to you? See section EH 18. Is there a financial arrangement? ̧ The definition of financial arrangement in section EH 19 is satisfied; and ̧ the arrangement is not an excepted financial arrangement under section EH 21; and ̧you do not or cannot elect to treat the excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement under section EH 22. Is this the income year that you must calculate your base price adjustment (BPA)? See sections EH 42 and EH 43. Are you a cash basis person? See sections EH 24 to EH 27. Were you a cash basis person in the immediately preceding income year? You do not need to use a spreading method. You must apply one of the spreading methods. See sections EH 31 to EH 34. Ignore accrual rules. Calculate your BPA, under section EH 44. NoNo NoYes Yes Yes No Yes Yes This flowchart illustrates the process to follow to determine whether the accrual rules or the spreading methods apply. Did you apply a spreading method to your financial arrangement in the immediately preceding income year? You must make a cash basis adjustment under section EH 29. No No 10 Definition of “financial arrangement” and “excepted financial arrangement” Definitions are generally found in section OB 1. However, the definitions of “financial arrangement” and “excepted financial arrangement” will be moved into Subpart EH, since they are fundamental to the application of the accrual rules. The definition of “financial arrangement” is cast in wide terms to include debt instruments, debt substitutes and derivatives. A wide definition is necessary because of the range of financial instruments and derivatives available in the marketplace, many of which are substitutable for debt. A consequence of the wide definition of “financial arrangement” is that it is necessary to exclude some arrangements from the rules. They are excluded because of the need to maintain the debt/equity boundary, for compliance cost reasons or because some transactions are subject to other rules set out in the Income Tax Act. The wide definition of “financial arrangement” will be retained, together with a definitive list of exclusions. However, the definition will be redrafted to improve its clarity and to make some minor amendments relating to terminology. Subparagraph (iii) of the current definition relates to the concept of a wider financial arrangement and lists arrangements that are included in the definition of financial arrangement (such as assignments and defeasances). This subparagraph will be repealed. Arrangements that fall within the scope of the subparagraph are already within the scope of the general definition, so the subparagraph is unnecessary. Subsection (2) of the proposed definition excludes from the definition partial or complete legal defeasances 1 and absolute assignments, not only of financial arrangements but also of excepted financial arrangements. The exclusion is necessary because legal and economic, or in-substance, defeasances, are similar in effect and thus difficult to exclude from the rules by way of refining the core definition. The arrangements will be excluded from the definition because an absolute assignment or legal defeasance merely terminates existing rights or obligations for the assignor or the defeasor. However, this exclusion will not prevent the assignee or defeasance counter party from becoming a party to a financial arrangement. 1 In Financial Reporting Standard No 26, Accounting for the Defeasance of Debt (FRS 26) a defeasance is a “legal defeasance” if the release of the debtor from the primary obligation for a debtor is either: (a) acknowledged formally by: (i) the creditor; or (ii) a duly appointed trustee or agent of the creditor; or (b) established by legal judgement. This definition will be incorporated into the Income Tax Act 1994. 11 Section EH 21 defines “excepted financial arrangement”. The list of excepted financial arrangements will be expanded to exclude certain transactions for compliance cost reasons. For example, small prepayments for goods and services, and private or domestic foreign exchange borrowings will be excluded from the accrual rules. Other arrangements will also be included in the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” to clarify the original intent of the rules. For example, it will be made clear that interests in group investment funds, partnerships and joint ventures are not financial arrangements. At present, taxpayers can elect to treat short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property as financial arrangements. This rule will be extended to prepayments for property or services of less than $50,000, short-term options, travellers’ cheques and variable principal debt instruments of less than $50,000. The election will be made by returning income or expenditure in respect of the arrangement on an accrual basis in the income year the election is made. Composite financial arrangements A consequence of the broad definition of “financial arrangement” is that groups of inter-related financial arrangements which may not be financial arrangements on their own may fall within the definition. Inter-related arrangements are those in which there is a degree of interdependency between the transactions. It is appropriate that they be covered by the rules if they have the same effect as debt instruments or debt substitutes. The calculation of income or expenditure in respect of composite financial arrangements is governed by a provision in the accrual rules (section EH 2 of the current rules). This provision will be re-enacted as section EH 20 with only two minor changes. The provision requires that when a composite financial arrangement includes an excepted financial arrangement, the amounts “solely attributable” to the excepted financial arrangement are excluded from the accrual rules. Income or expenditure will generally be “solely attributable’ to an excepted financial arrangement if it could have been expected to arise, or be incurred, without the support of the wider financial arrangement. The discussion document proposed that the operation of section EH 2 be clarified. However, submissions expressed concern that the proposed clarification would create a new concept and add uncertainties to the existing provision, so the proposed amendment has been withdrawn. The “solely attributable” rule will be amended, however, so that the rule will not apply to arrangements that are excepted financial arrangements for compliance cost reasons only. Those excepted financial arrangements are small variable principle debt instruments, short-term agreements for sales and purchase of property or services, short-term options, private or domestic purpose options over property, private or domestic purpose agreements for sales and purchase of property or services, private or domestic foreign currency loan to cash basis debtors, small prepayments for goods and services and travellers’ cheques. 12 An amendment will be made to ensure the “lowest price” concession 2 for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services (ASAP) will not apply if the ASAP is part of a composite financial arrangement. A composite financial arrangement containing a group of inter-related arrangements cannot be properly characterised as an ASAP (even though some of the constituent arrangements are ASAPs). Therefore the lowest price concession should not apply. This amendment will be achieved in the definition of “consideration” in section EH 45. Cash basis concession The accrual rules currently provide an exemption from the spreading provisions for cash basis holders. A cash basis holder is a natural person who holds financial arrangements with a total face value of less than $600,000 and the income from those financial arrangements is less than $70,000. The cash basis concession will be extended to all parties to a financial arrangement who are natural persons because there will no longer be a distinction between holder and issuer under the accrual rules. The three thresholds for the cash basis concession will be increased. The concession is available to persons with financial arrangements having a total face value of not more than $1,000,000. Under the income and expenditure threshold a person will be a cash basis person if the absolute value of the person’s income or expenditure, calculated under the accrual rules, from the financial arrangements, is less than $100,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure means the income will not offset the expenditure. Example A person is a party to two financial arrangements. Using the yield to maturity method, the income from one financial arrangement is $50,000 and the expenditure from the other financial arrangement is $20,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure is $70,000. The income and expenditure threshold is not breached. If the deferral threshold is not breached the person will be a cash basis person. Another person also has two financial arrangements. Using the straight line method, the income from one arrangement is $60,000 and the expenditure from the other financial arrangement is $50,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure is $110,000. The income and expenditure threshold is breached and the person is therefore not a cash basis person. 2 The “lowest price” provision in the definition of “consideration” ensures that increases in the value of property that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property, for example, are not included as interest income under the accrual rules. 13 A person will not be a cash basis person if the deferral threshold is breached. A breach will occur if a natural person creates a deferral of income or an acceleration of expenditure of $40,000 or more in aggregate. The amount of deferral is in respect of all financial arrangements to which the person is a party. The formula in section EH 24(3) sets out how the amount deferred will be calculated. It compares the income calculated under the accrual rules with the income calculated on a cash basis, and the expenditure calculated on a cash basis with the expenditure calculated on an accrual basis. If the total deferral across all financial arrangements is more than $40,000 the threshold will be breached. Other aspects of the cash basis concession remain largely the same even though the concession is being amended to reflect the removal of the holder/issuer distinction. As currently happens, the cash basis concession will apply to the estate of a deceased person. The concession will apply to the estate in the year of death and the subsequent four years if the deceased was a cash basis person at the time of death and the estate continues to fall under the cash basis thresholds. ELECTION TO USE A SPREADING METHOD Section EH 28 will provide that cash basis persons may elect to use a spreading method to calculate income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangements to which they are a party. In the year of election a cash basis adjustment will be performed for each financial arrangement, and income or expenditure in respect of those arrangements will be returned for that year. BECOMING OR CEASING TO BE A CASH BASIS PERSON Becoming a cash basis person, or ceasing to be one, requires a cash basis adjustment, as set out in section EH 29. Taxpayers must make an adjustment for all financial arrangements to which they are a party, apart from those arrangements that are already subject to the new method. For example, if they were a cash basis person and breached one of the thresholds, they would be required to perform a cash basis adjustment for all financial arrangements apart from those that were already subject to one of the spreading methods. The adjustment compares the income or expenditure that would have resulted had the new method been applied from the time the person became a party to the financial arrangement, with the income or expenditure that did result from using the old method. The result of the cash basis adjustment will be the person’s income or expenditure from the financial arrangement in that year. BASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT The base price adjustment is a “wash-up” calculation that is generally performed when a financial arrangement is sold, matures, is remitted or transferred. The current rules contain a separate base price adjustment for cash basis holders. Under the amended accrual rules the new base price adjustment, in section EH 44, will apply to both accrual and cash basis taxpayers. 14 Methods of calculating income or expenditure Taxpayers who are a party to a financial arrangement to which the cash basis concession does not apply must spread the income or expenditure over the term of the financial arrangement. The spreading methods available are set out in section EH 30 to EH 37. The flowchart in figure 2 is being included in the legislation to illustrate the process that should be followed to determine which spreading method to use. FIGURE 2: WHICH SPREADING METHOD TO USE You must use YTM or you may use an alternative under section EH 31. Can you use the market valuation method under section EH 33? (MV) You may use either method, outlined in Box A and Box B, if you satisfy the legislative criteria. Otherwise, you must apply section EH 31. NoNo Is there a determination? You must use a determination under section EH 35(1), or an alternative under section EH 35(2). Do you meet the criteria of section EH 36? NoYes YesNo You must use a method that complies with section EH 36. Do you meet the criteria of section EH 37? YesNo This flowchart illustrates the process to follow to determine which spreading method to use. SPREADING METHODS AB Yes Yes You may use SL. Can you use the straight line method under section EH 32? (SL) Can you use the yield to maturity method under section EH 31? (YTM) You may use MV You must use a method that complies with section EH 37. You should apply to the Commissioner for a determination under section 90AC of the TAA. YesNo 15 YIELD TO MATURITY The yield to maturity method is applied if expected cashflows and payment dates for a financial arrangement are certain. No substantive changes will be made from the current provision. STRAIGHT LINE METHOD The straight line method spreads the income or expenditure of a financial arrangement on a straight line basis over the term of a financial arrangement. The only change that will be made to this provision is an increase in the threshold. The straight line method will be able to be used if the person is a party to financial arrangements that have a total value of $1,500,000 or less. MARKET VALUATION METHOD At present, the market valuation method can only be used if Inland Revenue has approved a market in that instrument. This requirement will be relaxed so that the market valuation method may also be used if taxpayers can show that the market value used is reliable. Those who adopt the market valuation method will have to maintain records to show the reliability of the market from which the valuation is obtained. The change will be of most benefit to dealers in financial arrangements, since the use of market valuation rules is restricted for other taxpayers. The availability of the market valuation method is restricted to ensure that taxpayers are not entitled to bad debt deductions (by way of declining market prices) for capital losses that would otherwise be denied. The market valuation method is, however, available to all taxpayers for some arrangements with no risk of principal losses - forward contracts for foreign exchange and futures contracts. This group of arrangements will be extended to include exchange traded options. METHOD PRESCRIBED BY DETERMINATION If the yield to maturity method cannot be applied to a financial arrangement the Commissioner can issue determinations setting out an appropriate accrual method. Section EH 35 will deal with determination methods and alternatives available to taxpayers. IN THE ABSENCE OF A DETERMINATION Taxpayers who do not prepare financial accounts or who do not include income or expenditure of certain financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes will have to use a method to calculate income or expenditure for tax purposes that conforms with commercially acceptable practice. The method must also allocate a fair and reasonable amount to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement. 16 CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS AND CHANGE OF SPREADING METHOD Taxpayers must use a method of calculating income or expenditure consistently for a particular class of financial arrangement. Taxpayers are generally required to apply the same spreading method to a financial arrangement for its entire term. When a change of method is not explicitly prohibited by the consistency requirements, taxpayers will be able to change method only if there is a good commercial reason for doing so (section EH 40). They will be required to keep a record of the reason for the change under section 22A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxpayers changing methods must do a transitional adjustment, under section EH 41, in the year of change. However, they will not be able to change methods if a financial arrangement is subject to either the market valuation or straight line methods. Those methods must be applied to financial arrangements consistently until the financial arrangement is subject to the base price adjustment. Base price adjustment – holder/issuer distinction The distinction between a holder (usually a lender) and an issuer (usually a borrower) will be removed. The distinction is not relevant for many derivative arrangements such as forward contracts or options and, it is not always obvious which party to an arrangement is a holder or issuer. In some cases, the actual categorisation is arbitrary and the rules are difficult to apply. Removing the distinction will lead to a rewrite of the base price adjustment, so that one formula can apply to all parties to a financial arrangement, and to changes in terminology such as the use of “consideration” rather than “acquisition price”. The rewrite of the base price adjustment calculation is not intended to change the effect of the current law, except in relation to the treatment of non-contingent fees. TIMING OF THE BASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT Section EH 42 will set out the events that will require a base price adjustment. In addition to the sale, transfer, maturity or remission of a financial arrangement, the new accrual rules will set out special circumstances in which a base price adjustment is required. These circumstances include: • a non-resident leaving the tax base; • a debtor whose debt is sold to an associate at a discount; • an in-kind, or in specie, distribution of a financial arrangement by a company in liquidation; and • for an assignor or defeasor, an absolute assignment or legal defeasance of a debt. 17 DISPOSITIONS ON DEATH OF A TAXPAYER There is uncertainty as to if and when a base price adjustment should be done on the death of a party to a financial arrangement. An amendment will ensure that a transfer of a financial arrangement necessitating a base price adjustment will occur: • on the death of a party to a financial arrangement; and • on the distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will or on intestacy. EXCEPTIONS FROM PERFORMING A BASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT Taxpayers are required to carry out a base price adjustment when they cease to be New Zealand residents. To ease compliance burdens on them, temporary residents who are cash basis persons will be excluded from the requirement to perform a base price adjustment provided they become non-resident for tax purposes within three years of initially obtaining tax residence. This relief will apply only to financial arrangements to which they were a party before first becoming a New Zealand resident (section EH 43(1)). Section EH 4(9)(d) of the current rules requires persons who become non-resident to carry out a base perform price adjustment for any financial arrangement to which they are a party. This also applies if they continue to carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. An amendment will be made so that a base price adjustment will not be necessary if a New Zealand resident becomes non-resident and the financial arrangement relates to a business carried on by the person through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (section EH 43(2)). Under subsection EH 43(3) taxpayers who are a party to a debt that has been legally defeased but are not the defeasor will not have to carry out a base price adjustment. This is because their rights or obligations under the financial arrangement defeased have not been terminated. BASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT FORMULA The amendments to the base price adjustment in section EH 44 and the new definition of “consideration” in section OB 1 are intended to standardise and simplify the base price adjustment. The main policy changes include: • the removal of the holder/issuer distinction; • the extension of the consideration rules to cover finance leases; • the exclusion of income or expenditure associated with non-contingent fees (again through the definition of consideration); • inclusion of amounts remitted by operation of law in the variable “amounts remitted”; and • amendments to allow for the effect of debt parking arrangements. 18 Example A commercial property is sold for $1,500,000 under a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain planning consents being obtained. A deposit of $150,000 is paid on 20 December 1999, when the agreement is entered into. The balance of $1,350,000 is payable in two equal instalments due 3 and 6 months after the date of possession. Under the agreement, possession passes to the purchaser on the date the sale becomes unconditional; the purchaser has no other prior rights. On 3 March 2000 the planning consents are obtained and the sale becomes unconditional. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. For the purpose of recognising the expenditure incurred in the 1999 and 2000 income year of this agreement for the sale and purchase of property, the taxpayer may apply Determination G17B. By applying that Determination, the taxpayer will determine the value of the property passing under the agreement. The value of the property is determined, on the basis of discounted cash flows, to be $1,435,999. This is part of the “consideration” of the agreement for the sale and purchase of property. The other form of consideration is the cash payment of $1,500,000. Determination G17B, in turn, relies on Determination G3 (alternatively, G11A could be used) and Determination G1A to allocate an amount of expenditure to the 1999 income year. The expenditure allocated to the 1999 income year in accordance with those Determinations is $12,916. On the maturity of the financial arrangement, in the 2000 income year, a base price adjustment is calculated. The base price adjustment formula is: consideration – income + expenditure + amounts remitted where - consideration =the consideration paid to the person less the consideration paid by the person =the present value of the property transferred to the person less the cash payment made by the person =$1,435,999 – $1,500,000 =-$64,001 income=0 expenditure =expenditure incurred in previous income years =$12,916 amounts remitted=0 The result of the base price adjustment is, therefore, -$51085. This amount is thus expenditure incurred in the 2000 income year. ASSESSABILITY AND DEDUCTIBILITY OF ACCRUAL INCOME OR EXPENDITURE The main area of change with the removal of the holder/issuer distinction is the removal of the automatic deduction (a deduction not subject to a nexus or business test) currently available for holders of financial arrangements for a negative amount arising from the base price adjustment calculation. 19 The automatic deduction for holders will be removed because it: • is consistent with the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994, which will separate the timing rules from assessability and deduction provisions; • means that both parties to a financial arrangement will be treated in a consistent way; and • reduces incentives on taxpayers to structure transactions to take advantage of the right to an automatic deduction. A negative amount arising from the base price adjustment will be expenditure incurred that will be subject to the core deductibility tests. A positive amount is income derived. This will continue to be treated as gross income under section CE 1(1). Two additional tests will be introduced to overcome the unintended effects of removing the automatic deduction in the base price adjustment. If the outcome of the base price adjustment is negative (expenditure) and the amount arises because of an overstatement of income derived in previous income years, the amount will be deductible regardless of the core deductibility tests. If the outcome of the base price adjustment is positive (income) and the amount arises because of expenditure incurred in prior years but the expenditure was not allowed as a deduction, the amount will not be treated as income under the base price adjustment. Forgiveness of debt The accrual rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid as income if they are forgiven. Forgiveness is a benefit to the person who is no longer required to discharge its obligations. The forgiveness of debt rules also act as a clawback for deductions previously taken by taxpayers. The tax laws will be made more robust to ensure that taxpayers cannot structure transactions to avoid recognising forgiveness of debt income. NATURAL LOVE AND AFFECTION Under the accrual rules a debt that is remitted or forgiven will give rise to assessable income to the debtor. However, if a natural person forgives a debt in consideration of natural love and affection, the amount forgiven is treated as if it had been paid for the purposes of the accrual rules. Thus the amount will not give rise to remission income to the debtor. The Act will be clarified (section EH 49) so that forgiveness of debt in consideration of natural love and affection will apply if: • a creditor forgives a debt (whether in a will or otherwise) because of the natural love and affection that the creditor has for the debtor, or • a creditor forgives a debt owing by a trust because of natural love and affection that the creditor has for the beneficiaries of that trust. 20 TRANSFERS OF DEBTS TO ASSOCIATES Figure 3 shows an example of how a debt could be sold or transferred to an associate of the debtor to circumvent the debt remission rules. In the example, A owes money which it cannot repay to B. Rather than forgiving the debt (which would give rise to remission income for A) B sells the debt, at a discount, to an associate of A (in this case C). FIGURE 3: DEBT PARKING B has received $60 for A’s debt and extinguished its rights under the arrangement. Had this money come direct from A (as full and final settlement of the debt) remission income of $40 would have arisen to A. However, because C is an arm’s length party from B, no remission income arises under current law. The difference between this type of arrangement and the sale or assignment of the debt from B to an unrelated third party is that, although A’s debt under the arrangement is still outstanding, A no longer expects to have to repay the loan. Rules will be introduced (section EH 50) relating to transfers of debts to persons associated with the debtor. If a creditor sells a debt to an associate of the debtor at a discount of 20% or more, of the consideration remaining payable under the debt, the debt will be treated as being forgiven by the creditor. Both the original creditor and debtor will carry out a base price adjustment, and a new financial arrangement will be created between the debtor and the debtor’s associate. For the purpose of the base price adjustment the debtor will be treated as paying the discounted price (in the example $60). The debtor’s associate is treated as providing an interest-free loan of $60 to the debtor, so there is no income or expenditure to spread under the new financial arrangement. Under the new financial arrangement, if the debtor repays an amount in excess of the amount the debtor’s associates’ paid the original creditor, the excess will be an allowable deduction to the debtor and gross income to the debtor’s associate. A acknowledges the debt but C never calls the loan A (debtor) B (creditor) C (associate of A) $100 loan to A C buys debt from B for $60 21 AMOUNTS REMITTED When taxpayers perform a base price adjustment they must take into account any amount they have remitted. This ensures that the amount they remitted does not contribute to a negative outcome under the base price adjustment, since a negative outcome may be deductible for tax purposes. The current rule is incomplete, however, because only an amount remitted by the taxpayer is included in the base price adjustment. The amounts remitted through operation of law are not included in the base price adjustment. The base price adjustment will be amended to include amounts remitted through operation of law. Allowable deductions – bad debts Section EH 51, by and large, replicates the current section EH 5. It is extended to allow bad debt deductions for dealers or providers of goods and services when credit is extended under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. Security arrangements Sections EH 52 and EH 53 will consolidate the provisions relating to security arrangements. Agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services The rules applying to trade credits will be integrated with the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property. These rules will also be extended to apply to the provision of services. The integration is done by widening the definition of “property” for the purpose of the accrual rules. This will result in the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services covering all agreements in which the subject is property, except if the property is foreign exchange or financial arrangements. The current provisions for trade credits will be repealed. As a result of the integration, the bad debt provisions will be extended to taxpayers in the business of dealing in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. In addition, there will be only one excepted financial arrangement for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. The measurement period to determine short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services will run from the date the contract was entered into. If the date of contract cannot be determined with reasonable certainty the measurement period will run from the earlier of the date the purchaser makes any payment to the vendor or the date the first right in the property is transferred or any services are performed. The same measurement rule will apply to short-term options. 22 Interest accumulation rules will be included in the definition of “consideration” to enable the accrual rules to apply if payment is made before property is transferred. The rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property were intended to deal with actual transfers of property. They were not intended to apply if the property concerned is being used only as a pricing index. If there is a cash settlement option in a property agreement, this is an indication that the property is being used as a pricing index. The agreement should then be treated as a forward contract. The rules for an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services will apply only if the agreement is to be settled by physical delivery of property or the performance of services. It will be made clear that an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that provides for a cash settlement option is a forward contract, and a futures contract is a forward contract traded on a recognised futures exchange. The treatment of fees The treatment of fees incurred in relation to a financial arrangement is dependent upon whether the fees are contingent or non-contingent. Contingent fees must be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Currently, non-contingent fees up to 2% of the core acquisition price do not have to be spread. This threshold will be removed so that all non-contingent fees will not be spread. The treatment of fees will be reflected in the definition of “consideration paid” or “received” under a financial arrangement. Relationship between the accrual rules and other provisions of the Act Currently, section EH 8 governs the relationship between the accrual rules and the rest of the Act. Section EH 23 will be drafted to clarify that the accrual rules determine the amount and the timing of income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements, while the core provisions of the Act determine the assessability or deductibility of income or expenditure. At present, it is unclear whether section EH 8(1) precludes the transfer pricing provisions from applying. It will be made clear in the definition of “consideration” that the transfer pricing rules are intended to have overriding effect to determine the amount of consideration paid or received in applicable cross-border financial arrangements. Finance leases Currently, all leases are excepted financial arrangements. The specified lease rules, however, treat leases which are essentially financing transactions in a similar manner to a sale of the lease asset financed by a “loan” from the lessor to the lessee. Such leases are financing arrangements and are essentially similar to deferred property settlements. Therefore leases with financing characteristics will be included within the scope of the accrual rules. 23 From the date of enactment, leases with financing characteristics will be known as “finance leases”. The definition of “excepted financial arrangement” will be amended to exclude leases, other than finance leases, from the accrual rules. The definition of “specified lease” will be amended so that the definition applies only to leases entered into before the date the legislation is enacted. The definition of “finance lease” will be narrower than the current definition of “specified lease”. A lease of personal property (other than bloodstock and livestock) will be a finance lease if it meets any of the following criteria: • The lease asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term. • The lessee or associate has the option to acquire the lease asset for an amount that is substantially lower than the market value of the lease asset on the date of acquisition • The term of the lease is longer than 75 percent of the remaining useful life of the lease asset. Rules similar to those governing the tax treatment of hire purchase agreements will be introduced to deal with finance leases. As with the hire purchase rules the finance lease rules, other than those dealing with the calculation of interest income or expenditure, will be contained in Subpart FC. SPECIAL RULES FOR FINANCE LEASES New section FC 8A will stipulate that the leasing of an asset under a finance lease is treated as a sale. The lease asset is sold for the lessor’s disposition value (the cash price of the asset). Likewise, the lessee is treated as purchasing the asset for the lessee’s acquisition cost (again, usually the cash price). The result of the deemed sale is that any profit is recognised by the lessor in the year of sale, and the lessee is entitled to claim depreciation if appropriate. The lessor is explicitly denied a deduction for depreciation. New section FC 8B(2) will be inserted to ensure that if title transfers to the lessee at the termination of the lease, the transfer of title will not have any tax consequences. If the asset reverts to the lessor at the end of the lease, the consideration for the transfer is the guaranteed residual value (GRV). The GRV is defined as an amount equal to the value of the lease asset that the lessee agrees to pay the lessor at the expiry of the lease. If a lease is terminated early, the lease asset is treated as being sold to the lessor for the amount by which the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds any additional payment made as a result of early termination. 24 Both sections FC 8B(3) and FC 8C(1) will apply despite the requirements in section EG 19(7) in the depreciation rules. Section EG 19(7) enables the Commissioner to treat property sold, in certain circumstances, at its market value at the time of sale. This is not appropriate for finance leases because such leases will be treated as financing transactions, and the deemed sale price will be treated as part of that transaction. Section FC 8D will deal with sales of assets by the lessor following expiry of the lease. If an asset is sold for more or less than the guaranteed residual value, and a payment is made to or by the lessee, an adjustment is made to the deemed sale price to ensure that the value of the asset transferred is reflected in the financing transaction. FINANCE LEASES AND THE ACCRUAL RULES The new finance lease rules and the amendment to the excepted financial arrangement definition to exclude operating leases will mean that: • The interest element of a finance lease is recognised as income or expenditure over the term of the agreement using the yield to maturity or alternative accrual methods. • On termination or expiry of the lease there is a base price adjustment to ensure that all income or expenditure is recognised. FINANCE LEASES AND WITHHOLDING TAXES At present, the interest component of lease payments must be computed by a resident lessee in order for withholding taxes to be paid. Non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy must be deducted in relation to actual payments because the accrual rules do not apply for non-resident withholding tax purposes. Lease payments must therefore be divided into principal and interest by using, for example, actuarial tables. This approach continues under the finance lease rules. The only special rule inserted in the Act to deal with the integration of the finance lease rules with the withholding tax rules will be to deem income derived by the lessor from the deemed loan to be interest. This ensures that the amount is subject to the withholding tax. Other amendments BRANCH EQUIVALENT INCOME An amendment to the branch equivalent income calculation (section CG 11(5)) will clarify the amount a controlled foreign company must use to value the consideration for a financial arrangement. The section will apply if there was no attributed foreign income or loss in the previous accounting period. The valuation is necessary to enable taxpayers to apply the accrual rules to calculate the net income or loss of the foreign company. The consideration is the market value or the absolute value of the formula provided. 25 Section CG 11(5)(a) will be repealed, since it does not give the appropriate result. COMMERCIAL BILLS Section CE 3(1)(b), relating to commercial bills, will be repealed. A specific anti- avoidance rule (section GC 14A) will be introduced to act as a deterrent to taxpayers entering into arrangements to avoid non-resident withholding tax or approved issuer levy. The provision is designed to prevent non-residents avoiding non-resident withholding tax on redemption payments by disposing of the bills to a resident immediately before maturity of the bills. The provision does this by making a resident liable for tax on the redemption payment. HIRE PURCHASE RULES A new section (section FC 10(6A)) will be inserted into the hire purchase rules. The section treats the income of a lessor from the loan under a hire purchase agreement as interest. This is to clarify the relationship between the accrual rules and interest for the purpose of the withholding tax rules. NON-MARKET TRANSACTIONS Section GD 11 is aimed at transactions that attempt to defeat the intent and application of the accrual rules. The requirement that there be a connection between the parties will be removed, and the section will be extended to apply if an arrangement is issued, acquired, varied, sold or otherwise transferred. CONSOLIDATED GROUPS Amounts remitted amongst members of a consolidated group will be exempt from remission income only if the financial arrangement was held by members of the same group at all times during the term of the arrangement. This amendment to section HB 2(1)(a) is aimed at preventing taxpayers using the consolidation rules to avoid remission income. CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS A substantial number of consequential amendments will be made to remove terms such as “holder” and “issuer”. These changes are not intended to affect the way the taxation law applies. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 RECORD KEEPING A new section 22A will be inserted. This section will require taxpayers to keep: 26 • Sufficient records to verify market prices if they use the market valuation method to work out income or expenditure in any year. At present, taxpayers can use the market valuation method only if the Commissioner has approved the market. Markets will still be approved by the Commissioner, which will help to minimise compliance costs. • Records of why valuation methods have been changed. It is not intended that taxpayers have the ability to switch method from year to year simply because another accrual method provides more favourable tax outcomes. If, however, there are valid reasons for change - for example, a company is taken over and the new owner has different accounting policies - this is allowed. DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS The disclosure requirements for inter-related financial arrangement contained in section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be repealed. DETERMINATION MAKING POWERS Extensions to the determination making powers will be made to: • enable the consideration for the transfer of property to be calculated if there are substantial prepayments (accumulation provisions); • allow the Commissioner to determine the consideration for which a finance lease asset is transferred if it is inappropriate to use the cash price. In the latter case, the determination would refer to “discounted value”. This may occur, for example, if the payment terms are more favourable to the lessee than outright acquisition of the asset. 27 COMPARATIVE TABLE OF AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCRUAL RULES IN THE TAXATION (ACCRUAL RULES AND OTHER REMEDIAL MATTERS) BILL AND THE INCOME TAX ACT 1994/TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 As inserted by Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill 1998 Corresponding sections in current Income Tax Act Division One EH A1New EH A2New EH 1EH 1 - EH 1(3) and (4) amended EH 2EH 2 EH 3EH 3 - EH 3(1) amended EH 4EH 4 - EH 4(1), EH 4(9)(c) amended EH 5EH 5 EH 5ANew EH 6 - EH 10EH 6 - EH 10 EH 11OB 1 definition re-enacted EH 12OB 7 re-enacted EH 13GD 11 re-enacted EH 14New EH 15New Division Two EH 16New EH 17New EH 18(1)(a)New (b)EH 9(e)(i) reversed (c)New (d)Proviso EH 9(b) (e)EH 9(c) EH 18(2)(a)EH 9(e)(i) (b)EH 9(e)(ii) (c)EH 9(b) and (c) amended (d)EH 9(f) (e)EH 9(f) EH 19(1)OB 1 definition amended (2)New (3)OB 1 definition amended EH 20(1)EH 2 amended (2)New EH 21(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (l), (n), (p), (q), (r), (s) OB 1 definition (b), (e), (g), (h), (j), (k), (m), (t), (u), (v) New (i), (o)OB 1 definition amended (2)New (3)New EH 22EH 10 extended and amended EH 23EH 8 EH 24(1) - (5)EH 3(1) amended (6)EH 3(2)(b) EH 25(1)EH 3(6) amended (2)EH 3(6) amended (3)EH 3(6) amended (4)EH 3(7) amended EH 26EH 3(8) EH 27EH 3(9) amended EH 28New 28 As inserted by Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill 1998 Corresponding sections in current Income Tax Act Division Two continued EH 29EH 3(4) and (5) amalgamated EH 30(1) and (2)EH 1(1) amended (3)New (4)EH 1(8) EH 31EH 1(2) EH 32EH 1(3) and EH 1(4)(a) amended EH 33EH 1(6) amended EH 34New EH 35EH 1(5)(a) EH 36EH 1 (5)(b) EH 37New EH 38New EH 39EH 1(7) amended EH 40New EH 41EH 1(4)(b) extended and amended EH 42(1)EH 4(1), EH 4(9)(c), EH 4(9)(d) amended (2)OB 1 definition - maturity (3) - (6)New EH 43(1) - (3)New EH 44(1)EH 4(1), EH 4(2) amalgamated and amended (2)EH 4(3) amended (3)New (4)New EH 45OB 1 definition - acquisition price amended EH 46(1) and (2)GD 11(3) (3) - (5)EH 4(5) EH 47GD11(2) EH 48EH 4(7) EH 49EH 4(6) amended EH 50New EH 51(1)EH 5(4) (2)EH 5(1) (3) and (4)EH 5(2) EH 52 (1)EH 5(3) (2)EH 5(5) EH 53EH 4(8) EH 54EH 6 (1) - (3) EH 55New EH 56EH 4(9)(ba) As inserted by Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Bill 1998 Corresponding sections in current Tax Administration Act 1994 22ANew 44ANew 90AANew 90AB90(3) 90AC (1) and (2)90(1) (3)90(2) (4)Proviso 90(1) (5)90(1)(d) (6)90(6) 90AD (1)90(7) (2)90(8) (3)90(9) 90AEProviso 90(6) Other Changes to the Income Tax Act 1994 31 AVERAGING OF TAX-FREE ALLOWANCES (Clause 5) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment relaxes the tax-free allowance averaging legislation, so employers can base allowances on fair and reasonable estimates of work-related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related pay periods. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1999. Key features Section CB 12(3), which governs the averaging of tax-free allowances, will be replaced by a new provision that allows employers to base average tax-free allowances on fair and reasonable estimates of work-related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related pay periods. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 allows employers to calculate average tax-free allowances payable to employees. The legislation is intended to provide employers with the low- cost alternative of paying an average tax-free allowance, rather than having to reimburse each individual item of employee work-related expenditure. At present, employers use a variety of methods to determine the amounts of employee work-related expenditure to be reimbursed by way of average tax-free allowances. In general, average tax-free allowances paid by employers are reasonable estimates of actual work-related expenditure. However, an Inland Revenue review of the law has identified that a strict interpretation of the legislation does not allow for employers to take this approach. Under the current legislation, employers should carry out extensive employee surveys and use complex mathematical formulas to calculate the average tax-free payment they may make to each employee. If strictly followed, this would pose serious difficulties for employers. Even when information concerning total employee work- related expenditure is available (and in many cases, it may not be) the legislation’s compilation and calculation requirements impose a very heavy compliance cost burden upon employers. 32 The legislation will be amended by removal of its exacting survey and calculation requirements. Instead it will allow employers to base averages upon fair and reasonable estimates of work-related expenditure likely to be incurred by employees for related pay periods. 33 GST AS PART OF THE COST OF FRINGE BENEFITS (Clauses 12, 13 and 47(16) and (32)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment provides that GST is to be taken into account in valuing all fringe benefits except when the good or service being provided is exempt from GST. The absence of a GST content on goods and services other than motor vehicles is inconsistent with the underlying policy that benefits should generally be valued at the price the employee would have paid (a GST-inclusive amount) had he or she purchased them directly. There are no policy grounds to support this inconsistency. Application date This measure applies to fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1999. Key features The FBT rules are being amended to provide that the calculation of the value of a fringe benefit is GST-inclusive if the employer is a registered person who can claim input tax in relation to the fringe benefit provided or the good or service provided is subject to GST. This requires amendments to the terms “amount”, “cost”, “price”, “fee”, and “sale at retail” in sections CI 2 and CI 3. Consequential amendments are being made to the terms “input tax” and “registered person”. This measure will not affect all fringe benefits; only those that include a GST element will have an increase in the value of the benefit. It will not increase the cost of providing subsidised loans to employees because this is an exempt activity for GST purposes. The benefits affected are the goods and services an employer produces and provides to employees at a subsidised price or at no cost. Also affected are the goods and services an employer purchases and provides at a subsidised price or at no cost to employees. Example of impact of amendment An employer wishes to provide a fishing rod, cost $100 (including GST) to an employee. The table on the next page illustrates the various ways to achieve this, presuming the employee’s marginal tax rate is 33%. 34 Description of costFBT (current rules) Additional salary FBT under proposed change Actual cost of rod$100$100$100 GST content$11$11$11 GST input credit($11)n/a($11) Cost price of rod (under FBT rules) $89n/a$100 GST output tax based on cost price of rod for FBT purposes 2 $10n/a$11 Bonus paid after taxn/a$100n/a Income taxn/a$49n/a Fringe benefit tax$44n/a$49 Total cost to employer$143$149$149 Total revenue$54$60$60 collected FBT plus GST on rod Income tax plus GST on rod FBT plus GST on rod 2 Under the GST Act fringe benefits provided to an employee must be treated as a taxable supply by the employer. The example shows that by calculating the cost price on a GST-exclusive basis, less than the appropriate level of tax is paid, and employers may lower their overall tax bill by providing fringe benefits rather than paying equivalent wages. In the example, the saving to the employer was $6 on the $100 rod. This result was not intended, from a policy perspective, because the total cost to the employer and the total revenue collected should be the same regardless of the way employers pay their employees. Background FBT was introduced in 1985 to reverse the effect of certain court decisions, which established that non-cash benefits that could not be converted to cash were not subject to income tax. FBT was essential to support the PAYE base and to protect the revenue base, since employers were switching from providing monetary remuneration to remuneration in kind. FBT also increases the equity of the tax system, since equity requires that all forms of remuneration, including non-cash benefits, are taxed consistently. Also, because the incidence of non-cash benefits tends to increase with income, not taxing fringe benefits was eroding the progressive nature of the tax system. In the Atlas Copco 3 case the cost price of a motor vehicle was held to be GST- exclusive if the business could claim a GST input credit. The law was later amended to confirm that the cost price for motor vehicles was GST-inclusive. This amendment did not cover other goods or services that employers purchase or produce and then provide to their employees at a discount or for free. 3 CIR v Atlas Copco Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327 35 GUARANTEE FEES PAID TO NON-RESIDENTS (Clauses 14 and 47) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will ensure that guarantee fees paid to non-residents are liable to the same final withholding tax that an insurance premium paid to a non-resident insurer is subject to under section CN 4. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. Key features Section CN 4 and associated definitions in OB 1 are being amended to ensure that guarantee fees paid to non-residents are subject to the withholding tax treatment under that section. The amendments are of a clarifying nature and are intended to protect the New Zealand tax base. The main amendments are: • The definition of “insurance” in section OB 1 applying for purposes of sections CN 4, OE 4 and associated definitions in section OB 1 is amended to include a separate and explicit reference to a guarantee against risk. • A new definition of “insured person” is inserted in section OB 1 and applies for the purposes of sections CN 4 and OE 4. An insured person will be defined as a person who incurs a premium for a contract of insurance, regardless of whether the person is also the one who can make a claim under the contract. • The definition of “premium” in section OB 1 applying for purposes of sections CN 4 and OE 4 is amended to include a specific reference to a guarantee fee. An example of the amendment’s application would be to a guarantee fee paid by a New Zealand resident company to a non-resident parent company (or another non- resident associate) in return for the non-resident parent guaranteeing the repayment of a loan made by a lender to the New Zealand company. The guarantee fee would be subject to the withholding tax treatment under section CN 4. The amendments recognise that there is no distinction between insurance and guarantees at a conceptual level as both relate to protection against risk. 36 The amendments will also confirm that guarantee fees come within the insurance exclusion provision in the business profits articles in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. Background Section CN 4 generally provides that a non-resident insurer (without a fixed establishment in New Zealand) deriving insurance premiums from New Zealand is subject to a 3.3% tax on the amount of the gross premiums. The person paying the premium is required to deduct the amount of this tax from the premium and pay it to the Commissioner. Section OE 4(1)(o) stipulates the type of insurance premiums that are deemed to be derived from New Zealand. A “premium” is defined in section OB 1 for the purposes of sections CN 4 and OE 4 as meaning a premium payable in respect of a contract of insurance. “Insurance” is defined for these purposes to mean insurance or guarantee against any loss, damage, event or risk of any kind other than life insurance. 37 LIMITING DEDUCTIONS UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS (Clauses 16, 17, 24, 25, 26, 51 and 59) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments counter a weakness in the current tax law involving expenditure on films and petroleum mining exploration whereby arrangements can be structured to claim, in effect, two deductions for one amount of expenditure. Application date The amendments apply to expenditure incurred on films and petroleum exploration, under these arrangements, from the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The bill inserts two new sections in subparts DM and EO. Both amendments remove the taxation benefits of the arrangements in question but leave the normal deductions provided for films and petroleum exploration activities in place. If an arrangement involving two deductions (or equivalent effect) has been entered into, deductions for film or petroleum exploration expenditure are reduced to the extent of any proceeds from disposal of property under the arrangements in question. The proceeds of sale of property are defined to exclude income derived from films and from the disposal of petroleum mining assets under section CJ 3, to allow deductions to the extent that such income is derived. The Commissioner’s power to assess taxpayers under the proposed amendments will not be limited by the time bar. Use of money interest may apply as a result of any adjustments made. Background Under current law, investors can enter into arrangements, usually through a group of companies, and claim two tax deductions for what is, in effect, one amount of expenditure. The first deduction is for expenditure on films or petroleum exploration. The second deduction is claimed in relation to the disposal of property under the arrangement. 38 TRADING STOCK - VARIANCES (Clause 19) Summary of proposed amendment The trading stock rules are being amended to ensure that variances between budgeted and actual costs of production that are allocated to closing stock are taken into account in an income year. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1998–99 income year. Key features The amendment replaces section EE 5 (3A). It ensure that variances between budgeted and actual costs of production that are allocated to closing stock under section EE 5 (3) are taken into account in an income year. Background Many businesses adopt trading stock valuation systems that involve the use of standard cost accounting. Standard cost accounting systems can use predetermined rates for production overhead and other direct and indirect costs that are allocated to trading stock. At year-end, therefore, a variance from the actual production costs is likely to arise. The variance will arise if a taxpayer has higher or lower costs than those budgeted for. The tax issue arising from this relates to the timing of a deduction for a variance. The policy proposed when the trading stock reforms were introduced was that variances should be allocated between cost of goods sold (this portion of cost is allowed as a deduction) and closing stocks (this portion is carried forward to future periods). It was intended that variances be treated as annual adjustments. A new section, EE 5(3A), was inserted into the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock and Other Remedial Matters) Bill to ensure the annual adjustment occurs as intended. However, the provision, as currently drafted, does not achieve its purpose. It is not specific enough about the variance, and the section refers to the entire variance rather than the part of the variance allocated to closing stock. Nor does it allow for variances that arise because less is spent on trading stock than is budgeted. The proposed amendment is intended to rectify these drafting problems. 39 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT – LOW INCOME REBATE (Clause 43) Summary of proposed amendment Section KC 1(2) will be amended to correct an error. The term “absentee” will be replaced with “non-resident”. Section KC 1(2) currently refers to a taxpayer who is an absentee for part of an income year. Because an absentee is a person who is not resident for any part of an income year, the term which should have been used is “non-resident”. Application date The amendment will apply to the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years, the date the previous amendment is to apply from. 40 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 44) Summary of proposed amendments The Mission Without Borders (NZ), Humanitarian Aid Account is to be given charitable donee status. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1999-2000 income year. Key features The Mission Without Borders (NZ), Humanitarian Aid Account is being added to section KC 5, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status. Background Mission Without Borders (NZ) has established an account for moneys to be used outside New Zealand for humanitarian purposes. This account, which is to be known as the Mission Without Borders (NZ), Humanitarian Aid Account, is being added to the list of organisations that qualify for charitable donee status. Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1 / 3 % of the amount donated, to a maximum for all donations of $500 a year. Donations by companies (not being a close company) qualify for a deduction from net income. The amount allowable as a deduction depends on the amount of the company’s net income. Changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 43 APPLICATION OF SHORTFALL PENALTIES TO DUTIES (Clause 54 1(e)) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “return period” is being amended to clarify that it covers tax returns provided for a particular transaction or transactions but not tied to a particular period. Application date To ensure there is no argument about the return period to which payment of duties relates, the application date of this measure is that of the compliance and penalty legislation generally, the income year beginning 1 April 1997. Key features The definition of “return period” in section 3 is being amended to provide that the return period in relation to a tax return that relates to transactions is the day on which the tax return is due. For example, stamp duty is a transaction tax, so the tax return for stamp duty has no period to which it relates. This amendment provides a return period for these taxes so that various offsetting provisions in section 141 can apply and shortfall penalties can be imposed, since the requirements of section 141(3) are now met. Section 141(3) requires a shortfall penalty to be imposed in relation to a return period, a tax type and a tax position. Background Section 141 requires a tax shortfall calculation each time a taxpayer incurs a shortfall penalty. A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed on a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections. “Tax shortfall” is a defined term, and the definition sets out how the tax shortfall is to be calculated. A shortfall penalty is imposed for the return period to which the tax return relates. It is arguable that for taxes such as stamp and cheque duty, which have no return period because the returns relate to one-off transactions, shortfall penalties cannot be imposed. Furthermore, without a return period the various offsetting provisions in section 141 cannot apply. 44 TAX IN DISPUTE AND REMISSION PROVISIONS (Clauses 54 1(c), 92-93, 95, 97-99, and 102) Summary of proposed amendment Several amendments to the rules on tax in dispute, use of money interest, and remission confirm their application to disputes and remission requests received after the rules came into effect but for periods, such as income years, that predate their introduction. Other amendments confirm that these provisions apply regardless of section 1(2), which provides that the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies only to tax on income derived on the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Key features • The definition of “late payment penalty” in section 3 is expanded to cover late payment penalties regardless of the period to which they relate, allowing application of the current remission provisions to these penalties. • A provision is inserted into the Parts relating to disputes and remissions and use of money interest to ensure that this legislation applies to periods before the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect. • This will allow, irrespective of the income year or tax type to which any tax in dispute relates, for the correct tax in dispute and the associated use of money interest rules to apply, unless the dispute has begun and the taxpayer and Inland Revenue agree, before the enactment of this bill, that the old rules apply. • It will also ensure that the use of money interest rules introduced as part of the compliance and penalty legislation apply from 1 April 1997 to calculate the interest payable on deferrable and non-deferrable tax. • If a dispute relates to 1995-96 or an earlier income year and begins on or after 1 April 1997, the use of money interest rules introduced as part of the compliance and penalty legislation will apply from the beginning of that dispute rather than the original due date. Background The compliance and penalty legislation introduced new remission provisions that provided clear rules for remitting civil penalties (other than shortfall penalties). It was intended that the remission provisions would apply to remissions relating to the 1994- 95 income year and earlier years, but as a result of the application of the savings provision in section 1(2) this has not happened. 45 This amendment ensures that taxpayers in similar positions receive similar remission treatment regardless of whether the remission relates to a penalty imposed in the 1994-95 or earlier income years. Having one set of remission provisions applying to all penalties was proposed in the second Government discussion document on the proposed compliance and penalty legislation. Likewise there is doubt as to the application of the current tax in dispute rules, and use of money interest, to disputes relating to periods before the Tax Administration Act 1994 took effect. These amendments clarify the application of these current rules to those periods. 46 ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF TIME (Clauses 47(26) and 58) Summary of proposed amendments Two amendments are being made to the provisions relating to the extension of time arrangements for furnishing income tax returns. First, the provision allowing the Commissioner to cancel an extension of time arrangement is being amended to make clear that the Commissioner can cancel an arrangement previously granted if tax agents do not meet their return filing percentage obligations. Second, the term “linked to a tax agent”, which allows taxpayers so linked to have the extended terminal tax due date, 7 April for standard and late balance dates, is being limited to agents with extension of time arrangements. Application date The measures will apply from date of enactment. Key features Section 37(4A) is being amended to make it clear that the Commissioner has the power to cancel tax agents’ extension of time arrangements during an income year if they do not meet their return filing percentages. The definition of “linked to a tax agent” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to refer to tax agents with an extension of time arrangement. Clients of a tax agent without an extension of time arrangement do not require the later terminal tax date because their returns are due on 7 June and 7 July following the end of the income year. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 was recently amended to provide that taxpayers with an agent who have an extension of time arrangements would have a terminal tax date of two months after the general terminal tax dates. These measures address additional policy issues arising from the terminal tax date change. 47 BINDING RULINGS (Clauses 54, 67-90 and 99) Summary of proposed amendments The changes are aimed at improving the operation of the binding rulings system while maintaining the original policy intent and design features. The main proposals concern the continuation of binding rulings as a result of legislative change and a review of the publication requirements. The various other amendments are of a more minor nature. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Background The binding rulings legislation, enacted by amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994, took effect from 1 April 1995. The primary aim of binding rulings is to permit taxpayers to conduct their business and investment activities with a degree of certainty as to the tax implications of particular transactions. A post-implementation review of the rulings system has identified areas to be improved. Key features • Binding rulings will continue to apply after a legislative change if that change does not materially affect the ruling. To enable taxpayers to determine whether a ruling is still valid they will be able to apply for a status ruling. • Binding rulings will continue to apply if an assumption used in the ruling proves to be incorrect if the assumption is not material to the ruling. • Product rulings will not be published until two months after the applicant receives the ruling. Product and public rulings will no longer be required to be published in the Gazette but will be published in other tax-oriented publications. • It will be clarified that binding rulings are not disputable decisions and cannot be challenged through the dispute resolution process. 48 • Private binding rulings are being permitted on repetitive arrangements. This will improve certainty for taxpayers who regularly enter into similar transactions. Detailed analysis Continuation of binding rulings after legislative change Section 91G states that a ruling terminates if the taxation law on which the ruling has been given is repealed. This occurs even if the provision is replaced with a substantially similar provision that does not alter the tax treatment of the arrangement. Therefore rulings have to be re-issued, which can result in compliance and administrative costs and defeats the purpose of binding rulings, which is to provide certainty. The policy rationale of section 91G was that the intent of Parliament should always take precedence over a binding ruling. Binding rulings were to terminate, therefore, following a change to the legislation that materially affects that ruling. Immaterial changes were not intended to terminate binding rulings. This intent is not adequately reflected in the legislation, however. Section 91G has been redrafted to ensure that only material changes to a taxation law will affect the status of a binding ruling. This change means that taxpayers will be responsible for monitoring the rulings they have obtained. In some cases, however, the effect of a change in the law on a ruling may not be clear to taxpayers. To overcome this problem the Commissioner will be able to issue rulings on the effect of legislative change on an existing ruling. These will be known as “status rulings” and will be provided for by new sections 91GA, 91GB, 91GC and an amendment to section 3. This service will be charged for at the regular rate. Scope of product rulings Product rulings are Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how the taxation law applies to a particular product rather than how it applies to a person or class of persons in relation to an arrangement. The ruling, therefore, defines the product and specifies the tax treatment. It applies to taxpayers whose identities and tax attributes are not known to Inland Revenue. It was not intended that product rulings should state how the law applied to a person or class of persons. However, the legislation in this area is ambiguous. In practice, Inland Revenue has issued product rulings that include comment on the tax treatment of the unknown parties entering into that product. Section 91FC will be clarified so product rulings can be issued on the way the taxation law applies to the unknown parties to products. This will apply only if the tax characteristics of the persons entering into the arrangement do not affect the content of the ruling. 49 Effect of incorrect assumptions The rulings legislation allows the Commissioner to set out the facts and assumptions on which rulings are based. As the law currently stands, if the facts of an arrangement are materially incorrect, a ruling will not apply. In contrast, the legislation does not provide a materiality threshold in relation to incorrect assumptions contained in binding rulings. Assumptions are generally made about future events. If an assumption proves incorrect the whole binding ruling is invalid, despite the fact that the incorrect assumption may not be relevant to the remainder of the ruling. Sections 91EB and 91FB are being amended so that a ruling does not apply if it contains assumptions about future events or facts that prove to be materially incorrect. This is consistent with the rules applying to facts. However, a separate category, called “conditions” in the legislation, is retained in these sections. These conditions would not be subject to a materiality threshold. Arrangement not seriously contemplated The Commissioner is required to make rulings only on arrangements that are seriously contemplated. It is not clear, however, at what point an arrangement that is the subject of the binding ruling has to be “seriously contemplated”. It could be either the time of application or the time the ruling is to be issued. If the latter, it may be possible for taxpayers to use the rulings process as a means of testing proposals which are not fully developed in order to see whether they fit with the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law. Section 91E amends the law to clarify that an arrangement that is the subject of a binding ruling must be “seriously contemplated” at the time of application for a ruling. The proposed approach would not prevent minor amendments being made to an arrangement whilst a ruling application is being considered. Timing of publication of product rulings Product rulings are published in full because they may affect many people, and it is in the public interest for taxpayers to be aware of Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law. Section 91FH introduces a requirement that product rulings be published two months after a ruling is issued. This is because the publication of rulings could limit the competitive advantage that a new product generates. Introducing this time period means there is a suitable compromise between the public’s interest in gaining information and an applicant’s right to benefit from the development of new products. 50 Vehicle for publication of rulings The requirement on Inland Revenue to publish product and public rulings in the Gazette in section 91DA and 91FH is being dispensed with. It is cheaper and more effective for rulings to be published in tax-orientated publications that are widely available in hard copy and on the Internet. Binding rulings and disputable decisions Section 138E is being amended to make it clear that binding rulings are not disputable decisions. The policy behind the binding rulings system is clear that no separate appeal rights to the courts were to be provided. It should not be possible, therefore, to challenge rulings through the dispute resolution process. Repetitive arrangements Sections 91E (1) and 91EC are being amended so that private binding rulings will be permitted on repetitive arrangements, such as hire purchase agreements. This extension to the scope of binding rulings will improve certainty for taxpayers who regularly enter such transactions and reduce compliance costs. Extension of binding rulings Section 91FI, which allows extensions to rulings, will be repealed. There are no advantages in extending a ruling as opposed to completing a fresh application. Conflicting rulings The conflicting binding rulings provisions in section 91DB(2), 91EA(2) and 91FA(2) are unnecessary and will be repealed. Where conflicting rulings exist, the taxpayer has the choice of which ruling to apply. Content of a binding ruling Sections 91DA, 91EH and 91FH will be amended to include an explicit requirement to state in a binding ruling how the taxation law applies to an arrangement (and an applicant for private rulings). This reflects current practice. Duration of a binding ruling Sections 91DA, 91DC, 91DD, 91DE, 91E, 91EB, 91EH, 91EI, 91F, 91FB, 91FH, and 91FJ will be clarified to make it explicit that binding rulings can be issued for income years as well as for specific periods. This reflects current practice. 51 Minor mistakes in binding rulings Typographical errors and minor mistakes in rulings that have been issued will, with the consent of the taxpayer, be corrected without the need to withdraw the original ruling and reissue a new ruling. This is enacted by inserting new section 91GD. Disclosure requirements for private binding rulings The binding rulings legislation requires holders of private rulings to disclose to Inland Revenue whether they have complied with the content of a ruling and whether any material changes to the arrangement identified in the ruling have occurred. The disclosure provisions in section 91EJ for private rulings will be repealed. This will reduce compliance costs on taxpayers. Prospective applicants The application provisions in section 91EC will be amended to allow for applications to be made on behalf of applicants not yet in existence (for example, an arrangement to be entered into by a yet to be incorporated company). This reflects commercial reality and current practice. Identification of applicants in product rulings The amended section 91FH (1) will require applicants for product rulings to be identified in the ruling. Currently, the provisions relating to product rulings require the disclosure of the name of the applicant in the application, but there is no requirement that the name of the applicant be contained in the ruling. This is contrary to the original policy intent and current practice. Incorrect rulings Sections 91DC, 91EA and 91FA will be amended to make it clear that a binding ruling has not been applied if a taxpayer has filed a return on the basis of a ruling and has then issued a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) within the specified time period. The issuance of the NOPA effectively retracts the ruling, and the Commissioner will not, in these circumstances, be bound to apply it. Tax due and payable Section 91E(4)(d)(i) states that the Commissioner cannot make a ruling when the matter on which a binding ruling is sought concerns tax that is due and payable. This section has the potential to cause problems because of the operation of provisional and other tax credit regimes. In relation to provisional tax, for example, while it is due and payable in three instalments throughout the year, the tax has not been assessed at the date it is paid. The instalment acts as a tax credit until the actual income tax liability has been determined. 52 The provision was not intended to prevent rulings being made in relation to taxpayers who had, for instance, provisional tax payments due and payable. This would substantially limit the ability of the Commissioner to rule on completed transactions. Section 91E(4)(d)(i) will be amended to clarify that all provisional taxpayers may apply for binding rulings, even though the matter may concern a provisional tax payment. Audit undertaken Once an audit which encompasses an arrangement that is the subject of an application for a binding ruling has been undertaken, section 91E(4)(g) provides that the Commissioner cannot make a ruling on that arrangement. This restriction applies because the binding rulings system should not overlap with the dispute resolution process. It is unclear from this section what constitutes an “audit”, since the term is not defined in the Act. The original policy was that it incorporates all verification activities carried out by Inland Revenue. Section 91E(4)(g) will be clarified so that all types of audit activity carried out by Inland Revenue come within the scope of the provisions. Private rulings and the dispute resolution process The policy intent behind the binding rulings legislation is that it should not overlap with existing dispute resolution procedures. Section 91E (4) will be amended to clarify that a binding ruling cannot be sought on an arrangement that is within the scope of a NOPA. Outstanding money owing The Commissioner will be able to decline to rule if an applicant has outstanding debts relating to earlier binding ruling applications. Sections 91E (3), 91F (3) will be amended and a new section 91J will be added to allow this. 53 TIME BAR WAIVERS (Clause 91) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment confirms that income years and GST periods that began before 1 October 1996 may be the subject of a waiver under section 108B. As part of the dispute resolution process, that section allows taxpayers to sign a waiver to extend by six months, before its expiry, the four-year period that generally applies to amended assessments. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 October 1996, when the current section 108B came into effect. Key features The current section 108B is to be re-enacted with the addition of a clarification that income years and GST return periods that began before 1 October 1996 may be included in a taxpayer’s time bar waiver. Background The Commissioner may amend an assessment to increase the amount of income tax or GST payable within four years from the end of an income year in which a taxpayer provides a return. The Tax Administration Amendment (No. 2) Act 1996 introduced section 108B to the principal Act. Section 108B allows taxpayers, before expiry of the period of four years applicable under section 108 or section 108A, to sign a waiver to extend the four-year time bar by up to six months. The amendment re-enacts this policy and confirms the original intended policy that the waiver may relate to income years and GST return periods that began before 1 October 1996. Before 1 October 1996, section 108 of the Tax Administration Act provided that the four-year limitation period ran from the end of the income year in which the return was assessed. There was no provision for a waiver to extend the period in which a reassessment could be issued. In 1996, as part of the disputes resolution legislation, section 108 was redrafted to provide that the Commissioner could issue a reassessment to increase the tax liability only if the assessment was made within four years from the end of the income year in which the tax return was furnished. This had the effect of shortening the time available to the Commissioner to issue a reassessment by up to one year. At the same time, section 108B was introduced to 54 provide that the taxpayer could extend this four-year period by six months to allow the dispute to be resolved before the issue of a reassessment, thus avoiding unnecessary litigation. Inland Revenue, together with a large number of taxpayers and their advisers, considers the effect of these provisions is that the reference in section 108B to section 108 is to be taken as referring to the equivalent former provisions. This was the intended effect and operation of section 108B. A contrary view (that section 108B applies only to income years and GST return periods that began on and after 1 October 1996) has been expressed. The amendment is to clarify the law by confirming the intended policy position that section 108B applies to all income years and GST return periods. 55 TAX RECOVERY AGREEMENTS (Clauses 4, 48, 54, 63, 100, 101, 103) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments enable tax recovery agreements made with other countries to have effect in New Zealand. Tax recovery agreements provide a mechanism by which participating countries can call on each other’s tax administration to recover tax from absconding debtors. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Although the amendments will enable tax recovery agreements to have effect, New Zealand’s first such agreement (negotiated with the Netherlands) is not expected to enter into force until mid-1999. Key features A new Part XA, entitled “Tax Recovery Agreements”, is being inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994, and section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended. Together these amendments, and several other minor consequential changes, will permit tax recovery agreements to be given force of law in New Zealand by way of Order in Council, and provide a further legislative framework for the operation of those agreements. They will enable the Commissioner to exercise his usual powers of collection in relation to foreign tax claims that are the subject of a tax recovery agreement or request the other state to collect outstanding New Zealand tax. The amendments will also allow tax recovery provisions to be included within new or existing double tax agreements (DTAs). Practical application of a recovery agreement will be a straightforward process of debt collection. A typical case where New Zealand is called upon to collect foreign tax will involve: • New Zealand will receive a request for assistance in recovery, accompanied by relevant documentation, from a foreign state with which New Zealand has a relevant agreement. • New Zealand will review the request to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the agreement and the empowering legislation. • New Zealand will pursue recovery action, in the same way it would were the claim a New Zealand tax debt. • Following recovery (assuming the action is successful) the recovered amount will be paid over to the foreign state. 56 Almost all of the key matters to be covered by the legislation will be included within the new Part XA of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • Application of Part XA Section 173A will provide that Part XA applies to tax recovery agreements negotiated between the government of a territory outside New Zealand and the government of New Zealand. • Definitions Section 173B will contain several new definitions relevant to Part XA. These include “contested tax”, used in section 173G which will stipulate certain limitations on recovery action concerning contestability and age of tax claims. Section 173B will also include a definition of “tax recovery agreement” and “competent authority”. • Empowerment Section 173C will provide that tax recovery agreements may be given effect by Order in Council, in a similar manner to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to DTAs. However, whereas DTAs override anything in the Income Tax Act 1994 or any other enactment, section 173C will provide that the extent to which tax recovery agreements override domestic law will be limited, in their application, by the provisions of Part XA. • Taxes that may be recovered A new section 173D will provide that recoverable taxes are limited to those that are imposed by the laws of New Zealand and the other country, and are prescribed in the relevant tax recovery agreement. • Essential documentation requirements A new section 173E will stipulate the documentation that must accompany requests for assistance in recovery. This will include, for example, written particulars of the amount of the tax claim; the extent, if any, to which the requesting party considers that the tax claim is uncontested; a declaration that the request meets the terms of the relevant agreement; and a certified or notarized copy of the instrument permitting enforcement in the other country. Other documentation may be required under each agreement, although section 173E lists the essential documents that would be expected to accompany each request for assistance in recovery. • Enforcement powers A new section 173F will provide that the Commissioner may exercise his usual powers of collection in carrying out recovery action under a tax recovery agreement. However, the section provides that New Zealand use of money interest and penalties will not apply. 57 • Limitations on assistance in recovery A new section 173G will set out certain limitations on the recovery of foreign tax by the Commissioner, concerning the age of tax claims and whether they are contested. Under a tax recovery agreement the Commissioner will generally be obliged to collect uncontested tax claims (subject to the conditions of each individual treaty and the boundaries set out in the empowering legislation). The Commissioner will not, however, be obliged to collect a contested tax claim. Nevertheless, even if a tax claim is contested, in certain circumstances the Commissioner may choose to carry out recovery action - for example, when it is determined that the taxpayer may leave New Zealand, or take steps concerning the existence or location of assets, in an attempt to prevent recovery action. The Commissioner may do this only after consulting with the other country. The new section will provide that, to be recoverable under a tax recovery agreement, a tax claim must not have been outstanding as an uncontested tax liability longer than six years before the entry into force of the relevant agreement. The new section will also provide that the Commissioner is not obliged to comply with a request for assistance that has been made after a period of 15 years from the date that the tax claim first became uncontested. The rationale for this rule, which is modelled on a draft OECD proposal, is that a 15-year time period is considered to be sufficient to avoid an obligation to collect old claims, yet is also sufficient for disputes to be settled domestically before foreign assistance is required. • Process when objection raised A new section 173H will provide a process which persons may follow if they believe that recovery action should not be taken. They may present their case to the New Zealand competent authority and request that the competent authority of the other state be informed. The New Zealand competent authority must then, without undue delay, endeavour to resolve the matter with them or the other competent authority. This approach replicates the mutual agreement procedure that is usually included in tax treaties. • Right of appeal A new section 173I will provide a person who believes that recovery action should not be taken with a right of appeal to the District Court. • Commissioner’s certificate A new section 173J will provide that, if the Commissioner determines assistance in recovery of a foreign tax claim may be given, he may produce and sign a certificate stating that the request complies with Part XA. In proceedings relating to recovery of the tax claim the certificate will be, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence of the matters certified. 58 Tax recovery agreements may be negotiated on a stand-alone basis, as is the case with the Netherlands treaty, or as part of new or existing DTAs. The amendment to section BH1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will extend the purpose of a DTA to include giving assistance in the recovery of tax claims. This is to allow for tax recovery provisions to be included within DTAs. However, whereas DTAs override anything in the Income Tax Act 1994 or any other enactment, any DTA which contains a tax recovery agreement will be subject to the conditions set out in Part XA. Other, consequential, amendments will include deeming the meaning of “tax” and “income tax” to include taxes prescribed in a tax recovery agreement, and the insertion of a definition of the term “contested act of assistance”, used in sections 173H and 173I. Background Tax recovery agreements are becoming common internationally. Globalisation has prompted a rapid increase in international co-operation in economic and fiscal matters, including co-operation in tax administration. The OECD has recommended that Member countries consider adoption of tax recovery agreements, and is now developing a model agreement for likely inclusion into the OECD Model Tax Convention. It is expected that the New Zealand Government will enter into a tax recovery agreement only if the participating foreign state meets certain fundamental requirements. For example, it will need to have a system for the assessment and collection of tax that is acceptable to New Zealand and have a legal system that gives appropriate recognition to due process concerns. New Zealand will maintain a close working relationship with the competent authority of the foreign state. Therefore should complications arise at any stage of the collection process, the competent authorities will be able to develop a resolution that conforms to the requirements of the empowering legislation and the relevant agreement. 59 NON-RECOVERY OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF CIVIL PENALTIES (Clause 102) Summary of proposed amendment The $20 threshold below which the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax will be extended to cover late payment penalties, shortfall penalties, and late filing penalties. This is achieved by removing a provision that prevents this threshold applying to civil penalties. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features Section 174 is being amended to allow the Commissioner not to recover civil penalties, which means removing the full recovery requirement under section 174(2). Civil penalties will not be recovered if the amount is less than $20. Background The restriction on writing-off small amounts of civil penalties was carried over from the previous legislation and stemmed from a concern that those who have not complied in some way should not benefit from having small amounts of their tax liability remitted. In practice, the provision imposes both compliance and administrative costs, with little revenue benefit to offset those costs. Since identifying this issue the Commissioner has applied the care and management criteria provided under section 6A of the Tax Administration Act to prevent undue imposition of compliance costs. However, given the specific statutory provision on this matter, the Government considers it is more appropriate for the issue to be resolved by legislation. The proposal to increase to $20 the civil penalty write-off will provide a direct compliance cost benefit to taxpayers in this circumstance. Changes to Other Acts 63 GST ON OVERSEAS MAIL DELIVERY IN NEW ZEALAND (Clauses 109-110) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment zero-rates fees charged to overseas postal organisations for mail delivery services in New Zealand. It aligns the delivery of overseas mail with the delivery of other goods and services entering New Zealand. Application date The amendment applies to fees charged for overseas mail delivery services provided to overseas postal organisations from the date of enactment. Key feature The bill inserts a new paragraph to section 11(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The amendment specifically zero-rates delivery service fees charged to overseas postal organisations for the delivery of overseas mail inside New Zealand. Background Agreements between international postal authorities deem that the consumption of the delivery of international mail occurs at the time the letter is posted. To tax the fees charged to overseas postal organisations would be against the intention of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, since consumption occurs outside New Zealand. Under current law, the provider of overseas mail delivery services in New Zealand cannot zero-rate the fees charged to overseas postal organisations. This means the delivery of overseas mail is treated differently from the delivery of other goods and services entering New Zealand. This amendment aligns the legislation with the correct policy treatment of fees charged for overseas mail delivery services in New Zealand. This policy, until recently, had been to zero-rate these fees. 64 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE STUDENT LOAN SCHEME ACT 1992 (Clauses 111-114) Summary of proposed amendments The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to: • Ensure that the terminal repayments of borrowers with a tax agent will be due at the same time as their terminal income tax. This amendment follows that made to the Income Tax Act 1994 earlier this year which extended the terminal tax due date for taxpayers with an agent who has an extension of time arrangement by two months. • Correct two drafting errors made in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act (No. 2) 1998 in relation to the interest write-off and refund provisions. Application date The amendment to the payment dates will apply from the 1997-98 income year. The corrections will apply from the original application dates of the relevant legislation.

An estimated 600,000 people - including children, custodians and liable parents - are directly affected by the workings of the scheme. 1 Given this scale, it is particularly important that the child support laws operate effectively and fairly. Child support is generally an amount determined by a formula set out in the Child Support Act 1991, or agreed to by the parents concerned. In addition to collecting this child support, Inland Revenue may also collect child maintenance determined by a court in another country. Inland Revenue also collects spousal maintenance for about 600 people under the child support scheme. Spousal maintenance is a payment between two parties that may be awarded by the courts or arranged by a private agreement, for the benefit of the recipient rather than her or his children. A person does not have to have children to receive spousal maintenance, and someone with children may receive both spousal maintenance and child support. The child support scheme was the subject of a major review by the Child Support Review 1994 Working Party. Most of the operational recommendations put forward by the working party have already been implemented. Administering the child support scheme Most of the amendments in this bill are the result of a recent review of the administration of the child support scheme to improve its efficiency. They take up, and in some cases build upon, a number of the recommendations of the 1994 review. These amendments have been designed to solve a series of practical problems that impede the smooth functioning of the scheme. Inland Revenue is to be allowed greater discretion to write off penalties, a measure designed to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme. From 2001-02 the child support year is to begin in July, rather than April. This change, together with recently enacted tax simplification measures, will allow most liable parents’ assessments to be based on their previous year’s income rather than their income of two years earlier. 1 “Custodian” may include a person entitled to receive spousal maintenance, “child support” may include spousal maintenance, and “liable parent” may include a person who is required to pay spousal maintenance. 2 Then there are the liable parents who choose to estimate their income for the current year. Two types of problems emerge here: • Some liable parents fail to furnish their tax return to enable an end-of-year square up to be carried out; or • if they have already paid their full year’s child support by the time they estimate their income, the law says they must continue to pay the minimum amount - $10.00 a week - for the rest of the year. The amendments in this bill deal with these and associated problems. Problems related to liable parents who are in hospital or in prison long-term are also dealt with, increasing both the fairness and efficiency of the law. Other administrative measures allow greater flexibility in matters such as notices of assessment, refunds of child support, salary deductions, payments to custodians’ bank accounts, and when the person entitled to child support and/or spousal maintenance takes over responsibility for collection of the debt. New Zealand/Australia reciprocal agreement The bill contains minor amendments to the Child Support Act in anticipation of a reciprocal agreement with Australia that will enable the two countries to collect each other’s child support debt. Taxable income The bill also corrects an anomaly that arises when a liable parent is not a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. In this situation the liable parent is usually assessed at only the minimum amount of $520 for the year. The change will allow overseas taxable income to be included in the liable parent’s child support assessment. The amendments The bill amends the Child Support Act 1991, and all unspecified section references in this commentary are to that Act. The only other Act of Parliament amended by the bill is the Family Proceedings Act 1980. 3 WRITE-OFF OF PENALTIES (Clause 27) Summary of proposed amendments Penalties will be written off when: • Liable parents keep to debt repayment arrangements entered into within three months of when Inland Revenue first assessed their liability. • An initial penalty is more than the arrears to which it relates and the liable parent concerned has no history of late payments. Additional provisions will allow Inland Revenue the discretion to write off penalties when, under the circumstances, it would be unjust or unreasonable to charge penalties. These measures are expected to encourage voluntary compliance with the child support law by giving Inland Revenue greater flexibility to write off penalties, particularly when the liability first arises. 2 Background When payments of child support are late, the law imposes an initial penalty of 10% (or a minimum of $5) of the unpaid amount, and 2% on the outstanding balance (including penalties) every subsequent month. At present, Inland Revenue can write off late payment penalties only when: • The late payment arises through the failure of an employer or other third party to make a deduction. • A liable parent keeps to an agreed arrangement to repay a debt on which incremental penalties have been incurred, in which case only the incremental penalties may be written off. Penalising a compliant liable parent for a small failure may be counter-productive and actually reduce voluntary compliance. For example, it takes about six weeks to process an application for child support, because of the many steps involved. Liability begins from the date of application for payment, so liable parents may face a first payment that is the equivalent of two or three months of payments. Often they cannot meet this first payment and go into arrears, which attracts penalties. 2 These changes also apply to spousal maintenance. 4 Key features Penalties will be written off when liable parents keep to debt repayment arrangements they entered into within three months of when the assessment for their first payment was issued, and when an initial penalty is greater than the arrears to which it relates and the liable parent has no history of late payments. Inland Revenue will be able to exercise discretion in considering whether a penalty should be written off when: • The liable parent had reasonable cause for the delay in payment, and took corrective action as soon as possible. “Reasonable cause” will be defined to include events such as a serious illness. • In failing to pay on time, the liable parent had acted in good faith on the advice of an Inland Revenue officer, and that advice proved to be incorrect. • The delay in payment was due to an honest oversight by a liable parent who has no history of previous late payment and who paid the debt as soon as he or she became aware of the oversight. • The person entitled to child support has taken over responsibility for collecting the debt and it would be unfair or unreasonable to enforce collection of the remaining penalty. The first three changes are consistent with the new compliance and penalties legislation that came into effect on 1 April 1997, and recognise that the circumstances leading to a late payment are not always entirely within the control of the liable parent. In those situations it is often neither reasonable nor just to impose a penalty. The proposed amendments will allow Inland Revenue to accommodate these circumstances, and it will publish guidelines to ensure consistent application of the provisions. The fourth change arose from a recommendation of the Child Support Review 1994 Working Party. The changes will have no adverse effect on custodians entitled to child support because the penalties that are collected are retained to offset the costs of enforcing payment. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. 5 INCOME YEAR OF ASSESSMENT AND INFLATION FACTOR (Clauses 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 23, 26, 36, 37 and 38) Summary of proposed amendments The changes are designed to achieve a closer match between the income on which an assessment is based and the current ability of a liable parent to provide financial support. They involve changing the child support year so that, from the 2001-02 year, it will begin in July rather than in April. Recently enacted tax simplification measures will provide Inland Revenue with earlier income information. All these changes will enable Inland Revenue to base the assessments of about 75% of liable parents, those who have income tax deducted from their wages, salaries or benefits, on their income for the year ending on the 31 March before the start of the child support year. Other liable parents, those who do not have all their income tax deducted at source, will also move to a child support year that begins on 1 July, but will continue to have their assessments based on their income of two years earlier. An inflation factor will be added to the income of this group to bring them into line, as closely as possible, with the rest. For both groups there will be a transitional period covering 1 April to 30 June 2001. Background One of the objects of the Child Support Act is that liable parents provide for their children according to their capacity to provide financial support. By law, child support is based on income earned by a liable parent two years earlier, because that is the most recent income information available to Inland Revenue when the assessment is made. The law also provides for annual consideration of an inflation factor to be based on average wage movements. It has proved impracticable to comply with that aspect of the legislation, however, because Inland Revenue does not receive annual wage movement information in time for its annual issue of child support assessments. The tax simplification initiatives contained in the Taxation (Simplification and other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 mean that Inland Revenue will receive income information from employers earlier than it does at present. 6 Key features The bill proposes that the child support year will run from 1 July to 30 June (rather than the present year of 1 April to 31 March). This will allow child support assessments to be based on income for the tax year ending on the 31 March before the start of the child support year. This measure will enable the child support assessments of liable parents who are employees and beneficiaries to be based on their income for the year ending on the 31 March before the start of the child support year. Other liable parents will continue to have their child support assessments based on their income of two years earlier. An inflation factor will be added to the income of this group to bring them into line, as closely as possible, with those whose assessments are based on the previous year’s income. The inflation factor will be based on the average of actual headline inflation determined by the Consumer Price Index over the year ending on the 31 March before the start of the child support year. Because the bill specifies how the inflation factor is to be set, the existing provision allowing an inflation factor to be set by an Order in Council is no longer required and will be repealed. The amendments will require a transitional period from 1 April to 30 June 2001. Child support liability for the transitional period will be one-quarter of the previous year’s final liability. Application date The amendments will apply from the child support year beginning in 2001. 7 ESTIMATION OF INCOME (Clauses 9-17, 25 and 30) Summary of proposed amendments The provisions governing the estimation of income for child support purposes are being amended to make them fairer and easier to use. The changes: • allow reconciliation assessments to be issued when liable parents who have estimated their income fail to furnish tax returns; • stop those liable parents from estimating their income again until they furnish their outstanding returns; • cap child support at what would have been payable had income not been estimated; • ensure that those who estimate their income part-way through the year will not have to continue paying the minimum amount of $10 a week when the amount they have already paid covers their liability for the year; • provide for the state to waive its entitlement if the preceding change results in a custodian moving on to a social welfare benefit; • provide that when liable parents revoke an estimation or no longer meet the criteria for estimating income, their liability will revert to what it would have been had they not estimated, with the resulting shortfall being spread over the rest of the year; • make it no longer necessary that an application to estimate income be in the “approved form”; • remove the child support use of money provisions. Background The rules on estimating income in the Child Support Act arose because of the need to use income earned two years earlier as the basis of assessment. They were designed to give relief to liable parents whose current income has fallen by at least 15% from that on which their assessment is based. In this situation, they may ask for a new assessment based on an estimate of their income. Liable parents who estimate their income part-way through the year may have already paid sufficient to cover their total estimated liability for the year. Despite this, they are still required to pay the minimum amount of $10 per week. This can result in custodians receiving too much child support. Liable parents may revoke their estimation, but their liability for that year is still based on actual income. (The end of year square-up, or reconciliation, is discussed below.) 8 After the end of the child support year, a liable parent who has estimated his or her income must file a tax return to enable an end-of-year reconciliation to be made. A further payment is required if the liable parent has underestimated the year’s income, and an underestimation penalty may be charged. If an overpayment occurs because the liable parent overestimated his or her income, the overpayment is offset against any future liability, or refunded when there is no continuing liability. Custodians are disadvantaged when liable parents who estimate their income fail to file income tax returns, because Inland Revenue cannot reconcile estimated and actual income to ensure custodians have been paid the correct amount. The current law requires liable parents to fill in a prescribed form if they want to estimate their income. Many liable parents make a written request to do this but must still complete a form as well, which causes delays and creates paperwork. The law allows for use of money interest to be charged when child support is underpaid, in recognition of the monetary benefit gained by a liable parent through having the use of the unpaid child support. The primary intention of the use of money interest provisions in the Child Support Act was to give liable parents an incentive to file an income tax return so their correct child support liability could be determined. Return filing is now partially enforced through the recently introduced late filing fee. Furthermore, the proposal in this bill to issue reconciliation assessments when liable parents fail to file returns will limit the period over which interest would be calculated. No use of money interest rate has been set since the 1993-94 child support year. The Child Support Review 1994 Working Party considered that the estimation of income provisions should be made simpler, fairer and easier to understand. Key features The amendments in this bill are intended to make the income estimation provisions fairer and easier to use. To overcome the problem of liable parents not filing their tax returns so an end-of- year reconciliation can be carried out, the proposed amendments allow Inland Revenue to issue a reconciliation assessment for the amount that a liable parent would have had to pay had he or she not estimated. Furthermore, these liable parents will be prevented from estimating their income again until they have filed their outstanding tax return(s). To ensure that liable parents who estimate their income and do file their income tax returns are not disadvantaged by the change outlined in the previous paragraph, all liable parents will have their liability capped at the amount they would have had to pay had they not estimated their income. 9 Liable parents who estimate their income part-way through the year may have already paid sufficient to cover their total estimated liability for the year. In this situation, they will no longer have to continue paying the minimum amount, $10.00 a week. As a result of child support payments ceasing, some custodians may have to go on a social welfare benefit for the rest of the year. If this happens the state will waive its entitlement to retain any of the child support for that period so that the custodian does not incur a child support debt. When liable parents revoke their estimation, or when they no longer meet the threshold for estimating income, their child support liability will revert to what would have been payable had they not estimated. The amendments will allow the resulting shortfall to be spread over the rest of the child support year, which means that by the end of the year they will have met their child support liability in full, and there will be no need for a reconciliation assessment. It will no longer be necessary for liable parents to complete an “approved form” to make an estimation. The provisions imposing interest on underpaid child support will be removed from the Act. They were put there to encourage liable parents to file their income tax returns, but the law now sets penalties for not filing a tax return, and this bill introduces further consequences for liable parents who do not file returns. Application date Most of the amendments are to apply from the date of enactment, although some changes will apply as follows: • From the 1999-2000 child support year, liable parents will no longer have to continue paying the minimum amount when, at the time they estimate their income, the amount they have already paid exceeds their annual estimated liability. The amendments to the provisions relating to revocation of estimations and write-off of custodians’ debts will also apply from that year. • The repeal of the provision for use of money interest on underestimation of income, and the corresponding objection rights, are to apply from the 1998-99 child support year. • The amendment setting a maximum liability when liable parents choose to estimate their income is to apply from the 2000-01 child support year. 10 EXEMPTIONS FOR LONG-TERM PRISONERS, HOSPITAL PATIENTS (Clauses 19, 20, 21 and 22) Summary of proposed amendments Exemptions from paying child support will: • cover the full period of a liable parent’s imprisonment or hospitalisation if more than 13 weeks; and • be extended to long-term hospital patients who are on a reduced social welfare benefit, and patients in private hospitals and residential care institutions. The income criteria, which are used to determine whether an exemption may be granted, will be calculated on a weekly basis for liable parents who are in prison or hospital for more than 13 weeks but less than the full child support year. 3 Background The minimum child support liability is $10 a week, but some long-term prison inmates and hospital patients are exempted from paying this in recognition of their limited opportunity for earning income. Under current law, prisoners and hospital patients generally receive an exemption only if they are in prison or hospital for the full child support year; they do not receive it for part years. The exemption is not available to patients in private hospitals or people in residential care. Nor is it available to long-term patients in public hospitals who are social welfare beneficiaries, even though the combination of the reduced benefit and automatic child support deduction leaves them with only $16.98 a week from which to meet all their personal needs. To qualify for the exemption the liable parent must have no income for the child support year or, if the income is solely from investments, it must not exceed $520 gross. This means that liable parents may be required to pay a full year’s child support even if they are released from hospital or prison in the last few weeks of the child support year and their only income after release is a social welfare benefit. 3 These changes also apply to spousal maintenance. 11 Key features Exemptions from child support liability will be available for the liable parent’s full period of imprisonment or hospitalisation if longer than 13 weeks, and he or she meets the income criteria. The income will be calculated on a weekly basis when a period of hospitalisation or imprisonment is more than 13 weeks but less than a full child support year. Liable parents will be exempted from paying child support if their gross income from investments during their period of hospitalisation or imprisonment averages less than $10 a week, and they have no other gross income during that period. The exemptions will also be extended to include long-term hospital patients whose sole income is a reduced social welfare benefit and those who are in private hospitals and residential care institutions. As a result, the bill amends the definition of “hospital patient” in the Child Support Act, in keeping with the change in the Health Reforms (Transitional Provisions) Act 1993. Similarly, references to “net” income will be amended to “gross” to make the Child Support Act consistent with the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. Liable parents who are granted an exemption from child support will no longer need to reapply for the exemption at the beginning of each new child support year. Application date The amendments to the definition of “hospital patient” and the substitution of “gross” for “net” income are to apply from the date of enactment. The remaining amendments are to apply from the 1999-2000 child support year. 12 NOTICES OF ASSESSMENT FOR CHILD SUPPORT (Clauses 24 and 28) Summary of proposed amendments The changes are intended to allow more flexibility in the content of the notices of assessment that Inland Revenue issues to liable parents. They also allow the department not to issue a new notice of assessment when the amount of child support to be paid does not change as a result of a reassessment. This means that notices of assessment do not need to contain irrelevant information, and they will be issued only when there is a change in the amount of child support to be paid. 4 A further minor amendment ensures that liable parents are notified of their right to apply for an administrative determination. Background The Child Support Act is specific as to the content of notices of assessment issued. Some of this content is inappropriate and unnecessary in certain circumstances. For instance, when the notice relates to a court order or spousal maintenance, information relating to annual and monthly rates, income or the living allowance may be irrelevant. Under the present law, when there is a change in a liable parent’s circumstances that leads to a reassessment of the parent’s liability but does not result in a change in the amount payable, Inland Revenue must still issue a notice of assessment to the parent. This means that liable parents may receive notices that contain no new information. Key features The amendments will provide flexibility so that the content of notices of assessment can be varied to suit the particular circumstances to which they relate. This will mean that unnecessary or irrelevant information can be omitted. Inland Revenue will also be able to refrain from issuing a notice of assessment to a liable parent when the amount of child support payable does not change as a result of a reassessment. Even so, all liable parents will continue to receive at least one notice of assessment for each child support year in which they have a liability. A further minor amendment will ensure that notices of assessment include the right to apply for an administrative determination when liable parents believe they have grounds for departure from the formula assessment. This change was overlooked when the administrative determination provisions were introduced in 1994. Application date The amendments are to apply from the date of enactment. 4 These changes also apply to spousal maintenance. 13 REFUNDS (Clause 34) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments remove the requirement that applications for refunds of excess child support must be in writing, and allow Inland Revenue to refund excess child support without a prior application in some circumstances. This will speed up refunds and reduce paperwork. 5 Background The current requirement for applications for refunds to be in writing delays those refunds and creates unnecessary double handling and paperwork. A number of final credits are held on Inland Revenue’s child support data base. Key features The amendments will allow requests for refunds to be made either verbally or in writing. This is consistent with Inland Revenue’s general policy to encourage greater use of the telephone in contacts with the department. When Inland Revenue is satisfied that the liable parent is not in arrears and has no known future liability, it will be able to refund excess child support without a prior application. If the available final credit is less than $5 and no request for a refund has been received after 12 months from when that credit arose, it will be transferred to the liable parent’s tax account. Application date The amendments are to apply from the date of enactment. 5 These changes also apply to spousal maintenance. 14 DEDUCTIONS OF CHILD SUPPORT FROM WAGES AND SALARIES (Clauses 31 and 32) Summary of proposed amendments Liable parents will be able to choose to have more than 40 percent in child support deducted from a single wage or salary source when they have more than one employer or source of income. This will simplify their paying arrangements. Employers will be able to deduct child support according to the pay period under which they operate. 6 Background Liable parents may have more than one source of income. For example, they may hold down two jobs, or work part-time and receive a social welfare benefit. Under current law, their child support may have to be deducted from more than one source, even though they may prefer there to be a single deduction. The legislation protects liable parents from unreasonable deductions by providing that such deductions cannot reduce salary and wages by more than 40 percent. This amount is calculated on a weekly basis. Administrative practice has been to allow employers to calculate the maximum deduction according to the pay period under which they operate. Key features The main amendment will allow liable parents who, in accordance with the law, must have deductions made from more than one income source to choose to have the whole amount taken from only one of those sources. The maximum deduction from all sources is not to exceed 40 percent of their after-tax income. Another amendment allows employers to make child support deductions according to the pay period they operate under, whether fortnightly or monthly, and is a compliance cost saving measure for them. The amendment merely legislates for existing practice. Application date The amendments are to apply from the date of enactment. 6 These changes also apply to spousal maintenance. 15 “UPLIFT” OF DEBT AND FUTURE ENTITLEMENT (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendments At present, custodians who are not social welfare beneficiaries may withdraw from the child support scheme and take over responsibility for collecting current arrears of spousal maintenance and/or child support. The amendment allows them to take over future entitlement also. A further amendment allows social welfare beneficiaries who are entitled to spousal maintenance to take over responsibility for collecting both arrears and any future entitlement. (Social welfare beneficiaries cannot take over responsibility for collecting child support because it is generally retained by the state to meet the cost of the benefit provided.) Background When child support and/or spousal maintenance is in arrears, non-beneficiary custodians are able to take responsibility for collection (uplift the debt) themselves. However, custodians who withdraw from the scheme must wait until the final amount of entitlement is in arrears before they can uplift that debt. The state retains child support received for beneficiary custodians but they are entitled to receive spousal maintenance payments. However, they are unable to take over responsibility for collecting spousal maintenance in arrears. This problem arises because the provisions use the term “financial support”, which includes “spousal maintenance”. The intention of the legislation was to prevent beneficiary custodians from uplifting only their child support, which is retained by the state. Key features Non-beneficiary custodians who choose to withdraw from the child support scheme but are entitled to a final payment of child support and/or spousal maintenance for the period up to the date they withdraw will be able to take responsibility for collection of that final amount themselves. They will not need to wait until it becomes a debt. Beneficiary custodians who are entitled to spousal maintenance will be able to take over responsibility for collecting both past debts and future entitlement. These will be voluntary choices. Application date The amendments are to apply from the date of enactment. 16 CUSTODIANS’ BANK ACCOUNTS (Clauses 4, 18 and 29) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will preserve the administrative efficiency of requiring payments to be direct-credited to a bank account but achieve more flexibility by allowing custodians to choose any account for payments. To eliminate unnecessary delay in the start of child support, processing of an application will not be delayed because a custodian has failed to provide details of the bank account to which payments are to be made. Background An application for child support must be “properly made”. This includes providing details of the custodian’s bank account. These details are not essential to begin processing a child support application, however, particularly when the custodian is a social welfare beneficiary. Delaying the acceptance of an application delays the start date of entitlement and deprives either non-beneficiary custodians or the state of revenue. The requirement that a bank account must be in the custodian’s name was intended to ensure that payment went to the sole or principal provider of continuing daily care for the child(ren), but in practice has proved to be too inflexible. Key features The requirements in the Child Support Act for an application to be “properly made” will be amended so that processing an application will not be delayed because a custodian has not given Inland Revenue details of his or her bank account. Custodians who wish to have their child support paid to an account in, say, their child’s name, or an account held by a budget advisor, will be able to choose to do so. Application date The amendments are to apply from the date of enactment. 17 OVERSEAS TAXABLE INCOME (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will be able to include overseas taxable income in the child support assessment base of a liable parent. This will ensure that assessments more accurately reflect that parent’s ability to pay child support. Background Under present law, child support is based on income that is taxable in New Zealand for the income year two years before the child support year. This means that liable parents who leave New Zealand, and cease to be resident for income tax purposes, can be assessed under the child support formula for only the minimum amount of $520 a year once that previous income year does not contain income that is taxable in New Zealand. As a result, the amount of child support payable often bears no relation to the capacity of the liable parent to contribute to the support of his or her children. Key features Inland Revenue is to be given the discretion to include income that is taxable outside New Zealand in the child support assessment base when a liable parent is not resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. (Any overseas income should already be included in the parent’s tax return if he or she is resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes.) Application date The amendment will apply from the 1999-2000 child support year. 18 RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA (Clauses 35 and 39) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments are in anticipation of a reciprocal agreement for the collection of child support and spousal maintenance being entered into with Australia. The changes allow for small debits arising from exchange fluctuations to be written off and exclude the operation, between New Zealand and Australia, of the United Nations Convention for the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance. Background New Zealand and Australia are in the process of negotiating a reciprocal agreement for the enforcement of collection of child support and spousal maintenance. The agreement itself will be given effect in New Zealand by an Order in Council, although a small change is required to the Child Support Act 1991. There is also a consequential amendment to the Family Proceedings Act 1980. Key features In anticipation of a reciprocal agreement being entered into between New Zealand and Australia for the enforcement of collection of child support and spousal maintenance, the following changes are being made to the Child Support Act 1991: • Provision is being made to allow annual debits arising from exchange fluctuations of up to $20 to be written off. • The Family Proceedings Act 1980 is being amended so that, once the agreement comes into effect, people residing in New Zealand or Australia will not be able to seek maintenance using the United Nations Convention for the Recovery of Maintenance Abroad. Application date The amendment to the Family Proceedings Act 1980 will be given effect by the Order in Council that gives effect to the reciprocal agreement. The small debit write-off provision will apply from the date of enactment.

Under the present tax return filing system, many employees are required to file an annual IR5 tax return showing income received throughout the year and rebates claimed. About 1.2 million taxpayers file an IR 5 return each year. Employers have related responsibilities, including furnishing an annual reconciliation to balance the PAYE deductions they have made during the year. About 200,000 reconciliations are filed each year. The following amendments will remove these obligations: • Inland Revenue will create income statements from the information supplied by employers and send automatically an income statement to: -certain people with a student loan; -those who receive, or are entitled to receive, family assistance; and -those who have had the PAYE or resident withholding tax (RWT) rules applied incorrectly. Income statements will be pre-printed with taxpayers’ wage and salary information and related details. Consequential amendments are being made to child support, family assistance and the student loan scheme to allow use of income statements and the information they contain for purposes of administering these schemes. • A new employer monthly schedule will combine all information currently provided by employers to Inland Revenue on a simple form. Large employers will be required to provide information electronically, and small employers will be encouraged to do so. The monthly schedules will be used to identify employees’ invalid IRD numbers and incorrect use of tax codes. • Taxpayers claiming donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates will complete a new annual rebate claim form. The extra-pay rebate is being repealed. 4 A number of supporting amendments improve the accuracy of the PAYE system, removing the need to reconcile deductions by means of tax returns: • A simplified employee declaration form will replace the IR 12 and IR 13 tax deduction certificates, to be completed only when employees start work or change their tax code. • Easier tax codes are proposed to help employees select the correct PAYE code for use during the year. • The PAYE non-declaration rate for taxpayers who do not give employers their tax code and/or IRD number will be increased from 33% to 45% from 1 April 1999. • In relation to those receiving income tested welfare benefits, the requirement to provide an IRD number will be tightened, although an exemption will be provided in cases of sickness, injury or disability. A matching provision is proposed to prevent cessation of a benefit payment if a beneficiary has failed to provide an IRD number. • The tax codes for special circumstances will be removed. This will affect employees currently using the casual agricultural worker, the shearer and shed- hand codes. The election day worker code will be retained but increased to equate with the middle effective marginal tax rate. Other amendments improve the accuracy of the resident withholding tax rules and various social policy measures administered through the tax system: • Taxpayers will be able to elect a new 33% RWT rate. • The non-declaration rate for taxpayers who do not give their bank their IRD number will increase from 33% to 45% with effect from 1 April 2000. • Resident withholding tax (RWT) certificates issued by banks will contain a statement reminding taxpayers that they need to request an income statement if insufficient tax has been deducted. • Inland Revenue will allocate IRD numbers to children in relation to whom social policy claims are made. This will help ensure the correct provision of the various social policy measures applied through the tax system. • Overpayments of family assistance will be recovered from the current year’s entitlement. • Refunds exceeding $50 must be requested by taxpayers who receive income statements. 5 A number of additional minor amendments are also being made. Section references in this commentary are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise specified. Application date The PAYE related amendments will take effect from 1 April 1999. The measures relating to income statements will result in the last IR 5 returns being filed for the income year ending 31 March 1999. The first income statements will be issued in late May 2000. The family support amendments will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 2000. Key features Employer monthly schedule introduced Employers will be required to provide Inland Revenue with monthly schedules detailing each employee’s salary and wage income and deductions such as PAYE, student loan repayments, child support payments and certain other information. They must also fill in a remittance certificate that summarises the schedule and provides required employer details. The employer monthly schedule process involves: • combining in one schedule all employee information now provided by employers on multiple forms; • providing earnings and deduction information at an individual employee level; and • removing the current year-end reconciliation undertaken by employers, which will remove the need for the production and distribution of over 4 million tax deduction certificates a year, as well as the completion of 200,000 annual reconciliation forms. Employers who use manual payroll systems will be required to copy information already contained in their wage books onto the employer monthly schedule. Employers who pay PAYE to Inland Revenue twice monthly will be required to provide information electronically, although a limited exemption is provided if this would cause undue compliance costs. 6 Improved accuracy of PAYE system Reduction in return filing is significantly dependent on the accuracy of the PAYE system. Therefore various supporting measures, such as clearer tax codes to make it easier for taxpayers to select the correct PAYE code, are being introduced. Inland Revenue will use the information provided by the monthly employer schedule to ensure the correct tax code is being applied and that taxpayers are receiving the correct amount of social assistance for that year. If an employee does not correct an incorrect tax code the Inland Revenue will have the authority to do so. The non-declaration rate applying to wages and salaries will be increased from 33% to 45%. This rate will apply when employees do not provide their IRD number or choose a tax code. The proposal to improve the accuracy of the PAYE system through introduction of a cumulative PAYE system, as put forward in last year’s Government discussion paper, has not proceeded because of the associated compliance costs highlighted in the submissions received. Improved accuracy of RWT system Taxpayers will have the option of selecting a 33% RWT rate. This option allows those with income over $38,000 to choose a RWT rate that matches their marginal tax rate. This measure will apply from 1 April 1999. A supporting measure, the introduction of a new 45% non-declaration rate, will apply from 1 April 2000. Income statements introduced A new Part IIIA introduces income statements, to replace the annual IR 5 return. At present, Inland Revenue issues 1.45 million IR 5 returns each year, of which 1.2 million are completed and returned. Income statements will be sent mainly to people who have a student loan, or receive family assistance or are entitled to receive it. Income statements will also be sent to taxpayers who have had the PAYE rules applied incorrectly or had their tax under- deducted as a result of using inappropriate tax codes. All wage and salary earners will have the right to request an income statement if one is not issued to them automatically. Taxpayers who do not receive an income statement from Inland Revenue will be obliged to request one if they do not meet the non-filing criteria. About 300,000 people are expected to receive income statements automatically, with another 300,000 taxpayers voluntarily requesting one to receive a tax refund. The obligation will remain on taxpayers to report untaxed income. 7 Individual return filing (IR 3 returns) Taxpayers who earn income that does not have tax deducted at source, such as business or rental income, will be required to complete an individual income tax return. Those who earn wage, salary, interest and dividend income but have something out of the ordinary, such as a loss or foreign-sourced interest or dividends, will also be required to file a tax return. Rebates A separate rebate claim form will remove from the return assessment process the housekeeper-childcare and donations rebates. The existing maximum and minimum claim thresholds will continue to apply. The proposal provides a process for delivering these rebates independently of the tax system and will also apply to individual return filers (IR 3). The rebate claim form will be completed by taxpayers after the end of the income year and be due no later than 30 September. The amount of donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates will be limited, as at present, to the extent of a taxpayer’s taxable income. Because the information contained on the income statement may be provided after a taxpayer fills in a rebate claim form, the basis of eligibility for a rebate will be the previous year’s income. The extra-pay rebate will be repealed with effect from the income year beginning 1 April 1999. Social policy measures The bill provides for the allocation of IRD numbers to children in relation to whom family assistance or child support is being claimed. It also provides that income statement information may be used in determining entitlement for social policy measures administered through the tax system. This will remove the current need for taxpayers to provide income information which is also used for income tax purposes. To help provide equity between those who correctly estimate their entitlement to family assistance and those whose family assistance is overpaid, overpayments in relation to a prior income year will be recoverable from the current year’s entitlement. The information received from the employer monthly schedule will also allow Inland Revenue to monitor taxpayer income and identify possible overpayments and underpayments of family assistance. Recovery from current year payments of family assistance will not occur if the result would be serious hardship. 8 Background The last decade has seen several major reforms of the tax system and its administration. They have included, for example, a number of measures to simplify tax obligations; the first stages of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994 to make it easier to use; the introduction of binding rulings to increase taxpayer certainty of the tax treatment of future business transactions; and the introduction of clear standards of compliance and consistent penalties for failure to meet those standards. At the same time, the tax administration itself has been modernised through increased use of electronic technology and a new, taxpayer-orientated organisational structure for Inland Revenue. These developments have provided a base for the simplification measures proposed in this bill. In turn, enacting the proposals will have a major influence on the volume and types of services the tax administration undertakes in the future. For instance, freeing Inland Revenue from the processing of millions of tax returns will allow the department to upgrade its technology and provide better services to all taxpayers. The Government recognises that the new system of reduced tax return filing will be particularly critical for employers, who are fundamental to the success of the reform and whose compliance costs may increase temporarily during the transition. For this reason, Inland Revenue plans to work closely with employers during the transition. The proposals described in this commentary were first put forward in December 1997, in the Government discussion paper Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements. 9 INCOME STATEMENTS (Clauses 3-5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23-28, 33, 38, 52, 57, 74, 78, 81, 85-87, 89-93) Individuals not required to file a return or receive an income statement Section 33A is being replaced with a new section which redefines those individuals who will not have to file a tax return. The new section also excludes certain individuals from being issued an income statement. The individuals affected are those who do not derive income from sources other than from employment, which is subject to PAYE, and interest and dividends, which are subject to RWT. This is because the changes proposed to the existing withholding rules result in these rules being sufficiently accurate so as to allow certain individuals to avoid an end-of-year income tax square-up. New section 33A (1) excludes individuals who do not receive more than $200 of gross income that has had tax deducted incorrectly from the obligation to file a return or receive an income statement. This $200 threshold will prevent unnecessary compliance and administrative costs in situations where minor errors have occurred. To avoid the obligation to file a return or receive an income statement, individuals, or their spouses, must also meet other criteria. They must not have been issued with a family certificate of entitlement for any part of the income year or received a family credit (under section KD 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994) for which abatement is required. Furthermore, they must not have a student loan balance. Taxpayers who meet these criteria and do not receive an income statement must request one. This is because the withholding rules cannot accurately account for the fact that they are subject to various social policy measures administered through the tax system. Individuals required to file a return New section 33A (2) and (3) specifies those individuals who are required to file returns of income. They must file a return because the complexity of their affairs requires an end-of-year square-up. For instance, the following “natural persons” will have to file a return: absentees, non-cash basis holders and those who received a withholding payment. Natural persons who are subject to section 44, have made a net loss for that income year, or have an available net loss to offset against their net income must also file a return. New section 33A (4) states that unless the new section 80D applies, Inland Revenue is not permitted to issue an income statement to individuals referred to in section 33A (1). 10 FIGURE 1: TAXPAYERS WHO ARE TO BE ISSUED AN INCOME STATEMENT New section 33A (5) states that Inland Revenue must issue an income statement to all individuals to whom sections 33A (1) and (2) do not apply if they have not been issued with one by the appropriate date. Persons required to receive income statements The new Part IIIA, containing sections 80A to 80I, details the requirements regarding income statements. Income statements are being introduced to allow an end-of-year income tax square-up if the withholding rules do not deal with certain complexities or an individual is subject to various social policy measures administered through the tax system. Section 80A lists those taxpayers to whom Part IIIA applies. They include taxpayers not exempted from the obligation to be issued with an income statement in section 33A (1) and taxpayers who are required to file a return of income in section 33A (2). The section also applies to those who have requested an income statement. Section 80B requires individuals to notify Inland Revenue if they have received an income statement but should not have. This notification must either be before 7 February or before their terminal tax date, depending on whether section NC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies. Has the taxpayer requested an income statement? Is the taxpayer subject to section 33A (5)? Has Inland Revenue used discretion available under section 80D (2)? NO NO NO Inland Revenue does not issue taxpayer with an income statement Inland Revenue issues taxpayer with an income statement YES YES YES 11 Section 80C requires taxpayers to notify Inland Revenue if they are required to be issued with an income statement but do not receive one. This notification must be either before 7 February or before their terminal tax date, depending on whether section NC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies. Section 80D imposes an obligation on Inland Revenue to issue income statements to all appropriate individuals identified in Part IIIA. It also provides authority for Inland Revenue to issue income statements to individuals to whom this part would not otherwise apply. It also allows for Inland Revenue to issue more than one statement to a taxpayer for a given income year and provides that an income statement issued under this section must contain the details set out under section 80E. Particulars to be included in income statements Section 80E lists the details that are to be included in all income statements issued under Part IIIA. These details include the amount of income from employment, interest or dividends along with the amount of any tax deducted from that income when this information is available. The source of any such income, the amount of earner premium deducted, and a calculation of the income tax liability of the person concerned, including any tax payable or refund due, will also be included on an income statement if appropriate. Taxpayer obligations and assessment on receipt of income statement Section 80F outlines the obligations on Inland Revenue and individual taxpayers once an income statement has been issued. This section stipulates that unless total income from employment, interest or dividends not included on an income statement is less than $200, individuals are required to notify Inland Revenue that the information on the income statement is incorrect. They are then required to supply Inland Revenue with the information they consider to be correct. For individuals to whom section NC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies, information they consider to be correct must be supplied by the later of 7 February in the next income year or 30 days after the date of issue of the income statement. For individuals to whom the section does not apply, correct information must be supplied by the later of the terminal tax date or 30 days after the issue of the income statement. These dates are used because they provide taxpayers with sufficient time to reply to Inland Revenue once an income statement has been issued. If all of the information provided by a taxpayer under section 80F (1) is considered to be correct by Inland Revenue, another income statement incorporating this information must be issued. This provides confirmation that the information supplied by the taxpayer was regarded as correct. 12 If Inland Revenue considers that some, or all, of the information supplied by an individual under section 80F (1) is incorrect, it either issues another income statement incorporating the information which it considers correct or an assessment. The option of issuing an assessment rather than another income statement enables the dispute resolution process to begin. FIGURE 2: INLAND REVENUE AND TAXPAYER OBLIGATIONS AFTER AN INCOME STATEMENT IS ISSUED YES NO Inland Revenue issues an income statement to a taxpayer. Does the taxpayer consider the income statement is correct (or is it incorrect but error relates to less than $200 of gross annual income)? Does taxpayer provide Inland Revenue with information to correct income statement? Does Inland Revenue accept all the information provided by the taxpayer as correct? Income statement is deemed to be a return of income under section 80G and an assessment under section 80H. Inland Revenue issues a new income statement that incorporates the information provided by the taxpayer. Does Inland Revenue issue taxpayer with an assessment that incorporates any information it considers correct? Dispute resolution process is initiated. YES NO YES YES NO NO 13 Income statement deemed return of income and general assessment Sections 80G and 80H allow for an income statement to be deemed a return of income and a general assessment. This is necessary because numerous provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 refer to returns of income and general assessments. Therefore, for the proposed amendments to function correctly, these provisions are required. If an income statement is either accepted by a taxpayer as being correct, or not accepted as being correct but the taxpayer does not respond in the manner prescribed in section 80F, the income statement is deemed to be a return of income. Section 80H states that an income statement is deemed to be a return of income under section 80G and will also be deemed to be a general assessment. Unless an income statement indicates that a small refund is due, it becomes a general assessment on the earlier of 7 February or a taxpayer’s terminal tax date, depending on whether section NC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies. If a refund of less than $50 is due, an income statement becomes a general assessment on the earlier of the date on which the taxpayer requests a refund, or 30 days after the date of issue of the income statement. This allows taxpayers adequate time to consider whether the income statement is correct and, if not, provide Inland Revenue with any information they consider necessary to correct the income statement. Once assessed the refund will be issued automatically. If an income statement is issued either immediately before 7 February or a taxpayer’s terminal tax date, it is desirable to allow that individual adequate time to provide Inland Revenue with any necessary corrections. Therefore if an income statement is issued less than two months before the aforementioned dates, the taxpayer will have two months before that income statement becomes a general assessment. Supporting amendments Two further supporting amendments are to be made: • A new section 106 (1A) is to be inserted. This allows an assessment to be made for an amount of tax that Inland Revenue considers ought to be imposed, when an income statement that Inland Revenue considers to be incorrect or incomplete is issued to a taxpayer. • A new section 108 (1A) is to be inserted. This stipulates that, unless section 108 (2) or section 108B applies, an income statement cannot be issued four years after the end of the income year which follows the income year to which the income statement would apply. • A new section 184A providing that refunds must be made electronically unless it would cause undue hardship to a taxpayer or is not practicable. This provision applies from 1 April 1997. These amendments extend current regulations relating to returns of income to the income statements replacing these returns. 14 Certificate of earnings A further feature of the proposed changes is the introduction of a certificate of earnings. This is a supporting administrative measure and thus no legislative authority is required. Employees will be able to request a “certificate of earnings” as a record of their income for the year. This is being introduced because of the changes to employers’ data filing requirements. Along with the advent of the employer monthly schedule and the removal of the requirement on employers to undertake end-of-year reconciliations, employers will no longer be required to provide IR 12 and IR 13 tax deduction certificates. Therefore, because Inland Revenue will possess all the necessary information, it will be able to provide employees with a record of their annual gross employment income. A certificate of earnings will detail an individual’s wage and salary income and PAYE deductions but, unlike income statements, will not show any tax calculations and will not be deemed to become a return of income or general assessment. 15 THE REBATE CLAIM FORM (Clauses 3, 15, 38, 50, 51, 53) Eligibility rules The existing eligibility rules, which include the maximum rebate entitlements, remain unchanged. Receipts will continue to be required for donation rebates but not for housekeeper-childcare rebate claims. Present legislation limits rebates which may be claimed to the amount of tax payable in any given year. The new section 41A limits the amount of gross payments upon which rebates could be claimed to taxable income in the preceding income year. Limiting the rebates claimed to the previous year’s taxable income is necessary because of the change incurred from moving from tax returns to income statements. Otherwise taxpayers would not necessarily know their tax positions without tax returns, and the taxable income information for the current year would be unlikely to be available before the rebate was claimed. Limiting the allowable rebates to the previous year’s taxable income also applies to individual return filers. Rebate claim form The current legislation allows salary and wage earners to claim rebates on an annual tax return. From 1 April 1999 annual tax returns for salary and wage earners will no longer exist. The new section 41A allows individual taxpayers to claim rebates without completing a tax return through the medium of a rebate claim form. Claiming rebates through a tax return has no link with one’s income tax position, so at present taxpayers must incur the compliance costs associated with completing a tax return or checking an income statement merely to claim a rebate. Taxpayers may apply for one or more refunds of qualifying payments (under section KC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994) or gifts (under section KC 5) by using the rebate claim form. The rebate claim form will take effect from 1 April 1999, although taxpayers will not be able to claim rebates relating to the 1999-2000 income year until 1 April 2000. All rebate claim forms for an income year must be filed by 30 September of the following income year. The rebate claim form will be used by all individuals who are eligible to claim rebates, including those who will still be required to file a annual return of income. 16 Rebate claim notice When a rebate claim form has been processed by Inland Revenue, the new section 41A requires Inland Revenue to issue a rebate claim notice which will inform the taxpayer of the amount of donation or housekeeper-childcare rebates allowed and the amount of the refund allowed, which will be deposited into the taxpayer’s nominated bank account. FIGURE 3: THE REBATE CLAIM PROCESS In June 2000 a taxpayer completes a rebate claim form claiming donations of $600 and housekeeper-childcare costs of $1,000 for the income year ended 2000, from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. The entitlement is based on taxable income for the year ended 31 March 1999. 2000 Notice of Refund - 2000 In this example, the taxpayer has claimed $200 of a $500 maximum donations claim and the maximum $310 housekeeper-childcare rebate. Because Inland Revenue has received a claim for the 2000 income year, it will issue a blank rebate claim form automatically in the year 2001. 17 Refundable credits The new section 41A requires that any refunds allowed under sections KC 4 or KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 must be paid to the taxpayer as if they were tax paid in excess. This links into the new section 184A, which requires that any refund of tax paid in excess must be made by electronic means to a bank account nominated by the taxpayer. Direct crediting refunds minimises compliance costs for taxpayers (saving them the expense of banking a cheque) and decreases administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Nevertheless, it may sometimes be necessary to issue a refund by cheque, so subsection (3) of section 184A allows for an exemption to this rule if a taxpayer experiences undue hardship complying with section 184A. Issuing refunds manually will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Section KC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to allow refunds for housekeeper-childcare rebates to be made only if section 41A is complied with. To comply with section 41A, taxpayers will need to complete the rebate claim form as prescribed by Inland Revenue. The form has to show the correct details of rebates being claimed, along with receipts (if required), and be signed by the taxpayer. Section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to allow refunds for gifts of money to be made only if section 41A is complied with. Extra pay rebate The extra pay rebate compensates taxpayers for loss, in an annual assessment, of the rebates allowed in any extra pay-period or periods. The rebate is available to employees who receive more than 52 weekly full and regular pays in an income year. Granting this rebate is discretionary under present law. The extra pay rebate will be removed by amending section NC 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994, repealing the provision from income year commencing 1 April 1999. The current form of the extra pay rebate cannot be successfully incorporated into the income statement without placing high compliance costs on employers and individual taxpayers. Under the existing system, employers enter the number of pays employees receive during a year on their tax deduction certificate. The new legislation will remove the existence of the tax deduction certificate, thus removing the avenue of communication to Inland Revenue as to which employees received an extra pay. Removal of the extra pay rebate also corrects an administrative inconsistency because this is the only rebate that is discretionary. 18 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE PAYE SYSTEM (Clauses 3, 21, 22, 54, 59, 60, 70, 83) Tax codes Section NC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended to provide new tax codes that are simple and self-explanatory. The significant changes to the tax codes are set out in Table 1. TABLE 1: PROPOSED TAX CODES New CodeDescriptionEquivalent present code MMain source of income. Only one job can have this code. G M SL Main source of income with a student loan. Only one job can have this code. G ED MLMain source of income if annual taxable income is less than $9,880 a year from all sources. To use this code the employee must work full-time (more than 20 hours per week). T SSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is less than $38,000. SEC SHSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is higher than $38,000. S SLSecondary source of income if taxpayer’s annual taxable income is less than $38,000 and he or she has a student loan. SEC ED SH SLSecondary sources of income if annual taxable income is higher than $38,000 and he or she has a student loan. STC 99Special tax code rate issued by Inland Revenue (99 indicates the special tax code rate in cents per dollar). IR 23 The fundamental change for employees is that those currently using the G tax code will now use the M tax code and employees currently using the G ED tax code will now use the M SL tax code. 19 Inland Revenue research indicates that about 9% of PAYE errors arise through the use of incorrect tax codes. This results in an average end-of-year debt of approximately $215 for employees using the wrong tax codes. Selecting the correct tax code reduces the need for employees to “square-up” any end-of-year tax, which will result in significant compliance cost and administrative savings. Changing the tax codes to make them clear will assist employees to choose the correct tax code the first time. Employees using the incorrect tax codes The new section NC 12A of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows Inland Revenue to inform employers that employees are using incorrect tax codes. An employer who receives notification of the correct tax code must apply that tax code to source deduction payments on behalf of the employee. Tax codes amended by Inland Revenue Department will cease to apply from the last day of the year in which it notified the employer of the correct tax code. Employees can advise their employers of a change in tax codes by using the employee declaration form. Employee declaration form Section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended to eliminate tax deduction certificates, which at present inform the employer as to an employee’s tax code. An alternative source of information is the employee declaration form, which is linked to section NC 8 of the same Act. The purpose of this form is for employees to make a formal declaration of their name, address, IRD number and tax code. Employees will be required to complete the employee declaration form only when their tax code changes. Tax codes for special circumstances Section NC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to omit tax codes used for the following special employment types: • casual agricultural workers; • shearers; and • shed hands. The benefit of using special tax rates for these employment types has declined with the recent reductions in income tax rates. The rates for special tax codes have not been reviewed recently, so it is possible that in many cases more PAYE is being deducted than would be under the standard PAYE rules. Replacing tax codes for special employment types with clearer standard tax codes will reduce under-deduction and over-deduction of PAYE in these areas and will also reduce administrative and compliance costs. 20 The special tax code for election day workers (EDW) is to be retained because removing it would create considerable compliance costs for the Chief Electoral Office and local bodies. However, the deduction rate for election workers will be changed from 20% to 21%, and clause 7B of Schedule 19 is being amended to reflect this change. The change to a 21% deduction rate will bring this tax code into line with the middle effective marginal tax rate. Non-declaration rate Clause (2) of Schedule 19 is to be amended to include the new non-declaration rate of 45% where section NC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies, with effect from 1 April 1999. The increase to 45% will allow for sufficient deductions to be made when taxpayers do not provide a correct IRD number and have social policy responsibilities, or their total income exceeds the top tax rate threshold of $38,000. Income Support exemption from applying the new non-declaration rate The Social Security Act 1964 requires Income Support to pay beneficiaries a net rate of benefit. This net rate of benefit cannot be reduced. If Income Support were to apply the 45% non-declaration rate, its PAYE liability would increase but the net benefit would not alter. This could result in some beneficiaries requesting an income statement and claiming the additional PAYE back, which effectively increases their net benefit. Similar problems arise with the taxation of student allowances, which New Zealand Income Support will administer from 1 January 1999. On this basis, the proposed legislation exempts Income Support from applying the non-declaration rate of 45% to income-tested benefits and student allowances. Change in requirements for beneficiaries to supply Income Support with an IRD number Income Support will be exempted from applying the non-declaration rate of 45%, although the provisions for beneficiaries providing a correct IRD number to Income Support are being tightened. The current exemption requires beneficiaries to provide their IRD number within four weeks of applying for a benefit or being asked for their IRD number. If the IRD number is not provided, the Director-General of Social Welfare may refuse to grant or suspend the benefit applied for until the information is supplied. 21 New section 10AA is being added to the Social Security Act 1964. This section places an obligation on applicants for welfare benefits to provide evidence of a correct IRD number. The IRD number must be provided to the Director-General within ten working days after the date of application for the benefit or the date that the Director- General requests the IRD number. The Director-General may decline or suspend an application for a benefit if an applicant’s IRD number is not received within the ten working day limit. An exemption is given under subsection (6) of this section which exempts beneficiaries in cases of sickness, injury or disability from providing their IRD number within the ten-working day period. Exchange of IRD number information between Inland Revenue and Income Support The new section 82A authorises the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Welfare to ensure the correct IRD numbers of beneficiaries are supplied to prevent cessation or suspension of benefit payments. This section will be applicable only after section 10AA of the Social Security Act 1964 has failed. Subsection (5) of section 82A states that if a beneficiary is identified, Inland Revenue may supply the IRD number of the beneficiary to a person authorised under the new paragraph (n) of section 81 (4). Paragraph (n) refers to a person who is an officer, employee or agent of the Department of Social Welfare. 22 EMPLOYER PAYE OBLIGATIONS (Clauses 3, 9-12, 17-19, 29-32, 34, 36, 55, 56, 61-64, 67) The employer monthly schedule Section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to provide for employer monthly schedules to replace the existing PAYE returns (IR 66N or 66W). The employer monthly schedule will contain the following information (as defined in section OB 1 of the same Act) that must be filed monthly: • name and IRD number of each employee; • the tax code of an employee; • the amount of gross earnings, total amount of tax deductions, and amount of earnings not liable to the earner premium for each employee; • particulars of child support and student loan deductions; • if employees started or stopped work in that month; and • indication as to the employees where the tax deducted from an extra emolument is at a rate less than 33%. Section NC 15 (1) (a) is being amended to allow for twice monthly filers to continue to make payment for source deduction payments, child support deductions and student loan deductions made in the first PAYE period by the 20th of the month in which the deductions were made. The requirement to provide the details (outlined in the definition of “employer monthly schedule” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) pertaining to that period will be removed. Employers will be required to provide a remittance certificate that provides only the total amounts of tax deductions, child support deductions and student loan deductions made in the first PAYE period. The details of all individuals’ deductions made in a particular month (outlined in the definition of “employer monthly schedule” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) will be required by the 5th of the following month, along with payment for twice monthly filers. Current monthly filers will continue to provide the employer monthly schedule and payment in full by the 20th of the month following the month in which the deductions were made. 23 24 Elimination of tax deduction certificates Employers’ obligation to retain tax deduction certificates is also being removed from section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This removes the need for employers to send a copy of the tax deduction certificate to employees and file the tax deduction certificates with the PAYE reconciliation (IR 68P). The new return filing process Figure 5 illustrates the current and proposed filing requirements for employers. FIGURE 5: THE CURRENT AND PROPOSED SYSTEM The new process will differ for employers operating a manual payroll system and those operating a computer payroll system. Employers to continue to file an ACC employer premium reconciliation statement (IR 68A) Section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to remove the reference to employers having the obligation to file an ACC employer premium reconciliation statement. This obligation will still exist for employers, but will now be found in the amended regulation 3 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992. 25 Regulation 12 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992 will be revoked and replaced with a regulation that places a obligation on employers to provide ACC employer premium statements by the 15th of the second month after the month an employer ceases or disposes of a business. Payment of employer premium must also be made by this date. Electronic filing The new section 36A makes electronic filing of the employer monthly schedule by employers compulsory, and the data must be transmitted in a prescribed electronic format, except for those employers who are exempt under the new section 36B. Subsection (2) of section 36A gives employers the option of transmitting the remittance certificate in an electronic format. Employers who choose to transmit it electronically must do so in a format prescribed by Inland Revenue. The exemptions outlined in section 36B relate to employers who have accounting systems that are incapable of providing the employer monthly schedule in an electronic format. Compliance costs and the number of employees are factors that will be taken into consideration in determining if an employer can electronically transmit the employer monthly schedule. Section 36B (2) (c) and (d) states that an exemption from filing the employer monthly schedule electronically will be given only to employers of 100 or fewer employees. This exemption will decrease to 50 employees from 1 April 2000. The new section 36C states that information required to be furnished electronically must be in a prescribed electronic format that is certified by Inland Revenue. Subsection (2) applies to employer monthly schedules, forms and returns that are furnished in an electronic format. It will suffice for Inland Revenue to produce a printed copy of a specification of an electronic format in a court of law as evidence that an electronic format was prescribed. Penalty for not filing electronically The new section 139AA imposes a filing penalty on employers who are required to file employer monthly schedules in a prescribed electronic format and who fail to do so. This section does not apply to employers who are exempted from filing the schedule in a prescribed format under section 36B (1). The penalty is the greater of $250 or $1 for each person employed at any time during the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates. Late filing penalties Section 139A is being amended to make the employer monthly schedule liable for the late filing penalty from 1 April 1999. 26 Subsection (4) of this section sets the penalty for late filing of an employer monthly schedule at $250. The amended portion before paragraph (a) in subsection (5) excludes Inland Revenue from notifying the employer of its intention to impose a late filing penalty for the employer monthly schedule. Income Support and ACC exemption from providing all information required to be included on the employer monthly schedule Because welfare beneficiaries and ACC claimants are considered to be employees under the law, Income Support and the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation (ACC) will have to complete employer monthly schedules for beneficiaries and claimants. Given the number of people required to be covered by these schedules, it is necessary to grant these two entities a deferral of their obligation to file employer monthly schedules in relation to the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. These organisations will be required to file one annual employer schedule on or before 5 April 2000. Any further deferral would delay issuing tax refunds and family assistance. As a result, section 46 will be amended as follows: • Income Support will not have to provide dates of when beneficiaries began or stopped receiving a benefit until 5 April 2000. • Income Support will not have to provide family assistance information for beneficiaries receiving a benefit until 5 April 2000. • The ACC is exempted from providing this information as regards claimants until the same date. The exemption is not extended to staff members of these organisations. Non-resident employees Section NC 18 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being replaced by a new subsection (2) which relates to non-resident employees. It provides that if Inland Revenue accepts a bond or other security from an employer in relation to an employee, the employer must not make tax deductions under the PAYE rules; include the employee’s details in an employer monthly schedule; or apply the non-declaration rate to that employee. 27 CHANGES TO THE RWT SYSTEM (Clauses 6, 65, 66, 69) Deduction rates for RWT From 1 July 1998 RWT will be deducted from interest income at the rate of 19.5%. This has implications for taxpayers with income over $38,000 who receive interest income, because they will have their interest under-deducted at the rate of 13.5 cents in the dollar. The present system encourages taxpayers whose income is over $38,000 not to provide their IRD number to financial institutions so that the current non-declaration rate of 33% is applied to their interest, and the correct amount of tax is deducted. Even so, Inland Revenue still requires the IRD number of each taxpayer for income matching purposes, regardless of whether RWT is being deducted at the correct rate. To encourage people to use the correct withholding rate and to provide their IRD number, new section NF 2A of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being introduced, and Schedule 14 is being amended to allow taxpayers to choose to use a 33% withholding rate (as specified by the new section NF 2A). If they do not choose to use the 33% rate, the default rate of 19.5% will apply, as outlined in clause 1(c) of Schedule 14. Changes to the non-declaration rate Clause 1 (a) of Schedule 14 increases the non-declaration rate for not providing an IRD number to a financial institution from 33 cents to 45 cents, from 1 April 2000. RWT certificates RWT certificates will still be required to contain details of an account holder’s total gross interest and the resident withholding tax deducted. Section 25 (6) is being amended to include the extra information required on the RWT certificates. The main changes are found in paragraph (c), which requires that the IRD number of the recipient be printed on the certificate, if it is known to the payer. Adding paragraph (c) merely formalises what currently occurs. The second major change to the RWT certificate involves placing an obligation upon financial institutions to provide a statement on the certificate that states that taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue if insufficient tax has been deducted from their interest. Other Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 31 THIN CAPITALISATION (Clauses 43-45) Summary of proposed amendments Three remedial amendments are being made to the thin capitalisation rules: • The rules for determining the New Zealand parent of a company controlled only by virtue of the “controlled by any other means whatsoever” test are clarified. • The on-lending concession is extended to include certain loans to associated persons. • Certain interest expense that is deductible other than under the general interest deductibility rules in section DD 1(b) is brought within the ambit of the rules. The amendments address areas of the rules where the original policy intent has not been effected. Application date The amendments apply from the start of the 1998-99 income year. Key features • New section FG 4(11) clarifies the rules for determining a taxpayer’s New Zealand parent if the taxpayer is subject to the thin capitalisation rules only by virtue of the “controlled by any other means whatsoever” test. • Section FG 6 is amended to allow the on-lending concession to apply to funds on- lent to an associated person at an arm’s length consideration, provided the associated person is subject to the thin capitalisation rules and is not a member of the taxpayer’s New Zealand group. • Section FG 9 is amended to include interest expense deductible under sections DD 3, DI 1(1)(a) or (b) and DL 1(3)(c) within the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules. Background The thin capitalisation rules were enacted in December 1995, and apply to taxpayers controlled by a single non-resident person. The rules limit the amount of interest deduction available to the taxpayer if its New Zealand group has an excessive level of debt relative to the worldwide group of which it is a member. 32 Detailed analysis Three remedial amendments are being made to the thin capitalisation rules. The amendments address areas of the rules where the original policy intent has not been effected. Determination of taxpayer’s New Zealand group A deficiency in the rules for identifying a taxpayer’s New Zealand group has been identified in relation to companies that are subject to the thin capitalisation rules only because of the catch-all control test in section FG 2(1)(b)(ii) – “controlled by any other means whatsoever”. The problem is illustrated in the diagram on the left. In principle, Controlled Co should be the New Zealand Parent in relation to Sub Co 1 and Sub Co 2, because it is the highest company in the chain of companies to which Sub Co 1 and Sub Co 2 belong. However, because there is not a non-resident person with a 50% or greater ownership interest in Controlled Co, the rules in section FG 4(10) inappropriately identify each of the three New Zealand companies to be their own New Zealand Parent. As a consequence, the three companies can determine their New Zealand group independently in a way that minimises the effect of the thin capitalisation rules. For example, if Sub Co 2 is thinly capitalised (say 100% debt) while the other two companies are not (say 50% debt), the other two companies will exclude Sub Co 2 from their New Zealand group, to ensure that no denial of interest expense will occur. By contrast, Sub Co 2 will include the other two companies in its New Zealand group, as the consolidated debt percentage will then be less that 100%, reducing the extent to which the thin capitalisation rules will apply. An amendment is being made to explicitly identify the top-tier New Zealand company in a chain of companies “controlled” by a single non-resident “by any other means whatsoever” as the New Zealand Parent in relation to the lower-tier companies. On-lending concession The on-lending concession in section FG 6 currently does not apply to funds on-lent to an associated person resident in New Zealand. This creates an anomaly if the associated company is also subject to the thin capitalisation rules but is not a member of the company’s New Zealand group. This can result in the same amount of debt being subject to the thin capitalisation rules in two separate companies, with a potential double denial of interest expense. Controlled Co Sub Co 1 Sub Co 2 Non-resident 100% 100% < 50% Control by other means 33 The effect can be illustrated by the following example. Finance Co and Operating Co are both 100% owned by the same non-resident shareholder. Under the thin capitalisation rules, the two companies can form separate New Zealand groups. Finance Co Non-resident Operating Co Loan $1m 100%100% Loan $1m Assets $1m Assuming that the equity in each of the companies is negligible, Finance Co will be treated as having debt of $1m and assets of $1m (the loan to Operating Co). Operating Co will similarly be treated as having debt of $1m and assets of $1m. When viewed as a whole, however, the reality is that the two companies have consolidated debt of only $1m and consolidated assets of $1m. By not allowing the on-lending concession to apply for Finance Co, the thin capitalisation rules create the potential for a deduction to be denied twice on what is, in essence, a single amount of debt. An amendment is being made to section FG 6 to permit the on-lending concession to apply in the situation above, subject to the funds being on-lent at an arm’s length consideration. The arm’s length requirement has been included to counter situations such as the following: Finance CoAssociated Co Loan $1m 2% interest Loan $1m 10% interest Low debt percentage High debt percentage If an arm’s length requirement did not exist, Finance Co, as the only company in its New Zealand group, could be structured to utilise the on-lending concession to generate a low debt percentage while having a large interest deduction (the 8% net interest paid on the $1m loan). Associated Co, also as the only company in its New Zealand group, may be subject to a denial of a deduction for interest expense under section FG 8, but the amount denied would be far lower than if Finance Co and Associated Co performed consolidated calculations (because of the artificially low 2% interest rate). Introducing the arm’s length consideration requirement prevents the amendment to section FG 6 from being used to manipulate the tax base. 34 Interest expense brought within ambit of rules The thin capitalisation rules currently apply only to interest expense allowed as a deduction under the general interest deductibility rules in section DD 1(b) and, by extension, under section FG 9, specified leases. The thin capitalisation rules are intended to focus on the amount of debt in New Zealand on which an interest deduction is allowed. In principle, therefore, interest deductible other than under the general interest deductibility rules in section DD 1(b) should also be included within the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules. Its omission was not intended when the thin capitalisation rules were enacted. An amendment is being made to include the following debt and interest expense within the ambit of the rules: • funds borrowed to purchase shares in amalgamating companies; • deductions of building societies; and • money borrowed and applied as capital in a forestry business. 35 GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS (Clauses 42 and 47) Summary of proposed amendment Superannuation funds will be removed from the “designated sources” of group investment funds. Distributions from group investment funds to superannuation funds will no longer be subject to trust taxation. Instead they will be subject to the same tax treatment as distributions from companies and unit trusts. This ensures greater neutrality between investment by superannuation funds into different investment vehicles and neutrality across commercial investments in group investment funds. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1999. Key features Superannuations funds will be removed from the “designated sources” of a group investment fund in section HE 2 (3). The effect is that investment by superannuation funds will be treated the same as all other investments in a group investment fund that are subject to company taxation: • Distributions will be treated as dividends. The share repurchase rules will apply to determine the portion of the distribution that is capital and therefore, excluded from the definition of dividends. Any imputation credits attached to income distributed will prevent double taxation. • Group investment funds that are not listed are currently included within the definition of unlisted trusts, so will have access to both the slice rule and the ordering rule for determining whether part of the distribution is from capital. Listed group investment funds will have access to the ordering rule only. • Transitional rules will provide that group investment funds may elect to apply the slice rule to interests of a superannuation fund as at 1 April 1999. Background Group investment funds (GIFs) were originally established so that trustee companies, which were managing many (often small) trusts and estates could manage them more effectively by pooling those investments in a manner similar to the Common Fund of the Public Trustee. 36 GIFs involved in commercial activities are collective investment vehicles that are similar to unit trusts, although they are subject to separate tax rules. GIFs are taxed under a dual regime, with distributions of earnings from their trustee activities taxed under rules applying to other trustees, and distributions of earnings from their commercial activities taxed under the rules applying to companies and unit trusts. The income of a GIF that is generated from investment by a superannuation fund is currently subject to trust taxation because superannuation funds are “designated sources” for the purposes of the GIF rules in section HE 2 (3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This means all distributions from GIFs (except beneficiary income) to investors that are superannuation funds are exempt from tax. Superannuation funds holding investments on revenue account can effectively convert revenue account holdings to capital holdings by investing in “passive” group investment funds. Passive or indexed funds are funds that match a market index. These funds are not taxable on gains made on the disposition of investments, as they are not in the business of dealing in shares. The tax advantage superannuation funds are gaining by investing in passive GIFs is not what the tax exemption for investments in group investment funds by designated sources was intended for. It is arguable that removing superannuation funds from designated sources should have occurred along with the 1989 changes to superannuation taxation. With the advent of the “taxed, taxed, exempt” system, the potential for double taxation, which was a major policy reason behind the inclusion of superannuation funds in designated sources, was eliminated. Under the “taxed, taxed, exempt” system, contributions to superannuation funds are made out of taxed income and there is no deduction for such contributions. The earnings of superannuation funds are taxed, and all distributions from superannuation funds, whether lump sums or pensions, are exempt. 37 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND TAX PAID BEFORE 1 APRIL 1998 (Clause 56) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment prevents a superannuation fund or life office from crediting to its tax credit account any imputation credits received from wholly-owned entities that relate to tax paid before the introduction of the proposed tax credit system (TCS), which is in legislation before Parliament. The amendment applies to the imputation credits held by the subsidiary at 31 March 1998. The tax credit system was never intended to apply to tax paid before the introduction of the system. This amendment confirms the policy intent of the proposed tax credit system, and closes a potential revenue loophole that could arise when it is enacted. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1998 to coincide with the start of the tax credit system. Key features Section MJ 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended so that superannuation funds and life offices may not credit certain imputation credits received directly or indirectly from wholly-owned entities to their tax credit accounts. These are imputation credits that relate to tax paid by the wholly-owned entities before 1 April 1998. To reduce compliance costs, the provision will apply only when the wholly-owned entity has more than $1 million of imputation credits at 31 March 1998. Background Tax paid and imputation credits received by life insurers and superannuation funds after 1 April 1998 will generate tax credits under the proposed system. If an electing fund receives imputation credits after 1 April 1998 from a wholly-owned entity and the imputation credits relate to tax paid by the entity before the proposed tax credit system applies, the imputation credits should not generate tax credits. This amendment prevents those imputation credits being used to provide tax credits. 38 TAX-FREE ALLOWANCES AND SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEES (Clause 66) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment will be made to remove an anomaly that prevents certain shareholder/employees from receiving tax-free allowances. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1999. Key features The amendment will extend section OB 1's definition of "employee" to include, for the purposes of section CB 12 (the section governing allowances), shareholder/employees who fall within section OB 2(2). Background In certain circumstances, income derived by employees from companies in which they are also shareholders is deemed to be derived other than by way of source deduction payments. The circumstances in which this occurs are listed in section OB 2 (2), and are generally limited to where the income is derived other than by way of regular payments throughout the income year. The legislation is intended to prevent the deferral of income tax revenue, by providing that the income is subject to provisional tax, rather than PAYE. The term "employee" is defined in section OB 1 as "a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment". As a result, shareholder/employees who fall within section OB 2 (2) are not employees for the purposes of the income tax legislation. This means that they are unable to receive tax-free allowances, while the Act also prevents them from claiming deductions for employment related expenditure. The amendment will correct this anomaly. 39 PAYE TAX TREATMENT FOR OFFICE HOLDERS (Clauses 66 and 67) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments will be made to confirm PAYE tax treatment for members of Parliament and judges, and to provide for PAYE tax treatment for elected members of local authorities. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 1999. Key features Section OB 2's definition of "source deduction payment" will be extended to include a payment made to a specified office holder in respect of the activities of a specified office. Section OB 1 will be amended by insertion of a definition of "specified office holder". This definition will include a member of Parliament, a judge or an elected member of a local authority. (The definition describes a judge as a judicial officer whose salary and principal allowances are determined by the Higher Salaries Commission.) This will mean that these persons will be subject to PAYE tax treatment (while still retaining their status as office holders). Background Members of Parliament and judges are already, in practice, subject to PAYE tax treatment. The amendments will codify this existing practice. Elected members of local authorities are subject to withholding tax on remuneration payments. However, in practice, they are not treated in a consistent manner for tax purposes. Some are subject to PAYE tax treatment, others are treated as self- employed for tax purposes, while still others have part of their remuneration treated as subject to PAYE and the balance treated as self-employment income. The amendments will ensure uniformity in tax treatment. Minor Remedial Amendments 43 FORESTRY RIGHTS (Clause 46) Summary of proposed amendments The Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998 amended the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that no tax consequences resulted from the creation of forestry rights to oneself under the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983. However, section GD 1, which provides that if a forestry right is sold, created or granted for inadequate consideration, the market value of the right should be treated as gross income, was overlooked. This omission undermines the intention that no tax consequences should arise. The proposed amendments to section GD 1 will ensure that such tax consequences do not arise. Application date The amendments will apply to rights to take timber created or granted from the start of the 1997-98 income year. 44 LOW INCOME REBATE (Clauses 48 and 49) Summary of proposed amendments For the purposes of calculating the low income rebate, the income of taxpayers who reside in New Zealand for only part of the income year is grossed up to an annual amount. This ensures that individuals on high incomes do not qualify for the low income rebate. At present section KC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 does not provide for the rebate to be reduced relative to the number of days spent in New Zealand. This can overstate the rebate in some cases. The proposed amendments provide that the rebate calculated as a result of grossing up the income will be reduced, relative to the number of days spent in New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply from the start of the 1999-2000 income year. 45 REFUNDS OF STAMP DUTY \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Clause 85) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment reinstates the previous section 68(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, which was repealed in error when the legislation implementing the new taxpayer compliance, penalties and disputes resolution rules was enacted, in 1996. It will reinstate the original intent of the legislation, that the Commissioner can make a refund of overpaid stamp duty only if a written application is made within eight years of the overpayment. Application date The amendment will apply to every transaction liable to stamp duty entered into on or after 1 April 1997. 46 SMALL BALANCE WRITE-OFFS FOR ACC PREMIUMS \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Clause 72) Summary of proposed amendment A proposed amendment to section 132 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 will increase the small balance write-off for ACC premiums from $5 to $20. Therefore amounts of $20 or less owing by persons under the Act can be written off. The amendment ensures that the threshold for small balance write-offs for ACC premiums is the same as for the income tax rules. Application date This amendment will apply from the date of enactment.

Existing tax rules for superannuation and life insurance products levy tax at the fund and life office level at a flat and final rate of 33%. The proposed tax credit system provides a mechanism that, as far as practicable, allows people who save through superannuation fund membership and life insurance policies to pay tax on their earnings from those investments at their correct tax rate. As a result, funds will pay less tax and can credit the benefit to the accounts of savers. Annuity providers will also be able to use the tax credit system. Application date The tax credit system will be available from 1 April 1998. Key features • The tax credit system is designed to provide the mechanism that allows people who save through superannuation fund membership and life insurance policies to pay tax on their return from savings at their correct tax rate. • Policyholders and members (including members who are superannuation funds) will be able to elect to receive tax credits by filing a notice of election to the electing fund. • An electing fund’s income tax liability will be reduced by the amount of refundable credits generated as a result of attributing tax credits. The amount of the refundable credits is the difference between the tax rate the fund pays and the tax rate at which tax credits are attributed to electing savers. • Electing funds will be required to operate a tax credit account. Its purpose is to record which tax paid by the fund belongs to electing savers and non-electing savers and therefore the amount of tax paid that can be attributed to electing savers. • The tax credit account will operate in a manner similar to an imputation credit account. It will record as credits the amount of tax paid by the fund and record as debits the tax paid by the fund on behalf of non-electing savers, tax credits attributed to electing savers, and cash refunds of tax. 4 • Superannuation funds that elect to receive tax credits from another superannuation fund will be able to receive tax credits at different tax rates. • Life insurers and superannuation funds will be able to offer tax credits for their annuities or pension business. • When tax credits are attributed to an electing saver, the amount of the tax credits will be grossed up to determine the amount of the attributed taxable income. • Annuitants and recipients of pensions will be able to elect to receive tax credits by filing an election notice to the annuity provider. By electing to receive tax credits, annuitants will benefit from having the investment income component of their annuity taxed at a lower rate, which should result in a higher annuity payment. • Annuity providers will be required to determine the income component of the annuity or pension for electing savers. This amount will be treated as schedular gross income and taxed at a lower tax rate. The income component calculated for each electing annuitant will be treated as attributed income and the tax paid on that income attributed as tax credits. • The attributed income will be treated as gross income in the hands of the electing saver. As a result, the attributed income will be included in the taxable income of the electing saver and taken into account in providing social assistance for which taxable income is used as a basis for targeting, such as family support. • The attributed tax credit will be treated as an imputation credit in the hands of the electing saver. Background Under current tax rules, income of life offices and superannuation funds is subject to a final tax of 33%. The effective tax rate 1 currently applicable to many scheme members and policyholders is 24% (1997/98 income year), reducing to 21.75% (1998/99 income year) and 21% (1999/2000 and subsequent income years). Hence under the current rules low tax rate savers are over-taxed on their savings through superannuation scheme membership and life insurance policies. The problem arises from the interaction of three factors: • The income of life offices and superannuation funds is not easily attributable to investors each year. • That income is taxed at a proxy flat rate. • That rate does not necessarily match the saver’s effective marginal tax rate. 2 1 Effective tax rate: the income tax rate payable on the last dollar of one’s income, taking into account only the low income rebate. 2 Effective marginal tax rate: The income tax rate payable on the last dollar of one’s income. The calculation of this rate includes the tax-like effect of income targeting of Government transfers occurring outside the tax system (that is, the withdrawal of these transfers as income rises). 5 In response, the Government set up the Working Party on the Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannution Fund Savings to identify and develop suitable policy options to address this problem. The working party identified three options for further Government consideration: • a tax credit system; • a revised rate proxy; and • a qualifying fund regime. The Government decided its preferred option was the tax credit system. In August 1997 the Government released the discussion document The tax credit system: taxing superannuation funds and life office savings through tax credits, which described how a tax credit system might work. The final design of the system reflects the Government’s extensive consultation with the superannuation fund and the life industry. The design incorporates flexible rules which funds may use, in order to reduce their compliance costs. Detailed analysis Superannuation funds and life insurers Funds will continue to be taxed at 33% under the existing rules, but electing funds will receive refundable credits, which will be credited against their income tax liability. Elections The new section LH 2 allows superannuation funds and life offices that pay tax in New Zealand to offer tax credits to their members (including superannuation funds) and policyholders. The new section 78B of the Tax Administration Act requires funds that offer tax credits to their savers to notify Inland Revenue at least five working days before their return due date (ignoring extension of time arrangements) for the first income year tax credits are offered. The notification is valid until it is revoked by the fund. Tax credit account The new subpart MJ sets out the tax credit account rules. Electing funds will be required to maintain a tax credit account (TCA). A fund may operate multiple TCAs, or a TCA may apply to only part of a fund’s business. The fund must notify Inland Revenue whether it proposes to operate multiple TCAs or whether a TCA will apply to only part of the business. If a fund uses multiple TCAs, or a TCA applies to only part of its business, an actuary or the fund’s external auditor must certify which tax payment and liabilities apply to each TCA. The TCA will operate in a similar way to an imputation credit account, with tax payments (including imputation credits received) being credited to the account. 6 Refunds of tax, tax credits attributed to electing savers and the tax paid in relation to non-electing savers will be treated as debits. The TCA will operate on an income year basis. The TCA must not be in debit as at the fund’s balance date. If it is, further income tax is payable, although funds will have 63 days from balance date to pay this further tax without incurring penalties. Life insurers will still be required to maintain an imputation credit account and a policyholder credit account. The amount of any credit in the policyholder credit account that is used to meet the policyholder base income tax liability will be treated as a credit to the TCA. This amount is credited to the TCA on the last day of the life insurer’s income year. Cash refunds of tax at the policyholder level as a result of refundable credits will be debited to the TCA. No continuity of ownership rules will apply to the TCA. The new section MJ 10 inserts a specific rule to deal with arrangements to defeat the intention of the tax credit system. Allocation of income by funds to savers The new section LH 5 allows funds to use one of the following methods to allocate income to all savers in the fund each income year: • change in surrender value; • change in unit price or value; or • a method approved by an actuary or external auditor in accordance with commercially acceptable practices. The method used to allocate income must be used consistently across all savers. The allocated income will be used to calculate the amount of a fund’s estimated income tax liability that is paid in relation to non-electing savers. They will continue to be taxed at 33% at the fund level. The amount of tax paid in relation to them is referred to as the non-electing savers’ debit. This calculation is required by the new sections MJ 4 (superannuation funds) and MJ 7 (life insurers). The fund will have until the date it files its tax return for that year to make this calculation. The amount calculated will be debited to the TCA on the last day of the fund’s income year. The reasons for using “estimated income tax liability” is that the TCA needs to have either a zero or a credit balance as at the end of the fund’s income year. Funds will not have calculated their actual tax liability by this date to ensure that the TCA has a zero or credit balance. By using an estimated income tax liability, the fund should be able to calculate whether any further tax is payable without penalty in the 63-day period. Refundable credits The new sections LH 9 (superannuation funds and life insurers) and LH 15 (second superannuation funds) provide for refundable credits. 7 Electing funds will be able to meet their tax liability by means of refundable credits. Refundable credits arise because the fund pays tax at 33% and the tax credits are attributed to electing savers at 21.75% (1998/99 year) or 21% (1999/2000 and subsequent years). If the refundable credits result in a refund of tax, the actual cash refund is limited to the credit balance in the TCA when the refund is paid. The actual amount refunded must be debited to the TCA when the refund is paid. Attribution of income and tax credits to electing savers The new sections LH 6, LH 7, LH 12 and LH 13 deal with the attribution of tax credits and income to electing savers. An electing fund may at any time attribute tax credits and income to electing savers. An attribution of tax credits and income is deemed to take place on the date specified in the tax credit certificate as the date on which is the notice is sent. The amount of tax credits attributed must be debited to the TCA, and for calculating the fund’s tax payment an attribution can be deemed to be made on the last day of the income year, if made within six months after the end of that income year. Tax credits must be attributed across all electing savers on the same basis that income is allocated to savers. The income attributed to electing savers is calculated by dividing the tax credits attributed to them by either 21.75% (1998/99 year) or 21% (1999/2000 and subsequent years). This ensures that the attributed income has sufficient tax credits to meet the tax liability on that income if the saver is a low tax rate saver. The new section 30C of the Tax Administration Act will require an electing fund to provide savers with a tax credit certificate which shows the amount of attributed income and tax credits and the date on which the certificate was sent. This section will also require a copy of the tax credit certificate sent during a year (1 April to 31 March) to be provided to Inland Revenue by 31 May following the end of that year. Savers Elections The new section LH 3 will allow individual resident savers and superannuation funds to elect whether they wish to receive attributed income and tax credits from electing funds. Electing savers will be required to provide electing funds with their IRD number. Except for that requirement, the proposed legislation does not contain specific rules relating to elections. A saver may revoke an election at any time. It is a matter between savers and funds as to the rules relating to election dates and revocation of elections. If a saver does not provide an IRD number, the election is invalid. 8 Elections by superannuation funds Superannuation funds that invest in other superannuation funds can be electing savers and therefore are able to receive attributed tax credits and income. Section LH 11 allows a superannuation fund to give notice to have tax credits and income attributed at different rates. Under this provision, a superannuation fund can have tax credits and income attributed from another superannuation fund on the following basis: • at 33%; • at 21.75% (1998/99 year) or 21% (1999/00 and subsequent years); or • a mixture of the two rates based on the profile of the investing superannuation fund’s savers. The amount of tax credits attributed from a superannuation fund to another superannuation fund will be recorded as a debit in the attributing fund’s TCA and a credit in the receiving fund’s TCA. Under section MJ 8, the entries to the TCA for the attributing fund (second superannuation fund) will need to differentiate between the tax credits attributed at the different rates so that a refundable credit is claimed only in respect of those tax credits attributed at the lower tax rate. When attributed income and tax credits are derived Section EB 1 will be amended to provide that savers will derive the amount of attributed income and tax credits in the income year in which the tax credit certificate is sent (the date shown on the tax credit certificate). The new section CO 1 provides that attributed income is gross income. Attributed income will be treated as a dividend for the purposes of the low income rebate. Attributed income will be taken into account in providing social assistance for which taxable income is used as the basis for targeting, such as family support, independent family tax credit, student allowances, student loan repayments and child support. Tax credits will be treated as imputation credits. Credits that cannot be used by savers to reduce their income tax liability will be converted to a loss and carried forward to future years. Annuity providers Superannuation funds and life insurers The new section LH 16 will allow life insurers and superannuation funds to offer tax credits in respect of policyholders’ annuities and superannuation fund members’ pensions. Under section LH 18, annuity providers will be able to use one of the following methods to calculate the amount of income to be attributed to an electing annuitant theh 9 each year. Except for the last method, the amount to be attributed each year will be calculated at the time an annuity elects to receive tax credits. The methods are: • a flat percentage split between capital and income components of the annuity if an actuary certifies the split as being reasonable for that policy or group of policies with the same age and gender characteristics; • determining the income component on the basis of the income assumptions that applied when the annuity contract was entered into; or • determining the income component each year on the basis of an actuarial calculation at the end of the income year. The same method must be used each year. When the original income assumptions have been lost, the income to be attributed may be calculated using new income assumptions based on the remaining period of the annuity. The new sections CL 3 and CM 19 and the amendments to section CM 15 deal with the taxation of the income component of the annuity. The sum of the attributed income to electing annuitants will be treated as schedular gross income 3 of the annuity provider and taxed at 21.75% (1998/99 year) and 21% (1999/00 and subsequent years). Hence it will be excluded from the gross income of the life insurer and superannuation fund. Under new section LH 19, the amount of tax paid on this schedular gross income must be attached as tax credits to the attributed income. An annuity provider is not required to maintain a TCA in respect of its annuity business. However, if a superannuation fund maintains one TCA for all of its business, the tax credits attributed to electing annuitants must be debited to the TCA. Tax paid by the annuity provider on annuity income cannot be credited to the life office’s imputation credit account, policyholder credit account or tax credit account. An annuity provider must provide an electing annuitant with a tax credit certificate each year showing the attributed income and the tax credits and the date on which the certificate was sent. A copy of the tax credit certificates sent during any year (1 April to 31 March) must be provided to Inland Revenue by 31 May following the end of that year. Electing annuitants The new section LH 17 will allow annuitants and pensioners to elect to receive attributed income and tax credits from annuity providers. Because the investment income of the annuity will be taxed at a lower tax rate, annuitants should receive a higher annuity payment. 3 Under section BC 3, schedular gross income is treated if it were the only gross income of the taxpayer. 10 The attributed income and tax credits will be treated as gross income of the annuitant and therefore taxable. Tax credits will be treated in the same manner as imputation credits. Electing annuitants will derive the attributed income and tax credits in the income year in which the tax credit certificate is sent. Transitional rules As the tax credit system will apply from 1 April 1998, funds will be able to offer tax credits from that date. A fund must notify Inland Revenue at least five working days before its return due date (ignoring extension of time arrangements) that it has offered tax credits from that date. Except for funds that have a standard balance date, the new sections FB 7, FB 8 and FB 9 will require funds offering tax credits from 1 April 1988 to apportion their taxable income, tax liability, annuity income component and tax payments on the number of days from 1 April 1998 to the end of their income year over the number of days in their income year. Only those tax payments relating to the post-1 April 1998 period will be able to be credited to the TCA. The non-electing savers’ debit will also be calculated using these apportioned amounts. For attributions of tax credits made or deemed to be made by the fund on or before 31 March 1999, the specified tax rate will be 21.75%. For attributions of tax credits made or deemed to be made by the fund on or after 1 April 1999, the specified tax rate will be 21%. Example 1: How the tax credit system works for a superannuation fund X Fund offers tax credits from the beginning of its 1999/2000 income year, 1 April 1999. X Fund is a superannuation fund with ten members, five of whom have elected to receive tax credits. The fund completes its annual financial accounts and tax return on 1 June 2000 and decides to attribute $105 of tax credits to its electing members. The appropriate electing fund tax rate is 21%. The difference between the top rate and this rate is therefore 12%.

Electing member’s taxable income and tax credits An individual member’s share of the allocated income is $100. Using this as a basis for apportioning tax credits to each member means his or her share of the tax credits is as follows: 100 x $105 = $21 500 This means the member’s attributed income is: Tax credits: $21 = $100 Tax rate 0.21 The fund sends a tax credit certificate to the five savers on 1 August 2000. The tax credit certificate specifies the date sent as 1 August 2000. The electing members will be required to return the attributed income and tax credits in their 2000/01 tax return. By 31 May 2001 the fund must provide copies to Inland Revenue of the tax credit certificates issued in the year 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001. 4 Income allocated to non-electing members x Estimated income tax liability: 500 x 330 = $165 Income allocated to all members 1000 5 Refundable credits: Tax credits x Difference in rate:105 x 0.12 = $60 Tax rate 0.21 12 Example 2: How the tax credit system works for a life insurer Y Ltd offer tax credits from the beginning of its 1999/2000 income year, 1 April 1999.

Example 4: How the tax credit system will work for an annuity provider A Ltd offers tax credits from the beginning of its 1999/2000 income year, 1 April 1999. The company has ten annuitants, all of whom elect to receive tax credits. Each annuitant receives an annuity of $1,000. The company determines that the annual income component of each annuity is $400. Taxable income of life office tax base$5,000 Total annuity income on all electing annuitants$4,000 Amount subject to 33%$1,000$ 330 Annuity income (schedular gross income subject to 21%)$4,000$ 840 Tax to pay$1,170 The amount of annuity income attributed to each annuity is also deducted from the policyholder tax base calculation. The tax credits attributed to each annuity are calculated by multiplying the attributed income by the tax rate. Therefore each annuitant’s attributed income is $400, with tax credits of $84. 16 TRADING STOCK TAX REFORM (Clauses 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 24, 33(3) and (4), 38, 43, 44) Summary of proposed amendments The tax treatment of trading stock (or inventory) affects all businesses deriving income from manufacturing or producing goods, or trading in goods. Businesses must include in their tax returns the annual change in the value of their trading stock. At present, that involves applying an amalgam of rules, only some of which are set out in legislation. The remainder are matters of administrative practice or common law. The reforms will clarify the rules, make them more consistent and will measure income more accurately. They aim to improve the coherence of income tax law by codifying the tax rules applying to trading stock, in turn reducing compliance costs. New rules for valuing trading stock were first proposed in a Government discussion document last year. Since then, there has been wide consultation on the proposals and many have been modified to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. The amendments in this bill contain the detail of the reform, which while broadly consistent with the proposals in the discussion document, is now more closely aligned with financial reporting requirements. Application date The amendments will apply from the 1998/99 income year except for the rule that requires members of a wholly-owned group of companies to transfer shares at cost and amendments to the Tax Administration Act. These amendments will apply from the date the legislation is enacted. Key features • Trading stock will be valued at either cost or market selling value (if it is lower than cost). • Cost will be valued using “generally accepted accounting principles” for inventory as they apply to trading stock. This amount will be adjusted for any variance between actual costs incurred and costs budgeted for. • Replacement price and discounted selling price can be used to approximate cost if the methods are used for financial reporting purposes. • Special provisions for obsolete and slow moving stock will be repealed. Transitional measures will be introduced to spread any income arising from repeal of the obsolescence provisions over a three-year period. • The market selling value should allow for obsolescence. Certain direct selling costs may be deducted in calculating market selling value, if they have been taken into account for financial reporting purposes. 17 • There will be simplified rules for “small taxpayers”, who are defined as those with an annual turnover of less than $3 million. For stock valued at cost, small taxpayers will apply the current level of cost absorption to manufactured stock unless they absorb more costs in financial statements. The direct and indirect costs of production currently required to be absorbed are set out in Public Information Bulletin No. 82. Small taxpayers will be able to use market selling value for stock which has a value above cost, if they do so consistently from year to year. • Excepted financial arrangements will be valued at cost only. Transfers of excepted financial arrangements within a wholly-owned group of companies will be deemed to occur at the vendor’s cost. Taxpayers must apply a cost-flow method of assigning costs to excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property. Excepted financial arrangements which are worthless may be valued at nil. Background Despite the central importance of trading stock in calculating income subject to tax, there has been no major legislative review of trading stock rules since their original enactment in the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1939. The trading stock reforms arise out of a review of the current rules by the Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee). This was a Consultative Committee appointed by the Government in December 1989 to hear public submissions on matters concerning the design and implementation of the reforms outlined in the Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital. The Final Report of the Committee was released in 1992. The rules for the valuation of trading stock are currently set out in section EE 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and allow valuation at cost price, market selling value or the price at which it can be replaced. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may agree on a lower value for stock affected by obsolescence or other special circumstances under section EE 1(7). The requirements for cost absorption of manufactured stock and certain formulas for the write-down of trading stock under section EE 1(7) are set out in Public Information Bulletin No. 82. Under the current rules, taxpayers may value their stock at market value to utilise trading losses or foreign tax credits, and they have written down values for obsolete and slow moving stock, using formulas based on the age of the stock. There is no requirement for consistency, so taxpayers may value their stock to achieve the lowest income tax liability possible in any one year. The purpose of the reforms is to ensure taxpayers value their income from trading stock more accurately and consistently. However, the rules must also balance this objective with keeping taxpayers’ compliance costs to a minimum. The discussion document Trading Stock Tax Rules was released on 24 April 1997 to allow further consideration to be given to the practical impact that changes to the trading stock rules will have on taxpayers. In particular, the Government was interested in their comments on the compliance cost aspects of the proposals. The 18 proposals in the discussion document were generally based on the Valabh Committee’s recommendations. Seventy-nine submissions were received on the discussion document from manufacturers, retailers, tax agents and professional associations. The proposals contained in the discussion document have been reviewed and refined in the light of submissions received. Reducing compliance costs for taxpayers has been the major focus, although this has to be weighed against finding a more accurate method of measuring income. Many submissions expressed concern at the lack of simplified rules for small taxpayers required to value trading stock. The broad thrust of the proposals remains unchanged, although much of the detail of the proposed reforms differs from the proposals in the discussion document. The result is that the proposed reforms have moved further away from the recommendations of the Valabh Committee, and have become more closely aligned with Financial Reporting Standard No. 4 Accounting for Inventories (FRS-4). The most significant modification to the proposals is that taxpayers will now not have to incur the compliance costs involved in preparing separate valuations for tax purposes for stock valued at cost. Instead they will use financial reporting standards to value stock at cost for tax. In addition, special rules are now proposed for “small taxpayers”, those with an annual turnover of less than $3 million. They will continue to use the current rules for cost absorption for manufactured stock valued at cost, unless they absorb more costs for financial reporting purposes. There are also more flexible applications of other valuation methods. These and other changes have been made to simplify the rules, reduce compliance costs and increase flexibility so that taxpayers can readily apply the rules to a diverse range of circumstances. Detailed analysis Trading stock tax reform focuses on the rules for valuation of trading stock. The change in the value of trading stock is included in gross income each year by allowing a deduction for the value of opening stock, and bringing into gross income the value of closing stock. Opening stock and closing stock are defined. Compliance standards Trading stock tax reform recognises that taxpayers have different requirements for financial reporting, depending on their size. Most taxpayers are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Act 1993, meaning they must prepare financial statements in accordance with “generally accepted accounting practice”. Exempt companies with an annual turnover of less than $1 million do not have to comply with the Financial Reporting Act. Therefore most taxpayers will incur the compliance costs of preparing financial statements and valuing their inventory for financial reporting purposes. The amendments recognise this and require this group of taxpayers to comply with 19 “generally accepted accounting principles” for closing stock valued at cost. “Generally accepted accounting principles” are defined to mean “generally accepted accounting practice” for inventory, as it applies to trading stock. Smaller taxpayers often prepare accounts primarily for tax purposes. They may not incur the compliance costs of preparing financial reports. There are simplified rules set out for small taxpayers. A threshold of $3 million annual turnover has been set, below which small taxpayer rules apply. This threshold attempts to set a level above which taxpayers will be sophisticated enough to prepare more detailed valuations of their trading stock. In addition, taxpayers with a $3 million or greater turnover are generally required to comply with the Financial Reporting Act. The threshold for small taxpayers applies to the taxpayer and subsidiaries or related entities using the definition of subsidiary provided in the Financial Reporting Act. This definition means a subsidiary within the meaning of the Companies Act 1955 and the Companies Act 1993 and includes entities classified as subsidiaries in any applicable financial reporting standard. Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 8 Accounting for Business Combinations (SSAP-8) contains a definition for an in-substance subsidiary, meaning an entity (other than a subsidiary) which is controlled by another entity. In-substance subsidiaries will be counted in the $3 million turnover threshold for small taxpayers. The rules are divided into two categories: rules for small taxpayers and rules for other taxpayers. If small taxpayers prepare financial statements for financial reporting purposes, they are required to comply with the same rules as for other taxpayers. Valuation methods Closing stock must be valued using a cost valuation method, or when market selling value is less than cost, market selling value may be used. Replacement price and discounted selling price may be used to approximate cost if a taxpayer uses these methods in financial statements. Taxpayers may use one or more valuation methods to value their closing stock. However, it is generally expected that they will apply the same cost valuation method to groups of similar or related items of trading stock. The cost valuation methods used must be consistent with those adopted for financial reporting purposes. The valuation options are similar to the requirement to measure inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value in FRS-4. However, taxpayers are not required to measure whether trading stock has a market selling value less than cost. If they choose to do so, they may value all stock at cost. If stock is valued at net realisable value for financial reporting purposes, taxpayers may use market selling value, if it has a value less than cost, or cost. Small taxpayers may choose to value trading stock using market selling value when this value is above cost, if they do so consistently from year to year. This option will be particularly useful for farmers valuing cash crops. In this situation, the market selling value is easily obtainable, whereas calculating the costs of producing the crop may be a complicated and compliance cost intensive exercise. Excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock will be valued at cost. 20 There is no change to the rules for valuation of livestock. Cost Those taxpayers other than small taxpayers valuing stock at cost must include all costs required by “generally accepted accounting principles”, as defined. This proposal will give effect to the current practice of valuing trading stock for accounting purposes and making adjustments for tax purposes. The rationale is that taxpayers will not have to incur the compliance costs of preparing separate tax valuations. The costs to be included are those of putting trading stock in its present location and condition, which is a requirement of FRS-4. Taxpayers must allocate these costs to closing stock using methods acceptable under “generally accepted accounting principles”. FRS-4 requires separate disclosure of the value of each sub-classification of total inventories classified in a manner appropriate to the entity. The reference in the definition of “generally accepted accounting principles” to “generally accepted accounting practice” means FRS-4 plus the general principles from the Statement of Concepts for General Purpose Financial Reporting. Materiality is one of these general principles. The requirements of FRS-4 are applicable to the extent that they apply to trading stock as defined in tax law. The definition of trading stock for tax purposes is different from the definition of inventories in FRS-4. For example, consumable stores and supplies are included in inventory but are excluded from the definition of trading stock for tax purposes. As the reference to “generally accepted accounting principles” includes materiality, this is incorporated in the tax law. The proposed legislation qualifies it to make clear that materiality must be applied to trading stock separately. It will not be acceptable to exclude material costs from the valuation of trading stock on the basis that these amounts are offset by other amounts included in another part of the financial statements. Taxpayers who comply with FRS-4 in their financial reports will use the amounts adopted for financial reporting purposes for trading stock valued at cost for tax purposes, subject to the adjustment for actual costs if budgets have been used for financial reporting purposes. FRS-4 allows unallocated overheads as a result of low production to be expensed. In addition, variances from standard costs are to be accounted for as revenue or expense when standards have been properly set or maintained. All of these variances must be apportioned between the relative values of the cost of goods sold and closing stock for tax purposes. This approach was recommended by the Valabh Committee because tax valuations at cost should reflect the actual costs incurred in the production process. The apportionment can be done to closing stock on a global basis and is not required to be further apportioned to raw materials, work in progress and finished goods or other sub-classifications of trading stock. For operations with multiple activities or products, variances may be allocated according to a fair and reasonable method of 21 apportionment, such as apportioning based on the value of the stock on hand compared with the value of the cost of goods sold, as demonstrated in Example 2. Example 1: Valuation of manufactured stock at cost Company A is a footwear manufacturer. It started operations in the 1998/99 income year. It manufactures many different sizes of shoes which it sells for the same price. Accordingly, Company A considers itself to be a single product manufacturer and does not differentiate its costs between different sizes of shoes. The factory building for Company A is on a different site from the sales and administrative functions of the company. Company A has incurred the following expenditure in the 1998/99 income year: $ Direct materials1,650,000 Direct labour1,810,000 Indirect materials 445,000 Utilities (heat, light and power) incurred in factory 325,000 Indirect factory labour costs 135,000 Factory plant depreciation 225,000 Factory plant repairs and maintenance 80,000 Factory rent 200,000 Consumables used 190,000 Sales and administrative expenditure 960,000 Consumables on hand 60,000 6,080,000 Company A manufactured 160,000 pairs of shoes during the income year and has 20,000 pairs unsold at balance date. This was in line with budgeted production. Company A had budgeted on total expenditure of $6,000,000 (excluding consumables on hand). Sales and administrative expenditure remained on budget. In other words, Company A incurred an unfavourable budget variance of $20,000 on production. Company A had used standard costs and these had been reviewed regularly and revised to reflect actual costs. The turnover of Company A for the 1998/99 income year was $8,400,000. Cost absorption For financial reporting purposes, Company A absorbs all budgeted production overheads to the extent that they relate to putting the trading stock in its present location and condition. Accordingly, it absorbs direct materials, direct labour, indirect materials, utilities (heat, light and power) incurred in factory, indirect factory labour costs, factory plant depreciation, factory plant repairs and maintenance, factory rent and consumables used. The budgeted total required to be absorbed was $5,040,000 (being actual production costs of $5,060,000 less the unfavourable variance of $20,000). The unfavourable variance can be expensed for financial reporting as 22 Company A had complied with paragraph 5.17 of FRS-4 by revising its standard costs on a regular basis. For tax purposes, Company A would be required under section EE 5(1) to adopt the same level of cost absorption as it does for financial reporting purposes when determining the closing value of its trading stock. It will not absorb the sales and administrative expenditure as it is not required to be absorbed for financial reporting. Calculation of value of closing stock The calculation of the cost of sales and value of closing stock is as follows: FinancialTax ReportingPurposes Purposes $ $ Absorbed costs (per financial statements)5,040,0005,040,000 Add unfavourable budget variance 0 20,000 Divide by actual production (units) 160,000 160,000 Gives cost per unit 31.50 31.625 Cost of sales (140,000 x cost per unit)4,410,0004,427,500 Closing stock (20,000 x cost per unit) 630,000 632,500 Budget variance Section EE 5(3) requires Company A to prorate the unfavourable budget variance between the cost of goods sold and the closing stock. For financial reporting purposes, Company A will be able to add the $20,000 unfavourable budget variance to the cost of sales to get a total of $4,430,000. Consumables Because the level of unexpired portion of the consumable aids ($60,000) is above the $58,000 threshold stated in Determination E10, Company A will be required under section EF 1 to include the $60,000 as gross income and be allowed a deduction for that amount in the 1999/2000 income year. For financial reporting purposes, the $60,000 cost of consumables on hand will be included in inventory. Example 2: Allocation of budget variance across multiple products Company B manufactures children’s toys. During the 1998/99 income year, Company B made three types of toys: X, Y and Z. Whilst Company B had budgeted production costs of $200,000, the actual costs incurred were $240,000. In other words, Company B had an unfavourable budget variance of $40,000. Section EE 5(3) requires Company B to prorate the budget variance between the cost of sales and the goods on hand at balance date. Company B has decided to prorate the variance based on the sales value of the products sold. 23 Sales value Units sold Units on hand Goods sold Goods on hand $ per unit $$ Product X710,0003,50070,00024,500 Product Y812,0002,25096,00018,000 Product Z127,0001,75084,000 21,000 Total250,00063,500 Value of total sold250,000 Value of total on hand 63,500 Allocation proportion 0.2025 (63500) . (63,500 + 250,000) Thus 20.25% of the total variance is to be allocated to closing stock. This means that Company B will absorb $8,100 (20.25% x $40,000) of the budget variance into the value of closing stock. The balance of the variance, being $31,900, is attributable to goods sold. For stock that is separately identifiable, taxpayers have the choice of calculating cost by specific identification or using cost-flow methods of assigning costs. The acceptable cost-flow methods for trading stock are first-in first-out (FIFO) method and weighted average cost method. These methods are consistent with financial reporting requirements. Weighted average cost-flow methods which are acceptable for financial reporting purposes will be acceptable for tax. Cost-flow methods of assigning costs must be used for stock that is not separately identifiable or for excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property. Valuation of joint products and by-products is not expressly referred to in the legislation. Taxpayers should follow the requirements of “generally accepted accounting principles”. Small taxpayers will be required to include the current level of cost absorption, set out in Public Information Bulletin No. 82, for manufactured and produced stock. For stock acquired for resale, taxpayers will be required to include in cost, the purchase price, transport and insurance costs. They may include customs duty. Small taxpayers will be allowed to include a lesser level of costs than other taxpayers because of the compliance costs of requiring a higher level of cost absorption. However, small taxpayers who include more costs for financial reporting purposes or tax purposes should include these additional costs consistently. Small taxpayers are not required to allocate costs to sub-classifications of trading stock. They may allocate all costs to closing stock valued at cost, on a global basis. This approach simplifies cost allocation for small taxpayers and is consistent with the Framework for Differential Reporting. 24 Discounted selling price The discounted selling price method is used by many retailers in line with Inland Revenue policy set out in Public Information Bulletin No. 82. This method is now specifically provided for in the new reforms. The discounted selling price method was contemplated for retailers. However, other taxpayers such as the meat industry use a variation of the method and this is allowed in the new rules if it is used for financial reporting purposes. Taxpayers other than small taxpayers will only be permitted to use the discounted selling price method when they do so for financial reporting purposes. Broadly, the discounted selling price of trading stock is the amount equal to the retail selling price or market selling value of stock, less the gross margin applicable to that stock. Gross profit margins must be calculated for a department or category of stock for retailers and a category of stock for other taxpayers. “Department” and “category” have their ordinary meanings. In the case of the meat industry, a category of stock would be, at a minimum, a species of animal. Therefore, gross profit margins will have to be calculated for sheep, beef, venison and so on. The term “retailer” carries its ordinary meaning. It will also cover stock sold at retail by manufacturers in, for example, “factory” shops. Some small taxpayers will be able to apply a single gross profit margin to all stock on hand at the end of the income year. The gross profit margin will be the overall margin for the business. This method will apply only to taxpayers with a turnover of less than $1 million. Other small taxpayers will use the same methods as other taxpayers for application of discounted selling price. Replacement price Replacement price is predominantly a method for small taxpayers who do not prepare financial statements. It may be used by small taxpayers who prepare financial statements as well as by others if they use it for financial reporting purposes. The method is not expected to be used by many taxpayers other than small taxpayers, since FRS-4 appears to provide for its use only for raw materials. Replacement price is a proxy for cost. It is the purchase price that a taxpayer would pay on balance date. However, if a purchase price is not available on balance date because, for example, the goods are out of season, the last price paid during the income year may be used. Small taxpayers may use the last price paid during the income year under all circumstances. Market selling value The market selling value option may be used when market value is less than cost. Currently, market selling value can also be used when it is greater than cost, which ...................................................................................................... 25 introduces a degree of flexibility that is not desirable. It allows taxpayers to: • use credits that cannot be refunded or carried forward to other income years (such as foreign tax credits); or • soak up losses which might otherwise disappear following a breach of the shareholder continuity requirements. Under the new rules, the starting point for determining the market selling value of finished goods is the gross amount that a taxpayer will normally receive from selling trading stock in the ordinary course of business. For work in progress this amount is reduced by the costs of completing the goods. Market selling value is defined to be exclusive of goods and services tax. Sales in the ordinary course of business will include clearance sales. However, the ordinary course of business will not include sales that are not at arm’s length, such as sales made to employees at cheap rates. “Balance date” sales held for a short period over balance date, to establish a lower market selling value for tax purposes will also not be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of business. Direct costs of selling the stock which have not yet been incurred may be taken into account in calculating market selling value if these expected costs have been taken into account for financial reporting purposes. This a key feature of the net realisable value concept in FRS-4. The direct selling costs are specified as: • transport and insurance costs; • sales commissions; and • discounts to purchasers. The costs are those commonly deducted for financial reporting purposes, which are readily verifiable, although they are not exactly the same as those listed in the commentary to FRS-4. Market selling value must be calculated on an item-by-item basis. If there are multiple items of stock on hand to be valued, the market selling value will be the sum total of the individual items, less discounts allowed. Example 3: Calculation of market selling value Company C manufactures value-added timber furniture products for export markets. At balance date Company C has a range of completed furniture ready for export. Due to an oversupply in the world furniture market, Company C has chosen to value a portion of its finished stock on hand at balance date at market selling value for tax purposes, as this is less than cost. Export sale contracts usually sell goods on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, freight) basis. Company C has appointed a number of overseas agents to negotiate sales on a commissions basis (4% of the purchase price) on its behalf. 26 Company C has a number of preferential customers that make up a substantial majority of its sales. It offers these customers a purchase discount of 5% from purchase price. Company C is able to substantiate that the market selling value of the portion of its completed furniture on hand at balance date to be valued at market selling value is $1,125,000 (excluding GST). The anticipated costs of selling the completed furniture are (excluding GST): Transport$ 55,000 Insurance$ 27,500 Sales commissions$ 45,000 Discounts to purchasers$ 56,250 $183,750 For tax purposes under section EE 12(2), these anticipated costs of selling the furniture can be deducted from the market selling value. Accordingly, Company C may value its furniture on hand at balance date at $941,250 ($1,125,000 - $183,750). There are differences between the concept of market selling value and net realisable value. Net realisable value requires an estimate of the future proceeds of sale. Some taxpayers have used formula write-downs on an ageing basis to estimate the future proceeds of sale. This will not be acceptable for tax purposes as market selling value is based on the actual selling price of goods. Therefore if goods will be offered for sale at a certain price, that is the market selling value, and not a value which takes into account when the goods will be sold. The current section EE 1(7) will be repealed. Stock affected by obsolescence may be valued using market selling value if the offering price is less than cost. Obsolescent stock that is being sold for a price that is less than the original retail price but more than cost must be valued at cost. To allow write-downs below cost for such stock results in unrealised losses being taken into account for tax purposes when such losses will only occur if stock is sold below cost. Taxpayers will be required to have reasonable evidence to substantiate market selling values. Evidence includes offering prices of goods and actual sales for a reasonable period before and after balance date. Taxpayers may have difficulty determining and substantiating market selling value in some circumstances. This may arise when there is no open or active market in the good, or when the stock has not sold for some time and the taxpayer has reason to believe the goods will not sell at their current offering prices. If this information is not available, the taxpayer may substantiate the market selling value by obtaining an independent valuation. The valuation must be for tax purposes, using the definition of market selling value and not a net realisable value concept set out in FRS-4. Only the items of stock that have a market selling value below cost should be valued using the market selling value option. Excess stocks on hand should not be valued 27 below cost if they will be sold for more than cost. To do so does not provide an accurate reflection of a taxpayer’s income for tax purposes, although it may be appropriate for financial reporting purposes. Small taxpayers may use the market selling value option for trading stock that has a value in excess of cost. The rationale is to provide an alternative to a cost valuation when this may be difficult to calculate. In particular, this appears to be a difficult issue for farmers valuing cash crops. If small taxpayers choose to use the market selling value option in these circumstances, they must do so consistently from year to year. Transitional spreading provision for income arising from the repeal of section EE 1(7) The repeal of section EE 1(7) will mean that taxpayers who have used formulas to write down stock under that provision will be required to value stock at cost, unless they can substantiate a lower market value. Transitional spreading rules will allow them to spread any income arising from the repeal of section EE 1(7) over a three- year period. Spreading will be available for the 1998/99 income year and the two succeeding income years. Valuation of excepted financial arrangements The proposed rules for excepted financial arrangements are: • Taxpayers must value all excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock at cost. • Transfers of excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property between members of a wholly-owned group of companies will be at cost if the market value of the excepted financial arrangement is less than cost. • Taxpayers must use cost-flow methods of assigning costs (either the first-in first- out \[FIFO\] method, or a weighted average method) to excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property. Specific identification may not be used. The rules for valuation of excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock have not changed in any significant way from the proposals in the discussion document. The primary category of excepted financial arrangements is shares. However, the rules apply to all excepted financial arrangements, including options and short-term trade credits. The application of a cost-flow method to shares will only apply to a type of share, for example, all shares held in Company D. Cost-flow methods will not apply across a portfolio of shares, as a whole. New technical rules that apply to excepted financial arrangements are: 28 • Taxpayers will be able to write down the value of their worthless excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock. • The dividend rules will not apply to transfers of excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property between members of a wholly- owned group of companies. • Excepted financial arrangements that are trading stock or revenue account property that have been transferred within a wholly-owned group of companies will be deemed to be sold and repurchased at market value when the company holding the shares ceases to be a member of that group. This rule is similar to the current section EE 1(6) in relation to group companies. Consistency requirements Consistency requirements in the valuation of trading stock are a key feature of these reforms. The principle underpinning the requirement for consistency for tax purposes is that taxpayers should not be able to manipulate their gross income by applying different tax accounting treatments across income years. Changes in the method of valuing trading stock at cost can distort income for both accounting and tax purposes. Financial Reporting Standard No. 1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies (FRS-1) sets out consistency and disclosure requirements. FRS-1 states in its commentary that accounting policies adopted by an entity are normally consistent from one period to another, and are to be applied to all items of a similar nature. It provides that the statement of accounting policies must state whether or not the accounting policies used are consistent with those used in previous periods. If there have been changes in the measurement system, the assumptions, or the accounting policies used, full disclosure of the changes is required. All but small taxpayers must comply with these requirements. Small taxpayers who comply with “generally accepted accounting principles” must comply with FRS-1. Other small taxpayers must be consistent from year to year in five matters: • the extent to which indirect production costs are included in the cost of manufactured or produced trading stock; • the cost-flow method of assigning costs; • the cost valuation method chosen; • the method of calculating discounted selling price; and • the use of market selling value when it is above cost. Small taxpayers may change their method of calculating the value of closing stock if there are sound commercial reasons for the variation. Tax benefits are not considered to be a sound commercial reason. In the event of a change in method, small taxpayers must notify particulars of the variation and the reasons for it by the due date for filing their tax return for the income year in which the change occurs. 29 Record-keeping The current record-keeping requirements in the Tax Administration Act require only statements of quantities and values of trading stock to be kept, including stocktaking records. In order to support the consistency requirements, under the new rules taxpayers must keep records of valuation methods and their application. The records will show how the value of trading stock was calculated. To avoid unnecessary compliance costs, if taxpayers use the same methods from year to year, they will not have to keep additional records. However, if they change valuation methods or apply them differently, taxpayers must record the change. Definition of trading stock The definition of trading stock has been amended only as far as it applies to new Part EE (except section EE 19, which re-enacts section EE 2 providing that insurance receipts are gross income). The new definition of trading stock is an amalgam of the current definition and the proposal in the discussion document for the definition to be: • limited to a business undertaking; and • linked to a purpose of sale. Consumable aids are excluded from the definition of trading stock for clarity. They will be added back as gross income under the accrual expenditure rules in section EF 1. Spare parts held for maintaining plant that are treated as inventory under FRS-4 are also excluded from the definition of trading stock for clarity. They should either be depreciated (when appropriate) or added back as gross income under the accrual expenditure rules in section EF 1. Binding rulings The binding rulings legislation in the Tax Administration Act will be amended so that the Commissioner cannot rule on a matter which would require him to form an opinion as to “generally accepted accounting principles” or commercially acceptable practices. The Commissioner is not a recognised expert in these areas so it is not an appropriate area for rulings, for the same reasons that questions of fact are excluded from the rulings legislation. Provisions currently in Subpart EE The current subsections (4)(5)(6) and (10) of section EE 1 will be retained in Subpart EE, without substantive amendment. The current section EE 2 will also be retained in Subpart EE, without substantive amendment. Consequential amendments Consequential amendments will be made to the family support rules in section KD (1) and to the amalgamation rules in sections FE 2 and FE 6. 30 TAXATION OF PROPERTY OBTAINED WITHOUT COLOUR OF RIGHT \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Clauses 4, 9, 15, 33(6), 47 and 48) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments will protect the income tax base by including within the meaning of “gross income” property obtained without colour of right. A colour of right is an honest belief that the holder is entitled to possession or control of the property. The amendments cover property obtained by fraud, embezzlement, theft or misappropriation. In addition, taxpayers may claim a deduction for the amount of reparation or restitution to the legal or beneficial owner of that property. Application date The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 are applicable to property taken or controlled in the 1995/96 and subsequent income years. The equivalent amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976 are applicable to property taken or controlled between 1 April 1989 and beginning on the 1995/96 income year. The amendments will not apply to competent objections or challenges made before 6 March 1998. Key features The bill introduces four specific amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994: • A new section CD 6 will provide that property obtained without colour of right will be included within the meaning of gross income subject to income tax. • A new section DJ 18 will allow taxpayers a deduction for reparation or restitution made to the legal or beneficial owner of the property. This is because there is no enduring benefit to the taxpayer. Interest payments and other penalties will not be deductible. • A new section EN 5 will provide that income under CD 6 is included as income to the taxpayer in the year in which the property was obtained. • In section OB 1 the definition of property will be amended to include money and money's worth for the purposes of sections CD 6 and DJ 18. A new section 80A and an amendment to section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 mirror these amendments. Background For many years the practice of Inland Revenue has been to tax recipients of misappropriated property on the basis that such property was income. In 1997 the Court of Appeal, in A Taxpayer v CIR, CA 196/96, held that stolen money was not income according to ordinary concepts. The Court considered that unless stolen money was made subject to income tax by express provision, it was not taxable. The Government’s view is that money obtained without colour of right should be taxable. 31 CONSOLIDATION RULES AND SECTION LE 3 HOLDING COMPANIES (Clause 21) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to the consolidation rules will exclude the application of the exemption for intra-group transactions to a dividend or a supplementary dividend derived by a section LE 3 holding company member of a consolidated group. This will ensure that the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules work as intended, which requires such dividends to be taxable. Application date The amendment will have retrospective application to the 1995/96 income year. However, there is a savings provision for taxpayers who have filed returns claiming the benefit of the exemption for intra-group transactions before the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The efficacy of the section LE 3 holding company mechanism is dependent on dividends and supplementary dividends paid to a section LE 3 holding company being taxable to that company. This ensures that if the section LE 3 holding company does not on-pay such dividends, the FITC credit allowed to a lower tier company is effectively clawed back from that section LE 3 holding company. Therefore section LE 3 provides that the wholly-owned group inter-corporate dividend exemption in section CB 10(2) does not apply to dividends (to the extent fully imputed) and supplementary dividends derived by a section LE 3 holding company. However, there is a separate exemption in the consolidation rules (section HB 2(1)(a)) for intra-group transactions. Although it is the clear policy intention that dividends (to the extent fully imputed) and supplementary dividends derived by a section LE 3 holding company always be taxable, this exemption has not been expressly excluded from applying to such dividends. Accordingly, section HB 2(1)(a) is amended to exclude the application of its exemption for intra-group transactions to dividends or supplementary dividends derived by a section LE 3 holding company member of a consolidated group. Background The effect of the FITC rules is to ensure that the maximum rate of New Zealand tax (combining company tax and non-resident withholding tax) on non-resident shareholders in New Zealand companies does not exceed 33%, the same rate as for New Zealand shareholders. The FITC rules allow a company an income tax credit (the FITC credit) when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. 32 A special holding company mechanism in section LE 3 allows the FITC rules to be used in circumstances where a New Zealand holding company has an insufficient tax liability to utilise the FITC credit arising from paying a supplementary dividend to its non-resident shareholders. The mechanism allows a lower tier New Zealand company receiving a dividend and a supplementary dividend (a “section LE 3 holding company”) to claim a FITC credit when paying dividends up the chain of companies to the ultimate New Zealand resident holding company with non-resident shareholders. 33 EXCESS IMPUTATION CREDIT CONVERSION RATE (Clause 26) Summary of proposed amendment The conversion rate for excess imputation credits is being reduced from 21.75% to 21%, consistent with recently enacted reductions in the extra emolument rate, with effect from 1 April 1998. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the 1999/00 income year onwards. Key features The conversion rate specified in section LB 2(3)(iv) for the purpose of converting imputation credits is amended from 21.75% to 21%. Background Excess imputation credits are imputation credits which taxpayers cannot credit against their income tax because they have insufficient income tax liability. Excess imputation credits are converted to losses to prevent imputation credits being refunded to taxpayers. The conversion rate for individuals holding excess credits is based on the extra emolument rate, which is the middle effective tax rate. The imputation credit conversion rate for 1998/99 was set at 21.75% with the enactment of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997. 34 TAXATION OF SPECIFIED SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS (Clauses 31, 32 and 33(7)) Summary of proposed amendments Employees will be allowed to elect to have employer superannuation contributions included in their salary or wages and taxed at their personal tax rates if they are lower than the statutory rate of 33%. Application date Employees will be able to elect to have employer superannuation contributions treated as salary or wages from the date of enactment. Key features The new section NE 2A will allow employees to elect to have all or part of their employer superannuation contributions included in their salary or wages and therefore subject to PAYE. This will allow employees to have their employer superannuation contributions taxed at their personal tax rate. Employees will be able to revoke elections at any time. If the contributions are treated as taxable income of the employee, this income will be taken into account for social assistance targeting such as family support, independent family tax credit, student loans and child support. Background Under the current specified superannuation contribution withholding tax rules, employer contributions to superannuation funds are subject to a flat, final tax of 33%. The report to the Government from the Working Party on the Taxation of life Insurance and Superannuation Fund Savings (April 1997) noted that this treatment resulted in employer contributions being over-taxed for employees whose effective marginal tax rate was below 33%. The working party identified a number of options for taxing employer contributions to employee superannuation funds. In its report, it concluded that for employer contributions that vest immediately, the use of the existing PAYE mechanism already provided a relatively straightforward and effective way of dealing with the issue of over-taxation of employer contributions. In relation to contributions that do not vest immediately, the working party concluded that it could also be appropriate to adopt the same treatment proposed for contributions that vest immediately. Inland Revenue issued a draft Standard Practice Statement late last year confirming that the current PAYE system could be used to tax employer superannuation contributions as salary or wages if employees agreed to this treatment. In response to submissions on the draft statement, it was decided it would be more appropriate to provide for an election in the legislation. 35 DEPRECIATION (Clauses 14, 33(1) and 34) Summary of proposed amendments Several minor technical amendments are being made to the Income Tax Act which arise out of amendments to the depreciation legislation in September 1997. These are: • An amendment to ensure that in all circumstances taxpayers can only depreciate property when it is used or available for use in a business. Arguably, property that is owned but not yet in the possession of a taxpayer may currently be depreciated, but will not be depreciable after these amendments are enacted. • Amendments to the definition of “adjusted tax value” to ensure that taxpayers can amortise the whole of the cost of depreciable property used or available for use for business purposes. • An amendment to provide that taxpayers can depreciate property while it is under repair or inspection. • The reinsertion of words removed in error from the definition of “associated person” in section OD 8(3). Application dates The amendment to ensure that in all circumstances property must be used or available for use in business in order to be depreciable will apply from the 1998/99 income year. The amendments relating to the repair of depreciable assets and to the definition of “adjusted tax value” are generally taxpayer friendly and are retrospective to 23 September 1997, the date on which the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997 came into effect. The correction of the drafting error in section OD 8(3) applies retrospectively from 1 July 1997, the date on which the amendment to section OD 8(3) came into force. Key features • Section EG 2(1)(a) and (e) are amended to ensure that in all circumstances property must be used or available for use in business in order to be depreciable. Item c of the formula in paragraph (a) is now in the same terms as item g of the formula in paragraph (e). • A new subsection EG 2(2A) is added to provide that property continues to be available for use in deriving income or in carrying on a business if it is under temporary repair or inspection. 36 • Amendments are made to both components of the definition of “adjusted tax value” in section OB 1. The definition of “base value” is amended to ensure that if property is first used or available for use in business, it enters the tax base at cost – that is, paragraph (i) of item bv (base value) applies. • The term “aggregate deductions” is also amended to provide, in effect, that the tax book value of an asset decreases only during the period that the asset is either used or available for use in a business, or used for private purposes. • The two references to “paragraph (iv) of the item bv in the definition of ‘adjusted tax value’ ” are reinserted in section OD 8(3). Background In September 1997 the depreciation provisions of the Income Tax Act were amended to provide that a deduction for depreciation would be permitted only when property was used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business. This amendment has given rise to three problems. First, the amendment may not be effective in situations where depreciable property is owned by a taxpayer but not yet in the possession of the taxpayer. It can be argued, for example, that property that has been purchased but not delivered to the taxpayer may still be depreciated. The bill remedies this so that such property is not depreciable until it is used or available for use in deriving income. Second, property that has been used or available for use by a business should continue to be depreciable while it is under repair or inspection. Property under repair is arguably not available for use by a business. If this is correct, it would currently not be depreciable. The bill enables such property to be depreciated during the period of repair. Finally, the definition of “adjusted tax value” in section OB 1 requires consequential amendment. That definition calculates the tax book value of an asset at any particular time. The tax book value comprises the “base value” of the asset (generally cost) and “aggregate deductions” (broadly the amount of depreciation deductions to which the taxpayer has been entitled). An amendment is required to each of these definitions in order not to disadvantage taxpayers. The proposed amendments are explained below. Base value of asset The base value of an asset is generally its cost. However, if an asset is not immediately depreciable to a taxpayer (because, for example, it is first used for private purposes), the base value of the asset is its market value at the time that it becomes depreciable. Following the recent depreciation amendments, property is not depreciable unless it is owned and used or available for use in business. If it is owned but not yet available for use, it is not immediately depreciable to the taxpayer and in certain circumstances the base value of the property is its market value when it becomes available for use. 37 For example, plant that is purchased by a business but that is in transit to New Zealand is owned by the business but is not available for use. It is not depreciable until it is available for business use. Currently, in certain circumstances, such plant will be required to be depreciated from its market value at the time it becomes available for use, rather than from its cost. This is not appropriate and, when the market value is less than cost, will penalise taxpayers. The definition of base value is amended to provide that the base value is cost in these circumstances. Aggregate deductions At any time, the maximum remaining depreciation that may be claimed for an asset is its tax book value. Currently, the tax book value of an asset decreases from the time that the asset is owned, even where it is not yet available for use. As taxpayers can now deduct depreciation for an asset only when it is available for business use, this decrease in the tax book value is penal and means that taxpayers cannot deduct all of the cost of an asset that is only ever available for business use. The definition is amended to provide, in effect, that the tax book value of an asset decreases only during the period that the asset is used or available for use in a business, or is used for private purposes. It does not decrease over the period when an asset is unavailable for any use. The amendment therefore ensures that all expenditure by a business on an asset, except that attributable to private use, is deductible over the life of the asset. Such an amendment would mean, in relation to the plant in transit in the example above, that the tax book value of the plant would not decrease until the plant was available for business use. Drafting error in section OD 8(3) A minor technical amendment is required to correct a drafting error previously made in amending section OD 8(3). That section provides a definition of associated person for the purposes of several provisions, including depreciation. In that section, the two references to “paragraph (iv) of the item bv (base value) in the definition of ‘adjusted tax value’” were omitted, in the expectation that they would no longer be required because of the insertion of a reference to Part EG. This is incorrect and the two references are reinserted. 38 CONFIRMATION OF ANNUAL INCOME TAX RATES FOR 1998/99 (Clause 51) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to Schedule 1 confirm the income tax rates for the 1998/99 income year as follows: Policyholder income33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable income Maori authorities25 cents for every $1 of taxable income Undistributed rents, royalties and interest of the Maori Trustee 25 cents for every $1 of taxable income Companies, public authorities and local authorities 33 cents for every $1 of taxable income Trustee income (including that of trustees of superannuation funds) 33 cents for every $1 of taxable income Trustees of group investment funds33 cents for every $1 of schedular taxable income in respect of Category A income Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts 45 cents for every $1 of taxable distribution Other taxpayers (including individuals)Income not exceeding $34,200: 20 cents for every $1 of taxable income Income exceeding $34,200 but not exceeding $38,000: 22.875 cents for every $1 of taxable income Income exceeding $38,000: 33 cents for every $1 of taxable income Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax 33 cents for every $1 of the contribution Application date The amendment will apply for the 1998/99 income year. 39 NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT (Clause 42) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment requires that a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) be accompanied by a cover sheet when it is filed. This will allow Inland Revenue to identify NOPAs more readily and deal with them quickly. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features Sections 3 and 89F of the Tax Administration Act are being amended to require NOPAs to be accompanied by a cover sheet. Background A NOPA is a notification proposing that an adjustment to an assessment is required. It formally initiates the disputes resolution process. The Act currently prescribes what must be included in a NOPA. There is no requirement for a particular form to be completed. A form (IR 210) is available from Inland Revenue for this purpose, but because the information required can vary considerably, depending upon the nature of the adjustment required, taxpayers and their agents often prefer to file the NOPA in the form of a letter. The amendment will require NOPAs to be accompanied by a cover sheet when filed. This will ensure they are more easily identified and responded to within the time specified by law. 40 PRIVACY PROVISIONS IN THE STUDENT LOAN SCHEME ACT 1992 (Clause 50) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will be able to supply the Ministry of Education with taxpayer information that relates to a case that the Ministry is investigating when it suspects that a student loan has been fraudulently obtained, or that an attempt to obtain a loan fraudulently is being made. This will assist the Ministry of Education to investigate and prosecute fraud. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 62, the privacy provision of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, is amended to allow the Ministry of Education to request Inland Revenue to supply information about a taxpayer and his or her loan account. The information will include: • whether repayments have been made; • the individual’s current loan balance; • the current whereabouts of a borrower; • whether someone is an existing taxpayer; • the number of borrowers living at a particular address; and • any other information that is relevant to the investigation. Background Over the last five years the Ministry of Education has investigated nearly 800 cases in which it suspects that a loan has been fraudulently obtained or that an attempt is being made to obtain a loan fraudulently. Although Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education have separate roles in administering the student loan scheme, these roles are to a large degree interdependent. At present, Inland Revenue can release to the Ministry of Education only such information as is required to correctly identify a borrower.
Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability A Government discussion document Rt Hon Bill Birch Treasurer and Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue ii Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability A discussion document First published in August 1998 ISBN 0-478-10329-8 iii PREFACE This discussion document on legislating for self-assessment is part of the Government’s continued commitment to the reform of tax administration and reduced compliance costs. For some years now, taxpayers have calculated their own tax liabilities, and their returns were then automatically processed by Inland Revenue. The practice of self-assessment is a modern and efficient basis for tax collection. It is not, however, reflected in the legislation. The Government is concerned that this gap causes inefficiencies. The proposals outlined in this discussion document aim to address that gap. While the proposals are primarily intended to legislate for current practice, they also aim to ensure that codified self-assessment is consistent with other recent tax administration reforms, particularly the new disputes resolution procedures. This has involved reviewing some of the time limitations for actions such as amendment by the taxpayer. The release of this discussion document for consultation is part of the generic tax policy process, to which the Government is committed. The Government welcomes the views of interested parties, taxpayers and their advisors on any aspect of the document.

Administrative efficiency in tax collection is, therefore, of critical importance to the Government. 1.2 In recent years the Government has undertaken a programme of important reforms in tax administration through the introduction of a system of binding rulings, a new disputes resolution process, new penalties aiming to clarify taxpayers’ responsibilities and a progressive rewriting of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). These reforms are cumulatively aimed at achieving a modern tax administration in which the revenue needed to fund the activities of the Government is raised fairly, efficiently and in a way that minimises the overall cost to the economy. 1.3 This discussion document presents for public consideration a series of proposals to implement one of the last stages of this reform process – the codification in legislation of the practice of self-assessment. 1.4 In practice, taxpayers often assess their own tax liabilities because their returns are automatically processed by Inland Revenue. However, as long as the legislation continues to place the responsibility on the Commissioner for making an assessment, that responsibility is duplicated. The proposals in this discussion document are a response to the concern that such duplication is economically inefficient. They also recognise that taxpayers, because of the information they possess, are best placed to assess their tax liabilities. 1.5 The central purpose of the proposals is to ensure that the legislation reflects the current practice of self-assessment. They also clarify ambiguities and address deficiencies in current practice. They do not aim to make significant structural changes to the system of tax administration or underlying tax policy. The benefits of legislating for self assessment 1.6 Legislating for self-assessment will: • bring the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) into line with modern administrative practice; • make the law on assessment consistent with other recent administrative reforms including the new penalties provisions, disputes resolution procedures and binding rulings legislation; 2 • clarify income tax law - particularly in the area of discretions; and • lay a foundation for future phases of the project to rewrite the tax legislation. Overview 1.7 This discussion document has been divided into five chapters. Chapter two explains the background to self-assessment and its place within the context of recent reforms in tax administration. Chapter three sets out the key proposals for amending the legislation, including new obligations placed on taxpayers and other changes to tax administration. Chapter four outlines the Government’s policy approach to various types of discretions and explains proposals dealing with specific discretions. Legislating for self-assessment raises a number of other tax administration issues. These are discussed in chapter five. SUMMARY OF MAIN PROPOSALS The main proposals in this discussion document are: • The general provision in the TAA requiring the Commissioner to make assessments will be replaced with a provision requiring taxpayers to assess their own income tax liability. • Taxpayers’ returns will be their self-assessments. • The Commissioner’s power of amendment in section 113 of the TAA will be more clearly linked to the disputes resolution process. • The period in which the Commissioner must make a refund of excess tax will be reduced from eight years to four years. • Taxpayers will continue to have a two-month period in which to adjust their assessments. The two-month period will run from the time the return is furnished rather than from the date of assessment by the Commissioner. • Adjustments for goods and services tax input tax credits will be required to be made in a return period within six months immediately following the return period to which the input credit is attributable. • The Commissioner and taxpayers will continue to be able to agree adjustments for both income tax and GST purposes. 3 • Provisions purporting to give, but which do not in fact give, the Commissioner a discretion or which are unnecessary in a self-assessment environment, will be repealed. • Other discretions, including those relating to valuation, apportionment, and the availability of certain deductions, will be replaced with objective tests. • Discretions to recharacterise avoidance arrangements will be retained. Submissions 1.8 The Government invites submissions on the proposals in this discussion document. Submissions should be made by 2 October 1998 and addressed to: Self-assessment Project C/- The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON 1.9 The Government’s aim is that the proposed changes will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 1999. Introduction 4 CHAPTER TWO THE CASE FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT BACKGROUND 2.1 Tax administration has undergone enormous change in the last decade. Computerisation of administration, automation of return processing, the introduction of E-filing, and the greater use of withholding payments, all underpin the move towards the efficient collection of taxes. These changes reflect worldwide trends in tax administration. 2.2 The move towards a comprehensive system of self-assessment was foreshadowed in the Government discussion documents, Compliance Standards and Penalties 2 and Tax Simplification Issues. As stated in those discussion documents, much can be done to align our tax legislation with the practice of self-assessment through the process of rewriting the ITA. This process, however, is not designed to resolve substantial policy issues which must be looked at separately. The organisational review of the Inland Revenue Department 2.3 In 1993 the Government appointed a Review Committee, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson, to carry out a “fundamental, strategic review of the Inland Revenue Department and its activities”. 1 The Review Committee was to “investigate and recommend the optimal arrangements for the tax assessment and collection system”. The Review Committee concluded that the department had made significant improvements to tax administration in recent years, but some important issues needed attention. 2.4 The three major changes that had affected tax administration were the expansion to a broad tax base, the introduction of advanced technology to perform operations that were once done manually, and the limited introduction of self-assessment by taxpayers. The move towards self-assessment was seen as a fundamental change in tax administration necessary to deal efficiently with the increasing number of returns being received by the department. 2.5 Following the review, the department was restructured with the intention of supporting an administration based on self-assessment. New Service Centres were structured around particular customer groups and audit and technical functions were reorganised. 2.6 Despite these changes and the other reforms that were undertaken, the legislative framework does not yet fully support self-assessment. The 1 Statement by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on 8 July 1993 announcing the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department. The case for self-assessment 5 Government has recognised the gap between administrative practice and the law, and views the situation as undesirable. SELF-ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER REFORMS 2.7 The sequence in which the recent tax administration reforms have been introduced has allowed for the orderly and manageable implementation of an administrative framework to support the codification of self-assessment. 2.8 Legislating for self-assessment would not have been possible without the recent introduction of the disputes resolution process, the compliance and penalties legislation and the binding rulings system. The reforms could have been undertaken concurrently but because of the significant impact of the disputes resolution and compliance and penalties reforms on taxpayers, it was decided to deal with self-assessment separately. The relationship between the proposals to legislate for self-assessment and other recent tax administration initiatives is discussed in the following paragraphs. Disputes resolution process 2.9 The Government recognises that taxpayers’ compliance with their tax obligations is affected by their perceptions of fairness, and the speed with which disputes are resolved. An effective self-assessment system requires the early identification and prompt resolution of issues that may lead to disputes. 2.10 To address these issues, in 1996, Parliament enacted a new disputes resolution process which places increased emphasis on information disclosure and early discussion between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. The intention is to ensure that each party is fully informed of the facts, propositions of law and arguments on which their respective positions are based. 2.11 Legislating for self-assessment will place the disputes resolution process in its appropriate context. Some amendment to the disputes resolution legislation will be necessary. For example, section 113 of the TAA, which allows the Commissioner to make amended assessments, may need to be linked more clearly to the disputes resolution process to remove any doubt about whether it creates an alternative avenue for disputes resolution. Other minor changes will be necessary to reflect assessment by the taxpayer rather than the Commissioner. 6 Compliance and penalties 2.12 In 1996 the Government enacted new compliance and penalties legislation which recognised the department’s increasing reliance on self-assessment to administer tax collection. The legislation encourages voluntary compliance by requiring taxpayers to take their obligations seriously and perform the various tasks required of them honestly and with reasonable care. A self-assessment system cannot function properly without such voluntary compliance. It has, however, been recognised that the policy underlying the penalties legislation is inconsistent with legislation based on assessment by the Commissioner. 2 2.13 The compliance and penalties rules will not, in substance, be affected by the Government’s move to an explicit self-assessment system. The criteria relating to shortfall penalties and penalties for not taking reasonable care, for an unacceptable interpretation of the law, for gross carelessness or for an abusive tax position, will remain the same. 2.14 Legislating for self-assessment will, however, require some minor changes to be made to the compliance and penalties legislation. 2.15 Although most discretionary powers affecting the quantification of liability are inconsistent with self-assessment and will therefore be removed, the Commissioner will continue to exercise various discretions after an assessment is made. This should not affect the application of the penalties legislation. (Discretions are discussed in detail in chapter four.) Binding rulings 2.16 The complex nature of tax law inevitably results in uncertainty as to the tax implications of some transactions. The binding rulings legislation enacted in 1995 is an integral part of a tax administration based on self-assessment because it allows taxpayers to obtain certainty on the Commissioner’s view of the tax treatment of their transactions. 2.17 Legislating for self-assessment will require minor changes to be made to the binding rulings legislation. 2 This contradiction was acknowledged by the Government in its discussion document Taxpayer Compliance Standards and Penalties 2. The case for self-assessment 7 Tax simplification 2.18 The Government has a continuing commitment to simplification of the tax system and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. Initiatives were outlined in the discussion documents, Tax Simplification Issues (1996) and Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements (1997). The Government will ensure that the codification of self-assessment is consistent with further tax simplification initiatives. Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 2.19 A key objective in rewriting the ITA is to ensure the legislation is applied in the way Parliament intended. Legislating for self-assessment will mean that the ITA can be drafted in the “language” of self-assessment. It will also set a framework within which the Commissioner’s discretions can be reviewed, and will resolve a number of policy issues in advance of the process of rewriting the ITA. In addition, the proposals will lay the groundwork for the TAA to be rewritten in the future. 8 CHAPTER THREE LEGISLATING FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT Key proposals in this chapter: • Taxpayers will be required to assess their own liability, and their returns will be their self-assessments. • The Commissioner’s power of amendment in section 113 of the TAA will be more clearly linked to the disputes resolution process. • The period in which the Commissioner must issue a refund of excess tax will be reduced from eight years to four years. • When an adjustment is not agreed with the Commissioner, taxpayers will have two months from the date their return is furnished to adjust their assessments. • Adjustments for GST input tax credits will be required to be made in a return period within six months after the period in which the credit would otherwise arise. THE COMMISSIONER’S CURRENT ROLE 3.1 The central proposal in this discussion document is to enact legislation requiring taxpayers to assess their own income tax liability in accordance with the core provisions in Part B of the ITA. 3.2 The legislation imposes an obligation on the Commissioner to assess income tax (section 92(1) of the TAA): “...the Commissioner shall in and for every year, and from time to time and at any subsequent time as may be necessary, assess the taxable income and income tax liability of the taxpayer and the tax payable by the taxpayer.” 3.3 Although the Commissioner is required to assess the tax liability of a taxpayer, what constitutes an assessment is not specified. The law on this has been developed through the courts and has been continually refined. Legislating for self-assessment 9 3.4 In summary, an assessment by the Commissioner requires: • a consideration of the facts relating to the taxpayer’s financial affairs; 3 • the interpretation and application of the law to those facts; 4 • the determination of the amount of tax owing by the taxpayer; 5 and • an intention that the determination of the amount owing is final. 6 3.5 The consistent theme underpinning decisions by the courts in this area is that an assessment takes its character from the nature and quality of the decision made and not from matters of process or administration. THE PROPOSAL THAT TAXPAYERS ASSESS THEIR OWN TAX LIABILITY 3.6 The legislation requires taxpayers to calculate their tax liabilities. Section 15B of the TAA imposes various obligations on taxpayers, including the obligation to: (a) Correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws. 3.7 Section 15B was inserted as part of the compliance and penalties reforms to identify obligations that have interest or penalty consequences if they are breached. 3.8 The obligation to determine the correct amount of tax payable, while reflecting the practice of self-assessment, is not, strictly speaking, the same thing as requiring taxpayers to assess their own liability. An assessment is the process for establishing the debt owed by the taxpayer to the Crown. Proposed obligations 3.9 When self-assessment is enacted, taxpayers will be required to carry out the assessment function previously carried out by the Commissioner. In other words, taxpayers will be responsible for: • considering the facts relating to their own financial affairs; • interpreting and applying the law to those facts; • determining the amount of tax owing; and • making that determination with an appropriate degree of finality. 3 R v DFC of T ex parte Hooper (1926) 37 CLR 368. 4 Batagol v FCT (1963) 109 CLR 243. 5 CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meats Co Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,150. 6 FC of T v S Hoffnung & Co Ltd (1928) 42 CLR 39. 10 3.10 These obligations will not be explicitly stated in the legislation. They are inherent in taxpayers’ current obligations to determine their tax liability and will continue to apply. For example, when a return is furnished, it will be assumed that the taxpayer intended that the amount determined as owing is final. As is the current position, failing to comply with these obligations will breach the standard of care required to avoid penalties. 3.11 One difference between assessment by the Commissioner and assessment by the taxpayer is that the Commissioner must comply with the administrative law principles of natural justice and fairness. Those principles aim to ensure consistency of treatment between taxpayers. The penalties legislation, the disputes resolution process and the binding rulings system are all intended to ensure that these outcomes are achieved when taxpayers assess their own liability. 3.12 The Government proposes to repeal the obligation imposed on the Commissioner to assess taxpayers under section 92 of the TAA. It will be replaced with a new provision requiring taxpayers to assess their own tax liability. 3.13 The Commissioner’s powers to make corrective or default assessments are not inconsistent with self-assessment and are clearly a necessary part of the effective tax administration. Those powers will be retained. Method of self-assessment 3.14 Taxpayers who must file a return will continue to be required to do so under an explicit self-assessment system. The date on which the return is furnished will be treated as the date that the self-assessment is made. The Commissioner will not issue a notice of assessment in response to the taxpayer’s self- assessment, but will continue to issue statements to confirm the amount of tax owing. 3.15 At present, taxpayers can calculate their tax liability themselves or elect to have Inland Revenue calculate their liability on their behalf. This will continue. Calculation by Inland Revenue could appear to be inconsistent with self- assessment, however, it is more correct to say that the Commissioner is undertaking the calculation on the taxpayer’s behalf, rather like a service, and that this does not, therefore, detract from the nature of the return as a self- assessment. 3.16 The Government does not propose as part of legislating for self-assessment to align the dates for filing income tax returns with the date for payment of tax, as is the case with GST, nor to introduce any further record keeping requirements. Legislating for self-assessment 11 3.17 The liability for tax will exist whether or not taxpayers assess their own liability. The late filing penalty will, therefore, continue to apply. Validity of assessments 3.18 Sections 109 and 114 of the TAA provide in effect that an assessment made by the Commissioner may not be disputed except through the objection or challenge procedures specified in the TAA and the assessment is deemed to be correct until successfully challenged. 3.19 The presumption of validity of an assessment by the Commissioner underpins, inter alia, the ability to collect the non-deferrable portion of the tax once the assessment is made and this presumption will, therefore, be retained. However, to support the assumption that a self-assessment is the taxpayer’s final determination of liability, the Government proposes to extend the presumption of validity to assessments by taxpayers. AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER 3.20 The Commissioner’s function of administering the tax laws will not change substantially under codified self-assessment. As part of this function is to ensure that taxpayers comply with their tax obligations, the Commissioner must be able to correct assessments and to make default assessments. This section of the chapter discusses how this function can be better aligned with the objectives of the disputes resolution process by: • creating consistency between section 113 of the TAA (the Commissioner’s general power of amendment) and the disputes resolution process; • removing redundant provisions in section 89C of the TAA which permit the Commissioner to make adjustments without issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA); • changing the period within which the Commissioner must issue a refund from eight years to four years. Commissioner’s power to amend assessments 3.21 The Government does not propose to alter significantly the circumstances in which an assessment can be amended by the Commissioner. Accordingly, the Commissioner will be able to amend assessments by taxpayers: • after a NOPA has been issued by the Commissioner; 12 • in most of the circumstances in which the Commissioner is now able to issue an assessment without a NOPA, such as to correct a simple or obvious mistake or when an amendment is otherwise agreed between the taxpayer and the Commissioner (section 89C of the TAA). 3.22 Section 113 of the TAA allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment in order to ensure its correctness. Its scope is very wide. Although the intention of the disputes resolution reforms was that amendments must be preceded by a NOPA or fall within section 89C of the TAA, there is a possible argument that section 113 allows taxpayers and Inland Revenue to use the provision as an alternative to the disputes resolution process. 3.23 In addition, the intention of the new disputes resolution process, that parties are fully informed of the facts and of the propositions of law and interpretations upon which their respective positions are based, is not reflected in the language of section 113. The retention of this wide power of amendment is therefore inconsistent with having an effective method of disputes resolution to support self-assessment. 3.24 Nevertheless section 113 is a key provision that enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment: • to make amendments following an investigation; • to reflect the resolution of a dispute; and • for any of the circumstances prescribed in section 89C of the TAA. 3.25 The Government proposes that section 113 be retained but that it should be redrafted to specify the assessments that the Commissioner may make and to reflect self-assessment. Amended assessments if a NOPA is not required 3.26 Some of the circumstances in which the Commissioner may issue an assessment without preceding it with a NOPA (section 89C of the TAA) require review in the context of the proposal to legislate for self-assessment. The main change proposed is to remove the Commissioner’s power to issue an assessment merely confirming the taxpayer’s return (section 89C(a)). This will be superfluous, because the taxpayer’s return will be the assessment. 3.27 The power to issue an assessment that has been agreed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer to correct a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer (section 89C(c)) is also unnecessary. That power exists in the provisions allowing the Commissioner to issue an assessment that reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer (section 89C(d)). Legislating for self-assessment 13 3.28 Section 89C will otherwise be retained, including the power to issue an assessment that corrects a simple or obvious mistake or oversight in a taxpayer’s return (section 89C(b)). That power will be clarified to allow the Commissioner to correct an obvious mistake or oversight made by either the taxpayer or the Commissioner. Agreed adjustments 3.29 It is common practice for Inland Revenue and taxpayers to agree to adjustments, and for the Commissioner to issue assessments reflecting those agreements, particularly when the issue is one of fact rather than law. 3.30 This practice has several advantages for taxpayers: • They can initiate adjustments outside the time limits prescribed by the NOPA process. • This method is easier to instigate than the NOPA process and may involve lower compliance costs. 3.31 The corresponding advantages for Inland Revenue are the ease with which an adjustment can be made and the resultant administrative cost savings. 3.32 However, under this process, if the Commissioner does not agree to an adjustment, the taxpayer has no right of appeal. Because taxpayers have a limited period in which to make non-agreed adjustments to their assessments, taxpayers may find it necessary to prepare a NOPA to protect their position, while waiting for the Commissioner’s agreement. The compliance costs savings in having an agreed adjustment process, as an alternative to the NOPA process, are diminished when taxpayers invoke both processes. 3.33 The Government considers that this disadvantage is outweighed by the reduced compliance and administrative costs of the agreed adjustment process. Therefore, the Government proposes that the practice of agreed adjustments should continue. This may require a review of the existing processes in order to formalise in legislation a coherent process with uniform application. The four-year statute bar 3.34 The four-year period within which the Commissioner can issue amended assessments (section 108 of the TAA) now applies from the end of the income year in which the return was provided. Previously the statute bar applied from the end of the income year of original assessment. This change was made as part of the disputes resolution reforms and reflects the shift to self-assessment. No further reduction in the overall time within which an investigation by the Commissioner must be completed is therefore proposed. 14 The eight-year period for refunds 3.35 At present, the Commissioner, if satisfied that tax has been paid in excess of the amount properly payable, must refund that excess (section MD 1 of the ITA). Refunds are generally not available after eight years from the end of the year of assessment. 3.36 The Government considers that eight years is too long for final determination of a tax liability. It proposes that the eight-year period be replaced with a four-year period for income tax and GST. 3.37 Four years is more consistent with the disputes resolution process which aims to resolve disputes speedily and finalise the tax liability within four years of an assessment being made. The period will run from the date the return is furnished, although it may need to be extended in some instances where there are exceptions to the four-year statute bar on amendments by the Commissioner (for example, in retrospective spreading provisions, as discussed in chapter five). Submissions are invited on any difficulties that this might pose for taxpayers. AMENDMENTS BY TAXPAYERS 3.38 The most significant issue to be addressed in legislating for self-assessment is the extent to which taxpayers should be entitled to amend their own assessments. Under the disputes resolution process, a taxpayer may dispute an assessment made by the Commissioner. Legislating for self-assessment will mean that the Commissioner no longer makes the assessment. Therefore taxpayers disputing an assessment will, in effect, be “disputing” their own assessment. 3.39 This section discusses: • whether amendment by taxpayers of a self-assessment is appropriate; • the effect of the proposals on the time period for NOPAs issued by the taxpayer; • the apparent asymmetry between the timeframes for amendments by the Commissioner and the taxpayer; • a proposal for introducing a timeframe within which GST input credits must be claimed. Legislating for self-assessment 15 Current process for amendments by taxpayers 3.40 If taxpayers disagree with an assessment made by the Commissioner without the issue of a NOPA, they must themselves issue a NOPA within two months from the date of the assessment. Failure to issue the notice means that the taxpayer has no power to amend the assessment, unless exceptional circumstances exist. A taxpayer’s NOPA is followed by the Commissioner’s notice of response (NOR), again within the two-month time limit. Unless the taxpayer rejects the NOR within that time, the NOR is deemed to have been accepted by the taxpayer and the Commissioner’s assessment stands. 3.41 If agreement cannot be reached, a conference may take place in an effort to resolve the dispute. If this fails, the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice and the taxpayer may issue a statement of position in response. The Commissioner has a right of reply within two months of the issue of the statement of position. Failure to resolve the dispute at that stage results in referral to Adjudication for determination. Should taxpayers be able to “dispute” their self-assessment? 3.42 A self-assessment will not in the first instance include adjustments by the Commissioner. Arguably, therefore, there is little rationale for taxpayers to be able to amend an assessment. Taxpayers’ ability to amend their own assessments might be seen as inconsistent with the necessary element of finality that characterises an assessment. 3.43 However, an advantage for taxpayers in being able to dispute an assessment is to eliminate their exposure to shortfall penalties. At present, a taxpayer can make a return on a conservative basis and then file a NOPA on a less conservative basis. As penalties are calculated by reference to the tax position taken in a return, rather than in a NOPA, this approach avoids the application of penalties. Allowing taxpayers to amend an assessment also provides an opportunity to address an issue before investigation. This may allow early resolution of the issue. 3.44 The Government, therefore, considers that taxpayers’ right to amend their own assessment should be retained. It proposes that the amendments continue to be initiated by a NOPA and that the two-month period in which adjustments must be made continue to apply from the date of assessment. 3.45 The circumstances in which taxpayers may issue NOPAs will not change. However, because the date of assessment will be the date the return is furnished, and not the date of assessment by the Commissioner, the period for amendment will begin earlier. The Government is interested in receiving submissions on any practical difficulties that this might cause. 16 Balancing taxpayers’ and the Commissioner’s powers of amendment 3.46 Taxpayers have no general power to amend assessments of their tax liabilities. However, they can use the agreed adjustment process and issue NOPAs in certain circumstances, as discussed. 3.47 By contrast, the Commissioner has four years from the end of the year in which a return is filed to amend a taxpayer’s assessment. It is well established in case law that the Commissioner is required to assess a taxpayer in accordance with the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law as at the time of assessment. 7 The only exception to this rule is when the Commissioner is bound to apply an interpretation following a binding ruling. 3.48 One reason for the apparent asymmetry between these positions is that the Commissioner must administer the tax laws for all taxpayers, whereas taxpayers’ responsibilities are limited to their own tax affairs. Another reason is that if taxpayers had the freedom to reconsider their own assessments at any time within that four-year period, the “real” date for self-assessment would be the end of that four-year period. This would make the administration of the tax system, including the application of penalties and the administration of payments and refunds problematic and expensive. 3.49 It might also be argued that taxpayers should be able to re-open assessments in light of subsequent case law which could be interpreted as reducing their liability. Any right to adjust assessments in light of favourable case law would need to be accompanied by an obligation to reassess income tax obligations in light of subsequent unfavourable case law. Following this argument the Commissioner would then have to take into account the impact of post- assessment case law in applying any penalties or use of money interest. Accordingly taxpayers’ compliance costs and the Government’s administration costs could increase significantly. 3.50 Increasing the time in which taxpayers are able to amend their assessments would also have an impact on the time available to the Commissioner to review that amendment. The Commissioner’s duty to ensure that taxpayers comply with their obligations would be undermined if the Commissioner were not allowed further time to review taxpayers’ final assessments and make amendments to them. 8 7 CIR v Lemmington Holdings (1982) 5 NZTC 61,268. 8 In Australia, a further period for review is allowed under section 170(1A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act (Cth) 1936. A taxpayer has four years to make a statement amending their assessment. If a taxpayer makes an amendment to their assessment that results in a reduction of their liability, the Federal Commissioner of Taxation may, within four years of the date of the amended assessment, further amend the taxpayer’s assessment to increase their liability. Legislating for self-assessment 17 3.51 In summary, giving taxpayers wider powers to amend their own assessments would be inconsistent with the Government’s objectives of obtaining finality in the assessment process and of the speedy resolution of disputes. GST and amendment of assessments 3.52 Taxpayers assess their own GST liability and pay GST at the time a return is made. The Commissioner makes an assessment only if taxpayers have failed to file a return, or if the Commissioner is dissatisfied with a taxpayer’s return, or if asked to do so by a taxpayer. Taxpayers may initiate amendments to the Commissioner’s assessment through the disputes resolution process. 3.53 The Commissioner cannot issue an assessment or amend an assessment to increase the GST liability four years after the return is provided or the original assessment by the Commissioner is made (section 108A of the TAA). On the other hand, under section 20(3) of the GST Act 1985, taxpayers have an unlimited time in which to adjust for unclaimed input tax credits. Adjustments may be made in current period returns. 3.54 The unlimited time for making claims causes uncertainty in the level of tax collected. The provision also enables unlimited retrospective adjustment by taxpayers following favourable new case law. The Commissioner has no corresponding power to make adjustments increasing taxpayers’ liability. 3.55 The Government does, however, recognise the value in allowing taxpayers to make adjustments in current periods for transactions in a prior return period, rather than strictly adhering to the general time of supply rules. 3.56 Accordingly, the Government proposes to continue to allow returns to be adjusted for input tax attributable to an earlier period. However, in the absence of exceptional circumstances (similar to those described in section 89 K(3)), it is proposed that adjustments for input tax must be made in a return within six months immediately following the return period to which the input tax is attributable. 3.57 The adjustment period of six months is longer than the two-month period for taxpayers to make income tax adjustments. The Government recognises that claiming GST input tax credits may depend on the ability to obtain a tax invoice. More than two months is, therefore, considered necessary (despite section 24 of the GST Act 1985, which requires suppliers to provide tax invoices within 28 days of being asked to do so). 3.58 As with income tax, adjustments agreed between the Commissioner and the taxpayer, including those for simple or obvious mistakes and oversights will be able to be made within four years of the return being furnished. 18 SELF-ASSESSMENT AND TAX SIMPLIFICATION 3.59 The simplification proposals in the Government’s discussion documents Tax Simplification Issues and Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements relieve a significant number of current IR5 taxpayers from making a return. No assessment will be required because these taxpayers will effectively have determined that their tax obligations are satisfied through the deduction of PAYE and RWT from their income. 3.60 Income statements issued by the Commissioner will replace income tax returns for taxpayers affected by social policy measures implemented through the tax system and for taxpayers whose PAYE or RWT has been under- deducted. Taxpayers whose assessments are not in line with their income statement will be required to amend and return the statement. Taxpayers who are not required to file a return, or whose income statement requires no amendment, will be deemed to have assessed their liability at the terminal tax date for the relevant income year on the basis that their tax liability has been met by withholding tax payments. 3.61 A taxpayer who is required to amend an income statement but fails to do so, will be deemed to have assessed his or her own liability on the basis of the latest income statement. The self-assessment will be deemed to have occurred at the terminal tax date for the relevant income year. Penalties may apply if, in a subsequent audit, the income statement is found to be deficient. CONSEQUENTIAL CHANGES 3.62 Legislating for self-assessment will require numerous minor amendments to both the ITA and the TAA to ensure that both Acts are consistent with the proposals in this discussion document. One of the main tasks will be to identify terminology premised on assessment by the Commissioner and amend it to reflect self-assessment. 3.63 Most of the consequential amendments will be made when the proposals are enacted. However, some of the more mechanical changes, particularly to the ITA, will be made through the process of rewriting the ITA. There will be opportunity to make submissions on the changes when draft legislation is referred to Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee. 19 CHAPTER FOUR THE COMMISSIONER’S DISCRETIONS Key proposals in this chapter: • Those Commissioner’s discretions that are not exercised in practice, or that can be removed leaving in place an objective test without changing the effect of the law, will be removed. • Discretions which allow the Commissioner to value specific assets will be replaced with a general requirement to use market value. • Discretions which require the apportionment of consideration between revenue and non-revenue assets will be replaced with a general requirement to value the assets at market value and pro-rate the consideration accordingly. • Specific application to write off assets not disposed of but no longer used will not be required for assets under $2,000 provided the criteria in section EG 12 are met. • The circumstances in which the Commissioner will accept the stated value of an asset on transfer between associated persons will be set out in the legislation (section EG 17). • The Commissioner’s discretions in anti-avoidance provisions to recharacterise avoidance arrangements will be retained. THE PROPOSED APPROACH TO DISCRETIONS 4.1 Many provisions in the legislation reserve powers to the Commissioner. These powers are generally in the form of discretions allowing the Commissioner to carry out administrative duties, and make decisions regarding the affairs of individual taxpayers. Discretions permit a level of flexibility to address unforeseen situations. They are also used when it is undesirable to legislate for matters of detail or for multiple permutations. 4.2 Since their existence often assumes an active role for the Commissioner in the calculation of taxpayers’ liabilities, discretions can be incompatible with self- assessment. There may also be some uncertainty as to whether taxpayers must specifically apply for a particular discretion to be exercised. 20 Types of discretions 4.3 Discretions can be classed as follows: • Administrative discretions, allowing the Commissioner to carry out the duties of revenue collection. These do not generally have an impact on the ability of taxpayers to assess their own liability. • Discretions exercised on the application of the taxpayer under a defined process, including depreciation determinations and determinations made under the accrual rules. These similarly do not require any change under the proposals for self-assessment. • Discretions affecting the determination of tax liabilities, which give (or purport to give) the Commissioner powers that need to be exercised in order for taxpayers’ income tax liabilities to be determined. These include anti-avoidance discretions, which give powers to the Commissioner to ensure that the revenue base is protected. The focus of this chapter is on the last class. 4.4 In considering how to deal with the last class of discretions under a self- assessment system, three categories emerge: • discretions that do not confer any true discretionary power and can be removed because they are not in practice exercised or exercisable; • discretions in provisions that can become objective by removing the discretion; • discretions that can be replaced by specific objective rules. 4.5 Discretions in the first category are already embodied in the Commissioner’s general administrative and collection powers. An example is section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the ITA, under which the Commissioner must be satisfied that a bad debt has actually been written off. Such discretions are superfluous. The Government’s view is that discretions of this type can be removed without changing the effect of the law. 4.6 Discretions in the second category are not dissimilar to those in the first category, the distinguishing feature being that they may give rise to an issue of interpretation. An example of this type of discretion is the proviso to section CN 2(1), by which the Commissioner can exempt a non-resident film maker from the application of the section, if the income from renting films in New Zealand is “minor and insignificant”. Such discretions can be removed leaving in place an objective test. The Commissioner’s discretions 21 4.7 These two types of discretions will be removed during the rewriting of the ITA. 4.8 Discretions in the third category will be replaced by objective rules that are consistent with the underlying policy of the provision. If the Commissioner’s practice in exercising the discretion is generally accepted, that practice could provide the basis for the rule. An example is section EG 17(2) under which the Commissioner may determine the level of depreciation deduction in respect of property acquired from an associate. (The proposed approach is discussed in a later section.) PARTICULAR DISCRETIONS AFFECTING THE DETERMINATION OF TAX LIABILITY 4.9 This section discusses particular discretions in the third category including discretions to value specified items, to apportion income between revenue account and other assets, and to restrict the amount of a deduction available to taxpayers. It also discusses anti-avoidance discretions. Discretions as to valuation 4.10 These discretions allow the Commissioner to determine what value will be attributed to an item for tax purposes and are generally intended to be used if an item has no readily ascertainable value. This situation may arise if the item is valued or grouped with other items, if an in-kind payment is made or when the item in question is intangible. Examples are: • Section GD 1: trading stock sold without consideration in money is deemed to be sold at market price. When there is no market price, the Commissioner has the discretion to determine the price. • Section CF 2(5): the meaning of market price of property is set out for the purposes of the dividend rules and, if an actual market value is not available, the Commissioner is able to set a price that may be expected to be realised on an arm’s length sale of the property. • Section CH 2(3): the Commissioner is able to value benefits to an employee under a share purchase scheme. • Section EN 2(4): the Commissioner, in case of dispute, has the discretion to value non-cash consideration received in payment for patent rights. 22 4.11 In each case, the Commissioner is required to make an objective determination of value. In practice the valuation is more often carried out by the taxpayer. The Commissioner becomes involved only at the audit stage if a question arises on whether the taxpayer’s valuation reflects the true market value of the asset. Proposed treatment 4.12 Even when market value is not specifically provided, case law suggests that it should be adopted. 4.13 The Government, therefore, proposes to replace discretions of the type discussed above with a general requirement to adopt market valuation. To cover situations where there is no ready market, market value would be broadly defined to include willing parties acting at arm’s length. Discretions as to apportionment 4.14 If revenue account assets are acquired or disposed of with other assets, the expenditure incurred or income derived must be apportioned between the assets. Sections FB 4(1) (sale of trading stock), FB 6 (acquisition of a film with other property) and FC 5(3) (property subject to specified leases) provide that the Commissioner may determine the proportion of the combined consideration to be attributed to the revenue account property. The sections, however, give no guidance as to how that should be done. Proposed treatment 4.15 The application of section FB 4(1) was discussed in CIR v Edge 9 and Hansen & Others v CIR. 10 It was decided that once the combined value of the assets is ascertained, any consideration should be apportioned between them at the same ratio, with proportional reductions if the consideration is less than the combined actual value. The rule is effective if the values of all of the assets are known, or are able to be determined. Adoption of market value or an equivalent hypothetical valuation method would remove the need for the Commissioner to be involved in the apportionment. 4.16 It is proposed that discretions to apportion income from the disposition of revenue account assets with other assets be replaced by specific rules requiring proportional apportionment in relation to total assets. The provisions affected would be limited to those where there are no alternative rules. 9 \[1958\] NZLR 42. 10 \[1972\] NZLR 193. The Commissioner’s discretions 23 Restrictions on deductions 4.17 In some provisions, a particular deduction may be allowed at the discretion of the Commissioner. For most of these, criteria exist either in the legislation or in policy statements issued by the Commissioner. If there are no criteria in the legislation, but the criteria in policy statements are sufficiently objective to be applied effectively by taxpayers, these could form part of the legislation. Discussion of two discretions that may be used by the Commissioner to restrict deductions follows. 4.18 Under section EG 12, the Commissioner may agree to write off a depreciable asset if it is established that it is no longer used in the production of gross income. Taxpayers must specifically apply for the deduction. The discretion can be exercised only when the cost of disposing of an asset that is no longer used, exceeds any consideration that would be received on its disposition. 4.19 Section EG 17(2) allows the Commissioner to waive the rule that deems depreciable assets transferred between associated persons to have been transferred at the lower of market value of the asset when it became depreciable to the seller, or at the buyer’s cost price. The rule is intended to prevent assets being written up to market value on a transfer between associates in order to gain a tax advantage. The exception to the rule ensures that legitimate arm’s length purchases of second hand assets are not disadvantaged. 4.20 The Commissioner’s current policy 11 is to apply the discretion when: • there is a bona fide sale of an asset; • the purchase price is the fair market value of the asset; • the purchaser buys the asset for income producing purposes; and • the vendor no longer uses it. Proposed treatment 4.21 The discretion in section EG 12 must be exercised for all depreciable assets. As such, it is probably broader than is desirable and could be limited to writing off assets with an adjusted tax value over a certain threshold. The Government proposes a threshold value of $2,000 per asset, below which taxpayers may write off assets that are no longer used, without having first to apply to the Commissioner for exercise of the discretion. The requirement that disposal costs exceed estimated consideration on sale will continue to apply. (The $2,000 threshold level takes account of the costs involved in applying to the Commissioner.) Specific application to write off depreciable assets over $2,000 in value will still be required. 11 Tax Information Bulletin vol 4, no 5 (December 1992). 24 4.22 The criteria to be exercised for the discretion in section EG 17 could be enacted as objective rules. Although the characteristics of a “bona fide” sale are difficult to define, the other criteria provide more objective guidance in determining whether a transfer between associates is being made to obtain a more favourable depreciation rate. A relevant factor in the case leading to the enactment of section EG 17(2) 12 was that the vendor had not retained any beneficial interest in the assets or any virtual ownership of them. 4.23 The Government proposes that objective criteria be enacted setting out the circumstances in which section EG 17 will not apply. These criteria will focus on the objective tests (fair market value, the purchaser’s purpose and use by the vendor) rather than whether or not there has been a bona fide sale. Avoidance 4.24 The general anti-avoidance rule in sections BG 1 and GB 1 of the ITA has two key elements – the determination of whether an arrangement constitutes tax avoidance and the ability of the Commissioner to counteract the arrangement through reconstruction of the parties’ tax affairs. 4.25 The first element is an objective test. The second element involves the Commissioner’s discretion. This format has been adopted in other avoidance provisions, such as section GC 22, relating to tax avoidance under the imputation rules. 4.26 The objective nature of the first element is consistent with self-assessment. In general, the interpretation of the anti-avoidance provisions by the Commissioner or by taxpayers will be either accepted by both parties or litigated in the courts to ascertain the boundaries of the rules. In practice, and at least in part to mitigate the effect penalties might have, taxpayers will assess whether an arrangement they have entered into is likely to be held to be an avoidance arrangement. 4.27 The Government’s view is that it is necessary to retain the discretion to reconstruct transactions. 13 Avoidance arrangements often involve multiple transactions between a number of taxpayers. Individual taxpayers who do not know the full extent of the arrangement cannot be expected to calculate the extent of the tax advantage achieved through the arrangement. It is therefore appropriate to retain the Commissioner’s discretion to recharacterise an avoidance arrangement as a post-assessment function. 12 CIR v Lys & Others (1988) 10 NZTC 5,107. 13 The Valabh Committee supported this approach in its discussion paper Key Reforms to the Scheme of the Tax Legislation, published in October 1991. The Commissioner’s discretions 25 4.28 Some avoidance provisions clearly specify the transaction to which they apply and the consequent tax treatment. Most of these provisions do not rely on the Commissioner exercising a discretion to reconstruct the transaction. An example is section GC 15(1), relating to fringe benefits provided by employers or associates of employers to associates of employees. Under the section the employee is deemed to receive a benefit. However, when the avoidance provision does not apply to a specific type of transaction, discretions to reconstruct are likely to be necessary. 4.29 The fact that the Commissioner has this post-assessment role in reconstructing taxpayers’ affairs should not alter the application of penalties to the calculation by taxpayers of their income tax liabilities. 26 CHAPTER FIVE OTHER ISSUES Key proposals in this chapter: • Provisions that allow retrospective spreading or retrospective adjustments will be amended to ensure that taxpayers are not restricted by the two-month time period for amendments to assessments. • The discretion in section DH 3 which allows the Commissioner to request additional records to those specified in relation to motor vehicle usage will be removed. • The need to retain section EC 1 relating to changes in accounting practice will be reviewed following submissions. • Section HG 8(l) will be amended to allow the Commissioner to recover an appropriate portion of tax from an electing shareholder in a qualifying company, rather than requiring the Commissioner to issue an assessment. • The requirement for a special tax code (sections NC 13 and 14) when an employee wishes to increase the rate of deduction from their income will be removed. 5.1 This chapter discusses changes that will be required to other provisions of the ITA in legislating for self-assessment. The provisions discussed generally contain discretionary powers. However, the need for the changes results not so much from the discretion itself, but from other administrative requirements in the section. 5.2 These provisions include: • retrospective spreading provisions, such as section EN 3, relating to assignments of copyright; • other retrospective adjustment provisions, such as section LC 4(1), which applies when an amount of a foreign tax credit cannot be determined at the time the return is required to be filed; • provisions containing record keeping requirements, such as section DH 3, relating to the use of logbooks for motor vehicles; • section EC 1, which allows adjustments for adopting an incorrect accounting practice; 27 • section HG 8(1), which allows the Commissioner to assess a person for the income tax liability of a qualifying company when that person has elected to be liable for the tax; and • sections NC 13 and 14, relating to special tax codes. Retrospective spreading provisions 5.3 Rules allowing allocation of income or expenditure from one income year to other income years are used widely in the ITA. These often apply to particular industries or activities, and allow taxpayers to spread income or expenditure received or paid in a lump sum over a more extended period. 5.4 Examples of these provisions are section EJ 1 (income from the sale of timber), section EN 3 (income from royalties and the granting of rights in a copyright), and section EN 4 (compensation received on acquisition of land by the Crown). Proposed treatment 5.5 The allocation of income or expenditure to preceding income years has implications for self-assessment. Once income or expenditure has been allocated to a previous income year, assessments must be adjusted retrospectively. There is some conflict between these provisions and the proposed amendment rules. It will be necessary to allow specifically for amendment by taxpayers of their assessment beyond the proposed period for amendments. 5.6 Generally speaking, allocation provisions were introduced when tax rates were more graduated than they are now. With the advent of relatively flat tax rates, allocation provisions are less likely to be used. Some allocation provisions will be reviewed in a discussion document on timing issues planned for release later this year. Other retrospective adjustments 5.7 Some provisions allow for the re-opening of an assessment if an amount subject to tax does not become known until after assessment. An example is in the second proviso to section LC 4(1), which allows retrospective amendment of a taxpayer’s assessment when the amount of a foreign tax credit for attributed foreign income could not be determined before the taxpayer’s return was required to be filed. Similarly, section CH 2(4) allows the Commissioner to alter an assessment if the value of a benefit under an employee share purchase agreement is removed or reduced in one of the prescribed circumstances. Retrospective adjustments are also required when income or expenditure is recharacterised following the application of an anti- avoidance provision. 28 5.8 Some of these adjustments are subject to the Commissioner’s four-year statute bar, others are not. Proposed treatment 5.9 As most adjustments will need to be made after the two-month timeframe for amendment of the assessment by the taxpayer, specific extensions to this period will need to be enacted. 5.10 The alternative to retrospective amendment is to allow current year adjustments for past year over-calculations or under-calculations of income and deductions. This would be simpler than allowing reassessments, but does not allow the matching of expenditure and income and is, therefore, not favoured. Record keeping requirements 5.11 In addition to the record keeping requirements in the TAA, the Commissioner has a discretion to require taxpayers to keep and produce further accounts or records in some specific instances. Section DH 3 sets out the requirements for motor vehicle logbooks. Section DH 3(2)(b) gives the Commissioner a discretion to require further records to be kept. Extra records required to be retained may include the name of the client visited, the specific purpose of the trip and the reason the travel was necessary. 5.12 Under section DJ 9, which makes specific provision for deductions for expenditure on scientific research, the Commissioner may refuse a deduction when insufficient records of expenditure have been retained. Proposed treatment 5.13 Other jurisdictions that have moved to self-assessment have extended their record keeping requirements as part of that move. However, Part III of the TAA already contains comprehensive record keeping requirements and it is not proposed to extend these further as part of codifying self-assessment. The burden of proof on taxpayers when an assessment is disputed should in itself provide the incentive to retain sufficient records of business transactions. 5.14 Section DH 3 clearly sets out the motor vehicle use records that should be retained, and it is proposed to retain these. The Government does propose, however, to remove the discretion to require taxpayers to retain extra details, as the section is already sufficiently prescriptive. 29 5.15 As section DJ 9 applies only to a limited type of activity, a definition of what constitutes sufficient records could be enacted. But, as section DJ 9 is the subject of a wider review of research and development expenditure, proposals for its amendment are not considered here. Change in accounting practice – section EC 1 5.16 Section EC 1 allows a current year adjustment of a taxpayer’s income tax liability when an incorrect accounting practice has been adopted in a previous year. It was intended that the section apply only when an assessment could not be made within the statutory timeframe for ordinary reassessments. However, the Court of Appeal held in Hutchinson Bros Ltd v CIR 14 that the section is subject to the four-year statutory time bar. The section, therefore, appears primarily to apply in situations already covered by the Commissioner’s general power to reassess. 5.17 Given the limitation placed on it by Hutchinson Bros, the scope of section EC 1 is unclear and it is appropriate to consider whether it should be retained. Submissions are therefore invited on the situations (not covered by the Commissioner’s general power to reassess) to which the section should apply. Qualifying companies – section HG 8(1) 5.18 A person may elect to be liable for the tax of a qualifying company (section HG 8(1)). The section provides that although the company is assessed for the tax in the first instance, the Commissioner may also assess that person and they will be liable as agent of the company. The discretion is designed for a tax system based on assessment by the Commissioner. Proposed treatment 5.19 The practical effect of the section could be achieved in a manner more consistent with self-assessment if it simply enabled the Commissioner to recover the company tax liability from the electing person. An example of a similar provision is section HK 11, which makes company directors and shareholders liable for the company’s income tax when an arrangement has the effect that the company is unable to satisfy its own tax liability. It is therefore proposed to replace section HG 8 with a provision that makes an electing person liable for the appropriate portion of a qualifying company’s tax liability if the qualifying company fails to pay the tax. 14 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,374. 30 Special tax codes – sections NC 13 and 14 5.20 Section NC 13 gives the Commissioner a discretion to reduce the amount of any PAYE deductions. The discretion can be exercised if the income from a particular period is not a true reflection of the annual income of an employee, resulting in an over-deduction or under-deduction. 5.21 In order to apply the discretion in section NC 13, the Commissioner has a further discretion in section NC 14 to issue a special tax code certificate to an employer who then makes the increased or decreased deductions. Proposed treatment 5.22 The discretion to issue special tax code certificates is inconsistent with self- assessment. The Commissioner issues certificates based on the information provided by the taxpayer. Instead of applying for a certificate, employees could simply notify their employers of the tax code, and, therefore, the level of PAYE deductions to be applied. 5.23 This could, however, create scope for employees deliberately to seek under- deductions of PAYE. To prevent this, the Commissioner’s discretion to issue tax code certificates for deductions at a lower rate needs to be retained. The Government proposes, however, to remove the requirement for special tax codes when employees wish to increase the rate of deduction from their income.
1 Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Bill Officials' Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill 25 August 1998 2 CONTENTS TAX SIMPLIFICATION 1 THE INCOME STATEMENT 2 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE PAYE SYSTEM 11 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE RWT SYSTEM 14 SIMPLIFYING EMPLOYER PAYE OBLIGATIONS 18 THE REBATE CLAIM FORM 26 OTHER ISSUES RAISED BY SUBMITTERS 29 OFFICIALS'SUBMISSIONS TO FEC 33 OTHER MATTERS 41 THIN CAPITALISATION 42 GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS 44 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND TAX PAID BEFORE 1 APRIL 1998 48 PAYE TAX TREATMENT FOR ELECTED MEMBERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES 49 MINOR CORRECTIONS 51 Tax Simplification 2 THE INCOME STATEMENT PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a certificate confirming total earnings. • Replace the income tax return (IR 5) with an income statement issued automatically by Inland Revenue to taxpayers who meet certain criteria, or on request. • Pre-code income statements with wage and salary information and other taxpayer-specific information obtained from employers during the year. • Require taxpayers who now complete an IR 3 tax return to complete a simplified version of the tax return. The main difference between the returns would be that wage and salary information would be pre-coded on the simplified return. • Require taxpayers to advise Inland Revenue of income that has had tax incorrectly deducted at source only if it exceeds $200. • Regard the income statement as an assessment at the terminal tax due date. • Credit refunds into a bank account rather than issue them by cheque. Issue: Need for annual contact with IR 5 taxpayers Submission (1 0 - ICANZ, 11 - New Zealand Employers' Federation, 16W - National Council of Women of New Zealand) • Inland Revenue should issue an income statement to all individual taxpayers who do not file an individual return. Income statements must be verified, signed and returned. It is not appropriate that even small debits and credits (subject to thresholds) are ignored. If this recommendation is not accepted, income statements should be issued to taxpayers for the first two income years after the system is introduced. (ICANZ) • All taxpayers should be issued with an income statement, and those who receive non-taxed income should be required to file an additional return. This would avoid the need for complex legislation that may be difficult for taxpayers to understand. If this is not undertaken, sufficient publicity will be required to educate taxpayers. (National Council of Women) 3 • Taxpayers should be issued with a statement identifying their gross earnings and tax paid. (Employers' Federation) Comment ICANZ believes that the compliance costs associated with receiving an income statement, verifying it, signing it, and sending it back to Inland Revenue are not significant. Officials consider that such a policy would offset the estimated $60 million reduction in taxpayer compliance costs brought about by the changes in filing requirements. Issuing income statements to all eligible taxpayers would bring many more taxpayers into the system than are currently in it, increasing compliance costs for many. These compliance costs include the 'psychic' costs incurred by many people when they receive correspondence from Inland Revenue and must actively consider their tax affairs. At present, Inland Revenue issues 1.45 million annual IR 5 tax returns, of which 1.2 million are returned. This number is expected to drop to around one million for the 1997/1998 income year. About 2 million taxpayers are eligible to file an IR 5 return at present. Were this recommendation to be implemented, Inland Revenue would have to contact about one million taxpayers who otherwise would not be contacted. It would also result in an increase in administrative costs. Issuing an income statement to all individual taxpayers and requiring those who receive non-taxed income to file an additional return would also result in increases in compliance and administrative costs. Officials consider that requiring many taxpayers to deal with two separate forms would create an unnecessary level of complexity for taxpayers. Inland Revenue will be undertaking a major publicity campaign to educate taxpayers about the operation of the new system and their rights and requirements under it. With regards to the Employers' Federation submission, taxpayers will be able to request an earnings certificate stating their total gross income and the total tax deducted. Officials consider that issuing these certificates only to those who request them will prevent unnecessary contact with taxpayers who would prefer not to be contacted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 4 Issue: Requirement for taxpayers to request income statements Submission (10 - ICANZ, 7 - Federated Farmers) The requirement outlined in the new section 80(C) for certain taxpayers to request an income statement should be removed. Comment The requirement is necessary because individual taxpayers know more about their specific tax circumstances than anyone else does. The Commissioner is not in a position to know all income details for all taxpayers, especially in the case of those who earn interest, since the Commissioner is unable to determine whether this interest is earned from a joint account. Therefore taxpayers must be required to inform Inland Revenue of any income that has had tax incorrectly deducted, subject to the $200 threshold. Measures will be adopted to help make taxpayers aware of their obligation to request an income statement. They include such measures as requiring financial institutions to detail the amount of interest taxed at 19.5% and to insert a statement indicating in what circumstances taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue on RWT deduction certificates. With respect to the possible imposition of penalties, if a taxpayer has taken reasonable care in arriving at a tax position, a shortfall penalty would not be applied, although any tax shortfall would be payable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Sufficiency of the $200 threshold Submission (7 - Federated Farmers) The adequacy of the $200 threshold should be reviewed after the new regime has been implemented. Comment The threshold represents a trade-off between revenue and administrative costs. The actual impact of this threshold is impossible to calculate until the income statement process has been in effect for a year. At that point it will be possible to determine the number of taxpayers required to return an amended income statement because they have income exceeding $200 which is not recorded on the income statement, and, if necessary, to set a more appropriate threshold. Until that time, officials consider a conservative threshold is appropriate. 5 After a year, officials will be in a position to calculate the administrative and compliance costs associated with the threshold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interpretation of the 5200 threshold Submission (10 - ICANZ, 16W - National Council of Women of New Zealand) • The new section 8OF should be rewritten to clarify whether the threshold applies to each of the three specified types of income or gross annual income from all sources in aggregate. (ICANZ) • Section 33A (1) (b) should be reworded so as to replace "and" at the end of every subparagraph with "or". (National Council of Women) Comment Officials agree that the wording of section 8OF can be improved. The intention of this section is that taxpayers who receive more than $200 of income in aggregate that has not had adequate tax deducted must request an income statement, whether this income is from wages and salary, interest, or dividends, or any combination of these income sources. Officials do not agree with the National Council of Women's submission to amend the proposed section 33A (1) (b) as this may result in a taxpayer who receives more than $200 of income with tax incorrectly deducted not being required to request an income statement. In the situation where, for example, a taxpayer derives $200 of wages and $200 of interest and $200 of dividends which has all had insufficient tax deducted, officials believe that the taxpayer should be required to request an income statement and declare this income. Recommendation That the submission relating to section 8OF be accepted and the submission relating to 33A (1) (b) be declined. 6 Issue: Clarification of when a tax position is taken Submission (10 - ICANZ) It should be clarified who is to interpret when a tax position is taken by implication in the new section 4A(1) (ca). This section refers to "a tax position taken explicitly or implicitly in the income statement". Comment The matter is to be interpreted by the Commissioner. Officials do not see a need to clarify this by way of a legislative amendment. A taxpayer has the right to dispute the Commissioner's position and, ultimately, can appeal to the courts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Circumstances likely to give rise to over-deduction of tax Submission (10 - ICANZ) • Income statements should also be automatically issued to taxpayers entitled to the child taxpayer rebate. • Inland Revenue should publicise circumstances likely to give rise to tax refunds. Comment It is not possible for Inland Revenue to accurately identify taxpayers who are eligible for the child taxpayer rebate, so these taxpayers cannot be automatically issued with an income statement. Officials agree that it is a good idea to educate taxpayers about what they will be required to do to receive the benefits of such rebates. However, instead of attempting to target education at specific taxpayers, Inland Revenue considers that a better approach is to publicise how the new system will operate and the steps that taxpayers must take to calculate their tax position and obtain any refunds. This will involve educating taxpayers as to their right to request an earnings certificate or an income statement. With regard to a taxpayer's eligibility to receive a deduction for income protection insurance, officials believe that there is an incentive for insurance companies to indicate this fact to taxpayers. 7 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Objections to income statements by taxpayers Submission (10 - ICANZ) Inland Revenue should clarify the procedure taxpayers must undertake to make an objection to information included on an income statement. Comment Taxpayers who object to any information on an income statement may contact Inland Revenue and provide the necessary information to correct the income statement. If they do not do this before the income statement is deemed to become an assessment, they can object by way of the dispute resolution procedures. Inland Revenue will be use advertising to educate taxpayers about the new system closer to its implementation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income statement legislation Submission (10 - ICANZ, 16W- National Council of Women of New Zealand) • The words "will not receive an income statement" should be removed from the amended section 33A and inserted in Part IIIA of the Tax Administration Act. (ICANZ) • Section 33A (1) should be rewritten to avoid the use of double negatives. (ICANZ) • The Commissioner should be required to provide an income statement by 30 June. (National Council of Women) Comment Section 33A stipulates which taxpayers are not required to file returns or are not required to be issued with income statements. Therefore officials consider that this is an appropriate section to include this requirement. 8 Officials agree that section 33A should be reworded to avoid the use of double negatives, which may create confusion. Inland Revenue expects that all income statements required to be issued automatically will be issued well before 7 February. Inland Revenue expects the first income statements to be issued around May 2000 for the 1999/2000 income year. The issue of accountability of the timing of income statements is not well addressed through legislative obligation. A more appropriate avenue for ensuring that this target is met on time is through the chief executive's performance agreement. This approach also allows consideration of the administrative capacity of the department. Recommendation That the submission to remove the double negatives in section 33A be accepted, but the submissions to amend Part IIIA and to shorten the required date by which Inland Revenue is required to issue an income statement be declined. Issue: Confirmation of refunds Submission (10 - ICANZ) The requirement in section MD 1 (IA) that taxpayers must confirm that the income statement is correct before they can be issued with a refund exceeding $50 should be removed. Comment This measure has been included to protect the taxpayer from the possibility of having to repay a significant amount of money or be subject to penalties. Officials consider that it is necessary for taxpayers to consider the accuracy of the income statement if they are due a significant refund. Since taxpayers may be less inclined to actively consider their tax position where a large refund is involved, requiring them to do so may help to prevent a future liability if the initial calculation of the refund turns out to be incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: Payment of refunds Submission (10 - ICANZ) • Refunds of different tax types should be able to be made to different bank accounts. • Taxpayers who operate stock and station agent accounts should have refunds paid by cheque. • The option of paying refunds with cheques should be retained. Comment At present, refunds of different tax types can be paid into different bank accounts. This will not be affected by the implementation of these changes. Officials note that stock and station agent accounts owned by taxpayers can be direct credited. To ensure payment to the account, taxpayers must supply the stock and station agent's bank account number and their own client number. Therefore there is no need for these taxpayers to receive refunds via cheque. The new section 184A however, provides for the Commissioner to make a refund by means other than direct credit if paying by direct credit would cause undue hardship to the taxpayer or is not practicable. Recommendation That the submission for refunds of different tax types to be able to be paid to separate accounts and the retention of a cheque option, if certain criteria are met, be accepted. That the submission that refunds to taxpayers with stock and station agent accounts be paid by cheque be declined. Issue: Information for agents Submission (10 - ICANZ) • Inland Revenue should: • allow for earnings certificates of clients to be automatically issued to agents; • consider providing agents with a schedule of taxpayer refunds. 10 Comment Officials acknowledge that there will be compliance cost benefits in making relevant taxpayer information available directly to agents. However, because the design of the income statement system has yet to be completed, Inland Revenue is not yet able to confirm the exact nature of the information that will be available or the form in which it will be transmitted. Therefore once these systems have been further developed, Inland Revenue will be able to consider the exact detail of such measures. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 11 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE PAYE SYSTEM PROPOSED POLICY • Simplify the employee declaration form • Introduce a new system of tax codes that is easier to understand. • Increase the non-declaration rate from 33 percent to 45 percent. • Remove the tax codes for special circumstances. Issue: Non-declaration rate Submission (3W - New Zealand Chambers of Commerce & Industry) The non-declaration rate should remain at 33%, otherwise incorrect tax deductions at source will occur, increasing costs for the taxpayer, the employer and the Inland Revenue. Comment The non-filing and income statement proposals depend on accurate PAYE and RWT systems. For these systems to work, taxpayers must provide their IRD numbers. This necessitates a non-declaration rate sufficient to give all taxpayers an incentive to comply with their obligations. A non-declaration rate above 33% is required if those subject to the various social policy measures administered through the tax system, especially those who have student loans, are to have any incentive to comply. An increased non-declaration rate may result in an initial increase in compliance costs for some employers because of the systems changes that may be required. However, these increases in initial costs can be offset by the reduction in costs caused by implementation of a clear rule relating to how to deal with non-declaration of a taxpayer's tax code. This prevents employers undertaking ad hoc measures to deal with employees who do not provide an IRD number. Given the strong incentive on employees to provide their number promptly, this measure will reduce the costs imposed on employers having to contact employees several times. Taxpayers will have the opportunity to request an income statement at the end of the income year. It will allow them to receive a refund of any over-paid tax if they have later supplied an IRD number after being taxed at the non-declaration rate. 12 Inland Revenue will be giving priority to applications from employees for IRD numbers. This will help reduce the risk of taxpayers having PAYE deducted at the non-declaration rate because of a delay in response to an IRD number request. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ability to match employers' records against Inland Revenue's records Submission (7 - Federated Farmers) Employers should be supplied with a schedule that shows a running total of gross wages and tax deductions for the year to date. This would provide a method of cross-checking Inland Revenue's and employers' records. Comment At the end of the year Inland Revenue will provide employers with a summary of the total gross payments and tax deductions which can be used to check against their payroll figures if they so wish. Officials do not consider that issuing such a summary at the end of every month is necessary. Employers who wish to receive-year-to date information may contact Inland Revenue at any time to acquire this information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Employee using an incorrect tax code Submission (16W - National Council of Women of New Zealand) Inland Revenue should notify the employee as well as the employer as per section NC 12A if an incorrect tax code is being used. This would allow the employee to request a special tax code if necessary. Comment When Inland Revenue detects the use of an incorrect tax code it will attempt to contact the employee initially. If this is unsuccessful it may then contact the employer and stipulate the appropriate tax code to be used. 13 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE RWT SYSTEM PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a new 33 percent withholding rate which taxpayers will be able to select if their income is expected to exceed $38, 000. • Increase the non-declaration rate from 33 percent to 45 percent. • Incorporate a statement in R WT certificates issued by financial institutions, informing taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue if insufficient tax has been deducted from their interest. 15 Issue: Implementation date for RWT elections Submissions (9W - ASB Bank) The election to apply RWT at 33% for taxpayers who have declared their IRD numbers should be able to be applied to interest payments from 1 January 1999. The ASB Bank believe it may impose greater costs if it is required to load an election into its system and store it until 1 April 1999 than if it is able to apply an election from when it is received. Comment Officials believe that not all financial institutions will be able to have systems in place by 1 January to allow an election by a taxpayer to be applied. Therefore allowing this recommendation could create confusion for some taxpayers if their bank is unable to apply their election until 1 April while other taxpayers' banks can apply their election. Allowing an election to apply from 1 January might also lead to the situation where taxpayers request a bank to back-date their election for the entire income year. Furthermore, this proposal would result in inconsistent, inequitable tax treatment across taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: IRD numbers for joint accounts Submission (10 - ICANZ) More than one IRD number should be lodged for accounts owned by more than one investor. Comment Officials consider that it is necessary to consider the compliance cost impact on financial institutions of this recommendation. Although it would enable Inland Revenue to include interest details on income statements, it would also impose excessive compliance costs on financial institutions. The proposals contained in the bill represent a compromise between the impact on financial institutions and the risk to voluntary compliance presented by incorrect deductions. Taxpayers with interest income will be required to declare that income, assuming they receive an income statement, only if it, and any other income they earned not included on the income statement, exceeds $200. For a taxpayer on the top 33% marginal tax rate, this means a revenue cost of $27. 16 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: RWT Certificates Submission (10 - ICANZ, 9W - ASB BANK) • The requirement to disclose interest subject to 19.5% withholding tax on the RWT deduction certificate should be removed. (9W – ASB Bank) • The requirement to include on the RWT deduction certificate a statement from the Commissioner referring to the need for a taxpayer to contact Inland Revenue should be more specific. (10 - ICANZ) Comment The requirement to disclose interest taxed at 19.5% is necessary to enable taxpayers to identify instances of tax being incorrectly deducted. Officials recognise that the proposals will increase the compliance costs imposed on financial institutions. They increase the complexity of RWT, but do not require the introduction of a whole new system on the part of financial institutions. Furthermore, financial institutions will benefit to the extent that the proposals increase the RWT deducted from certain groups of taxpayers, and they can retain those amounts until they are required to be paid to Inland Revenue. Although the proposals do increase compliance costs on financial institutions, they act to reduce compliance costs on both employers and wage and salary earners. Overall, then, compliance costs are decreased. To further alleviate these concerns, officials have proposed the use of a formula to enable interest payers to estimate the amount of interest taxed at 19.5% in order to reduce the compliance burden on them. Officials note that a draft statement to be included on RWT deduction certificates has been distributed to all interest payers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 Issue: Implementation date for RWT elections Submission (9W - ASB Bank) The date for taxpayer elections of the lower or higher rate of RWT should not be earlier than the current proposed date of 1 January 1999. Comment Officials consider that bringing forward the date on which interest payers must accept elections may impose significant costs on some financial institutions. Therefore no change is proposed to the current bill on this matter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 18 SIMPLIFYING EMPLOYER PAYE OBLIGATIONS PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a simplified monthly schedule. • Require employers to provide information on gross wages and PAYE deductions for all employees on a monthly basis. • Eliminate IR 12 and IR 13 forms. • Eliminate the end-of-year PAYE reconciliation. Issue: Electronic filing Submission (11 - Employers Federation, 3W - New Zealand Chambers of Commerce & Industry, 7 - Federated Farmers, 13W - Greg Keymer) • Employers should not be required to file the employer monthly schedule electronically unless they have over 20 employees and are twice-monthly payers of PAYE. This would give small employers certainty as to their filing requirements. (Chambers of Commerce) • The electronic filing of employer monthly schedules be voluntary. Federated Farmers are concerned that the costs incurred by the employer are not considered. (Employers' Federation, Federated Farmers) • Small employers should be given the option of filing electronically or manually. (Chambers of Commerce, Greg Keymer) • No employer should be forced to file electronically. Comment Officials consider that the bill is sufficiently clear. All employers who are twice-monthly payers of PAYE are required to file electronically, as outlined in section NC 15 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials believe making this requirement compulsory is necessary to ensure timely and accurate processing of the substantial amount of information large employers will provide. The new section 36B provides for the Commissioner to grant an exemption, however, for certain employers who would otherwise be required to file electronically. Providing for this discretion on the part of the Commissioner is necessary because there are likely to be employers who would experience significant compliance costs otherwise. 19 The exemption applies to employers who would face costs considered by the Commissioner to be material, whilst also having regard to the costs that other employers face, the costs Inland Revenue would incur if the employer filed manually, and the number of employees. If the number of employees is less than 100 for the 1999/2000 income year, or less than 50 for subsequent years, this exemption can apply. The Commissioner will provide further guidelines on what costs will be considered material once the format of the electronic filing methods has been finalised. It is crucial to the success of the proposals that the data in question are filed electronically. If this did not occur, the administrative costs imposed would seriously undermine the feasibility of the proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Implementation date of electronic filing Submission (3W - New Zealand Chambers of Commerce & Industry) Because the format of the electronic filing system has not yet been prescribed, and the system must be implemented in less than seven months, the requirement for employers to file electronically should be deferred to 1 April 2000. Comment Officials have identified that there is a risk of incurring systems errors if employers are not provided with adequate assistance in the implementation of the new system. Therefore a significant amount of Inland Revenue's implementation resources will be allocated to the provision of appropriate assistance and communications with affected employers. Inland Revenue will also be using its Relationship Managers, who currently work with major corporate taxpayers on a variety of issues, to work through the implementation of this system. Inland Revenue is also working with software developers and computer payroll personnel to develop a defined format for electronic filing. Recommendation That the submission be declined 20 Issue: Compliance costs associated with twice-monthly payment of PAYE Submission (7 - Federated Farmers, 11 - New Zealand Employers' Federation) • All employers should be permitted to make PAYE payments on a monthly basis to allow a reduction in compliance costs. (Federated Farmers, Employers Federation) • These payments should be required to be made by the 20'h of each month following the month in which the earnings were paid. (Federated Farmers) Comment Officials believe the compliance cost reduction would be of a relatively minor nature. In many cases large employers actually receive a net benefit from the deduction of PAYE. This is because of the interest they are able to earn on the deductions before the PAYE collected is paid to Inland Revenue. Thus such a proposal would only serve to increase the benefits that large employers receive, while reducing the amount of Government revenue in net present value terms. It would provide little or no benefit to small employers. Although requiring those paying fortnightly to provide an employer schedule rather than a pay-in slip would reduce their compliance costs, it would be very difficult for the administration to handle the amount of information it would be receiving. It would allow very little time for Inland Revenue to process information before further information was received from the same employer. Officials believe that if the Government wished to reduce compliance costs and suffer a resulting negative revenue impact, it would be better served by targeting a measure at smaller employers. Inland Revenue will be considering measures to reduce compliance costs on small businesses in the near future. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Liability for incorrect tax code declaration Submission (7 - Federated Farmers) Employers should not be held liable for incorrect PAYE deductions if they are based on an employee's incorrect tax code declaration. Comment Inland Revenue will monitor the monthly information it receives from employers and when it identifies that an incorrect tax code has been used it will contact the employee. Use of an incorrect tax code will result in employees being provided with an income statement at the end of the income year to ensure their tax liability is assessed correctly. Therefore an employer will not be liable if an employee provides an incorrect tax code. 21 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Flexibility during transition to new system Submission (7 - Federated Farmers, 11 - New Zealand Employers' Federation) • There should be a transitional period in which a degree of tolerance and flexibility is provided as employers become acquainted with the new regime. (Federated Farmers) • The new sections 139A and 139AA do not allow for any flexibility in applying penalties. (Employers' Federation) Comment Officials note that there is scope for discretion on the part of the Commissioner with respect to the imposition or remission of penalties for late filing or non-electronic filing. The amended section 139A allows the Commissioner discretion in applying a late filing penalty. Remission of both these penalties is provided for in the amended section 183A. Recommendation That the submission be declined because the concerns raised are addressed through appropriate remission provisions. Issue: Costs to employers of electronic filing Submission (10 - ICANZ, 11 - New Zealand Employers' Federation) • The costs of upgrading from a manual to electronic payroll, or refining existing software, to comply with the new filing requirements should be funded by the Government. (Employers' Federation. ICANZ) • Alternatively, any software costs should be fully depreciable in the year in which they are incurred. (Employers' Federation) 22 Comment Officials consider that the exemption available in the new section 36B will sufficiently target those employers who would face excessive compliance costs if required to file electronically. One of the selection criteria that Inland Revenue is using in its decision as to what the prescribed electronic format for electronically filing will be, is that the cost of the software for employers is kept as low as possible. Therefore officials do not believe that it will be necessary for the Government to fund the costs involved with electronic filing. With respect to the deductibility of these software costs, the existing deductibility provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply. Therefore all costs incurred will be fully deductible. Whether they are deductible immediately or over time via depreciation depends on whether the expenditure is of a revenue or capital nature. Officials do not consider that offering a specific deduction for these expenses would be justified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Options for filing electronically Submission (10 - ICANZ) • If the costs to employers of complying with electronic filing are not borne by the Government, more than one format should be prescribed by the Commissioner as acceptable. • When finalising the details of the electronic filing options, provision should be made for employers that may have difficulty in complying. Comment Officials agree that allowing more than one format for electronic filing is desirable. Inland Revenue is currently considering various options and will inform employers of the relevant details when the options have been finalised. Officials understand that many employers may experience difficulty when attempting to comply with the new requirements. Inland Revenue will be using resources to educate and assist employers with the transition. 23 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Adjustments for errors Submission (10 - ICANZ) The system must be able to deal with errors that are detected after the filing of an employer monthly schedule. Comment Amendments correcting errors can be made by re-submitting the appropriate employer monthly schedule or by making adjustments in later schedules, provided the error is detected before the final employer monthly schedule for the income year is submitted. Officials consider a legislative change would be useful in clarifying how errors will be corrected. Officials recommend that the definition of 'employer monthly schedule' be amended to include errors identified by the employer in relation to an earlier PAYE period in the same income year. No legislative amendment is proposed for corrections detected after the end of the income year. This will leave the communication of errors detected after the end of the end of the income year to the discretion of the Commissioner and the taxpayer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exemption from electronic filing Submission (10 - ICANZ) The number of employees referred to in the new section 36B should be specified as full time equivalent employees. This would prevent employers of large numbers of casual employees from having to upgrade from a manual payroll system to a computerised system. Comment The objective of the proposal is to ensure that employers with large numbers of employees, whether temporary, casual or part-time, provide information electronically. Exempting employers of casual employees from this requirement would mean that some large employers might still provide information in a manual form. Even so, some flexibility is appropriate for employers with large numbers of employees for short-periods - such as an orchardist who employs extra staff for the picking and pruning seasons. Officials recommend that if the exemption is to apply, the daily weighted average of the number of employees (whether full-time, temporary, casual or part-time) for the year should 24 not exceed 100 in the 1999/2000 income year, or 50 in subsequent years. For example, an employer of 200 staff for 60 days and 80 staff for 305 days would have, on average each day 99.72 employees \[((200 staff x 60 days ) + (80 staff x 305 days)) / 365)l and therefore may apply for the exemption in the 1999/2000 year. To minimise compliance costs when staff numbers continually fluctuate, officials recommend that Inland Revenue have a discretion not to require the calculation if it considers, from other information provided by the employer, that the employer would meet this requirement. Officials also recommend that an exemption from electronic filing continue to apply until the employer considers he/she no longer meets the threshold or the exemption is cancelled, except if the employer had over 50 employees and fewer than 100 employees in the 1999/2000 year. Finally, to prevent the cancellation of the exemption resulting in an immediate obligation on the employer to file electronically, officials propose that electronic filing must begin on the later of six months after cancellation or the start of the subsequent income year. In the case of those with more than 50 employees but fewer than 100 in the 1999/2000 year, no grace period should apply, as it is clear they will have to begin filing electronically in the 2000/2001 year. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the method of counting the number of employees be clarified, that the exemption does not have to be renewed each year, and that employers have a minimum of six months or the start of the next income year to begin filing electronically. Officials recommend that these measures, except for the employee counting rule, should not apply to employers with more than 50 but fewer than 100 employees in the 1999/2000 income year. Issue: Bonuses and executive salaries Submission (10 - ICANZ) • Provision should be made for executive salaries and bonuses that are not included in current payroll systems to be filed separately. • Different passwords should be required for different types of accounts. 25 Comment There will be scope in the new system for these payments to be filed separately. Employers will be able to request a separate IRD number and file this information under a separate name. This will allow this information to be filed on a separate employer monthly schedule. This process will enable separate passwords to be used for each payroll system. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 26 THE REBATE CLAIM FORM PROPOSED POLICY • Introduce a new claim form for donation and housekeeper-childcare rebates. • Continue the existing annual maximum claim thresholds. • Limit the amount of donations and housekeeper-childcare payments that can be claimed to the amount of taxable income, up to a maximum of $1,500 for donations and $940 for the housekeeper-childcare rebates in the year before payments. • Repeal the extra pay rebate. Issue: Separation of the rebate claim form Submission (10 - ICANZ, 16W - National Council of Women of New Zealand) • Individual return filers (currently IR 3 taxpayers) should be able to claim donations and childcare rebates in a tax return. If this is not acceptable, the deadline for filing the rebate claim form should be extended to 31 Marc tie following year. (ICANZ) • There should be provision to E-file rebate claim forms. (ICANZ) • All taxpayers should be issued with a rebate claim form. (National Council of Women) Comment The abolition of IR 5 tax returns will mean that many taxpayers will no longer be required to have contact with Inland Revenue. For these people to claim rebates without having to file a return or request an income statement a separate rebate form is necessary. Having a separate rebate claim form for all taxpayers, regardless of whether they are required to file returns, maintains the simplicity of the new system. If a taxpayer changes from one who has no contact with Inland Revenue to one who must file a return, or vice versa, the taxpayer may become confused about whether a rebate claim form must be filed in order to claim rebates. Therefore having all taxpayers subject to the same rebate claim requirement avoids undue complexity. 27 Officials consider the new rebate claim form to be very simple and easy to complete. Therefore agents should not have to complete this new form as individuals will be able to do it themselves. Maintaining the 30 September deadline will help to relieve agents of the burden of completing these forms and will allow them to ensure their resources are used on higher value added tasks. For those who do wish to use agents to administer their rebate claim forms the option of E-filing the claims may be satisfactory to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will consider this an option. Recommendation That the submissions to allow rebates to be claimed via the individual tax return and for the rebate claim deadline to be extended be declined. Issue: Donations rebate Submission (4 - Inter Church Working Party on Taxation, 5 - Philanthropy New Zealand) • The maximum claim limits should be increased to allow for inflation and because of the increasing use of donations to fund activities that were previously taxpayer funded. • This increase would also assist in offsetting the fact that fewer taxpayers will be reminded of their entitlement to claim the donations rebate. Comment The proposals are aimed at reducing the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers. Considering issues in relation to the thresholds and maximum claims that can be made under the various rebates is outside the scope of these proposals. With respect to taxpayers' reduced awareness of their rebate entitlement, Inland Revenue will be putting resources into advertising and communicating the changes in taxpayer requirements when they are introduced. As a supporting administrative measure, rebate claim forms will be automatically distributed to all taxpayers who made a claim in the previous year. Separating the claiming of rebates from the income tax system may allow charities to distribute rebate claim forms to those from whom they receive donations, further ensuring that taxpayers who wish to make a claim will have ready access to a claim form. At present, 15 percent of IR 5 tax returns are filed simply so taxpayers can claim these rebates. This places compliance costs on taxpayers, costs that will be avoided by using a stand-alone form. This new process would also bring administrative benefits to Inland Revenue, as the department would not have to issue an income statement merely for the purpose of allowing a rebate to be claimed. 28 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Deadline for taxpayers with a non-standard balance date Submission (10 - ICANZ) The new section 41A should be amended by replacing the words "in the case of other taxpayers" in subparagraph (6) (b) with "in the case of taxpayers with a balance date between 1 April and 30 September". Comment Rebates allowable under sections KC 4 and KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 are calculated from qualifying payments made during the taxpayer's income year. The proposed section 41A ensures that taxpayers with a balance date other than 31 March have six months to file their rebate claim form to be eligible to receive a rebate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 OTHER ISSUES RAISED BY SUBMITTERS Issue: Tax codes for special circumstances Submission (10 - ICANZ, 7 - Federated Farmers) • The tax codes SSH, CAW and SHR should be retained. • If these codes are removed they should be replaced by a means of enabling accurate tax deductions for casual workers in the new system. This would be the introduction of a new code, CS, for casual workers, which attempts to apply the appropriate average tax rate to an employee's wages. This should apply to all casual employees, not merely those in the agricultural industry. Comment Submissions on the Government discussion paper Simplifying Taxpayer Requirements generally supported the removal of these codes. Removal of the codes was presented as an option rather than a firm proposal because of the potential issues now being highlighted in the submissions received by the Committee. The concerns regarding removal of the codes include the resulting inaccuracy of deductions and the fact that the codes allow a simple tax deduction calculation by an employer, thus preventing an increase in compliance costs which would occur if these employers were required to use PAYE tables. Officials consider that the concerns being raised can be addressed by retention of a tax code for casual agricultural employees, which will adequately address these concerns. Officials propose a single code, casual agricultural employee (CAE), which would have a flat rate of 21%. This code would apply to all employees to whom the current codes CAW, SHR, and SSH apply. The rate of 21% is used to bring it in line with the middle effective marginal rate, and therefore to avoid the need for these taxpayers to request an income statement unless they earn more than $38,000. With respect to the submission concerning different casual codes, officials note that employees can currently apply for a special tax code for this purpose. These codes will be easier to apply for in the future, and employees will be able to do this via the telephone. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that a single code for agricultural employees which has a rate of 21 % be retained. 30 Issue: Contact with family assistance recipients Submission (10 - ICANZ) Inland Revenue should maintain appropriate contact with family assistance recipients to ensure that when a change in circumstances gives rise to an obligation to deregister they are reminded to do so. Comment Officials believe that the benefits from the reduction in compliance costs from relieving recipients from their obligation to complete an annual application form outweighs the likely effects of recipients failing to indicate when there is a change in their family circumstances. To ensure those who receive family assistance are reminded of their obligations, they will be contacted regularly throughout the year, as at present. Recipients of family assistance will all receive an income statement and so will be under an obligation to declare their tax position. Given the increased information available to the Commissioner through the employer monthly schedule, the scope for Inland Revenue to detect any changes in a taxpayer's circumstances promptly will be greatly increased. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: System implementation Submission (10 - ICANZ) The new system should be phased in gradually. Employers should continue with annual reconciliations and the issuing of IR 12s and IR 13s to 31 March 2000. Income statements should be prepared and issued using these reconciliations, and employers then be required to comply with the current proposals from 1 April 2000. 31 Comment While the proposals require Inland Revenue's PAYE systems to be amended by 1 April 1999, the bulk of system and other process amendments are required to be in place by 1 April 2000. Inland Revenue has undertaken a major exercise to establish the implications of these measures. This review established the system and organisational changes required by the proposals and the effort required to successfully implement the necessary amendments. On the basis of this review, Inland Revenue considers it has the capability to deliver required changes by the implementation dates chosen by the Government. Inland Revenue will be undertaking a major education campaign and providing assistance to taxpayers affected by the changes, particularly employers, to ensure that taxpayers are able to comply with the changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: IR 56 Taxpayers (Home care workers and embassy workers) Submission (10 - ICANZ) The treatment of these taxpayers under the new system should be clarified Comment To incorporate IR 56 taxpayers into the new system, section NC 16 (a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to provide for these taxpayers to furnish an employer monthly schedule instead of a IR 66N return. IR 56 taxpayers are also relieved of the obligation to undertake an annual reconciliation. Other than these changes there are no specific changes for IR 56 taxpayers. Those who are private domestic workers will continue to file tax returns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 32 Issue: ACC reconciliation return Submission (10 - ICANZ) Compliance costs for employers may be reduced if ACC obtained the necessary information directly from Inland Revenue and then assessed taxpayers. Comment While Inland Revenue will have considerable PAYE details, it will not hold information such as the appropriate ACC codes. This means employers must complete a return, although they will be supported in this activity as Inland Revenue will provide summary PAYE details to them. At the end of each income year all employers will be issued with a summary of total gross wage and salary payments and total tax deductions for each employee. This will act to reduce employer compliance costs over the current position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Withholding tax and contractors Submission (7 - Federated Farmers) Inland Revenue should investigate the effects of this bill's proposals on the current withholding payment regime. Inland Revenue should investigate and resolve the current problems associated with verifying the tax status of contractors and potential liabilities. Comment Officials note that this bill does not have any implications for the withholding payment regime. The submission to resolve issues with the withholding payments regime is outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 OFFICIALS'SUBMISSIONS TO FEC Issue: Provision to allow small employers to file electronically Submission (Officials) A provision should be inserted to allow small employers to voluntarily choose to file an employer monthly schedule electronically. Comment Currently the provision relating to filing the employer monthly schedule does not provide scope for an employer who is only required to pay PAYE to Inland Revenue monthly (a small employer) to file electronically. This was unintended. Employers who wish to file the employer monthly schedule electronically should be able to do so. Recommendation That a provision be inserted to allow small employers to elect to file the employer monthly schedule electronically- Issue: Provision of remittance certificate electronically Submission (Officials) Section NC 15 should be amended to provide scope for electronic lodgement of remittance certificates. Comment As currently drafted, section NC 15 does not provide for electronic lodgement of remittance certificates owing to the requirement that such certificates be signed. This reflects the fact that currently the Commissioner is not in a position to receive that information electronically. However, this position is likely to change in the future, so it would appear sensible to provide scope for electronic provision. To achieve this, the proposed section NC 15 (1) should be amended to remove the references to the remittance certificate having to be signed by the employer. A new section NC 15 (2B), providing that only non-electronic remittance certificates must be signed by the employer, is required. 34 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying the election of the 33% deduction rate for RWT purposes Submission (Officials) The proposed section NF 2A should be re-worded to make it clear that the election for the 33% deduction rate applies to accounts, rather than the current provision's application to a payment. Comment The current wording of section NF 2A requires an election in relation to a payment of interest. This effectively requires an election for each interest payment by the taxpayer. This was not intended and officials propose an amendment to allow an election in relation to a payment or payments (effectively by account). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Removal of need to retain a signed hard-copy of employer monthly schedule Submission (Officials) Employers should not be required to keep a paper copy of an employer monthly schedule filed electronically. Comment For larger employers who are required to file electronically, the employer monthly schedule could be a substantial document. As the draft legislation is currently worded, employers must retain a paper copy of this document. Officials consider that employers should be able to retain an electronic copy of the employer monthly schedule as a substitute for a paper copy. This will reduce compliance costs on employers, possibly significantly in the case of very large employers. To ensure that employers do not have to retain a paper copy of the employer monthly schedule the following amendments are required: 35 • to section 23 of the Tax Administration Act, to exclude employers from having to retain a signed hard copy of each employer monthly schedule they provide to Inland Revenue. • to section 24, which covers records to be kept by employers, to allow electronic retention of records. • inclusion of a new subsection in section 40, to remove the requirement that electronic returns must be signed. • to section 36(3), to remove the requirement to a hard-copy of any employer monthly schedule furnished in accordance with section 36A. • to section 110(2), to provide that a hard-copy of information transmitted in accordance section 36A is sufficient evidence of the information electronically transmitted. • removal of clause 10 of the bill, as this clause effectively requires employers to keep a paper copy of the employer monthly schedule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Non-New Zealand sourced interest or dividends Submission (Officials) Taxpayers who receive New Zealand sourced wages or salary, interest, or dividends and non- New Zealand sourced interest and dividends should not be required to file a tax return or receive or request an income statement if the amount of gross annual income that has had tax incorrectly deducted does not exceed $200. Comment Taxpayers who earn salary and wages and/or interest and dividends sourced solely from New Zealand and who earn $1 or more of non-New Zealand sourced interest and dividends, must file an IR 3 tax return. This, in effect. removes them from the non-filing system. Officials propose these taxpayers should be included in the non-filing system. This would mean that they would not be required to request an income statement if their overseas interest and dividends and any other income that has had tax under-deducted does not exceed $200 and provided the other non-filing criteria apply. If income has had tax under-deducted they would be required to request that an income statement be issued. Upon receipt of an income statement they would be required to return details of their non-New Zealand sourced income to ensure that their tax liability can be accurately calculated. 36 These taxpayers will be tied into the standard $200 income threshold so as to avoid unnecessary complexity for individual taxpayers. The revenue loss from not requiring these taxpayers to file is estimated to be less than $110,000. This arises as in the majority of cases interest or dividends will be sourced from countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). This means that New Zealand will give credits for tax withheld at source. In many cases these credits will mean that there is little or no tax left to pay to Inland Revenue. The effect of this proposal is that it will reduce compliance costs on those taxpayers who would otherwise have to file an individual return, and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Based on 1996 figures, this measure removes up to 5,000 taxpayers from the obligation of having to file an IR 3 return. A further maximum of 27,000 would be required to request a simple income statement. Those taxpayers who wished to claim losses from overseas would still be required file an individual return. Present figures indicate that about 180 taxpayers would remain as individual return filers because they claim losses from overseas. Inland Revenue will target education campaigns at those who earn foreign sourced interest or dividends to ensure that they are aware of their requirement to declare any foreign sourced interest or dividends that does not come under the $200 threshold so as to inform taxpayers of the need to request an income statement. This will involve fewer than 27,000 taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: ACC to make a return as an employer Submission (Officials) Amendments to correct the section references used in the bill in respect of measures related to the ACC are required. These incorrect references arise because of consequential amendments that were not made to earlier bills. Comment Officials propose several minor amendments to clause 17 the bill regarding section 46 of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • Subsection 4, subparagraph (iv) refers to "earnings related compensation". This is now known as "weekly compensation". • Sections 38, 39 and 43 referred to in subparagraph (v) are contained in the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, not the Accident Compensation Corporation Act 1982. 37 • The vocational allowance referred to in paragraph (v) has been repealed. • The references to sections 58,59,60 and 138 are unnecessary as they are covered by the reference to weekly compensation payable under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act in subparagraph (iv). As these amendments are in effect correcting consequential amendments arising from previous legislation, these errors exist currently in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Officials recommend that the amendments above be applied to the existing section 46 (6) (c). Because of the nature of the provision there is no need for these amendments to be retrospective. They can apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: RWT Formula Submission (Officials) The bill should be amended to allow for interest payers to use a formula to estimate the amount of interest that was taxed at 19.5%. Comment The requirement to state the amount of interest earned at 19.5% figure is intended only as a guide to whether a taxpayer may need to request an income statement. It is not used in any income or tax calculation. Therefore the compliance costs that can be imposed on financial institutions to provide that information must be considered carefully. In discussion, the Bankers' Association indicated that the requirement for interest payers to state the exact amount of interest that was taxed at 19.5% will impose significant compliance costs on some interest payers. Officials consider this compliance cost should be reduced. Officials have established a simple decision tree and a formula which approximates the result that would arise if a financial institution actually tracked the withholding applied to each dollar of interest. Overall, the use of the formula will result in estimations which are considered by officials to be satisfactory. To allow for the use of this formula an amendment is required to allow the Commissioner to accept a formula instead of an actual amount of RWT deducted at 19.5%. This requires an amendment to section 25 (6) (g) so that RWT deduction certificates using this formula comply with the legislation. 38 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Start and stop dates for interest calculation Submission (Officials) The lodgement date for income statements should be deemed to be the date on which an income statement was issued. Comment Part VII of the Tax Administration Act provides that interest on overpaid tax begins on the later of the due date for the payment of the tax or the date the tax return is filed. The purpose of this measure is to prevent Inland Revenue having to pay interest to taxpayers who are due significant refunds which the department cannot refund as no return has been filed. In effect, this provision prevents the Crown being exposed to increasing unquantified interest on possible refunds. Officials consider a similar provision is required in the case of income statements. For the interest provisions of the compliance and penalties legislation to be applied to the new income statement process, the lodgement date should be deemed to be the date on which the income statement was issued by Inland Revenue. This is regardless of whether the income statement was requested or automatically issued. If a taxpayer returns an amended income statement resulting in a new income statement being issued, the lodgement date should be deemed to be the date the initial income statement is issued. Part VII also provides that interest on an overpayment ceases on refund of the overpayment. For refunds exceeding $50 arising from the issue of an income statement, officials propose that the date the interest period ceases is the date the taxpayer can claim the refund, not the date it is actually claimed. As with the interest commencement provision, the intention is to prevent payments of interest on amounts taxpayers can choose to have refunded should they wish. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 39 Issue: Nominated persons Submission (Officials) Section 81(4) (1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to allow persons to nominate another person (the "nominated person") to take care of their tax affairs on their behalf by telephone as well as in writing. Comment At present, nominated persons are able to act on behalf of another taxpayer only if they have been nominated in writing by that taxpayer. With the increasing use of telecommunications systems, officials believe that it is appropriate that the legislation be amended to allow persons to nominate another to act on their behalf via the telephone. This would reduce taxpayer compliance costs and greatly reduce the time taken for tax affairs to be dealt with. If this proposal is adopted, the systems will be designed so that security of a taxpayer's affairs is maintained by the use of confidential passwords applying to both the nominating and nominated persons. A number of questions will be asked over the phone to ensure correct identification of persons nominating another to act on their behalf. A letter will be issued to the persons nominating another to act on their behalf to confirm the nomination, to provide a further check on the nomination, and to provide a permanent record to the taxpayer. Implementing this measure will require section 81(4)(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to be amended so that the words "or in another method as prescribed by the Commissioner" are included. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: minor omissions Submission (Officials) A number of minor errors in the draft legislation have been identified. Comment • The amendments to the definition of "non-filing taxpayer" requires amendment to cover taxpayers not required to receive an income statement. • Section NC 15(2) needs amendment to omit an unnecessary "by". 40 • Section 36B (1) needs insertion of a reference that the Commissioner's authority to authorise non-electronic filing of the employer monthly schedule relates only to those required to file electronically. • Section 36B(2)(d) needs amending by substituting "current income year" for "income current year". • Section NC 6 needs amending to set the rate of deduction paid under section 303 of the Education Act 1989. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement that information be provided on Inland Revenue form Submission (Officials) A provision should be inserted to require those filing paper employer monthly schedules to complete the form provided by Inland Revenue. Comment The change to the employer monthly schedule, with its increased information provision, places a significant obligation on Inland Revenue to process the information it receives both accurately and in a timely manner. This information will become the basis of income statements prepared by the Commissioner for approximately 300,000 taxpayers. To ensure accurate, timely processing of the employer monthly schedule, the schedules issued by Inland Revenue will contain various information for tracking the forms through departmental processes and is likely, in the future, to contain significant amounts of information in bar code form. Given the inclusion of this additional information on the return, officials recommend that employers be required to return the form issued by Inland Revenue. At present, some employers print their own forms. The continuation of employers using their payroll package to generate their own form under the new system is not feasible as the coding information cannot be generated by a pay-roll package. Even if it could, Inland Revenue would be required to establish manual checking procedures to ensure that information provided was in fact correct. Furthermore, the department has already encountered major problems with the quality of paper, the types of ink used and the fonts in forms prepared by employers, problems that have often required manual intervention. Were employers to continue to print their own forms, these problems would likely increase in significance under the new system. 41 To balance the proposed restriction, officials note that employers will now have new options as to provision of information to Inland Revenue: • manual completion of the pre-printed form provided by Inland Revenue; • online transfer of an employer monthly schedule, file directly from the employer's payroll package; • online completion of employer monthly schedule, probably using internet technology. Officials believe in most cases where employers have the necessary technology to print the information to exact IRD specifications they would also have the technology to file electronically, which is the preferred option for speed, accuracy and both compliance and administrative cost minimisation. Recommendation That a provision be inserted requiring employers to compete the employer monthly schedule provided by the Commissioner rather than prepare their own form. 42 Other Matters 43 THIN CAPITALISATION Issue: Extension of on-lending concession to associated persons Clause 44 Section FG 6(1A) Page27 Submission (10-ICANZ; 14-Toyota Finance New Zealand Limited) 1. Section FG 6(IA) does not achieve its intended objective and should be redrafted (ICANZ, Toyota Finance). 2. There should be no requirement for an associated person to which a loan is made to be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the on-lending concession is to apply (ICANZ). Comment Section FG 6(IA) is intended to extend the on-lending concession in the thin capitalisation rules to loans made to associated persons, provided those persons are subject to the thin capitalisation rules and are not members of the taxpayer's New Zealand group. This ensures that debt originating from a single source is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules separately in the hands of two different companies. Officials agree that redrafting of section FG 6(IA) is required if the intent of the amendment is to be effected (the first submission point). However, officials do not consider it appropriate to remove the requirement for associated persons to be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the on-lending concession is to apply (the second submission point). Officials agree that if on-lending is done at arm's length rates, likely avoidance opportunities will be reduced. However, because such opportunities will not be eliminated completely, it is prudent to retain the requirement that the associated person be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Transactions involving associates have the greatest potential for circumventing the rules. Officials note further that the requirement for the associated person to be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the concession is to apply is likely to be of only limited practical consequence. It would require quite an artificial structure for an associated person to be not subject to the thin capitalisation rules, and it is unlikely, therefore, that it will impact on commercial structures. Recommendation That submission point one be accepted, but that submission point two be declined. 44 Issue: Rules for determining New Zealand parent Clause 43 Section FG 4(11) Page 26 Submission (1 - Chapman Tripp) The rules concerning the ability to group a foreign company's New Zealand branch operation with its New Zealand subsidiaries should be clarified. Comment The rules for identifying a taxpayer's New Zealand group are intended to ensure that groups for thin capitalisation purposes are determined consistently. In other words, if Company A's New Zealand group includes Company B, Company B's New Zealand group should include Company A. This prevents companies from manipulating the thin capitalisation rules through their choice of grouping arrangements. The submission identifies an anomaly if a non-resident has a branch operation in New Zealand and also controls a New Zealand subsidiary. The rules currently require the branch to include the subsidiary in its New Zealand group, but generally exclude the branch from the New Zealand group of the subsidiary. This result was unintended, and a clarifying amendment is desirable to remove the anomaly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS Issue: Scope of the amendment Clauses 42 and 47 Submission (8 - Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The amendment should not proceed. If there is a problem with revenue account investment in passive funds, the solution should address it specifically, and not make a major broad-brush change to the group investment funds regime to treat the group investment fund effectively as a unit trust/company in relation to superannuation funds' investment. The amendment will mean that superannuation funds investing in passive group investment funds on capital account will pay tax on their capital gains. Comment Investors who hold their investments in a listed group investment fund on capital account will not pay tax on any capital gains, if they sell their units on the market. Three of the largest passive group investment funds are listed: TENZ (NZ Equity), AMP WINZ (International Equity) and Tower Tortis Ozzy (Australian Equity). Investments in these three funds accounted for $735 million of the approximately $1 billion invested in passive group investment funds as at 31 March 1998. Therefore superannuation funds which invest in passive group investment funds on capital account will not be taxed on capital gains if they invest in a listed fund and sell their investment on the market. Superannuation funds investing in passive group investment funds on revenue account are not paying tax on their gains. This is a loophole, which the proposed amendment will close. As noted in the commentary to the bill, it is arguable that removing superannuation funds from "designated sources" should have occurred along with the 1989 changes to superannuation taxation. The solution treats superannuation fund investments the same as all other 4 G commercial" type investments in a group investment fund. This is the same tax treatment as for investors in unit trusts and companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 Issue: Incentives for retirement savings Clauses 42 and 47 Submission (12 - Trustee Corporations Association) Superannuation funds should not be removed from the definition of "designated sources" as such a move will not encourage or promote retirement savings, but instead will be a disincentive to investors saving for their retirement in a responsible manner through the use of professionally managed superannuation funds. Comment As the submitter points out, individual investors will still be able to make tax-free capital gains if they invest on capital account in a passive group investment fund that is listed, and they sell their investment on the market. However, this treatment also applies to superannuation funds which invest in listed group investment funds on capital account. They will also be able to obtain tax-free capital gains by selling their investment on the market. However, it is not appropriate for superannuation funds investing in group investment funds on revenue account to obtain tax-free gains. Revenue account gains are taxable, whether they are made by individuals, superannuation funds or other entities. The proposed amendment will close this loophole. It is interesting to note that there was no submission from the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand on this issue, nor in relation to the proposed amendment generally. The submitter represents the four trustee companies (through which group investment funds are formed) and the Public Trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of the amendment Clauses 42 and 47 Submission (8 - Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) If the amendment is to proceed, it should be deferred either: • until there has been a specific review of the group investment fund taxation provisions; or 47 • at the very least, until completion of the Government's review of the tax treatment of superannuation funds investing through other superannuation funds. Comment Superannuation funds investing on revenue account in passive group investment funds and passive superannuation funds has the potential to create a significant revenue cost. The current tax advantage for this type of investment is creating distortions in the financial markets, with greater levels of investment from superannuation funds being diverted into passive group investment funds and passive superannuation funds, than passive unit trusts or other investments. There is no reason to delay an amendment to the group investment fund rules because the Government has signalled that it will be considering a proposed solution to investment in superannuation funds, following consultation. At the time of the introduction of the proposed changes to the group investment fund rules, the Government announced that a paper would be circulated shortly on treatment of superannuation fund investment into superannuation funds. The issues and potential solutions relating to superannuation fund investment in other super funds are more complex than for group investment funds. It is not appropriate to delay making amendments until there is a wider review of the group investment fund rules. It is important to address the loophole now because of the significant revenue cost. Making a legislative change will also give superannuation funds greater certainty about their tax treatment as they have been expecting the Government to address the problem for some time now. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Available subscribed capital Clauses 42 and 47 Submission (8 - Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc) In the event the amendment does proceed, the Income Tax Act should provide explicitly for the value of a unit in a GIF immediately prior to the application date of the amendment to be the available subscribed capital once the amendment becomes effective. Comment The effect of the proposed amendment is to change an investment that is subject to trust tax treatment to one that is subject to company tax treatment. The definition of available subscribed capital, which applies to company share repurchases, would not take into account investments made before 1 April, without amendment. 48 The effect of making the change recommended in the submission would be to ensure that the proposed amendment would only apply to gains made by group investment funds after 1 April 1999. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM AND TAX PAID BEFORE 1 APRIL 1998 (Clause 56) Issue: Imputation credits transferred to a life office's policy holder credit account before 1 April. Submission (10W- Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Submission 1 - Superannuation schemes and life offices should be able to credit imputation credits to the tax credit accounts even where those imputation credits arose from tax paid by wholly owned entities before 31 March 1998. Submission 2 - The amendment should contain an ordering rule for identifying imputation credits attached to dividends paid from wholly-owned entities. Official's comment As a general policy, tax changes should affect only income earned after the date of implementation. Consequently, in moving to the tax credit system, only tax paid after the implementation date should be used to provide tax credits. Imputation credits reflect tax paid. Imputation credits that have accumulated in the wholly-owned entities of life insurers or superannuation funds before the tax credit system's implementation reflect tax paid. Therefore they should not be available to be used to provide tax credits when they are attached to dividends paid to a fund from its wholly-owned entities. An ordering rule is required to identify which imputation credits are attached to dividends. Officials propose an ordering rule to ensure that imputation credits are paid out in the same order as they were earned. This also prevents a possible avoidance technique. Recommendation That the first submission be declined, but the second submission be accepted. 50 PAYE TAX TREATMENT FOR ELECTED MEMBERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES (Clauses 66 and 67) Issue: Proposed PAYE tax treatment for elected members of local authorities Submission (2, 2A, 2B and 2C - Auckland City; 15 - Local Government New Zealand) The proposed amendment subjecting elected members to PAYE tax treatment should be removed from the bill. Comment The tax legislation currently treats elected members as self-employed. Their remuneration is subject to a 33% withholding tax under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, and they are able to claim deductions for work-related expenditure. However, in practice, elected members are treated in a variable manner for tax purposes - some as self- employed, others as employees, while still others have a mix of the two (with part of their remuneration treated as employee income and the balance as self-employment income). Recognising the need for a consistent approach, officials consulted with Internal Affairs and local authorities' national representative body, Local Government New Zealand ("LGNZ") on a proposal that elected members be subject to PAYE tax treatment, that is, the same tax treatment as employees (while still retaining their status as office holders). Internal Affairs advised officials that they had no fixed view on the proposal. However, LGNZ expressed support, stating that the overwhelming majority of elected members would be made better off by the change in tax treatment. Consequently Ministers gave their approval to the proposed amendment, and it was included in the bill. When the bill was introduced into the House, on 24 June 1994, LGNZ sent a memorandum to all local authority Mayors, Chairs, and Chief Executives concerning the proposed amendment, stating, "We have advised Inland Revenue of our support for this aspect of the Bill." However, LGNZ's submission to the Committee states that it opposes the proposed amendment on the basis that it will disadvantage elected members. Speaking to officials concerning their submission, LGNZ has advised that its shift in view is largely due to communications it received from local authorities voicing disapproval for the proposed amendment. This disapproval is based on the fact that if elected members were made subject to the same tax treatment as employees, they would no longer be able to claim deductions for work-related expenditure. LGNZ is now of the opinion that the proposed amendment should not be passed. 51 Officials are of the view that, from a policy perspective, either employee or self- employed tax treatment is acceptable (although, from an Inland Revenue administrative point of view, employee tax treatment is marginally preferable). The current legislation subjects elected members to a 33% withholding tax. Therefore, whether elected members remain self-employed, or are moved to employee tax treatment, either will result in consistent deduction of tax at source (although self-employed treatment enables elected representatives to claim deductions for work-related expenditure). Whichever tax treatment is chosen, it will be accompanied by moves by Inland Revenue to clear up current inconsistent practice. Recommendation That, should the Committee choose to accept LGNZ's and Auckland City's submission, the proposed amendment subjecting elected members to PAYE tax treatment be removed from the bill. Should the current legislative treatment be confirmed, Inland Revenue will take steps to ensure that councils and elected members are familiar with the appropriate compliance requirements. That is, councils will have to deduct withholding tax from all payments made to elected members (including allowances) at the rate of 33%, and elected members will be able to claim deductions for work related expenditure. 52 MINOR CORRECTIONS Issue: Cross-referencing errors in Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock and other Remedial Matters) Bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified five cross-referencing errors in the bill: 1. Section CB 9(2) should refer to section LH 19 (4) as well as section LH 19 (3). 2. Sections CL 3 (1) and CM 19 (1) should refer to section LH 19 instead of section LH 20. 3. The new section DI 3A should follow section DI 3 instead of section DK 3. 4. The word "estimated" should be removed from section MJ 7 (1)(a). 5. In section OB 1, in the "first superannuation fund" definition, "section LB 1 A" should be omitted. Recommendation That these corrections be included in the slip to the bill.

THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM 7 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The tax credit system (TCS) will provide a mechanism that allows people who save through superannuation and life insurance products to pay tax on their investment income at their correct tax rate. The current 33% rate is a disincentive to saving for lower rate taxpayers (those earning below $38,000) who, after the tax cuts on 1 July 1998, will be on a rate of 21%. Background Investment earnings in life office and superannuation funds are currently taxed at a flat and final rate of 33%. This disadvantages taxpayers earning less than $38,000, who end up paying tax on their investment income at a much higher rate than the tax they pay on other income. Narrowing the gap between the different tax rates would be the obvious solution to the problem. However, given that there is a significant differential between tax rates, the best solution is to tax income from savings in life and superannuation funds at savers' personal tax rates, as happens in the case of interest and dividend income. However, attributing annually the income of life offices and superannuation funds to individual investors is not easy because of the way that life offices and superannuation funds operate. In response, the Government set up a process for full consultation, including a working party chaired by the Retirement Commissioner, to identify workable options. This working party, known as TOLIS, reported to Government in April 1997. The working party identified three options for solving the problem: a tax credit system, a revised rate proxy, and a qualifying fund regime. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, there must be a trade-off between achieving a level playing field with other similar investments (by an accurate allocation) and limiting additional compliance costs. The Government decided that the tax credit system was the best fit. This then formed the basis of Government’s subsequent discussion document, published in August 1997. The outcome is included in the tax bill before the Committee. Submissions Eighteen written submissions and three supplementary submissions on the tax credit system were received. Ten submitters were heard by the Select Committee. Submissions dealt with both the tax credit system and a change relating to superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT). Submitters generally agreed that the tax credit system (TCS) achieves the desired result, allowing savers to be correctly taxed at their personal tax rates. Of the systems considered, this was the only one that could achieve this accuracy. However, submitters were concerned about the complexity and costs involved for savers electing into the tax credit system. Submitters were concerned that income attributed to electing savers under the tax credit system will increase the savers’ taxable income and consequently may reduce their entitlement to social assistance. 8 Submitters sought clarification of the change relating to SSCWT. This change addresses the issue of over-taxation of contributions to a superannuation fund made by an employer in respect of employees. Officials agree that clarification is required so that employer and employees can agree to treat the contribution in such a way that the employee is subject to tax on the contribution at their personal tax rate rather than at a flat 33%. Submissions on the SSCWT change also recommended that contributions by the employer on behalf of the employee should not be included in taxable income for the purpose of determining entitlement to certain social assistance. The submissions can be broadly categorised into two groups: significant policy issues and technical and drafting issues. 9 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM: SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES 10 SAVER ELECTIONS Clauses 8 and 27 Section CO1, LH3 Clause 8 Section CO1(1) Submissions 5W - Roger and Judy Collins 10 - Watson Wyatt 11 - NZ Anglican Church Pension Board 12 - William M Mercer 13W - National Provident Fund 14 - ASFONZ 16 - Armstrong Jones 17W - General Accident Asia-Pacific Ltd 22 - Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc. (ISI) 24 - Retirement Commissioner The submissions above raised the following points: • Savers' understanding of the TCS for the purposes of electing into the system Savers will have difficulty understanding how the changes will work and how much benefit they will receive from electing the TCS. • Savers on incomes close to the 33c tax threshold In particular, those close to the 33c tax threshold may find it difficult to manage their tax position accurately as they find themselves with higher allocated income than anticipated if the fund does better than expected or through overtime payments and the like. Similarly, those receiving social assistance may not understand the implications of electing the TCS. • Social assistance impact Including attributed income from the tax credit system in income calculations in relation to social welfare benefits will actively discourage use of the TCS by low income savers and therefore undermines a key objective of the TCS. • Timing of saver's elections There is a practical problem of an election being made some time before it impacts on a saver’s income. In the meantime the saver's circumstances in relation to social assistance may have changed, so that electing into the TCS proves to be a poor decision. 11 • Income to pay any additional tax The attributed income is notional and not paid annually in cash because the investment has not been realised. In contrast, interest and dividends are from realised income and paid in cash. Submissions' suggested solutions (i) There should be a taxpayer education campaign regarding the implication of electing the TCS option. Inland Revenue, Social Welfare or the Retirement Commissioner should take a key role in any campaign rather than the onus being placed on superannuation schemes, who could be sued for incorrect advice to members regarding elections. (ii) There should be a one-year transition whereby taxpayers who enter the regime are not penalised for miscalculating, with all attributed income being taxed at 21% regardless of the taxpayer’s actual income, provided their income was less than $38,000 in the previous year. (iii) Tax credits should be attributed to electing savers at a rate of 33% rather than 21%. Consequently, electing savers would receive their tax refund through their personal tax return. Officials' comments Savers’ understanding the TCS for the purposes of electing into the system Election by savers into the TCS will be optional. In making a decision whether to elect into the system savers will need to take into account what level of income they earn in a year and whether they receive social assistance. Inland Revenue officials have been working with the industry, and will continue to work with them, to develop guidelines for savers who want to make a decision as to whether they elect or not. Once the legislation is enacted, Inland Revenue will publish a Tax Information Bulletin covering the operation of the tax credit system. Savers on incomes close to the 33% tax threshold Savers close to the threshold have the option of electing into the TCS but may be concerned about doing so because their income may ultimately go over the 33% threshold. In this case the credits at 21% will not cover their attributed income under the TCS. To help savers make the right decision, we understand that funds are likely to provide savers who are considering electing into the scheme with an indication of the level of income they are likely to be attributed under the TCS. This will be important in determining whether the saver will go over the 33c threshold. We also understand that funds may make available to electing savers the 12c “refundable credit”. As a result, if electing savers have a tax liability on 12 the attributed income from the TCS of more than 21% they will have the 12c available to them to help with this liability. Social assistance impact Attributed income under the TCS will not be included in the social security definition of "income" for the purposes of determining benefit entitlement under the Social Security Act. These benefits include unemployment and sickness benefits, widows, domestic purpose and invalids benefits. However, social assistance which is based on taxable income may be affected by a saver's receiving income under the TCS. Electing savers will include the income they are attributed under the TCS in their taxable income. Benefits for which entitlement is based on taxable income include family support and student allowances. Child support payments are also determined with reference to an individual’s taxable income. Officials have considered whether the income from TCS, which will form part of electing savers' taxable income, should be overlooked for purposes of determining levels of social assistance. We do not recommend this course of action. It would mean that savers receiving social assistance would not pay the correct amount of tax. Moreover, these savers would be in a preferred investment vehicle that would have an advantage over other forms of investment. Such a move would encourage people who receive social assistance to invest in this type of vehicle rather than, for example, a bank account. In this regard it would be possible for people to avoid a reduction in their social assistance by using a superannuation fund, for example, in the same way as a bank account. The avoidance of the National Superannuation surcharge is an example of where this type of avoidance occurred. It is likely that funds will advise savers who are on incomes of greater than, say, $20,000 and in receipt of social assistance not to elect into the TCS. Fiscal cost The “best guess” fiscal cost of excluding attributed TCS income from the definition of income for the purposes of calculating family support entitlements is $10-30m. Of the social assistance programmes affected, family support has by far the greatest fiscal implications and hence this estimate relates only to family support. The actual cost is dependent on how many recipients of family support are also investors in life insurance and superannuation products, and the extent of their investment. This estimate assumes that around 25-50% of recipients of family support have these types of investments and receive on average $500-$1000 attributed income. The estimate also assumes that in the absence of exempting attributed income from the calculation of family support entitlements, the affected taxpayers will not opt for the TCS. This means that their life insurance/superannuation 13 investment income would continue to be taxed at 33% rather than their true effective marginal tax rate, which could be as high as 100%. However, should the exemption be provided, the savers are assumed to move to an effective tax rate of 21%. Timing of saver’s election Funds are given flexibility as to when elections are made by savers. Flexibility is also given to the funds in respect of their acceptance of the revocation of saver elections. It is likely that funds will allow for savers to revoke elections when their income changes, so that the 33% rate applies. Income to pay any additional tax We understand that funds who offer tax credits may choose to provide in cash the 12c refundable credit they receive on the tax credits they attribute to electing savers. This cash could be used to meet any additional tax the saver faces. Tax credits attributed at 33% rather than 21% The proposal would require savers to file a tax return merely to seek a refund from Inland Revenue, a measure that is in direct conflict with tax simplification moves to reduce the numbers of those who must file returns. The funds prefer that the 12c refund be reinvested in the funds on behalf of savers. Recommendation That these submissions be declined. It should be noted that officials and the industry are working together on how to provide advice to savers who are considering electing into the TCS. 14 COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR THE FUNDS Clause n/a Submissions 5W - Roger and Judy Collins 7 - Eriksen & Associates Ltd 11 - NZ Anglican Church Pension Fund 12 - William W Mercer 16 - Armstrong Jones 22 - ISI Compliance costs should be reduced or an alternative system should be adopted. While supporting the need for reform, a number of submissions are concerned that the changes appear to be very complex with high compliance costs. This is a particular concern for employer subsidised schemes which in many cases do not have professional trustees. Other changes such as the Securities Commission and Financial Reporting requirements have already materially increased compliance costs and the Tax Credit System (TCS) adds to this. As a result, the submissions predict that many employer schemes will not offer the TCS option to staff or some employers may speed up their decisions to cease offering superannuation schemes to staff. In terms of the larger non-employer funds, the systems changes to implement the TCS coincide with changes such as the year 2000 problem so there is a shortage of software systems people for the programming required for the TCS. Officials’ comment In response to these submissions, we note that: • TCS is optional for life insurers and superannuation funds. • The compliance costs for life insurers and funds operating the TCS in respect of new business will be less than for existing business. Consequently, we understand funds are more likely to offer the TCS on new products, designed to take account of the TCS. • TCS has been developed in consultation with interested groups. A considerable focus during consultation was the reduction of compliance costs. To this end, the TCS legislation contains flexibility as to the methods that can be used in order to determine the tax credits that can be attributed to electing savers. This takes account of the many possible methods funds currently have for allocating income to savers. 15 • The TCS rules are less complex than company imputation rules. For example, the TCS rules contain no continuity of ownership provisions and no share repurchase rules. • TCS will put life offices and superannuation funds in a very competitive tax position. Recommendation That this submission be declined, noting that life insurers and superannuation funds will have a fair degree of flexibility over how they administer the scheme should they opt for it. 16 ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS TO THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM Clause n/a Submissions 7 - Eriksen & Associates Ltd 11 - NZ Anglican Church Pension Fund 12 - William W Mercer 14 - ASFONZ 22 - Investment Savings and Assurance Association (ISI) Suggested alternative options referred to in these submissions are: • Reduced proxy rate (ISI suggests this in conjunction with a cap mechanism). • One single flat rate of tax for all investment earnings, incomes and GST. • In employee schemes employers would pay tax based on the marginal rate of the employee. The employer would determine this based on salary information. • Qualifying fund. This is seen as being very similar to the TCS in its application. • Tax credits would be attributed at 33% (instead of 21% as proposed) with taxpayers claiming a tax refund from Inland Revenue if they are on a tax rate of less than 33%. This has also been suggested for those taxpayers receiving a pension. • Schemes would not be required to attribute income and tax credits to members but the benefit of tax credits would be reflected through unit prices for all investors. The difficulty arises in the attribution of the tax credits whereby the tax expense used in the unit pricing will differ from the actual tax paid, principally owing to unrealised gains and losses on equities and real property. Officials’ comment Revised proxy rate A lower proxy rate (with or without a cap) would merely lower the current rate of 33% to, say, 27%. A cap would limit the benefit of the lower rate on an individual basis. With a cap, all taxpayers would be required to specify in their tax return whether the total value of their superannuation and life insurance investments (based on, say, their surrender values) exceeded, say, $100,000 at any time during the income year. We note: • A lower proxy rate means that all investors are incorrectly taxed. Some will remain overtaxed, while others will be undertaxed. 17 • A lower proxy rate will favour higher income earners (the opposite group targeted by the reform), who will be able to invest their money in these schemes and be taxed at less than 33% on their earnings. • It provides a competitive advantage to life offices and superannuation funds over other comparable investment vehicles, leading to likely complaints from those other investment intermediaries. • There is no statistical approach to determining what the proxy rate should be. • The cap will be arbitrary, will not produce an accurate result and can be manipulated (for example, by dividing investments between family members or trusts so as to remain under the cap for each investment). • The cap mechanism is inconsistent with the aim of reducing the need to file a tax return. The operation of the cap is likely to lead to savers under $38,000 having to file tax returns. Under the cap mechanism the compliance costs shift to investors to determine whether they have breached the $100,000 cap. If they have, they will also have tax to pay. • TCS is also more fiscally sustainable than the revised proxy rate. The fiscal cost for a 27% proxy rate is $60-70m, whereas for TCS is only $20-30m. • The lower rate proxy has been acknowledged by many submitters as not a viable long-term solution to the problem of overtaxation of lower tax rate payers. One single tax rate for savers This was outside the ambit of the options that were considered by the TOLIS working party. Narrowing the gap between the different rates would be the most obvious solution but has wider implications. Qualifying fund This option enables funds to be created or formed by the sub-division of existing funds, which cater only for lower rate taxpayers. It is a variation on the proxy rate regime but with two rates - 21% and 33%. Conceptually, the option would result in the application of the right effective tax rate to many individual savers in a reasonably cost effective way. However, a key disadvantage is that it involves compliance and administrative costs in ensuring that taxpayers on effective tax rates greater than 21% do not enjoy the benefits of 21% schemes. Furthermore it is not certain how those who incorrectly end up in, say, the 21% fund would be “penalised” for an incorrect election. Also, there are many taxpayers on effective marginal tax rates in excess of 33% because of social assistance. This would imply the need for more than two types of qualifying fund to cover the range of effective marginal tax rates. In contrast, the TCS does in fact pick up the marginal rate of the saver. 18 Tax credits at 33% rather than 21% The proposal would require savers to file a tax return merely to seek a refund from Inland Revenue, a measure that is in direct conflict with tax simplification moves to reduce the numbers of those who must file returns. The funds prefer that the 12c “refundable credit” be reinvested in the funds on behalf of savers. Non-allocation of tax credits Under this option, it would be up to the fund as to what benefit the saver received. The tax benefit would be implicitly built into the unit price in a widely held superannuation fund so that all savers, not only the 21% savers would benefit. There would also be problems about how to square off insufficient tax paid because of incorrect elections given that the saver would not need to include the tax credits and attributed income in their tax return. Recommendation That these submissions be declined. 19 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED IN SALARY AND WAGES Clause 32 Submissions Submission (i) 7 - Eriksen & Associates Ltd 11 - NZ Anglican Church Pension Board 12 - William M Mercer 14 - ASFONZ 17W - General Accident 21 - NZ Society of Actuaries 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone The legislation should enable employees to change their election only with the consent of their employer. There appears to be a drafting error that enables employees to instruct their employer to include employer superannuation contributions in their salary and wages and, therefore, be subject to PAYE and the associated impact on family support, ACC levies, and the like. This impinges on the contractual relationship between employee and employer. It also leads to additional compliance costs for the employer because of variations between employees as to the amount, if any, deducted from their salary as a super contribution. The legislation does not have sufficient safeguard to stop employees claiming the employer’s contributions as having immediately vested as they are salary and wages, and seeking to spend the money rather than putting it into the super scheme. Submission (ii) 9 - NZ Employers Federation 10 - Watson Wyatt 14 - ASFONZ 17W - General Accident Employer superannuation contributions should be treated as salaries and wages for taxation purposes only. The salary and wages that consist of specified superannuation contributions in terms of paragraph (j) of the “salary and wages” definition should be added to the list of exclusion in paragraph (b) of “earnings of an employee” in the ACC regulations 1992. The proposal in respect of employee contributions has the following implications: • will increase ACC payments for both the employer and employee, amounts paid out as holiday entitlements, family support payments, student loan repayments, redundancy payments and any other salary linked pay outs (eg death benefits); 20 • increases expectation of staff not in scheme to receive matching pay increases, • would be difficult to unwind if the super scheme was wound up, • would put an element of salary and wages outside employers control because contributions are determined by the trust deed and trustee not the employer, • would create confusion in the event of receivership or liquidation where salary and wages are given priority and super is normally paid out in accordance with the trust deed, • taxes employees that leave before full vesting on income they do not receive. • is unclear on what happens where an employer receives a “contribution holiday” because the scheme has sufficient reserves. As a result, employers are less likely to offer subsidised superannuation plans, so in the course of trying to remove one disincentive to savings have created another. Submission (iii) 9 - NZ Employers Federation 11 - NZ Anglican Church Pension Board Employer funded contributions should be subject to SSCWT at the appropriate rate which reflects the salary and wage level of each employee. Officials’ comment • We agree with Submission (i) that there is a need to clarify the legislation so that employers and employees must agree to the new treatment. It was not the intent of the legislation to enable an employee to have sole discretion over whether an employer’s superannuation contribution is included in salary and wages and taxed at the employee’s personal rates. Rather it was intended that whether an employer’s superannuation contribution is included in an employee’s salary and wages would require joint agreement between both employers and employees. • In respect of Submission (ii) requiring joint agreement between employer and employees on whether contributions are included in salaries and wages should remove much of the concern about the flow-on effect this would have on other costs to employers for ACC payments, holiday pay, superannuation contributions and redundancy payments. When making a decision on whether to offer employees a choice of how superannuation contributions are to be treated, employers will be able to weigh up the implications of the flow-on effects in relation to competitive salary packages. • Similarly, employees will, when making their decision, need to weigh up issues such as their likelihood of leaving before full vesting against the benefits of a lower longer-term tax rate based on their personal rate. 21 • Treating contributions as salaries and wages for tax purposes does not imply that there is any change in the contribution status in relation to receivership or liquidation law. • Where there is a “contribution holiday” there will consequently be no employer contributions subject to SSCWT, so this change will not apply. • In the case of the option for contributions to be treated as salaries and wages and its impact on social assistance eligibility, again this is only replicating the treatment given to other forms of salary and wages, that is, ensuring a level playing field. Ultimately, the scheme is optional and employees can continue to have the contributions taxed at a flat rate of 33 cents (under SSCWT) notwithstanding that their effective marginal tax rates could be in excess of this, given the receipt of social assistance. • If employees could opt to include superannuation contributions in their salary and wages without impacting on their family support, child repayment obligations, student loans, they could take an immediate pay cut and substitute that for employer superannuation contributions and avoid any abatement effect. Hence there could be a substantial fiscal cost. • As regards Submission (iii), a key problem with applying SSCWT at the appropriate rate which reflects the salary and wages level of each employee is determining what is the appropriate rate. Incomes may vary so that the rate of deduction proves to be incorrect. In these circumstances, it is far from clear how to correct the under or over deduction given that SSCWT effectively operates as a final tax. For example, should the adjustment be done at the employer or employee level? Recommendation • That submission (i) to clarify the legislation be accepted so that an employee’s election to have an employer’s superannuation contribution treated as salaries and wages can only apply if the employer also agrees to offer this option; and • That submissions (ii) and (iii) be declined. 22 THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM: TECHNICAL AND DRAFTING ISSUES 23 APPLICATION OF TCS TO SUPER SCHEME RESERVES Clause n/a Submission (13W National Provident Fund) Investment income derived on reserves should be subject to tax at the average rate of tax payable by the superannuation scheme after taking account of elections made by contributors and annuitants without increasing the attributed income to electing annuitants. NPF has substantial reserves to minimise the Government’s risk, given guaranteed minimum crediting rates. Officials’ comment Reserves and investment income on reserves will be subject to a tax rate of 33% in the first instance, as will all income of superannuation funds. Tax credits can be carried forward in respect of tax paid reserves in the tax credit account. These tax credits could then be attributed to savers when the reserves concerned are subsequently allocated to savers. While applying the average rate across electing savers instead of the 33% rate seems at first glance appealing, it is not necessarily the correct rate as the mix of savers is likely to be different when the tax is actually attributed as tax credits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 ROLLOVER RELIEF Clause n/a Submission (14 - ASFONZ) For ease of administration, trustees may wish to split schemes into 33% and 21% taxpayers. Therefore, rollover is requested to avoid the tax consequences of such splits. Officials’ comment Any rollover relief provisions would of necessity be complex so as to avoid the possibility of their being abused as a means of tax planning. They would add a further layer of complexity to the TCS that in the end is likely to be unnecessary. Our discussions with the industry on this point indicate that lack of rollover relief should not be a problem, because: • The TCS legislation already provides mechanisms to enable funds to effectively split their funds for the purposes of offering tax credits to a group of their savers without setting up separate legal entities. • Tax credits are likely to be offered more for new products rather than existing products. For example, funds could apply section MJ9 to attribute tax credits in relation to part of the business or section MJ11 to establish multiple tax credit accounts. If, however, funds wish to separate out their assets into separate legal entities they will be subject to the tax consequences of asset transfers, as would any other entity during the normal course of its business. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 USE OF MONEY INTEREST ON PROVISIONAL TAX OVERPAID Clause n/a Submission 10 - Watson Wyatt 22 - ISI Use of money interest (UOMI) should be payable on provisional tax overpayments made to generate tax credits. Insurers and super funds may wish to do this in years where there is no tax liability. In the absence of any change to the legislation, UOMI would be payable. Bringing tax forward benefits the Crown and interest recognises this cash advantage. The situation is different from dividends as there are underlying differences from the imputation regime. Under the imputation regime dividends represent a transfer of wealth, but under TCS there is no transfer, merely a notional distribution. Officials’ comment We do not agree with paying interest in this instance. This approach is consistent with the company imputation regime. The wider picture needs to be considered in that while it is true that the fund will pay tax before its tax liability has crystallised, the savers will have the benefit of the tax credits generated by the prepayment immediately. As regards comparable treatment for notional distributions, we see the TCS as analogous to a company making a taxable bonus issue to pass imputation credits out to shareholders without having to distribute cash. In that situation no interest is paid on the prepaid tax used to generate the imputation credits. Recommendation That this submission be declined. The legislation should make clear that it is not intended to pay interest on prepaid tax that is used to generate tax credits. In relation to superannuation, a specific legislation amendment will be required; however, in relation to life insurers this issue is already covered. 26 AMENDMENT OF TRUST DEEDS AND/OR THE SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES ACT Clause n/a Submissions (i) 12 - William M Mercer 13W - National Provident Fund The legislation should specifically provide for trust deeds to be altered to accommodate TCS without requiring funds to obtain the consent of all members under section 9 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. NPF suggest similar provisions to those included in the Human Rights Act. (ii) 14 - ASFONZ 21 - NZ Society of Actuaries (NZSA) The Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 should be amended to enable schemes to recover higher administration costs of TCS from members on different bases, such as a different declared rate for the TCS electors. Otherwise section 9 of that Act will be breached as the additional charges would reduce the surplus available to the non- electing members in the event of a wind-up. Suggested draft wording is provided in the submission, including a provision to address the concerns of the Government Actuary. Officials’ comment Clearly there is an issue of how superannuation funds will handle allocating the costs of TCS across their members given that non-electing members would otherwise bear some of the costs without getting any benefit. Administratively, there is some doubt as to whether trust deeds or the Superannuation Schemes Act need to be amended to provide superannuation funds with the flexibility to handle this situation. Notwithstanding the administrative difficulties, it seems desirable for funds to get the consent of the affected members to the higher costs from offering the TCS. These issues have been discussed with the Government Actuary, who has advised that no amendment should be made to this Act. However we are discussing this issue further with the industry and Ministry of Commerce We note that in practice funds may avoid the problems above by offering new products to a group of savers who elect the TCS and who all agree to the associated costs. 27 Recommendation That the submission be declined. We note that we are continuing to discuss the issue of amendment of the Superannuation Schemes Act. 28 ABILITY TO OBTAIN A TAX CREDIT UNDER THE POLICYHOLDER BASE AND LIFE OFFICE BASE TAX Clause 27 section LH9 and LH15 Clause 30 section MJ6 Submissions 6W - Tower Corporation 7 - Eriksen & Associates 21 - NZ Society of Actuaries 22 - ISI (i) Section ME18(1) of the Act should be amended to allow a credit to the PCA for the refundable credit in the proposed section LH9(2). (ii) Section MJ6 should be amended to clarify that there is no double counting of credits in the TCA for tax paid in respect of the policyholder tax base liability. (iii) Life insurers should be able to obtain a refundable credit under the TCS at the life insurer and policyholder base. The base for taxing life insurers involves two separate calculations to derive the total tax payable. As currently drafted, the legislation allows for tax credits to be offset against only part of the calculation so that the actual tax paid by the life insurer would not be reduced, and the benefits passed on to individual policyholders would be met by participating policyholders or the shareholders. (iv) Sections LH9, LH15 and MJ6 should be amended to ensure equal treatment of insurers and superannuation schemes in relation to refundable credits. The current wording renders the TCS ineffective in all situations where the tax liability in relation to the life insurer base income exceeds the tax liability on policyholder base income (after the allowance of tax credits). (v) The credits should recognise the actual tax incurred and paid by the life insurer. The original policy intention was to limit the credits available to the amount of the policyholder tax liability. The provisions in the bill actually credit to the TCA all tax paid by the life insurer. Life insurers calculate their tax liability on two bases - the life insurer base and the policyholder base. If the tax creditable to the TCA is limited to the policyholder base liability, significant limitations on the application of the TCS rules will arise and life insurers will be disadvantaged vis a vis superannuation funds. (vi) Clarification is required as to whether the income tax liability referred to in LH9(3) is a reference to an income tax liability on policyholder income. 29 Officials’ comment As this issue was raised by a number of submitters, we discussed the details with the industry and have revised the proposals as follows: • A refundable credit will be available to credit against a tax liability at both the life office and policyholder base. • However, a cash refund of tax relating to the refundable credit will only be available at the life office base if there is a sufficient credit balance in the company’s imputation credit account. • Where refundable credits exceed the current year’s income tax liability at the policyholder base, the excess can only be carried forward as a loss at this base. • When imputation credits from the life office base are transferred to the policyholder credit account, the tax credit account will be credited with the same amount. • Where amounts are transferred from the policyholder credit account to the imputation credit account, the tax credit account must be debited by the same amount. • A cash payment of tax in respect of a policyholder base tax liability can be credited directly to TCA. Recommendation That the Committee note that this area has been revised in consultation with the industry and that points raised in the above submissions have been addressed in the legislation. 30 TRANSFER OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS Clause 6 Section CM15(1) Clause 30 Subpart MJ Submission (6W - Tower Corporation) • Items v1 and v0 contained in section CM18(1) should be amended to incorporate the proposed changes to v1 and v0 contained in the proposed section CM15(1). • A provision should be included in the TCS similar to section ME19A so that the life insurer may elect to transfer a credit balance in its credit account (TCA) on the transfer of its life insurance business to a company in the same wholly owned group of companies, and section MJ7(1)(g) would not cause a debit to the TCA in such cases. • A provision should be included to ensure that the status of an “elected fund”, “electing policyholder or electing member” and “non-electing policyholder or non-electing member” are not altered by a life insurer transferring its life insurance business to another company in the same wholly-owned group of companies. Officials’ comment These submissions relate to the implications for the TCS when there is a transfer of life office business. The legislation should contain provisions relating to the transfer of life office business. This includes the consequences on transfer for the TCA. Recommendation That submissions be accepted. 31 CONSOLIDATION AND AMALGAMATION Clause n/a Submission (6W - Tower Corporation) The relevant sections in the Income Tax Act 1994 that deal with consolidation and amalgamation of companies should be appropriately integrated with the TCS rules. Officials’ comment Officials agree that consolidation and amalgamation rules covering the TCS are needed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and note that if time allows, the necessary changes to the legislation should be made. 32 IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THE TCS Clause - various Submission (16 - Armstrong Jones) The TCS should be implemented as soon as possible. Officials’ comment The TCS is planned to apply from 1 April 1998. Funds can use the scheme from this date, notwithstanding that in some cases this does not coincide with the beginning of their income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that 1 April 1998 is the earliest feasible time for implementing the TCS. 33 ATTRIBUTION FROM A LIFE INSURER TO A SUPERANNUATION FUND Clause 27 Section LH10-15 Submission 15W - ICANZ 21 - NZ Society of Actuaries 22 - ISI The proposal enabling a superannuation fund to attribute income to another superannuation fund should be extended to allow life insurers to attribute income to superannuation funds. It is not uncommon for superannuation funds to invest not only in other superannuation funds but also in life insurance products. Officials’ comment Officials agree with the submission and recommend that if time allows, the necessary changes to the legislation should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 BACKDATING A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE Clause 39 Section 30C(1) of the TAA Submission (19W - WestpacTrust Financial Services) The TCS regime should be amended to allow a superannuation scheme to backdate a tax credit certificate sent in one income year to the previous year, if it is sent within six months of balance date. Under the proposed legislation, it is possible for attributed income not to become assessable until the income year after the election to enter the regime is made even though it is earned in the year of election. This is because the tax credits and income are credited to the electing member on the date specified on the tax certificate, which is effectively when it is sent. As a result, an electing member’s circumstances may have changed (for example, his or her income may be now over $38,000). Having the ability to backdate the tax credit certificate to the year in which the income is “earned” would overcome this problem. A similar provision (LH6(5)) already exists for the backdating of debits. Officials’ comment In the case of individual savers, backdating is complex. Funds have different balance dates, as do savers. An example of a practical problem that backdating would create is where a saver may have already completed a tax return and subsequently receives a backdated tax credit. We note that if a superannuation fund invests in another superannuation fund, it may receive income up to six months after balance date. This income will be deemed to be received as at the balance date of the fund providing the tax credit where that fund has claimed the refundable credit in the previous income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the legislation should provide that when a superannuation fund invests in another superannuation fund and income is attributed up to six months after balance date, that income is deemed to have been received by the superannuation fund on the balance date of the fund providing the tax credits. 35 RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND SURPLUSES Clause 27 Section LH5 Submission 10 - Watson Wyatt 21 - NZ Society of Actuaries The legislation should make it clear that reserve account and surplus assets will be treated as non-elected savings for the purposes of allocation in order to attribute tax credits. Officials’ comment It depends on the allocation method chosen as to whether reserve account and surplus assets are allocated to savers for determining their interest in the fund for the purpose of attributing tax credits. There is a range of possible allocation methods, the key criterion being that the allocation is fair and reasonable across all savers. A prescriptive rule excluding reserve accounts and surplus accounts could, therefore, lead to an allocation that may not meet that criterion. Recommendation That the submission to have a prescriptive rule be declined. 36 NOTIFICATION OF ELECTION AND CESSATION Clause 40 Sections 78B and F of the Tax Administration Act Submission 15 - ICANZ 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone The five working days’ notice period should be replaced with a requirement to notify the Commissioner of the event at the time of filing, and by inclusion, in the annual tax return. The provision requires an electing fund to give notice to the Commissioner no later than five working days before its tax return is filed. Also, five days’ minimum notice before the end of the income year is required for cessation of an election. ICANZ do not see the need for prior notification. Section 78B should be clarified to allow retrospective elections. The section appears to allow a fund to elect to attribute tax credits by notice to the Commissioner at any time up to approximately four months after the end of the income year. However, 78B(3) is not clear as to when the election takes effect from - for example, is it the time of notice or from the start of the previous income year? The latter case implies an ability to make a retrospective election. Officials’ comment The requirement to give five working days’ notice should be deleted and replaced by a requirement to give notice to Inland Revenue that it intends to offer the TCS within 63 days of the beginning of an income year. This requirement is to assist Inland Revenue administration and is necessary for the smooth operation of the scheme. To facilitate meeting this requirement, a form will be designed. Notification will be one-off, to advise Inland Revenue that the fund is offering the TCS and keeping a TCA. Depending on when the scheme decides to opt into the TCS, this would be: • within 63 working days of the beginning of an income year, or • within 63 working days of the beginning of business, or • within 63 working days of enactment of this legislation. Ceasing to offer the TCS will also require notification to the Commissioner. The Commissioner should have discretion to accept late elections. Recommendation That the submission be declined but note that the original proposal should be changed to, in general, a notice period of 63 working days. 37 REFUND OF ATTRIBUTED TAX CREDITS Clause 25 Section LB 1A and LB 2 Submission (14 - ASFONZ) If a tax credit is not credited against the income tax liability of the taxpayer for the income year, the residual amount should be refunded to the taxpayer rather than be required to be carried forward. Officials’ comment The treatment proposed for the TCS is consistent with the company imputation rules. In both cases any excess credits received by taxpayers can be used in future years by their conversion to a loss that is carried forward. As with other tax losses, they cannot be used until there is sufficient income to offset. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 DATE OF ATTRIBUTION Clause 27 Sections LH6(4) and LH20(4) Submission 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI The provision should be clarified by referring to the date on which the certificate is issued. This could be done by reference to section 30C (1)(e) of the Tax Administration Act. The provisions currently specify that electing funds attribute credits (and income) on the date specified on the tax credit certificate. Officials’ comment We agree that the provision needs to be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 39 GUIDELINES SOUGHT FOR ASSISTING TRUSTEES IN DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE INVESTMENT INCOME TO EACH MEMBER Clause 27 Sections LH2, LH5 and LH6 Submission (i) 13W - National Provident Fund The legislation should include specific authority to trustees to decide how the system is to be implemented, the ability to allocate costs and tax savings to electing members, and so forth. (ii) 14 - ASFONZ 15 - ICANZ 21 - NZ Association of Actuaries 22 - ISI A further income allocation method should be added to those in LH5(3), that is, a method approved by the Commissioner upon application to the Commissioner by the electing fund. This will add certainty that that method will not be subsequently rejected by Inland Revenue during an audit. (iii) 21 - NZ Association of Actuaries 22 - ISI Because of the range of allocation methods and range of practitioners, a guidance note should be developed for those involved in the allocation process. (iv) 22 - ISI Section LH5 should incorporate a further method that allows the allocation to be based on actual member-by-member tax-based methodology. ISI are happy to work with officials on drafting appropriate wording. (v) 22 - ISI The legislation should specifically outline the choices available where a method results in negative income (or a loss) for a policyholder or superannuation fund member. ISI understand that officials are intending to allow flexibility in this regard as follows: • A member's income in a particular year will be able to take into account losses arising from this calculation for a prior year, or • if a fund chooses to simplify the calculation, the income in a particular year is determined ignoring any prior year losses that arise out of this calculation. 40 Officials’ comment Submission (i) There is flexibility as to the method of allocating income in order to attribute tax credits. There should only be a general rule that the method must be consistent across both electing and non-electing savers (also see comments on submissions (ii)-(iv)). The legislation does not require the fund to pass on to savers the benefit of the refundable credit that the fund receives on the basis of the attributed 21% tax credits. However, unless savers can see that they will benefit from their election, they are unlikely to elect to join the scheme. Hence commercial pressure is likely to encourage funds to pass on the 12% refundable credit benefit to savers. Funds may operate a separate “21% fund” under the tax credit system for 21% savers. Those in this fund may have increased administration costs and would go into the fund accepting this. This approach may lead to lower additional costs relative to an existing fund splitting itself into 21% and 33% savers. There is no intention to specify in the legislation that the costs of operating the tax credit system be allowed to be offset against the benefit of refundable credits passed on to the electing savers through their accounts with the fund. There is also the issue of whether the Superannuation Schemes Act needs to be changed or, alternatively, a separate provision is included in the tax legislation to enable funds to amend their trust deeds without needing to obtain all members’ approval. This would avoid the costs of having to obtain approval. At this stage there are no changes, which means that members will need to agree to how the costs are borne. As noted earlier, we have discussed this aspect with the Government Actuary and will continue to work through this issue with the industry and Ministry of Commerce. Submissions (ii)-(v) It has been agreed following discussions with the industry that the allocation options will be more generally phrased so that whatever method is used, the resulting allocation has to be fair (treating all policyholders/members the same). In this context, any losses would also need to be allocated on a fair basis, so no specific provision is needed on how to allocate losses. To assist in aiding certainty for taxpayers, funds/life insurers will be able to seek the Commissioner’s sign-off on whether their allocation method is acceptable. Recommendation That submission (i) be declined and note that submissions (ii)-(v) should be addressed through redrafting the allocation provisions. 41 63 DAYS’ ALLOWANCE FOR RECTIFYING DEBITS TO THE TCA Clause 30 Section MJ12 Submission 14 - ASFONZ 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI (i) An electing fund should be allowed 63 working days after the end of the fund’s income year within which to pay further income tax in respect of any debit balance to its TCA. (ii) Further income tax should be payable on the last date for filing income tax returns (including extension of time arrangements) with a 10% penalty for late payment. The 63-day period will be difficult to comply with owing to the reliance on actuarial valuations for the calculation of the policyholder base tax liability. The ICANZ suggestion is similar to imputation. (iii) Funds should be given 180 days to square off any debit in their TCA. The proposed time of 63 days is unrealistic given the added complexities of the TCS. Even though only an estimate is required, ISI consider their members will not be comfortable with a maximum of 63 days. Officials comment Funds and life insurers will have 63 calendar days (ie not working days, so two months) after balance date to square off any debits in their ICAs without penalty. This is not the case for the imputation credit account, where a debit needs to be squared off at 31 March if the company is to avoid any penalties. The reason for the 63 days is a concession to allow the funds time to determine the non-electing savers’ debit. That debit, which needs to be calculated as at balance date, is based on the fund’s “estimated income tax liability” for the year. This is defined as the taxpayer’s income tax liability as recorded on the tax return. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 COMMISSIONER’S ABILITY TO ISSUE ASSESSMENT WITHOUT OBTAINING ADVICE OF AN ACTUARY Clauses 27 and 30 Sections LH8, LH21 and MJ11 Submission (22 – ISI) (i) The Commissioner should be required to obtain the advice of an actuary before issuing an assessment that alters the calculations made by an insurer or superannuation fund. This advice is considered necessary because electing funds are themselves required to obtain approval of an actuary or external auditor in relation to matters associated with the TCS. (ii) If the submission above is accepted, a consequent amendment should be made to section CM8(3), which relates to the Commissioner’s ability to make assessments in the context of the calculation of actuarial reserves for the purposes of the life insurance regime. Officials’ comment The current draft legislation is consistent with section CM8(3) of the Act. Under that provision, in making an assessment of a life insurer’s income, the Commissioner may seek the advice of an actuary. There is, however, no obligation to do so. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 DUTIES OF ACTUARY RESPONSIBLE FOR ELECTING FUND Clauses 27 and 30 Sections LH8(2), LH14(2), LH21(1) and MJ9(3) Submission 14 - ASFONZ 15W - ICANZ The trustees of a fund should be required to perform the duties under sections LH8(1), LH14(1), LH21(1) and MJ9, rather than it being the responsibility of their actuary or external auditor. This is particularly an issue for funds that do not employ actuaries. Ultimately it is the trustees’ responsibility anyway. Officials’ comment The concern was to ensure that where, for example, an actuarial method of allocating tax and income was used it was signed off or validated by an actuary. We agree that trustees have the ultimate responsibility for the correct management of the fund and should, in order to ensure that they are not in breach of their duty, have recourse to the necessary technical experts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 44 MINIMUM INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO SAVERS Clause n/a Submission (21 - NZ Society of Actuaries) The legislation should prescribe minimum information requirements to be provided to policyholders/savers to assist in their decision on whether to elect into the TCS - for example, the effect on an individual’s tax return, how and when the refund will be applied and what costs will be levied. Officials’ comment Prescribing minimum information standards runs the risk that they are mis-targeted or encourage only minimal information disclosure. Instead Inland Revenue is working with the industry so that industry players that offer the TCS can educate savers on whether to elect the TCS. Ultimately, however, savers may need to obtain independent advice on their specific circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 VALIDITY OF ELECTION Clause 27 Section LH3(5) Submission 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI The investor’s election should be valid notwithstanding an incorrect IRD number being given by the investor. Under the proposals, an incorrect IRD number invalidates the election. However, the fund would not be aware that the number given by the investor is incorrect and would proceed to allocate tax credits. In contrast, resident withholding tax deductors are able to take a tax file number provided by an electing member at face value. Officials’ comment The provision requires electing policyholders or electing members to give their tax file number to an electing fund for the election to be valid. Inland Revenue proposes to administer this provision on the same basis as the RWT rules, so that if a number is taken by the payer as genuine, the election is not invalidated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted but note that no legislative change is required. 46 USE OF THE TERM “MUST” Clause 27 Sections LH4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18 and 20 Submission (22 – ISI) These provisions should be redrafted to remove any implication that an electing fund is required to attribute income to electing policyholders. These provisions currently contain the term “must”, which seems inconsistent with an elective regime. Officials’ comment While the TCS is elective, once in the regime the electing fund must apply the provisions in accordance with the legislation. However, we agree with the submission in relation to sections LH7 and LH13 and recommend that those provisions be redrafted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 47 SAFEGUARDING OF RECORDS Clause 39 Section 30D of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) Submission (i) 15W - ICANZ The provision, which requires taxpayers to take all reasonable steps to safeguard their records, should be removed and section 22 of the TAA extended to encompass any information required for the administration of the TCS. ICANZ consider that this provision imposes a higher standard of conduct on life insurers and superannuation funds than that imposed on other taxpayers. They do not consider it to be appropriate to impose additional obligations on a specific group of taxpayers in respect of an issue that impacts on all taxpayers. If it is the Government’s intention to impose more stringent record retention requirements on taxpayers, this should be done consistently across all taxpayers by amendment to section 22 of the TAA, and all taxpayers should be given the opportunity to submit on that matter in a manner consistent with the Generic Tax Policy Process. ICANZ believe that section 22 of the TAA imposes a sufficient standard of record retention and should be extended to encompass any information required for the administration of the TCS. (ii) 22 - ISI The only requirement should be to retain records. The provision requires that the taxpayer take all reasonable steps to safeguard his/her records. However, it is inappropriate that a life insurer or super fund could be prosecuted for failure to take reasonable care of the records in addition to failure to retain the records when no other taxpayers face such double jeopardy. Officials’ comment The provisions are modelled on section 26 of the TAA, which covers record-keeping in relation to RWT, rather than the general record-keeping obligations on taxpayers of section 22. Section 26 was considered more appropriate as it focuses only on a specific aspect that has close parallels with the proposed TCS. The proposed legislation, therefore, is not trying to change a taxpayer’s wider record-keeping obligations. No new offences are created for failing to keep records and only the standard penalties could apply to life insurers and superannuation funds. So there is no double jeopardy. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 FORMULA FOR CALCULATING REFUNDABLE CREDITS (A) Clause 6 Section CM15(1) Submission (21 - NZ Society of Actuaries) Adjustments to ensure that the policyholder base tax excludes the capital amount of the TCS refund may be more effectively achieved by premium adjustments rather than adjustments to v0, v1. Suggested changes are provided in the submission. The current proposed legislation has some ambiguity in the v0 adjustment and there may be practical difficulties with the v1 adjustment. Making changes to v0,v1 also introduces some uncertainty in the underwriting income calculation. Officials’ comment It would be difficult to amend the “premium” definition because the term is used in many places in the Act and the implications of making such a change would need to be carefully considered to avoid any uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 FORMULA FOR CALCULATING REFUNDABLE CREDITS (B) Clause 6 Section CM15(1) Submission (21 - NZ Society of Actuaries) The proposed legislation should clarify that v0 and v1 do not include any obligations relating to the extent that refundable credits are expected to be credited to the benefit of policyholders. Officials’ comment We agree that the policy intent is that v0 and v1 should not include any obligations relating to refundable credits to the extent that refundable credits are expected to be credited to the benefit of policyholders. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 EXCLUDING REFUNDABLE CREDITS INCLUDED IN RESERVES Clause 6 Sections CM15(1) item “v0” Submission (22 – ISI) Item v0 should also exclude the amount of refundable credits in any income year prior to that one. Officials’ comment We agree that these should be excluded and recommend that the legislation be redrafted to achieve this. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 51 FILING OF TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATES Clause 39 Section 30C(2) Submission (22 – ISI) (i) Provision should be made to give the tax credit certificates to Inland Revenue in either electronic or written form. (ii) The legislation should retain 31 May as the date for filing the certificates. There would be strong resistance to 20 April, for example. Officials’ comment We agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 52 FURTHER CONSULTATION WITH THE INDUSTRY Clause n/a Submission (22 – ISI) Officials should be requested to consult with the Industry on the final form of the provisions before the bill is reported back. Given the complex and innovative nature of the TCS, there may be problems with the provisions that could be reduced if the industry has further opportunity to review the provisions. Officials’ comment Officials are continuing to discuss various issues with the industry. We request that the Committee agree to officials providing the amendments to the legislation arising from this report to the industry for their comment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that the Committee agree to officials providing the amendments to the legislation arising from this report to the industry for their comment. 53 APPORTIONMENT IN THE TRANSITIONAL RENEWAL OF TAX PAYMENTS AND LIABILITY FOR FIRST AND SECOND SUPER FUNDS Clause 17 Sections FB8(1)(b)(ii) D and E Submission (22 – ISI) (i) Attributed credits and income should be excluded from the amount apportioned under the proposed section FB8(3) and (5) and instead be added to the result of the formula that exists in that provision. (ii) There should be no apportionment of the amount of attributed income and it should be excluded from the definition of “taxable income” in section FB7(1)(b), and the formula specified in FB7(3) and (5) be modified accordingly. Officials’ comment As tax credits can only be received by first superannuation funds after 1 April 1998 there is no need to require that the tax credits be apportioned in the transitional year. Likewise, in respect of the taxable income apportionment, attributed income under the TCS need not be apportioned in the transitional year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 HYBRID SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Clause 27 Sections LH10 and 15 Submission 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI These provisions should be redrafted to ensure that hybrid superannuation funds (those that have both individuals and super funds as members) can operate the TCS as intended. As currently drafted, the provisions do not appear to cover the situation where a superannuation fund can be both a first fund and second fund (for example, where a superannuation fund has both individuals and other superannuation funds as members). Officials’ comment We agree that in principle “hybrid funds” should be able to operate the TCS and also be “electing savers”. We will discuss this issue further with the industry to ascertain the problems with the provisions as they are currently drafted that would inhibit a hybrid fund from operating the TCS and also being an electing saver. Recommendation That this submission be accepted but note that officials will work through how to incorporate the hybrid superannuation fund issue into the legislation. 55 DEFINITION OF ATTRIBUTED ANNUITY INCOME Clause 27 Sections LH18-LH20 Submission (21 - NZ Society of Actuaries) The definition of attributed annuity income should be amended to recognise that annuity income received by annuitants is after allowance for tax. Annuity payments pass to annuitants with appropriate deductions for tax. This means that the section LH18(2) income component needs to be grossed up. Sections LH19 could be altered to read: “The income component of an annuity as determined under section LH18 is the net of tax income component, in accordance with the actuarial assumptions in LH18(4). The attributed income of an annuity is the before tax income component, in accordance with the assumptions in LH18(4)”. Officials’ comment We agree that the definition needs to be clarified in recognition that annuity income is received by annuitants on an after tax basis. We are looking at appropriate wording and the implications for the formula referred to in the next submission. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 56 ANNUITY INCOME CALCULATIONS Clause 6 Section CM15(1), item “a” Clause 7 Section CM19(1) Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI (i) The calculation of “annuity income” in CM19(1) should be grossed up by 0.67. The proposed formula for CM15 ignores the fact that the annuity paid out is an after- tax amount. By subtracting item “a” outside of the brackets in the proposed policyholder base income formula, the benefit of taxing annuity income at the lower rate is understated. Item “a” should be grossed up when subtracting it from policyholder base income and when taxing it in the hands of the life insurer at 21.75%. (ii) The annuity income amounts should be grossed up to a pre-tax amount as annuity income is a net of tax amount. In contrast, the provisions are adjusting a gross income amount. Officials’ comment We agree with this submission. The problems noted in these submissions are tied up with the submission above. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 57 STATUTE BAR OF DETERMINATION OF INCORRECT CREDIT Clause 30 Section MJ13 Submission (15W – ICANZ) Section 92(5) of the TAA should be amended to include a determination of incorrect entry made under section MJ13. Section MJ13 enables the Commissioner to determine that an incorrect entry has been made to the TCA, to correct it and to issue a “determination of incorrect entry”. The provision is similar to the corresponding provision in the imputation rules that enables the Commissioner to correct an incorrect entry to the ICA (ME40) or the PCA of a life insurer (ME20). Section 92(5) of the TAA deems, for the purpose of Part VIIIA and various specific sections relating to re-assessments and the statute bar, a determination of incorrect entry made under ME20 or ME40 to be “assessments”. The effect is to impose a statute bar on such determinations, similar to the statute bar applying to assessments, thereby increasing taxpayer certainty. ICANZ considers that similar certainty is required as to the tax position of a life insurer and superannuation fund as it applies to those entities’ TCAs. They suggest that section 92(5) be extended to encompass determinations made under section MJ13. Officials’ comments Our understanding is that clause 45 of the proposed legislation already provides for this point. Recommendation That the Committee note that the point outlined in the submission has already been incorporated in clause 45. 58 TREATMENT WHEN POLICIES OR SUPERANNUATION FUND MEMBERSHIPS ARE HELD BY MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL Clause n/a Submission (22 – ISI) Careful consideration should be given to how the TCS will apply to multiple policyholders or superannuation scheme membership and the issues should be resolved at the same time as wider consideration is given to the application of resident withholding tax to joint accounts, and so forth. Officials’ comment We agree that there is an issue when there is more than one member/policyholder of a life policy or superannuation fund investment. Inland Revenue would prefer that details such as the tax file numbers of all the owners and their proportions of ownership of the asset be provided. However, we realise that this would create systems problems for funds. The same issue arises in the case of RWT on joint bank accounts. We, therefore, agree with the submission that this issue be addressed in a wider context at a later stage. Recommendation That this submission be accepted and note that this issue could be addressed in a wider context at a later stage. 59 SEPARATE TCA ACCOUNTS FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT TYPES Clause 30 Section MJ11 Submission (22 – ISI) There needs to be provision for separate TCA accounts for different product types where there are acceptable actuarial accounts or accounting records to identify income and tax separately. Officials’ comment The legislation already provides for multiple TCAs, which should cover the point made by the submission. Recommendation That the Committee note that this legislation already appears to enable the proposal covered in the submission. 60 REVISING THE ESTIMATE OF THE NON-ELECTING MEMBERS’ DEBIT TO THE TCA Clause 30 Sections MJ4 and MJ6 Submission 22 - ISI 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone There should be a provision for the estimated liability to be revised once final figures are available. There needs to be a correction mechanism to rebalance the account once the actual numbers are known. It should be clarified for the purposes of estimating the income tax liability for the year (to enable calculating of the non-electing savers’ debit): • what the estimate is based on; • and when this estimate must be made. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission. The “estimated tax liability” for the purposes of the TCS fund’s tax liability will be as recorded in its tax return. The legislation will provide a definition of estimated tax liability. This is used in calculating the fund’s non-electing savers’ debit. This debit is recorded in the TCA as at balance date, notwithstanding that it will be calculated some time after. If a fund adjusts its tax liability after it has filed its tax return then an adjustment will need to be made in the TCA to reflect the change to the non-electing saver debit. This adjustment will also be as at balance date. If Inland Revenue reassess the fund’s tax liability an adjustment will be required in the TCA to reflect the change to the non-electing saver debit. This adjustment will be required at the time the reassessment is issued. We note that the fund has 63 days from balance date to square up the TCA without penalty. For this reason it is likely that the funds will use the best estimate they have at that point of their “estimated tax liability” in calculating the non-electing saver debit. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 61 APPORTIONMENT OF TAXABLE INCOME IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR NON-STANDARD BALANCE DATE TAXPAYERS Clause 16 Section FB7 Submission 14 - ASFONZ 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI The methods available for apportionment should be expanded to enable funds to apportion income on (1) a time of derivation basis and (2) an accounting basis, as well as a simple daily pro rata basis. The other methods are seen as more equitable and accurate where adequate records are available. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission and recommend an appropriate redrafting of the section to accommodate acceptable alternative methods of apportioning income in the transitional period. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 62 APPORTIONMENT OF TAX PAYMENTS IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD Clause 17 Section FB8 Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI The daily pro rata method currently required be a “safe harbour” option with an actual allocation of tax payments being available if accounting records are adequate. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission and recommend an appropriate redrafting of the section to accommodate acceptable alternative methods of apportioning the tax payments in the transitional years. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 63 ELIGIBILITY OF TAX CREDITS IN RELATION TO TAX PAID FOR 1997/98 AND 1998/99 Clause 30 Sections MJ(1)(a)(vi)-(vii) and MJ6(b)(iv)-(v) Submission (22 – ISI) These sections should be redrafted to make specific reference to what credits are available to funds in relation to particular years depending on their balance dates. These provisions appear to preclude a tax credit for any fund with a standard balance date. Officials’ comment This issue should be addressed by redrafting of MJ6. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that MJ6 be redrafted to address this. 64 PAYMENT OF TAX ON ANNUITY INCOME Clause n/a Submissions 12 - William Mercer 13W - National Provident Fund 15W - ICANZ 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone (i) Section MJ7 appears to be deficient in providing for a debit for tax attributed to electing annuitants. (ii) Annuities should be treated no differently from superannuation savings. (iii) Provision should be made to enable tax on an annuity to be paid by way of debit to the policyholder credit account. As policyholder income, the tax liability on annuity income should be able to be met through a debit to the insurer’s policyholder credit account. (iv) Electing annuitants should be able to claim a tax refund directly from Inland Revenue for the tax paid by the superannuation scheme at a rate in excess of that which applies to the electing annuitant. Officials’ comment Annuity income is taxed at the life office level and not at the policyholder level. (It is specifically deducted from the policyholder level.) Annuity income is deducted from life office income to enable it to be taxed at 21%. This approach has generally been accepted by the industry. Under this approach, it is not appropriate to provide debits to the PCA as suggested. It should also be clarified in the legislation that the tax paid on annuity income should not be included in the ICA of the life office. Likewise the TCA of the superannuation fund should not include any tax payments on annuity income. Recommendation That these submissions be declined and the legislation be clarified to ensure that the tax paid on annuity income is not included in ICAs, TCAs and PCAs. 65 MECHANISM FOR REDUCING ATTRIBUTED INCOME BY ANNUITY INCOME TO ENSURE NO DOUBLE TAXATION Clause 5 Section CL 3(4) Submission 12 - William M Mercer 13W - National Provident Fund 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI (i) Provision should be made for a superannuation fund to have a deduction from its taxable income for the amount of the annuity income. The provision contemplates in section CL 3(4) that a net loss arises to the extent that annuity income exceeds the superannuation fund’s taxable income but there does not appear to be a mechanism which allows the fund’s taxable income to be reduced by attributed annuity income. Without this mechanism there would be double counting. (ii) Similarly, in conjunction with section CM 15(1), there should be a similar exclusion of the amount of attributed annuity income from the life insurer base income of the insurer who issued the annuity. Otherwise there is double counting. Officials’ comment We recommend amending these provisions to address the problem identified in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 66 TREATMENT OF DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES Clause 32 Section NE(2A) Submission 10 - Watson Wyatt 12 - William M Mercer The legislation should be clarified as to the eligibility of defined benefit schemes in relation to the proposals. It is not clear what the intended treatment is for contributions to defined benefit schemes. Watson Wyatt question what is meant by “made by the employer for their benefit”. This term may inadvertently exclude defined benefit super schemes (as opposed to defined contribution schemes). So the submission proposes to clarify the legislation to refer to the level of employer contribution made on behalf of the member. William M Mercer query whether the intention is to include 100% of employer contributions to defined benefit schemes as part of the employee’s income even though the amount of ultimate benefit is determined by the trustees. Officials’ comment Contributions to defined benefit schemes will be eligible to be included as salary and wages rather than be subject to SSCWT should both the employee and the employer agree. However, the problem is that employees do not generally get any direct benefit from the reduced tax rate from applying their own tax rate rather than SSCWT as their benefits are already defined. There may be instances in which an employee may receive some additional benefit as a top-up or may be able to negotiate a share of any savings to the employer. But in practice the option is unlikely to be taken up by many defined benefit scheme employees. For those who do, we recommend amending the wording to refer to contributions made by the employee on “behalf of the employee” rather than “for their benefit”. Recommendation That the submissions proposing clarification of the wording in NE(2) be accepted to ensure that employer contributions to defined benefit schemes will be eligible to be included in salaries and wages. 67 DEFINITION OF WHO IS TO MAKE DECLARATION VERIFYING INCOME TAX LIABILITY Clause 30 Section MJ11(4) Submission (14 – ASFONZ) The declaration verifying the income tax liability and tax paid for each investment portfolio should be made by the trustees of the fund rather than “the person responsible for control of the fund’s accounts” as the latter is not defined at law and is too vague. Ultimately it is the trustees’ responsibility. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission. Given that we are also recommending that trustees ultimately sign off the attribution of tax credits and income, then it is also appropriate for them to verify the income tax liability and tax paid for each of the investment portfolios kept separately. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 CALCULATION OF ANNUITY INCOME Clauses 3, 5, and 27 Sections CB9, CL3, and LH18-20 Submission 13W - National Provident Fund 25W - Rudd Watts & Stone (i) The reference in the proposed section CB9(2) should be to attributed income under section LH19(2) rather than LH20. (ii) The reference in section CL3 to section LH20 should more appropriately refer to section LH19. Section CL3 requires a superannuation fund to add the amounts of income attributed under LH20 to determine total annuity income. (iii) Investment income derived by an annuity fund should not be included in gross income. This tallies with the position under the current legislation. Alternatively, if annuity income is to represent gross income, then the provision should exclude gains and losses that are currently non-taxable. Officials’ comment We agree with submissions (i) and (ii). Submission (iii) has been raised by NPF. The income methods in LH18 are intended to cover this possibility. However, we are considering NPF’s concern further and will recommend a legislative change to clarify this if required. Recommendation That submissions (i) and (ii) be accepted, and that submission (iii) be considered further. 69 IMPUTATION CREDIT TO INCLUDE TAX CREDIT Clause 25 Sections LB1A and LB2 Submission (14 – ASFONZ) Taxpayers’ gross income should include the tax credit, otherwise section LB2 is ineffective and the system is inoperative. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 DEBITS ARISING TO TAX CREDIT ACCOUNT Clause 30 Section MJ4 Submission (14 – ASFONZ) The term “estimated income tax liability” in the variable “ITL” should be defined for the purposes of section MJ4. This is to provide better guidance as to the calculation of the non-electing members’ debit in section MJ4(1)(a). Officials’ comment We agree with this submission. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 71 IS A SUPERANNUATION FUND A BUSINESS? Clause 30 Section MJ9 Submission 14 - ASFONZ 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI Section OB1 should be clarified to ensure that the definition “business” incorporates a superannuation fund. Following the high court case of Piers & Ors v CIR there is some uncertainty that a superannuation fund is in business. ICANZ suggests clarification by replacing “business” with “activities” or “investments”. Officials’ comment We recommend changing “business” to “activities”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the word “business” be replaced with the word “activities” in section MJ9. 72 DEFINITIONS AND CROSS-REFERENCING Submission 14 - ASFONZ 22 - ISI 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone (i) Clause 33, Section OB1 The definition of “non-electing policy holder or non-electing member” should be amended to mean “a person who does not elect to receive tax credits from an electing fund or who cannot elect to receive tax credits” rather than “a person who elects not to...”. The change is proposed as there is no requirement for members of electing funds to elect not to receive tax credits. (ii) Clause 27, Section LH9 The reference in the definition of “TC” in proposed section LH9(1) to section MJ4(1)(b) should be a reference to section MJ4(1)(c). (iii) Clause 27, Section LH12(4) The reference to section LH4 should be to LH5. (iv) Clause 27, Section LH15(1) The reference in variable “TC” should be to section MJ8(1) not section MJ10(1)(a). Officials’ comment We recommend that these changes be incorporated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 DEFINITION OF ANNUITY Clause 27 Section LH18 Submission 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI The term “annuity” should explicitly encompass pensions offered by qualifying superannuation schemes. Section LH18, which determines how an annuity is calculated, makes no reference to pensions, although the intent is to treat them the same way as annuities. Officials’ comment We recommend that the change be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 LOST RECORDS Clause 27 Section LH18 Submission (22 – ISI) The word “lost” in section LH18 should be changed to “unavailable” to more appropriately reflect the situation. Officials’ comment We do not agree with this submission. “Lost” is the word used elsewhere to refer to information the taxpayer cannot get because no one knows where it is anymore. In contrast, “not available” could imply that the taxpayer is too busy or unwilling to get the records from wherever they are, for example, their branch in Auckland in the case of a Wellington headquartered firm. In other words, “not available” can be contrived to suit the taxpayer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 CLARIFICATION OF EXPRESSION IN PURPOSE Clause 27 Section LH1 Submission 15 - ICANZ 22 - ISI The expression “...pay income tax...” should be replaced with “...have their earnings from those investments taxed at the same tax rate...”. The term “pay income tax” may imply the tax is payable by the saver. Officials’ comment We agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 76 TAX CREDIT ACCOUNT ENTRIES Clause 30 Sections MJ3(1)(a)(vi)-(vii) and MJ6(1)(b)(iv)-(v) Submission (15 – ICANZ) Consideration should be given to redrafting the provisions to make specific reference to the credits available to funds in relation to particular income years depending on their tax balance date situation for that year. For example, section MJ6(1)(b)(v) denies a credit for income tax paid in relation to the 1989/99 income year for a standard balance date electing fund. Officials’ comment We agree with this submission and recommend that the provisions be redrafted accordingly. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 77 ANTI-AVOIDANCE CONSEQUENCES Clause 30 Section MJ10 Submission 15 - ICANZ 21 - ISI (i) The provision should be redrafted to clarify the mischief. (ii) A provision should be inserted to specify the remedial action to be taken by the Commissioner in the event of an arrangement being a tax avoidance arrangement (so that electing funds and policyholders can understand the consequences of their action. (ICANZ) Officials’ comment We agree that the section should be redrafted. It is aimed at covering the mischief of a deliberate streaming of income that results in an unfair income allocation (and hence attribution of tax credits). In these circumstances the Commissioner may declare an allocation to be a tax avoidance arrangement. If the Commissioner declares an allocation to be a tax avoidance arrangement, section GB1 will apply, the same as for other anti-avoidance arrangements. That section leaves open the action that the Commissioner can take. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and redrafted to cover the mischief outlined above. 78 CREDITING OF REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT Clause 27 Section LH9(3) Submission (15W – ICANZ) The provision should be redrafted to clarify against which income year’s tax liability the refundable tax credit should be credited. To which year does this provision currently refer - the year of allocation or year of attribution? Officials’ comment We agree the provision needs to be clarified to ensure the policy intent, as set out below, is clear: • When a tax credit is attributed up to six months after the end of its income year, a fund has the option of claiming the refundable credit against its income tax liability in either that income year or in the previous income year. In the latter case, the attributed income is recorded in the TCA as at the last day of that previous year. • In all other cases the tax credit is attributed in that income year. Recommendation It is recommended that this submission be accepted. 79 TERMINOLOGY Clause n/a Submission (22 – ISI) Consideration should be given to altering the nomenclature of tax credits, attributed income and similar to remove the potential for confusion. The labels and terminology used in the legislation need to be changed to make them meaningful and to avoid unnecessary confusion and complexity. For example: “Attributed income” should be “Attributed savings income” “Tax credits” should be “Savers’ tax credits” “First superannuation fund” should be “member superannuation fund” “Second superannuation fund” should be “master superannuation fund” Subpart LH should be “Savers’ Tax Credit System” Subpart CO should be “Attributed Savings Income” Subpart MJ should be “Savers’ Tax Credit Accounts”. Officials’ comment We have carefully considered these proposed changes of nomenclature, including in relation to other areas of the Tax Acts, and have concluded that they would not be an improvement over the current terminology in terms of assisting taxpayer understanding of TCS. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 PLAIN ENGLISH DRAFTING Clause 25 Section LB1(1A) Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI The provision should be redrafted as a separate section for tax credits. Forcing the tax credits into the imputation rules by reading the imputation rules as if a number of words and phrases were disregarded is not good drafting practice, and the provision becomes unnecessarily complex and confusing. Officials’ comment In essence, section LB1A provides that section LB2 applies to tax credits. Rather than repeat section LB2 and make the appropriate reference changes, we have chosen to refer to the operative provision. This practice is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 1994. Section LB1A will ultimately be rewritten as part of the Rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 SAVER ELECTION REQUIREMENTS Clause 27 Section various Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI The requirements as to content of the savers’ election notices should be consolidated into a single provision. Various provisions impose requirements on the election notice from savers. For example, section LH3 requires a tax file number, section LH20 requires the notice to be signed, 30C \[TAA\] effectively requires full name and address of the saver, and section LH6(1) implicitly requires the election to be dated. Separating these requirements into different provisions could cause providers to make errors which could invalidate the election. All of the requirements for the election notices should be consolidated into one provision within the Tax Administration Act. This provision could also be used to clearly define an electing saver and make it clear that only an electing saver can receive attributed income and tax credits. This approach would remove the duplication in the existing provisions and simplify the balance of the TCS legislation. Officials’ comment Part LH provides minimum requirements for elections into the tax credit regime – an electing saver must provide their tax file number for their election to be valid, and an electing fund cannot attribute tax credits without a signed election notice. The form and timing of election notices is a matter between the electing saver and the fund. Section 30C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 relates to tax credit certificates. Similar to resident withholding tax certificates, tax credit certificates must be provided to savers and a copy to Inland Revenue. They are separate from election notices, although a fund would need information from a saver (whether from an election or from existing records) to be able to meet the requirements of a tax credit certificate. At this stage, we consider that it is inappropriate for election notice provisions to be contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994, as the Act relates to the administration of income tax by Inland Revenue and not to administrative requirements between taxpayers. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994 is considering whether administrative rules for taxpayers should be placed in the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 CONTRADICTORY REFERENCES Clause 27 Section LH3 Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI The provision should be clarified to remove the following contradiction: subsection LH3(1) does not allow a trustee to become an electing member whereas subsection (2) expressly allows this. Subsection (1) should include the words “except as allowed in subsection (2)...” Officials’ comment We agree that section LH3(1) and LH3(2) should be consistent and recommend that the legislation be redrafted to ensure this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 TIMING OF DEBITS TO TCA Clause 27 Sections LH6(5) and LH12(5) Submission 15W - ICANZ 22 - ISI These provisions should be included in sub-part MJ. The provisions state the time at which a debit arises to a provider’s TCA. The provisions more sensibly fit within the subpart MJ, which deals with TCAs. Merely having a cross-reference in subpart MJ as currently drafted is not appropriate. Officials’ comment We agree that these provisions be included in Subpart MJ. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 84 DETERMINATION OF SHARE OF INCOME Clause 27 Section LH5(2) Submission (15W – ICANZ) Consideration should be given to clarifying the wording of this provision. Section LH5(2) prohibits the taking into account, when determining a saver’s share of income, the fact that tax credits are to be attributed to that saver. This is ambiguous as the after-tax income allocated to a member will clearly take the value of tax credits into account. Officials’ comment In response to earlier submissions we propose redrafting this section. The point raised in the submission would no longer be an issue in the revised legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 85 LABELS AND TERMINOLOGY USED IN THE LEGISLATION Clause n/a Submission (22 – ISI) (i) Consideration should be given to the term “tax credit” having specific meaning for the purposes of the TCS to distinguish it from ordinary tax terminology. (ii) The term “attributed income” should be made more definitive as there may be many forms of attributed income. Various wording changes are suggested in the submission (page 19). Officials’ comment We have considered the identification referred to and believe that no further clarification of these terms is needed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 86 TAX ON ANNUITIES Clause 27 Sections LH19-20 Submission (22 – ISI) The provisions should tax only that proportion of the annuity paid during the income year. There is concern that the proposed provision will tax the full income component of an annuity. Officials’ comment The concern here arises out of a potential timing difference between when income is attributed under the TCS and the actual cash payment of the annuity. Timing differences result out of the different methods an annuity provider could choose to calculate attributed income in a particular year. Annuity providers are given considerable flexibility as to the method they use and can therefore minimise these timing differences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 DUPLICATION OF SECTIONS LH20(1) AND LH20(3) Clause 27 Sections LH20(1) and LH20(3) Submission (22 – ISI) Section LH20(1) is unnecessary because of section LH20(3). Officials’ comment We disagree. Section LH20 follows the approach taken in section LH6. It is not enough for an annuitant to say “I elect”. An annuity provider must have proof of the election, hence the requirement for a signed election notice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 TERMINOLOGY IN SECTION MJ4(2)(A) Clause 30 Section MJ4(2)(a) Submission (22 – ISI) The term “debit for non-electing members” should be “income tax paid in respect of non-electing members”. The current wording appears to be inconsistent with the balance of subsection (2) and the implied cross-reference to subsection (1). Officials’ comment We agree with the submission and recommend that it be redrafted accordingly. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 89 COMMISSIONER’S FAILURE TO APPLY THE ACT Clause 30 Section MJ13(6) Submission (22 – ISI) Section MJ13(6) should be removed as it is inconsistent with the rest of the Income Tax Act. The section notes that the Commissioner’s failure to apply the Act does not invalidate his/her actions. Officials’ comment The submission is incorrect. The section is consistent with sections ME20(4), ME40(8), MF6(8), MG12(8) and MI12(5), which all relate to the Commissioner’s failure to give notice not invalidating the Commissioner’s determination that a taxpayer’s entry is incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 UTILISATION OF REFUNDABLE CREDITS Clause 27 Section LH9(3) Submission (21 – ISI) Section LH9(3) should be clarified as to: (a) whether the income year referred to is the year of allocation or attribution; and (b) whether the income tax liability referred to is the life insurer base or policyholder base. Officials’ comment The income year is the year of attribution (including for a deemed attribution). Issue (b) is covered in an earlier submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 INCOME REFERENCE IN SECTION LH5 Clause 27 Section LH5 Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The reference to “income” in the proposed section LH5 should be clarified. The section relates to the methods of allocating income to savers. The term income could mean “taxable income”, “gross income”, “net income” or some separate notion of accounting income. Officials’ comment The term “income” is deliberately non-specific so as to allow funds and life insurers to use a range of location methods as requested by the industry. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 CLARIFICATION OF LH11(1) Clause 27 Section LH11(1) Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) Section LH11(1) should be clarified so that it is clear that the first fund is notifying the second superannuation fund of the rate at which tax credits are to be attributed to it. Specifically, the words “to it” should be added to the end of the proposed section. Officials’ comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 FIRST AND SECOND SUPER FUNDS AND CREDITS AT ANY RATE LESS THAN 33% Clause 27 Section LH15 Submission (25 – Rudd Watts & Stone) A tax credit should be allowed under section LH15 for a second superannuation fund if the first fund has elected to receive credits at any rate less than 33%. The section allows a second superannuation fund a refundable credit in respect of any first superannuation fund that elects to receive tax credits at the 21% rate. However, it does not allow a refundable credit if any other rate is chosen. Officials’ comment A superannuation fund can receive tax credits at either 33% or 21%. Funds can also choose to receive some attributed income with 21% tax credits and other income with 33%. This is likely to be based on the proportion of TCS electing savers versus non- electing savers in the receiving superannuation fund. If a superannuation fund chooses to receive 33c tax credits, it can choose to attribute 21c of the tax credits to its electing savers and claim a refundable credit in its tax return based on this attribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 REQUIREMENT TO PAY TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TCA IS IN DEBIT AS A RESULT OF TAX DEBITED IN RESPECT OF THE NON- ELECTING SAVERS’ BALANCE Clause 30 Section MJ12 Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) Section MJ12 should not require a payment of further income tax to the extent that the tax credit account debit balance relates to tax debited under sections MJ4(1)(a) or MJ7(1)(a). Officials’ comment The legislation already provides that further income tax in respect of a debit balance in the TCA can be paid within 63 days of balance date without penalty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 95 CONSOLIDATION OF DEFINITIONS IN SINGLE SECTION Clauses various Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The definitions should be included in section OB1 instead of in the substantive provisions of the Act. One of the principles of the Act is that all definitions are included in OB1 instead of being spread throughout the substantive provisions. Officials’ comment We do not agree with the submission. The definitions are working definitions and, accordingly, are appropriately placed in the operative provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 96 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF TAX CREDITS FOR SAVERS’ TAX RETURNS Clause n/a Submission (Inland Revenue) Superannuation funds and life offices should provide each saver with a consolidated statement of tax credits and income attributed to the saver in the year to 31 March. Officials’ comment This is to assist savers with determining their tax position at year end in circumstances for example where they lose their certificates during the year. It should also be helpful in providing a correct income statement to the Commissioner if the Government’s tax simplification proposals are adopted. We have spoken to some industry representatives on this and while they see merit in providing such a statement to savers they note that there will be a cost for them in providing this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 97 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS - APPORTIONMENT OF TAXABLE INCOME Clause 17 Section FB7 Submission (Officials) For clarification, the legislation should provide that it is the income tax liability arising from the apportioned taxable income that should be calculated in order to determine the non-electing savers’ debit in the transitional years. Officials’ comment The legislation currently provides for an apportionment of taxable income. This should be extended so that the apportionment is of the estimated income tax liability. Estimated income tax liability is used in the calculation of the non-electing savers’ debit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 FOREIGN TAX CREDITS CANNOT BE USED AGAINST ANNUITY INCOME Clause n/a Submission (Officials) The legislation should provide that foreign tax credits cannot be used against a liability for tax on annuity income at 21%. Officials’ comment This is consistent with the policy of companies not being able to pass on foreign tax credits they receive to their individual shareholders. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 99 2. TRADING STOCK TAX REFORM 100 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Seven submissions were received on trading stock tax reform, from: Merrill Lynch (2) Retail Merchants Association (4) New Zealand Chamber of Commerce (8) Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (15) Corporate Taxpayer Group (18) Motor Industry Association (20) Rudd Watts & Stone (25) Two submitters (Retail Merchants Association and Motor Industry Association) were heard by the Committee in support of their submissions. Two submitters (ICANZ and Corporate Taxpayer Group) commented that on the whole they were satisfied that the legislation proposed will result in a much fairer regime for taxpayers with much reduced compliance costs than would have been the case under the proposals contained in the discussion document. Submissions reflect this general satisfaction with the overall package of trading stock tax reform. The only area where the reform is clearly criticised is in the impact of the repeal of the obsolescence provision on the motor vehicle industry. Transitional income spreading rules are also addressed. Many issues raised are technical points to improve the quality and clarity of the legislation. The submissions can be broadly categorised into three groups: significant policy issues, technical issues and drafting issues. This report has been organised along these lines. 101 TRADING STOCK TAX REFORM: SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES 102 OBSOLESCENCE PROVISION Issue: Repeal of obsolescence provision Clause 11 Section EE12 Page 11 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association, 20 - Motor Industry Association) The proposed amendments do not address the issue of stock held surplus to requirements which still has a market selling price above cost. (4) The motor vehicle industry opposes a trading stock regime that does not have a specific mechanism to address obsolescence. (20) The motor vehicle industry opposes the removal of the specific writedown formulas for the motor vehicle industry contained in Public Information Bulletin No. 82. (20) Comment Both submissions address the repeal of the obsolescence provision but have different suggested solutions. The Retail Merchants Association submission appears to focus on spare parts and trading stock which is like spare parts, giving the example of bolts. The submission argues that the taxpayer should be able to seek pre-approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for formulas under the binding rulings regime. The Motor Industry Association did not consider the binding rulings process to be appropriate for setting formulas. The submission from the Motor Industry Association states that the motor vehicle industry opposes the presumption that obsolescence of an item is always reflected by its market value. The submission considers that the writedown formula based on age is a simple and accurate solution to the obsolescence that the industry experiences with half of its product lines. The submission indicates that the Motor Industry Association may consider as appropriate an alternative formula, should the Select Committee consider the basis used in Public Information Bulletin No. 82 does not accurately reflect the obsolescence patterns arising currently in the industry. The industry submission was very clear that if the obsolescence provision was removed and the formula no longer applicable that it would take an aggressive approach to determining market value to reflect obsolescence. Both submissions state that the value required to comply with generally accepted accounting principles for obsolete and slow moving stock will be significantly different from the value determined under the proposed legislation. 103 It is important to consider the issue of valuing obsolete and slow moving stock in the context of the total package of trading stock reforms. The majority of taxpayers value most of their trading stock at cost. For these taxpayers, their compliance costs will be substantially reduced because they will be able to use the valuation prepared for financial reporting purposes. The new rules will result in a fairer regime for taxpayers overall. However, taxpayers who have obtained generous writedowns based on the age of stock will take some time to adjust to the reforms. This is the reason for transitional income spreading for additional income over a three-year period. The formula in Public Information Bulletin No. 82 was approved by Inland Revenue in 1974. It allows motor vehicle dealers who are master agents or sub-agents to write- off the cost of spare parts over three years. The formula has been adopted by these taxpayers for both tax and financial reporting purposes. It is regarded to be an appropriate “net realisable value” for financial reporting purposes. A net realisable value or a formula based on writedowns from cost relating to the age of stock does not give an accurate measurement of income for tax purposes. For example, after holding spare parts for three years, the taxpayer is holding them at a nil market value, when they will clearly be expecting to receive additional income from the remaining spare parts held. Allowing a writedown means that an unrealised loss is recognised in the accounts reducing income in the period of the writedown. Taxpayers should not be able to value slow moving stock at very low, or nil, values only to sell those goods in a subsequent income year for an amount in excess of that value. This allows taxpayers to defer recognition of gross income and effectively reduces the cost of holding excess stock and may interfere with optimal inventory investment decisions. Stock which is genuinely obsolete and will be sold for an amount less than cost may be valued at the market selling value. Oral submissions were unclear about the behavioural impacts the new rules would have on taxpayers. It is not clear that the public will be disadvantaged if the motor vehicle industry held lesser quantities of spare parts than at present. Holding less stock will mean fewer costs being passed on to the public. If a particular item is not held by a dealer, modern transport and communications systems should not result in lengthy delays to obtain a replacement part. The submissions claim that the motor vehicle industry is in a unique position with its holdings of spare parts. The Motor Industry Association stated that the industry services products which have established second-hand markets, which was not the case for other products. The written submission states that the motor vehicle industry is unique in the high levels of inventories of spare parts which are retained as a result of the longevity of the product to be serviced and legal obligations under the Consumer Guarantees Act. The Consumer Guarantees Act requires manufacturers to take reasonable action to ensure that a supply of parts for the goods is reasonably available for a reasonable period after the goods are supplied. These obligations apply to all manufacturers, whereas currently only franchised motor vehicle dealers get the benefit of the published formula in Public Information Bulletin No. 82. In addition, franchise motor 104 vehicle dealers do not have a monopoly on providing spare parts for vehicles. The submission acknowledges that second hand parts may be obtained from wreckers or customers might purchase substitute/non-genuine parts. Other examples of products that may be held for a long period of time are whiteware and some electrical appliances. In these cases people may hold appliances for a similar period of time to owning a car. The formula in Public Information Bulletin No. 82 gives a tax advantage to the motor vehicle industry which is not available to other taxpayers, unless they have negotiated a similar formula with Inland Revenue. By removing the formula and requiring taxpayers to value obsolete stock using market selling value, all taxpayers will be in the same position. Taxpayers holding slow moving stock will effectively be required to value slow moving stock at cost. We believe taxpayers can reduce their spare parts holdings whilst maintaining sufficient quantities to meet legal and customer requirements. It is significant to note that the repeal of the obsolescence provision is no longer opposed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and other groups representing business interests, such as the Chamber of Commerce. In summary, we continue to recommend the repeal of section EE1(7) on the basis that: • The market selling value takes into account declines in value of assets below cost. • Writing off the cost of slow moving stock is advantageous to some taxpayers and may therefore affect inventory investment decisions. • It is not clear that the change will have adverse impacts on business and/or consumers. • All industry groups should be treated in the same way. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 105 TRANSITIONAL RULES FOR REPEAL OF OBSOLESCENCE PROVISION Issue: Spread income over five years Clause 11 Section EE17 Page 14 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association) Five years is a more appropriate period over which to spread additional income tax payable, because many retailers are currently struggling in a sluggish domestic economy. Comment Income is proposed to be spread over a three-year period. This is also the length of time proposed for spreading of income arising from the cost only valuation rule for excepted financial arrangements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 TRANSITIONAL RULES FOR EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Spread increase in income Clause 11 Submissions (8 - NZ Chamber of Commerce, 15 - ICANZ, 18 - Corporate Taxpayer Group, 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) Spread any increase in income that may arise from revaluation of excepted financial arrangements over the 1998/99 and the two succeeding income years. Spread either the gross income or allowable deduction arising as a consequence of the cost only rule for excepted financial arrangements. (25) Comment Submissions have indicated that there are circumstances where the managed funds industry, particularly employer superannuation schemes, had adopted a lower of cost or market approach in valuing excepted financial arrangements. These taxpayers may be affected by the changes requiring excepted financial arrangements to be valued at cost. Transitional income spreading over three years has been provided for the repeal of the obsolescence provision to ease the transition to the new valuation methods. Similar issues arise for taxpayers that will be required to value shares at cost. An increase in income is unlikely for taxpayers that have valued all of their excepted financial arrangements either at cost or at market value. However, those that have valued at the lower of cost or market value will likely have an increase in income from valuing shares at cost which have previously been valued at a market value less than cost. It is appropriate to allow income spreading over a three-year period, to be consistent with the transitional rules for the repeal of the obsolescence provision. The submission from Rudd Watts & Stone indicated that any allowable deduction should also be able to be spread. We understand this submission to mean that if taxpayers had been valuing all excepted financial arrangements at market value, under the cost only rule they might have a reduction in gross income or a “loss” from trading stock in the 1998/99 income year. The submission argues that this should be spread. If taxpayers are in this position, they should treat the “loss” as a loss in the 1998/99 income year. It would be unnecessarily complex to provide for taxpayers who may not wish to use this loss in the 1998/99 income year for other reasons, and wish to retain the flexibility of spreading it across income years. Recommendation That the submission regarding spreading gross income from excepted financial arrangements over three years be accepted. That the submission regarding spreading allowable deductions be declined. 107 APPLICATION DATE Issue: Application date should be changed to the 1999-2000 income year Clause 11(2) Page 16 Submissions (8 - NZ Chamber of Commerce, 25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The new legislation will apply retrospectively to taxpayers with early balance dates because they will have paid provisional tax prior to enactment of the legislation. Comment The first provisional tax payment date in the 1998/99 income year for 31 March balance date taxpayers is 7 July 1998. Early balance date taxpayers will have made their first payments before then. Taxpayers will need to take into account any increase in income from the new rules in provisional tax instalments, prior to the bill being enacted. Many taxpayers, particularly large taxpayers, who are facing an increase in income should have a high level of awareness about the new rules and the 1998-99 application date because of the extensive consultation and publicity about the changes over the past year. The most likely areas where there may be increased income are from: • the repeal of the obsolescence provision; • valuation of excepted financial arrangements at cost; • valuing trading stock at cost under FRS-4. Transitional income spreading will alleviate some of the effects on income. It is available for the repeal of the obsolescence provision and we have recommended that it also be available for excepted financial arrangements. These transitional income spreading arrangements mean that the increase in income will be spread over three years, so only one-third will relate to the 1998-99 income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 108 VALUATION OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Market value option for shares Clause 11 Section EE13 Page 11 Submission (2 - Merrill Lynch) Retain current option allowing valuation of shares at market value but remove the ability to value shares on a “line by line” basis at the lower of cost or market. Alternatively, an option should be available to allow companies to elect (either irrevocably or only able to change with the Commissioner’s approval) to apply consistently a market value for all shares held at balance date. Comment The submission is proposing a mark-to-market valuation option for all shares. Merrill Lynch is the only taxpayer which has sought this option. The effect is that unrealised gains would be taken into account for tax purposes. Initially a mark-to-market valuation option appears to be an attractive option because it may provide a more accurate reflex of income than the cost only rule and it would generally be consistent with the valuations for financial reporting purposes, and if so, would decrease compliance costs. However, we consider that there is no widespread demand for a mark-to-market valuation option and therefore one should not be available because of the disadvantages of this option. If a mark-to-market option is an alternative to the cost only rule this would increase the complexity of the legislation, because of the rules required to elect into and out of the option. In addition, shares that are trading stock would be treated differently from shares held on revenue account (which are valued at cost), creating pressure on that boundary. The submission states that Merrill Lynch values shares at market selling value for both accounting and taxation purposes. Under the proposed rules they would need to maintain separate valuation systems for accounting and tax. The submission indicates that the development of a system to track the original cost of shares on hand at balance date will be a significant cost. It is not clear whether they have considered using the weighted average method to determine the cost of shares on hand. This might involve fewer compliance costs than determining the actual cost of shares. There is an apparent conflict with this submission and those made by the funds industry seeking specific identification for excepted financial arrangements. In that case, taxpayers are seeking to apply the actual cost of excepted financial arrangements purchased. 109 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Valuation of excepted financial arrangements at cost Clause 11 Section EE13 Page 11 Submission (15 - ICANZ) Excepted financial arrangements should not be subject to differential treatment. Comment The submission considers that it is illogical to differentiate excepted financial arrangements from many other forms of trading stock, such as commodities. Excepted financial arrangements are primarily shares. The proposal that excepted financial arrangements be valued at cost followed the recommendations of the Valabh Committee in its Tax Accounting Issues and Final Report. The proposal was designed to address a concern that taxpayers defer recognition of gains by valuing shares that have increased in value at cost but recognise the unrealised losses on those shares that have lost value through the market value option. Although this practice also occurs with lines of tangible trading stock, the problem is magnified in the case of shares because of the volatility in the value of shares on the market. The asymmetrical treatment of gains and losses is not justified in the case of shares, which are as likely to increase in value as fall in value. In addition, shares have no holding costs and therefore are qualitatively different from other trading stock. If shares that are trading stock have access to a market value option, whereas shares that are held as revenue account property or on capital account must be valued at cost, this also creates pressure on these boundaries, and taxpayers may have some discretion to transfer assets between revenue and capital portfolios. This was a key reason for the Valabh Committee declining to change its recommendation for shares to be valued at cost, when submissions disagreed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 110 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Issue: Incorporating accounting standards into the tax law Clause 11 Section EE5 Page 8 Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) Principles applicable in accounting standards should not be incorporated into the tax law. Comment The submission contends that accounting principles are not crafted or intended to be used with the same level of precision as a taxing statute and are prepared with quite different objectives in mind, which tend to understate income. It continues that it is undesirable as a matter of principle for a tax statute to rely on financial reporting standards in a way which has the effect that if the accounting standards are changed, so is the tax law, without reference to Parliament. The sentiments expressed in the submission describe generally why accounting standards do not determine tax liability. However, there are specific examples when accounting standards are similar to the tax law and attempt to achieve the same purpose. The valuation of trading stock at cost is one example. In practice, taxpayers use the valuation calculated for accounting purposes and make adjustments for tax purposes. The proposed legislation gives effect to this practice and does not require taxpayers to incur the compliance costs of preparing a separate valuation for tax purposes. The accounting standard that will be applied is Financial Reporting Standard No. 4: Accounting for Inventories (FRS-4). The standard is longstanding and is a relatively clear set of guidelines. Although there is some flexibility in the application of the standard, it is not open to widely varying interpretations. The risk that this area of accounting practice will be changed is small, and if it is changed, the situation can be reassessed. The legislation does not adopt the accounting standard where practice is regarded to be uncertain, and where the potential to understate income is significant. For this reason, the legislation does not adopt the rules for determining net realisable value when the value of stock is below cost. Instead, it sets out rules for establishing a market selling value. Recommendation That the submission be declined, with respect to the incorporation of financial reporting standards for valuing trading stock at cost. 111 MATERIALITY Issue: Incorporating materiality into tax law Clause 11 Section EE5 Page 8 Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) Materiality is not a standard that should be incorporated into tax law. Comment The submission considers that materiality should not be enacted into tax law. In addition, it raises the issue of what materiality means, and whether understating income by 10% would be acceptable under the legislation. If an accounting standard is incorporated into tax law, then materiality must also be incorporated to avoid taxpayers incurring the compliance costs of including all costs, including those that are material. In relation to trading stock valued at cost, this means that costs that are immaterial need not be included in the cost. It does not authorise a global discounting of the total value of stock of 10% or some other figure. Section EE5(2) attempts to limit the application of materiality to valuation of trading stock by requiring it to be considered for the application of FRS-4 to determine the value of trading stock only, not the total application of materiality to income in financial statements. Recommendation That the submission be declined, with respect to the incorporation of materiality for valuations of trading stock at cost. 112 TRADING STOCK TAX REFORM: TECHNICAL ISSUES 113 EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Specific identification for excepted financial arrangements Clause 11 Section EE5(4) Page 8 Submissions (15 - ICANZ, 18 - Corporate Taxpayer Group) If excepted financial arrangements are separately identifiable, taxpayers should have the option to specifically track separately identifiable parcels of shares. Comment The ICANZ submission contends that in addition to the cost only rule it is not necessary to go even further and eliminate specific identification as a cost flow option. ICANZ’s information is that particularly in the funds management area stock parcels are separately identifiable, notwithstanding scripless trading. The Corporate Taxpayer Group correctly identifies officials’ concern about the ability of taxpayers to “cherry pick” blocks of shares sold so as to minimise their tax exposure. They consider that taxpayers should be free to plan their tax position to best advantage. The policy intention of the legislation is to ensure that taxpayers cannot minimise their taxable income in this way. Specific identification is not appropriate for either tax purposes or accounting purposes if a large number of items of trading stock are ordinarily interchangeable because the selection of items can be made to manipulate income from trading stock. This is the case for shares and for all other trading stock. Taxpayers will be required to use cost flow methods for all trading stock that is ordinarily interchangeable, including excepted financial arrangements. We note that both submitters considered that income spreading over three years would be desirable. We have recommended that this submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 114 TRANSFERS OF EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN WHOLLY-OWNED GROUPS Issue: Transfers of excepted financial arrangements that are on capital account Clause 11 Section EE14 Page 11 Submissions (15 - ICANZ, 18 - Corporate Taxpayer Group) The limitation that transfers of excepted financial arrangements within wholly-owned groups must be at cost if the market value is less than cost should not apply when the transferee will hold the property on capital account. Alternatively, the transferee should be entitled to a deduction for the loss which would otherwise have arisen to the transferor at the time of the transfer of shares by the transferor. (18) Comment The submission contends that if the property transferred is on capital account in the hands of the recipient, there is potentially no deduction allowed to any company within the group for the loss. This is a correct interpretation. No loss will be available until the excepted financial arrangements are transferred outside of the wholly-owned group of companies. If there is an exception when the recipient will hold the property on capital account, this creates pressure on the boundary between shares held as trading stock or held on revenue account and those on capital account. It then becomes a potential way to avoid the cost only rule. The discussion document stated that the Government was interested in hearing of any circumstances giving rise to transfers of trading stock or revenue account property to members within the group to hold on capital account. Neither submission gives examples of why this would be necessary, instead, commenting that the restriction should not apply. We are not persuaded therefore that the additional complexity and avoidance opportunities that will be available justify accepting the submission. The alternative submission has the same implications and should be declined for the same reasons. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 115 BINDING RULINGS Issue: Obtaining binding rulings on generally accepted accounting principles Clause 43 Section 91E TAA Page 53 Submission (15 - ICANZ) The Commissioner should not be prohibited from issuing a private/product ruling which requires an opinion on generally accepted accounting principles or commercially acceptable practice. Comment The submission contends that the ruling process is intended to give taxpayers absolute certainty in relation to their tax obligations and this certainty should be available for valuing trading stock. As the use of expert external advice in relation to the interpretation of non-tax law criteria is permitted, ICANZ considers that there is no reason to make a distinction with regard to generally accepted accounting principles, an area which is currently considered by the Commissioner in relation to the analysis of case law referring to such principles. Inland Revenue may not make a ruling determining questions of fact (such as the market value of a property or a taxpayer’s purpose on acquisition) except in limited situations involving international tax. We do not consider it is appropriate for the Commissioner to rule on generally accepted accounting principles for the same reasons as questions of fact are excluded from the rulings regime. The Commissioner is not a recognised expert in these areas. It is possible to obtain expert evidence on market value and in relation to the application of generally accepted accounting principles. In both cases, there may be a range of views held by experts. An adjudication or a court is a more appropriate forum in which to weigh these views. In addition, we do not consider it to be the best use of resources of the Adjudications and Rulings business group to rule on generally accepted accounting principles. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 BUDGETED/STANDARD COSTS Issue: Adjustment for budgeted costs Clause 11 Section EE5(3) Page 8 Submission (15 - ICANZ) Taxpayers should have the option of using a pool basis to allocate variances which can be reversed in the following year and re-established at the following year-end based on the subsequent variances arising. Comment The intention was for adjustments between budgeted or standard costs and actual costs incurred to be calculated in the manner described by the submission. We recommend that the legislation be amended so that a taxpayer making an adjustment for a variance will treat the previous year’s variance as an allowable deduction and include as gross income the variance relating to trading stock valued at cost in the current year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 SMALL TAXPAYER DEFINITION Issue: Reference to “subsidiary” Clause 33 Section OB1 Page 44 Submissions (8 - NZ Chamber of Commerce, 15 - ICANZ) Reference to “subsidiary” in the definition of small taxpayer should be replaced with a member of a “group of companies” using the meaning assigned by section IG1(2). Comment The submission considers that use of the term subsidiary adds an additional definition to the Income Tax Act, further complicating situations where a type of grouping test is required. Use of the term “subsidiary” is complex as the Financial Reporting Act further refers to sections 5 and 8 of the Companies Act 1993. To reduce compliance costs, both submissions recommend using grouping tests already in the Income Tax Act. We recommend adopting the associated person’s test in section OD7 of the Income Tax Act. Broadly, under this section companies are associated if a person or group has voting interests of 50% or more or control by any other means. This is nearer to the subsidiary definition in the Financial Reporting Act than the group of companies test and should also meet the compliance cost concerns of submitters arising from using definitions which refer to other Acts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The reference to “subsidiary” should be replaced by a reference to the associated persons test. 118 SMALL TAXPAYER USE OF FRS-4 Issue: Small taxpayers preparing one-off accounts using FRS-4 Clause 11 Section EE7 Page 9 Submissions (8 - NZ Chamber of Commerce, 15 - ICANZ) Section EE7 should be narrowed such that it only includes those taxpayers who prepare financial statements regularly for annual accounts. Comment The submissions consider that section EE7 should specifically exclude those taxpayers that may be required to prepare such accounts for a one-off purpose, such as a bank funding application. Section EE7 requires a small taxpayer that in an income year includes additional costs of production in financial statements or for tax purposes to include those costs consistently from income year to income year. To avoid additional compliance costs, small taxpayers should include additional costs only in the income year in which those costs are included in financial statements. In years when the additional costs have not been included in financial statements, they should not be required to be included for tax purposes. This approach will satisfy the submission, although it is a different outcome. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in substance, so that taxpayers are required to include the additional costs only in the income year in which accounts are prepared in accordance with FRS-4. 119 SMALL TAXPAYER INCLUSION OF COSTS Issue: Insurance costs Clause 11 Section EE7(3) Page 9 Submission (15 - ICANZ) Clarification of the insurance costs referred to is desirable. Comment The submission assumes that the insurance costs referred to relate to the insurance costs of getting the stock to its current location and condition rather than the insurance cost for the year. This assumption is correct. The legislation should clarify that freight, insurance and any other direct transportation costs should be included. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 120 SMALL TAXPAYER THRESHOLD FOR DISCOUNTED SELLING PRICE Issue: Level of threshold Clause 11 Section EE9 Page 10 Submission (15 - ICANZ) The $1 million threshold may not be high enough. Comment The submission does not indicate what it considers to be the appropriate level for the small taxpayer threshold. It has been set at an arbitrary level, which will mean some taxpayers are always slightly above that level. The level set for exempt companies under the Financial Reporting Act 1993 is $1 million. The current threshold should capture all “corner dairy” type operations, which are the main targets for the simplified method. Taxpayers who do not qualify will be required to use the regular method for discounted selling price. The only additional requirement is to apply margins to different departments or categories of trading stock rather than applying an average gross profit margin to all trading stock. The threshold can be amended in future by Order in Council. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 121 APPLICATION OF DISCOUNTED SELLING PRICE METHOD Issue: Calculation of the margin Clause 11 Section EE8 Pages 9-10 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association) Change the margin requirement to a margin based on the full retail price. Comment The practical application of the discounted selling price is not at issue, although it is complex to express in legislation for the reasons outlined in the submission. The alternative to the method outlined in the submission is to require stock to be valued at current selling prices less the normal gross profit margin, which is the method provided in FRS-4. Advice from the Institute of Chartered Accountants on the application of FRS-4 is that a correct application to stock that has been reduced from a full retail price will involve a compensatory adjustment to the normal gross profit margin so that an accurate approximation of cost results. Using the method provided in FRS-4 is consistent with the legislation providing for valuation of cost in accordance with FRS-4 and solves the problem raised in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that an equivalent outcome be achieved by requiring stock to be valued at selling price less the normal gross profit margin in accordance with FRS-4. 122 USE OF COST IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET SELLING VALUE Issue: Availability of cost valuation method Clause 11 Section EE12(3) Page 11 Submission (15 - ICANZ) Taxpayers who do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate market selling value be required to use a “cost valuation method” as opposed to cost. Comment The submission comments that it would be very difficult to establish cost in subsequent years, while it may be relatively easy to use discounted selling price as a cost valuation method. This use of any of the cost valuation methods as an alternative to market selling value was intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 USE OF MORE THAN ONE VALUATION METHOD Issue: Using a combination of valuation methods Clause 11 Section EE3(1) Page 7 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association) The legislation does not make it clear that the taxpayer can use a different valuation method for different sections of trading stock. Comment It is intended that different valuation methods apply for different groups of trading stock. This is implicit in legislation that provides the option of cost valuation methods or market selling value (if lower than cost). Current practice is for taxpayers to value groups of stock using different methods. This should not change under the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 124 USE OF REPLACEMENT PRICE Issue: Use of replacement price for stock acquired in a previous income year Clause 11 Section EE11 Page 10 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association) Section EE11 does not cover the situation when the taxpayer acquired stock in the previous income year and the item is not normally on the market at the end of the income year. Comment Replacement price is defined as the market value for acquisition of trading stock on the last day of the income year, that is, the price at which the trading stock can be replaced at balance date. To satisfy the concerns of taxpayers who may not purchase stock at balance date because, for example, it is out of season, the option of using the price of stock purchased during the year was given. If the concession is extended to stock bought in a previous year, the replacement price is not likely to be current, and bears no close relationship to replacement price at balance date. Other cost valuation methods should be used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 125 DEFINITION OF COST Issue: Dividing line between cost of trading stock and selling costs Clause 11 Section EE5(1) Page 8 Submission (4 - Retail Merchants Association) Section EE5(1) requires all costs to be included by generally accepted accounting principles. The issue in FRS-4 is when the costs of “bringing the inventories to their present location and condition” end and “selling costs” begin. Comment FRS-4 is not explicit in addressing the dividing line between costs to be included in trading stock and selling costs. However, in practical terms, all entities complying with FRS-4 apply the standard currently. They should continue to do so, and this will be acceptable for tax purposes. It is not appropriate to elaborate on FRS-4 in tax legislation. The submission appears to be particularly concerned about the inclusion of transport and storage costs once the trading stock is within the control of the taxpayer. The costs included for financial reporting purposes will be acceptable for tax purposes. Practice may vary slightly between taxpayers and may change over time as accounting systems improve. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 126 DEFINITION OF TURNOVER Issue: Clarify the definition Clause 33 Section OB1 Page 44 Submission (25 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The definition refers to “total gross income derived by a business . . . as a result of trading by that business.” It should be clarified to ensure that it does not include gross income from the closing value of stock. Comment The definition was not intended to include gross income from trading stock calculated in accordance with section EE2(4). The legislation should be clarified to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS Issue: Make consistency requirements record-keeping Clause 11 Section EE16(5) Page 14 Submission (Issue raised by officials) Comment Under the proposed legislation small taxpayers who do not prepare financial statements and who vary their methods for valuing trading stock must notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at the time of filing their returns. To reduce compliance costs for these taxpayers, a record of the reason for the variation could be kept instead. This approach is consistent with that for other taxpayers, which requires compliance with the consistency and disclosure requirements of FRS-1. FRS-1 requires disclosure of changes in applying accounting policies in the statement of accounting policies in the financial statements. The effect is to create a record-keeping requirement. Recommendation That the issue of disclosing changes in valuation methods, raised by officials, be addressed in the bill as a record-keeping requirement instead of requiring small taxpayers to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 128 TRADING STOCK TAX REFORM: DRAFTING ISSUES 129 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX Issue: Inclusion of goods and services tax Clause 11 Section EE8 Page 9 Submission (15 - ICANZ) It should not be necessary to state within particular sections whether output or input tax is to be included in value. Comment The submission comments that given the presence of section ED4 (which states amounts are GST exclusive), this should not be necessary. The Income Tax Act is inconsistent about including explicit references to output and input tax in a value. References to output and input tax were included to be consistent with other definitions in section OB1. However, the better view is to rely on section ED4, which will have the benefit of simplifying the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES Issue: Definition of generally accepted accounting principles Clause 11 Section EE5(2) Page 8 Clause 33 Section OB1 Page 44 Submission (15 - ICANZ) A definition of the term “generally accepted accounting principles” would be unnecessary if the legislation simply referred to the term “generally accepted accounting practice”. Comment The Income Tax Act contains several other references to “generally accepted accounting principles”, for example, in Part CG on attributed foreign income. To be consistent with these other references the term was used in Part EE instead of “generally accepted accounting practice”. The Explanatory Foreword to General Purpose Financial Reporting refers to “generally accepted accounting practice”. This term has been adopted in the definition to link in with what taxpayers are doing for financial reporting purposes. The requirement is to comply with “generally accepted accounting practice” for inventory (FRS-4) as it applies to trading stock as defined in the Income Tax Act. Defining “generally accepted accounting principles” for the purposes of Part EE simplifies the drafting of the sections in Part EE. If there were no definition, it would be necessary to qualify the phrase each time it is used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 131 DEFINITIONS Issue: Placement of definitions in the Income Tax Act Clause 11 Section EE8 Page 9 Clause 11 Section EE11 Page 10 Clause 11 Section EE12 Page 11 Submission (15 - ICANZ) The definitions of the terms “discounted selling price”, “replacement price” and “market selling value” should be defined in section OB1. Comment The substance to these definitions is contained in subpart EE because the definitions are only to be applied to subpart EE. Definitions that relate to the Income Tax Act as a whole are defined in full in section OB1. Those definitions which only have application to a particular subpart in the Act are included in section OB1, but the substantive definition is included in the subpart in the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 132 DEFINITION OF THE TERM “RETAILER” Issue: Meaning of the term “retailer” Clause 11 Section EE8 Page 9 Clause 11 Section EE9 Page 10 Clause 11 Section EE10 Page 10 Submission (15 - ICANZ) A definition of the term “retailer” would be useful. Comment A definition is not necessary. In the absence of a definition, the ordinary meaning of a term will apply. This is acceptable for the term “retailer”, which has a clear and widely understood meaning. The intention is not to exclude taxpayers from application of these sections, but to provide for the different application of the discounted selling price method for retailers, and for other taxpayers, commonly commodity exporters in the meat industry. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 133 3. OTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 134 TAXATION OF PROPERTY OBTAINED WITHOUT COLOUR OF RIGHT Issue: Victims’ rights Clauses 4, 9, 15, 33(6), 47 and 48 Submission (8W - NZCCI, 15W - ICANZ) The proposed legislation should either: • instead of taxing money acquired "without colour of right", prevent taxpayers claiming losses which arose from activities funded from stolen money; or • ensure that any allowable deductions relating to restitution to the victim is recognised in the year in which the income arises. Comment The submitters argue that the proposed provisions disadvantage victims’ ability to recover their property. This is because, once convicted, taxpayers may have insufficient resources to pay all claimants such as the victim, Inland Revenue and other unsecured creditors such as the courts. They contend that the perceived real problem is the existence in some cases of tax losses being generated. However, the main purpose of the proposed amendments is to prevent people from evading income tax by recharacterising their income as stolen. Preventing taxpayers from claiming losses on this income would not address the issue of tax evasion and, therefore, would still leave a potential hole in the New Zealand tax base. Officials consider the amendments critical from a base maintenance perspective. With regard to victims’ ability to recover their property, Inland Revenue is producing a practice statement outlining how it will administer these provisions. One of the core features of the statement is the focus on minimising any potential prejudice against victims’ claims. Inland Revenue will not make an assessment or reassess a taxpayer until the victim has exhausted his/her legal rights or has decided to no longer pursue those rights. This should ensure most victims are not disadvantaged. Furthermore, if victims materialise after the taxpayer has been assessed and the tax has already been collected, the proposed provisions minimise the potential effect on victims by allowing a deduction to the taxpayer for any reparation made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 Issue: Legal sanction of criminal activity Submission (3W - David and Margaret Troup) The proceeds from the criminal should be used for restitution to victims of crime in general. Comment The submitters believe that those who obtain property illegally should not have the privilege of paying income tax, and the taxation of stolen property provides in some way the semblance of a legal sanction. Officials consider that the taxation of stolen property does not provide in any way a legal sanction to theft or like conduct. The taxation of stolen property can be justified on the basis that by not taxing it the tax system is in effect subsidising those who choose to steal property. Officials also consider that the proposal to set aside any tax collected on stolen property to a fund for victims in general would be difficult to administer. Currently, Inland Revenue does not have the capacity to determine which revenue collected relates to stolen property. Furthermore, such initiatives as that suggested in the submission are generally funded out of the Crown account, into which tax revenue is deposited. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Limited application to criminal convictions Submission (8W- NZCCI) The application of the proposed legislation should be limited by changing the term "without colour of right" to "fraudulently obtained without colour of right". The taxation of such property should also be made subject to obtaining a criminal conviction. Comment The submitters argue that the application of the proposed provisions is too wide and includes property obtained by mistake, breach of trust or other fiduciary duty. Officials do not agree that the provisions require any limitation or that a criminal conviction must first be obtained. The main purpose of the provisions is to prevent people evading income tax by declaring that their income to have been stolen. To require a criminal conviction would undermine that objective because taxpayers could 136 recharacterise their income as stolen with impunity. Inland Revenue is prevented from revealing taxpayer information to the Serious Fraud office or the Police. Furthermore, anyone who acquires property by mistake, and does not return it, should also be taxed on the basis that they have had the economic benefit of that property. Whether or not the action is criminally liable is not a consideration for the purposes of income tax. Generally, property obtained by mistake or through a breach of duty is promptly returned to the rightful owner. In the unlikely event that tax has already been collected from such mistakes, the taxpayer will still qualify for a deduction on the return of the property under the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 137 CONSOLIDATION RULES AND SECTION LE 3 HOLDING COMPANIES Issue: Excluding consolidated groups from section LE 3 holding company rules Clause 21 Submission (Issue raised by officials) Comment Clause 21 amends the consolidation rules to exclude the application of its exemption for intra-group transactions to dividends or supplementary dividends derived by a section LE3 holding company member of a consolidated group. Officials recommend replacing this amendment with an amendment explicitly excluding consolidated groups from the section LE 3 holding company rules. This is because a consolidated group, by virtue of being generally treated as a single company for tax purposes, has no need to use these rules to ensure that it can utilise the FITC credit arising from the payment of a supplementary dividend to its non- resident shareholders. The section LE3 holding company rules were introduced primarily to allow non-wholly owned groups to utilise the FITC mechanism. The amendment to exclude consolidated groups from the section LE3 holding company rules should be retrospective to when they took effect, in December 1995. This is justified because section LE3(3)(e) indirectly already has that effect. This provision treats a section LE3 holding company notice as revoked if dividends derived by the former section LE3 holding company are not taxable other than under section CB10. This would apply to dividends derived by a member of a consolidated group from another member of that group as such dividends are exempt from tax under existing section HB2(1)(a). However, the exclusion of consolidated groups from the section LE3 holding company rules should be stated explicitly, rather than being indirectly provided for through the deemed revocation of a section LE3 holding company election under section LE3(3). The proposed amendment would achieve this explicit exclusion. A consequential amendment also needs to be made to section LE3(3)(e) to replace the reference to “exempt income” with “not gross income”. The reference to “exempt income” was inserted by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. However, it is not consistent with the Core Provisions in Part B, which refer in section BD1(2)(a) to exempt income arising only under Parts C, D, or F (nor Part H). The correct terminology in section LE3(3)(e) is “not gross income” as this would be consistent with section BD1(2)(b), which includes as an amount that is not gross income an amount that is excluded from gross income under Part H (in particular, by the exemption for intra-group transactions in section HB2(1)(a)). This problem in section LE3(3)(e) did not exist before the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, which did not apply until the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. 138 Recommendation That existing clause 21 be replaced by an amendment excluding consolidated groups from the section LE 3 holding company rules. Issue: Foreign investor tax credit rules Clause 21 Section HB2(1) Page 22 Submission (1 - Arthur Andersen; 15 - ICANZ) The tax credit ordering rules for section LE3 holding companies should be amended to correct an anomaly in the legislation. Comment The section LE 3 holding company rules were designed to allow the effective operation of the foreign investor tax credit rules when a New Zealand company pays dividends to non-residents through an intermediary company. The intermediary company is able to receive supplementary dividends under the rules, which it then on- pays to its non-resident shareholders. The submission identifies that the mechanism does not operate as intended if the intermediary company (the section LE 3 holding company) does not on-pay the supplementary dividends in the same year in which it receives them. This is because of the effect of the tax credit ordering rules. Officials agree that the intended effect of the rules has not been achieved, and that an amendment should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 DEPRECIATION Issue: To be depreciable, property must be used or available for use in deriving income Clause 14 Section EG 2(1)(a) Submission (15 - ICANZ) Property should be depreciable where it: • is held pending imminent use in a business, or • has been in use but is subsequently not used or available for use. Comment Last year Parliament enacted an amendment to the Income Tax Act which requires that depreciation deductions can be claimed by a taxpayer only in relation to assets that are used or available for use in the income earning process. The Valabh Committee, which proposed new rules for depreciation in 1992, recommended such a limitation, and the Government agreed to it. However, the legislation that followed was deficient in this respect. The amendment enacted last year ensured that the legislation reflected the original policy intent. Last year’s amendment was not effective in one set of circumstances, and the amendment in clause 14 rectifies that. The submission in effect objects to the underlying rule enacted last year. Officials do not agree with the submission and consider that the current test is appropriate. The submission proposes that depreciation should be allowed when property is not available for use in a business but is held pending imminent use in the business. The term “imminent” is uncertain, and if use is actually imminent, deductions will, in any event, shortly be available to the taxpayer under the current provisions. The submission also argues that an asset that has been in use but is subsequently not used or available for use be depreciable. It argues that assets which are “mothballed” can be subject to a greater depreciating factor than an asset continually used in production. Officials consider that the depreciation legislation adequately provides for such assets. When the taxpayer does not intend to use the asset again, the taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner to write off the asset. (Inland Revenue is currently considering removing the need to apply if assets have a value under a certain threshold). Alternatively, if the asset is again available for use in the business, it can be depreciated from that time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 140 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT Issue: Low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section KC1(1)(c) should be amended to provide for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year. Comment Section 33 of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997 amended section KC1(1)(a) to provide for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year. A similar amendment is required to section KC1(1)(c). Recommendation That section KC1(1)(c) be amended to provide for the low income rebate for the 1997/98 income year. Issue: Low income rebate for the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 income years Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section KC1 should be amended to defer the application date of the veteran’s pension amendments to the low income rebate from the 1997/98 and 1998/99 income years to the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 income years respectively. Comment Section KC1 was amended to treat recipients of a veteran’s pension in the same way as New Zealand superannuitants for the purpose of the low income rebate. The application dates of these amendments were not deferred when the tax rate reductions were deferred. Recommendation That the application date of the veteran’s pension amendments to the low income rebate be deferred from the 1997/98 and 1998/99 income years to the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 income years respectively. 141 Issue: Cross-reference errors Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified four further cross-reference errors that were introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994 by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. They affect the operation of sections CB10(3)(b), GD13(4)(a), LC4(3), and the definition of 'unit trust' in section OB1. Recommendation That- • in section CB10(3)(b), “section BB9” be replaced with “section BG1”; • in section GD13(4)(a), after “taxpayer”, “for any income year” be inserted; • in section OB1, in the definition of “unit trust”, “section HE1” be replaced by “the definition of trust”. That each amendment be deemed to have come into force on 1 April 1995 and to have applied with respect to income derived in the 1995/96 and subsequent income years. Issue: Cross-reference errors in definitions of “direct market value interest” and “direct voting interest” Submission (Matter raised by officials) In section OB1, in the definitions of “direct market value interest” and “direct voting interest”, references are made to section CH3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. In each case, the reference should be to section CF3 of that Act. Comment These errors occurred as a result of the conduit investment provisions in the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998. Recommendation That each reference be amended from CH3 to CF3. 142 4. AMENDMENTS TO OTHER ACTS 143 NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT Issue: Date of application Clause 42 Submission (Officials) The application date for the proposed legislation should be from 1 October 1998, a set date, rather than from the date of assent. Comment Officials have identified a problem with the current application date of the proposed provisions. A set date would provide sufficient time following enactment for taxpayers, tax agents and Inland Revenue staff to be informed of the amendment. This in turn would mean a smoother introduction of the law changes. If the application date remains the date of assent we expect an increase in the number of late applications, thus increasing administrative and compliance costs. Recommendation That the application date be changed from the date of enactment to 1 October 1998. 144 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT Issue: Cross-reference error Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 62(5) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 refers to section 82(5)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The correct reference should be to section 81(4)(g) of that Act. Comment This cross-referencing error, which occurred in the course of the 1994 re- ordering/renumbering of the Tax Acts, was identified during work on the amendment to section 62 contained in the bill. Recommendation That section 62(5) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 be amended to refer to section 81(4)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
