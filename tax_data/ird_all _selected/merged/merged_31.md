The current tax rules on investment operate very unevenly. They over-tax some investors, they favour direct investment by individuals over investment through funds, and they favour investment in some countries over investment in others. A basic principle of taxing investment income is that the tax rules themselves should not create investment distortions. Investments should be taxed the same regardless of where the investment is located, and those who invest through intermediaries such as managed funds should be taxed in the same way as those who invest directly. The amendments in the bill aim to achieve a coherent and balanced tax treatment of New Zealanders’ investment income. 4 NEW TAX RULES FOR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT VEHICLES (Clauses 6, 12, 85, 86, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 113(2), 120, 122, 126, 129, 144, 145, 148, 154, 155, 160, 167, 168, 169, 170 and 171) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces new tax rules for collective investment vehicles that meet the definition of a “portfolio investment entity”. Under these optional rules, collective investment vehicles that satisfy certain criteria will not be taxable on realised shares gains made on New Zealand and Australian companies. Portfolio investment entities will pay tax on investment income based on the tax rates of its investors (capped at 33%). Income earned via a portfolio investment entity will not affect investors’ entitlements to family assistance or their student loan repayment and child support obligations. The new rules will treat investment through portfolio investment entities in the same way same as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long-standing disadvantages of saving through intermediaries like managed funds. They will also prevent over-taxation of lower income savers, and eliminate the taxation of capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held through a fund. These changes are particularly important given the anticipated 1 April 2007 implementation of KiwiSaver. Application date The new rules for portfolio investment entities will apply from 1 April 2007. Collective investment vehicles will be able to adopt the new rules on or after this date by registering with Inland Revenue. Key features Collective investment vehicles that meet certain qualifying criteria will be able to choose to adopt new tax rules to become portfolio investment entities. The portfolio investment entity rules will be contained principally in new subpart HL of the Income Tax Act 2004. The rules will be compulsory for KiwiSaver default funds and will come into effect in tandem with the start-up of KiwiSaver. Qualification criteria for becoming a portfolio investment entity To qualify to be a portfolio investment entity: • A collective investment vehicle must have as its principal activity the provision of investment and savings services (as defined by the proportion of its underlying assets that are used to derive specified investment income). 5 • It must have at least 20 investors, with no individual investor holding more than a 10% ownership interest in the vehicle – the “portfolio investment in” test. There will be some exceptions from these requirements – for example, when a portfolio investment entity invests in another portfolio investment entity. • It must own not more than 25% of any underlying entity – the “portfolio investment out” test. There will be exceptions from this requirement for investments in other portfolio investment entities and when the total of investments greater than 25% is not greater than 10% of the value of the portfolio investment entity’s total assets. • It must not issue separate classes of interests that stream different types of proceeds from the same asset to different interest holders. • It must be a New Zealand tax resident. If an entity fails to meet one or more of these requirements, it will result in forfeiture of portfolio investment entity status. A portfolio investment entity will be able to breach one of the requirements temporarily without forfeiting its qualifying status if the breach is due to factors outside the entity’s control (for example, on start-up and wind-down of the entity) and is rectified in a specified timeframe (within six months). The rules for electing to become a portfolio investment entity and ceasing to be such an entity are contained in new sections HL 2, HL 4 and HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The eligibility requirements for a portfolio investment entity are contained in new sections HL 5 and HL 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Definition of “income” for a portfolio investment entity Portfolio investment entities will not be taxable on realised gains on domestic shares (investments in New Zealand-resident companies) and Australian shares (investments in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange). This non- taxation of realised domestic and Australian share gains will not extend to situations where a portfolio investment entity does not have full equity risk associated with an investment. This exclusion for realised New Zealand and Australian share gains is contained in new section CX 44C of the Income Tax Act 2004. For offshore shares held outside Australia, income will be calculated under one of the calculation methods under the new foreign investment funds rules (described in greater detail in the section on the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares). The definition of “taxable income” will otherwise remain the same as it is under the Income Tax Act 2004. Requirements for investors in portfolio investment entities Savers will need to know whether their collective investment vehicle has adopted the new rules, as the associated benefits will arise only for investment via portfolio investment entities. Lower income savers will be able to elect a tax rate of 19.5% if their previous year’s total income (such as salary and wages, interest and any other investment income) is $48,000 or less. Other individual investors will be taxed at a 33% tax rate on their investments via a portfolio investment entity. 6 A portfolio investment entity will apply a 0% tax rate for any resident entity investors (such as companies and trusts). Tax on investment income derived via a portfolio investment entity will be payable by the resident entity investors themselves. Any losses made by the portfolio investment entity and tax credits received will “flow through” to resident entity investors. The tax rates that investors in a portfolio investment entity can elect to use are contained in the new definition of “prescribed investor rate” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The tax paid by a portfolio investment entity based on investors’ tax rates will generally be a final tax for individual investors. Individual investors will generally therefore not need to return this income in their tax returns, and individuals who are not currently required to file a tax return will not have to file a return under the new rules. If a portfolio investment entity makes a net loss or receives tax credits that exceed investment income, their benefit will generally be available to individual investors without their having to file a tax return – in other words, losses and excess credits will be available as a rebate. The amount of the rebate will be calculated under new sections HL 13 and KI 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Portfolio investment entity income will not affect individuals’ entitlements to family assistance (under the Working for Families package) or their student loan repayment and child support payment obligations. The fees incurred by investors on their investments in a portfolio investment entity will be subject to the general rules for deductibility of investment fees. Requirements for portfolio investment entities A portfolio investment entity will be required to pay tax on investment income based on the elected tax rates of its investors. It will pay tax on investment income quarterly (although it will have the option of doing so more frequently), with tax paid based on the tax rates of all persons who were investors at any time during the relevant income calculation period. The provisions for calculating the tax payable by a portfolio investment entity are contained in new sections HL 10 and HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Defined benefit superannuation schemes electing to be portfolio investment entities A defined benefit superannuation scheme is a type of collective investment vehicle in which investors’ entitlements are not linked to their contributions. Defined benefit superannuation schemes that meet the definition of portfolio investment entity will be able to elect into the new rules and receive the exclusion for realised New Zealand and Australian shares gains. Instead of paying tax based on investors’ tax rates, defined benefit schemes that adopt the new rules will be required to pay tax at a flat 33% tax rate. The tax payable by a defined benefit superannuation scheme that elects to be a portfolio investment entity is contained in new section HL 12 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 7 Transitional rules on election to be a portfolio investment entity On becoming a portfolio investment entity, a collective investment vehicle will need to undertake a “notional windup” (a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the vehicle’s underlying assets) under which any underlying assets held on revenue account will be brought to tax and spread forward over three years. Any losses arising on transition will be available to offset against income of the portfolio investment entity in future years. The transitional rules for an entity electing to be a portfolio investment entity are contained in new section HL 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The rules for use of transitional losses are contained in new section HL 13. Background In June 2004, the government released a discussion document – Taxation of investment income – outlining proposals to reform the tax rules for New Zealand- based investment and savings vehicles, as well as the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. The proposals in the discussion document built on the work carried out in a series of earlier reviews, including one by Mr Craig Stobo in 2004. The proposals for collective investment vehicles have been subject to robust consultation, both from feedback on the discussion document and subsequent consultation with key stakeholders, which has informed the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities proposed in the bill. The current tax rules for investment income create a number of problems. The first problem is the difference in tax treatment when people invest directly in New Zealand shares and when they invest in such shares via a New Zealand collective investment vehicle. Someone who invests in New Zealand shares directly will probably be taxed only on dividends because the investment is likely to be on capital account. Gains of a capital nature are typically not taxable in New Zealand because there is no general capital gains tax here. However, an equivalent investment via a collective investment vehicle will typically be taxed on dividends as well as any realised New Zealand share gains. This is likely to occur because the vehicle will generally be in the business of trading in shares. When a taxpayer is in the business of trading in shares (or other assets) any income from this business is taxable. Similar problems arise in relation to investment in offshore shares via a collective investment vehicle. Under the current “grey list” exemption, investments in companies resident in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States are broadly taxable only on dividends if held directly by individual investors. Investment in these countries via collective investment vehicle are taxable on full realised share gains (as well as dividends) because the vehicle is in the business of trading in such shares. The second problem that arises with investment via collective investment vehicles is the non-alignment of tax rates of investors with the rate at which these vehicles are taxed. For example, superannuation schemes are taxed at 33%, although the investor might have a lower marginal tax rate (say, 19.5%). This creates a significant tax disincentive for lower income savers to use managed funds in order to have access to a diversified range of investments. 8 Therefore, under the current rules, collective investment vehicles, while having the greatest mainstream appeal, often suffer the worst tax result. As a result, many less sophisticated investors are discouraged from investing as they may lack the experience or resources to invest directly. This can create a bias against financial intermediation, which is economically harmful and could undermine participation in the proposed KiwiSaver initiative. The magnitude of the problem is potentially very large as New Zealanders have approximately $56 billion in financial assets, including superannuation, shares and interests in managed funds – according to Statistics New Zealand and the Retirement Commission (The net worth of New Zealanders: a report on their assets and debts, 2002). The current tax rules for investment adversely affect New Zealand firms’ access to capital by reducing financial intermediation. Under the new rules, lower income savers investing in collective investment vehicles that elect to become portfolio investment entities will be taxed at their correct tax rate – 19.5%. The investment income of higher income savers will continue to be taxed at 33%. This is important to ensure that such investors continue to have the incentive to save via collective investment vehicles. Another benefit is that capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held via a portfolio investment entity will no longer be taxed. As noted earlier, these gains are generally taxed if held through a collective investment vehicle, even though the individual savers would generally not be taxed on capital gains if they held New Zealand and Australian shares directly. Further, the proposed market and smoothed market value methods for investments in offshore shares (outside Australia) should more broadly align with the treatment of direct portfolio investment offshore, under the reforms proposed for individual investors. These reforms for individual and non- managed fund investors are discussed in the next section. Overall, the portfolio investment entity rules are designed to put investment in New Zealand and offshore shares via collective investment vehicles that elect into the new rules on a broadly similar tax footing to investment in those assets directly. Detailed analysis Definition of a portfolio investment entity Principal purpose of savings and investment Under new section HL 6(5), a portfolio entity must pool investors’ funds and invest these funds (at least 90% of the entity’s assets) to derive income from investment in land or investment or trading in: • loans; • securities; • shares; • futures contracts; • currency swap contracts; 9 • interest rate swap contracts; • forward exchange contracts; • forward interest rate contracts; and • rights or options in respect of any of these or similar financial arrangements. An investor in a portfolio investment entity must also not be able to influence the entity in making or disposing of the investments listed above under new section HL 5(4). “Portfolio in” requirements Under new section HL 6(2) a portfolio investment entity must have at least 20 investors. Associated persons, as defined in section OD 8(3), will be treated as one investor for the purposes of this requirement. Each investor (including associates) is not allowed to hold more than a 10% ownership interest in the portfolio investment entity, under new section HL 6(4)(b). The following exceptions will apply to the “portfolio in” requirements: When an investor is another portfolio investment entity, the 20% investor and 10% ownership interest requirement does not need to be satisfied, although the 10% rules must be complied with by all non-portfolio investment entity investors. This exemption will also arise when the investor is a foreign collective investment vehicle that meets the definition of a portfolio investment entity except for the residence requirement. These exemptions are provided for in new section HL 6(2)(b), (c) and HL 6(4). A New Zealand-resident qualifying unit trust, a group investment fund, a life insurance company that is a New Zealand resident, and a superannuation fund can all hold up to 20% of a portfolio investment entity, without themselves being one. The 20 investor requirement will still have to be met, however. This exemption is provided for in new section HL 6(4)(a). “Portfolio out” requirements A portfolio investment entity must not hold more than 25% of the beneficial ownership in any underlying entity. To hold up to 25% of an underlying entity, the investors in the portfolio investment entity must be able to buy their interest in the portfolio investment entity at the estimated net market value of the underlying assets at least once every five years. If a portfolio investment entity does not offer such a mechanism, it must not own more than 10% of an underlying entity. These requirements are provided for in new section HL 6(7) and (8). The following exceptions will apply to the “portfolio out” requirements: A portfolio investment entity can hold a greater than 25% interest in another portfolio investment entity or a foreign collective investment vehicle if the foreign vehicle meets the definition of a portfolio investment entity except for the residence requirement under new section HL 6(6). 10 Under new section HL 6(6) and (7), a portfolio investment entity can hold more than 25% of an underlying entity if the total of all such investments do not amount to greater than 10% of the total value of the assets held by the entity. A portfolio investment entity can also hold any interest in real property, subject to certain limitations on use of land losses. This limitation will not apply if the total of all interests in land do not exceed 10% of the total value of the assets held by the portfolio investment entity, under new section HL 17. Interests give rights to all proceeds from underlying investment A portfolio investment entity must not issue different classes of units that stream different categories of income from the same asset to different interest holders (such as the dividend stream from New Zealand equities to low-tax rate investors and tax- free capital gains to high-rate investors). This is provided for in new section HL 5(3). Entity is a New Zealand tax resident A portfolio investment entity must be a New Zealand tax resident at all times under new section HL 5(2). A portfolio investment entity does not qualify as a New Zealand resident if it is treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. Breaches of the portfolio investment entity definition A portfolio investment entity must monitor compliance with the preceding definition criteria and satisfy those criteria each quarter. Under new section HL 6(9) a portfolio investment entity will be able to breach the definition criteria temporarily, without forfeiting portfolio investment entity status, for the following reasons: • Start-up and wind-down: an entity can breach the “portfolio in” requirement for up to six months from the date of election into the new tax rules or on announcement of winding up. • Breaches owing to factors outside the entity’s control (such as exit of investors, fall in the value of investments, company amalgamations): the entity will have six months to deal with breaches of the “portfolio in” and “portfolio out” requirements. A temporary breach that is not rectified in these time frames will result in a permanent breach. Failure to meet any of the other definition criteria will also result in a permanent breach. Portfolio investment entity status will be lost from the date of the breach. A disposal and reacquisition of the underlying assets will be deemed to occur at the point of breach under new section HL 4(2). An entity that breaches the definition of portfolio investment entity will not be able to elect back in. 11 Electing into the portfolio investment entity rules Under new section HL 7, an entity must elect to be a portfolio investment entity by giving notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In the first year (2007-08 year) an entity will be able to elect into the portfolio investment entity rules with effect from the start of each quarter following the date notice is given. In every other year, an election into the new rules has to be made before the start of a tax year and will take effect from the following year beginning 1 April. The income year for a portfolio investment entity will run from 1 April to 31 March. Electing out of the portfolio investment entity rules New section HL 7 also allows a portfolio investment entity to elect out of the new rules by giving notice to the Commissioner. The election will become effective on the following 1 April, with the entity ceasing to be a portfolio investment entity from that date. A portfolio investment entity that elects out of the new rules must undertake a deemed disposal and reacquisition of its underlying assets, for tax purposes, on 31 March. A portfolio investment entity that elects out of the new rules can only elect back into the portfolio investment entity rules after a period of five years from the year it elected out of the rules. Definition of “income” for a portfolio investment entity Under new section CX 44C, gains on sale of shares of New Zealand-resident companies, Australian-resident companies and companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange are excluded income for a portfolio investment entity. Under this new section, the exclusion will not apply when a portfolio investment entity does not have full equity risk associated with an investment, for example, by entering into an arrangement with another party to guarantee a gain on disposal. Similarly, if a portfolio investment entity sells and then buys the same New Zealand or Australian shares within 30 days, the gains from the sale will be taxable. Offshore share investments, outside Australia, held by a portfolio investment entity will be taxable under one or more of the income calculation methods proposed under the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. Income from dividends, interest, rents and other amounts defined as assessable income under the Income Tax Act 2004 will remain taxable. Rules for investors in portfolio investment entities Individuals will be able to elect a 19.5% tax rate if their total income from all sources (including portfolio investment entities) in the previous year is $48,000 or less. All others will be subject to tax at 33%. The tax rate elected by individuals will be a final tax rate. Investment income from portfolio investment entities will not be returned in individuals’ income tax returns and will not affect their entitlements to family assistance (under Working for families) or their student loan and child support payment obligations. 12 A portfolio investment entity will apply a 0% tax rate for its resident entity investors (entities that are required to file tax returns such as companies and trusts). These entities will report portfolio investment income in their tax return and pay provisional tax. A resident entity investor will include another portfolio investment entity. The portfolio investment entity would apply a 33% tax rate to its income to the extent it is owned by non-resident investors. If investors’ interests are held through a custodian or nominee company it must provide the portfolio investment entity with the tax rate information of its membership (the proportion of 19.5% rate and 33% investors, respectively). The tax rates that an investor can elect to use for a portfolio investment entity are contained in the definition of “prescribed investor rate” in section OB 1. A portfolio investment entity is not responsible if an individual elects the wrong rate. It would be responsible, however, if it did not pay tax at the rate elected by its investors. If an individual knowingly elects a tax rate that is too low, he or she could be subject to penalties. In addition, the investor will be subject to tax on income earned through investing in the portfolio investment entity. This could also affect entitlements to family assistance and student loan and child support obligations. Expenses, such as interest costs, incurred in deriving excluded income by investors will continue to be deductible under ordinary principles. Tax calculation for a portfolio investment entity (new sections HL 8, HL 9, HL 10, HL 11 and HL 12) A portfolio investment entity must calculate, at least quarterly, the taxable income earned in that period and pay tax on that income based on the tax rates of all investors who were present during the period. This calculation could occur more frequently than quarterly if a portfolio investment entity wishes to do so. A portfolio investment entity will calculate taxable income in each quarter as follows: Gross income – Deductible expenses = Net income + Current year land loss – Land loss carry-forward – Transitional losses carried forward (formation loss) = Portfolio investment entity taxable income Under new section HL 12, the tax payable by the portfolio investment entity in each quarter would then be calculated with reference to the tax rates elected by investors, investors’ ownership interests, and the period each investor was present in the quarter. Tax credits received by the portfolio investment entity will be available to offset the tax payable on portfolio investment entity income. 13 Loss limitation for land losses (new section HL 8 and HL 17) Land losses are ring-fenced when the total value of land owned by a portfolio investment entity exceeds 10% of the total value of the entity’s assets. A portfolio investment entity must first calculate the share of net income or loss from land. This is: Land gross income – Land deductible expenses = Land net income / loss If there is a land loss, it is added to a carry-forward amount (“portfolio investor class available land loss”). If there is a land income, the loss carry-forward is reduced by the amount of the income. The amounts are then used in the section HL 8 portfolio entity taxable income calculation. “Class income” is the taxable income, including any current land income or loss. If there is a net land loss, it is added back as an “excess loss” (so the net land loss does not reduce other income earned by the entity). If a loss carry-forward has been used (the “portfolio investor class available land loss” has reduced) it is allowed as an additional deduction (“land loss used”). Payment of tax by portfolio investment entities and filing requirements (new section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Portfolio investment entities will be required to remit tax payments to Inland Revenue quarterly, together with an accompanying return in a prescribed electronic format. These quarterly payments and returns will be due by the end of the month following the end of a quarter. They must also file an annual reconciliation statement each year, by 20 May of the calendar year in which the tax year ends, in a prescribed electronic format. Portfolio investment entities will not be subject to the provisional tax rules. Other issues Tax paid by the portfolio investment entity will be allocated to each investor by reference to their tax rates and deducted from their ownership interest in the entity under section HL 6(3). Any distribution paid by a portfolio investment entity made up of income that has been subject to tax under the portfolio investment entity rules will be excluded income of its investors under new section CX 44D. Because the distribution is not taxed, a portfolio investment entity will not be able to be an imputation credit account company. A portfolio investment entity will be eligible to receive an exemption certificate from application of the resident withholding tax rules. 14 Investors with losses from portfolio investment entities (new sections HL 16, HL 18 and KI 1) For individual investors with portfolio investment entity losses and tax credits that exceed portfolio investment entity taxable income, Inland Revenue will compare the losses and tax credits with other tax paid by the investor (PAYE and provisional tax). If enough tax has been paid in relation to these sources Inland Revenue will issue a rebate. Resident entity investors will be attributed any net losses and excess tax credits directly for inclusion in their tax return. Defined benefit schemes Defined benefit schemes, as defined in the Income Tax Act 2004, will be able to elect to be portfolio investment entities if they satisfy the definition of a portfolio investment entity. These entities will receive the exclusion for New Zealand and Australian realised shares gains but will not be required to pay tax based on investors’ tax rates. They will instead be taxed at 33% on their income under new section HL 12. Transitional rules for portfolio investment entities A “notional wind-up” will need to occur at the point a collective investment vehicle elects into the portfolio investment entity rules. This will result in a deemed disposition and reacquisition at market value of the entity’s assets under new section HL 2(3). An entity’s tax year is deemed to end the moment before the “notional wind-up”, with the entity required to do a normal tax return and pay tax on any income derived in the tax year that ends before the “notional wind-up”. Tax payable on “notional wind-up” will not give rise to imputation credits if paid after the entity becomes a portfolio investment entity. This tax becomes due and payable in three equal instalments over the next three years. Tax payable on transition will not be included in the provisional tax calculations of the entity that is being wound up. The use-of-money interest rules will also not apply in respect of these tax payments. If a loss arises on “notional wind-up”, it will be ring-fenced at the portfolio investment entity level under new section HL 13(3). Any loss that cannot be offset against net income of a portfolio investment entity will give rise to a formation loss carry forward amount. Any losses that relate to the period before a collective investment vehicle elected to be a portfolio investment entity (under new section HL 13(1)) will also be carried forward into the new rules but ring-fenced against portfolio investment entity investment income under new section HL 13(3). 15 NEW TAX RULES FOR OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN SHARES (Clauses 5, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 79, 82, 87, 88, 126 and 127) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces new rules for taxing income from investment in a foreign company when the investor owns less than 10% of the company. Under the new rules, investments by individuals in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange will be taxed the same as New Zealand investments: they will be taxable on dividends if the investment is held on capital account or on dividends and realised gains if held on revenue account. Investments in Australian-resident listed companies via portfolio investment entities will generally be taxable only on dividends (to mirror the treatment of realised New Zealand share gains made via portfolio investment entities). There will also be an exemption for interests of less than 10% in foreign companies in “grey list” countries that have a small number of New Zealander shareholders who collectively own 10% or more of the foreign company. There will be a $50,000 cost threshold for investments outside Australia and New Zealand held by individuals, below which these investment will continue to be taxable as at present (for example, on dividends only if held on capital accounts). For investments above the threshold, investors will have the option of electing a number of methods. The two main ones are generally being taxed on a maximum of 5% of the opening value of the offshore shares each year (the smoothed market value method) and being taxed on 85% of the change in share value each year (called the market value method). Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investment in shares will be taxed consistently, whether the investment is made by an individual directly or through a collective investment vehicle. Portfolio investments into certain countries will no longer be disadvantaged, while the tax-favoured treatment of investments in a handful of countries (under the current “grey list” exemption) will be removed. Application date The new rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Under the new rules, the exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for investments of less than 10% in companies resident in “grey list” countries will be abolished. The “grey list” currently consists of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. 16 The “grey list” will continue to apply for non-portfolio investments of 10% or more in foreign companies. However, owing to their widely held nature, the following will not qualify for this grey list exemption: portfolio investment entities, superannuation schemes, unit trusts, life insurance companies and group investment funds. Two current income calculation methods under the foreign investment funds rules – the comparative value and deemed rate of return methods – are being replaced by three new calculation methods: market value, smoothed market value and cost. The new methods, plus the current accounting profits and branch equivalent methods, will be available to investors who hold non-controlling investments in foreign companies, irrespective of the level of the interest, and interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies. NZD$50,000 minimum threshold for application of new foreign investment fund rules (new sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d)) A minimum threshold will apply to individuals’ investments in companies other than New Zealand companies and Australian-resident listed companies. If the original cost of the shares purchased totals NZD$50,000 or less, the foreign investment fund rules will not apply. The investors will continue to pay tax only on dividends if they hold the shares on capital account (meaning they do not actively trade these interests). This minimum threshold will also apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. For the purposes of applying the threshold, individual investors will also have the option of taking into account half the market value (on 1 April 2007) of interests acquired before 1 January 2000. This is designed to assist investors who cannot remember the cost of investments that they have held for a number of years. This amount will be added to the cost of investments purchased on or after 1 January 2000, to determine whether the NZD$50,000 minimum threshold has been breached. Investment in Australian-resident listed companies (new section EX 33(1)(a)) Individual investors and investors other than portfolio investment entities who invest directly in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange will continue to be taxed as at present: they will be taxed on dividends only if the share is held on capital account, and on dividends and realised share gains if held on revenue account. Investments in Australian-resident listed companies by portfolio investment entities will be taxable only on dividends (subject to the portfolio investment entity having full equity risk in the Australian share). The exemption applies only to Australian companies subject to Australian tax law. To effect the exemption, the Australian company must have a franking account in accordance with Australian tax law. Interests in Australian unit trusts do not qualify for the exemption and generally will be subject to the new rules. 17 Investment in foreign companies in which a small number of New Zealanders collectively hold a “non-portfolio” interest (new sections EX 33(1)(c) and EX 46B) Investments in certain foreign companies resident in “grey list” countries will not be subject to the new rules. This exemption will apply when the total number of New Zealand shareholders is 100 or fewer (not including any widely held investors such as superannuation funds) and these shareholders collectively own 10% or more of the foreign company. Such a situation could arise when New Zealand venture capital investors hold interests in New Zealand companies that migrate offshore to gain access to finance. As these investments are more representative of non-portfolio investments (which will still receive the “grey list” exemption) they should be treated similarly. This means investors will be taxed only on any dividends received if the investment is held on capital account. Other exemptions from the new rules Other current exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules, such as those for interests covered by the controlled foreign company rules and employment related pensions, will continue to apply. Income calculation method 1: smoothed market value method (new section EX 44C) Under this method, which will be available to all investors, foreign investment fund income in a year will be “capped” at the higher of 5% of an investment’s opening market value or the net cash-flow from that investment (dividends and the proceeds from realisations that are repatriated to New Zealand). This method will apply in respect of an individual investor’s total portfolio of offshore shares that he or she elects to treat under this method, instead of having to apply this calculation to each security separately. For investors to calculate their tax under the smoothed market value method, the following steps will be required: Step 1: Investors will need to measure the change in the value of their offshore share portfolio over the year. If the value has increased, 85% of this increase plus dividends is the maximum amount that will be taxable. Step 2: Investors will then calculate what portion of 85% of the increase in value should be taxed in that year. If they have dividends or repatriated proceeds of at least 5% then that is their total taxable income. If an investor receives less than 5% in net cash but has positive share gains, 85% of the gains up to a maximum of 5% of the opening value or cost will be taxed. Any excess not taxed will be carried forward to the next year. 18 For individuals (including trusts established for their benefit) applying the smoothed market value method any gains that are carried forward will be taxable only on repatriation of funds. This means that the proceeds from selling offshore shares will not trigger a tax liability unless they are repatriated (that is, not reinvested in other qualifying offshore shares). Resident entity investors, such as companies and portfolio investment entities, that elect to use the smoothed market value method will not receive the benefit of this rollover relief. Any carried forward gains would also not be taxable on the death of an individual investor. Losses of up to 5% of the opening value or cost of an investor’s share portfolio will be allowed if an investment falls in value, with losses in excess of 5% available when the investment is realised in full and the proceeds are not re-invested in other offshore shares. These losses can be offset against the investor’s other taxable income in a year. Income calculation method 2: “market value method” (new section EX 44B) Under this method, which will be available to all investors, 85% of the change in share value (plus full dividends) will be taxable each year. This method will also apply to an investor’s total portfolio of offshore shares that he or she elects to treat under this method. Income calculation method 3: cost method (new section EX 45B) Under this method, which will be available to all investors, offshore investments will be taxed each year on 5% of their cost or dividends, if higher. The cost base is increased each year by the excess of the 5% deemed income over dividends. On realisation of an investment, and repatriation of funds, there will be a wash-up to ensure that 85% of excess gains and losses, respectively, are taxed or allowed as a deduction. Income calculation method 4: accounting profits method (section EX 42) The accounting profits method set out in the current foreign investment fund rules will continue to be available. It taxes investments in foreign companies by calculating an investor’s share of the underlying after-tax accounting profit of the foreign company. Income calculation method 5: branch equivalent method (section EX 43) The branch equivalent income calculation method, which currently taxes interests in offshore companies as if the company were a New Zealand company, will also continue to be available for those investors with sufficient information to use this method. 19 Background Proposals to reform the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares were outlined in the government discussion document Taxation of investment income, released in June 2004. As with the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities, the proposed reform of the offshore tax rules has been the subject of significant consultation and reflects a number of amendments in the course of policy development, to take into account various concerns raised in consultation. The current tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares favours investment in eight so-called “grey list” countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and United States). Investments in companies resident in these countries are taxed only on dividends if they are held on capital account (which is likely to be the case for most individuals). Dividend-only taxation has become, in many instances, an inappropriate tax base because many foreign companies have a policy of paying low or no dividends. The investor can still, however, derive an economic gain from the investment via an increase in the share price. It is therefore quite easy at present to achieve a low tax or no tax result for direct portfolio investment in shares outside New Zealand. Furthermore, dividend paying and non- paying offshore investments are often substitutable. This can leave higher income or more sophisticated taxpayers with significant ability to minimise their tax burden by investing offshore. On the other hand, investment in some high growth and lower tax countries, including trading partners in Asia and Latin America, are currently over-taxed relative to investment in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In particular, direct investors currently face significant tax barriers to investment in these countries as a result of the application of the current foreign investment fund rules, which generally tax full accrued capital gains (and capture the full effect of currency fluctuation and share price volatility). This hurts linkages with these newer and increasingly important investment destinations. A more coherent and comprehensive set of tax rules is needed for offshore portfolio investment in shares so that historical investment destinations do not continue to receive undue benefit relative to new destinations. A further problem with the “grey list” exemption is the difference in tax treatment between investments in those jurisdictions directly and those made through a collective investment vehicle. Under the “grey list” exemption, individuals typically get taxed only on dividends because they will probably hold their shares on capital account. On the other hand, collective investment vehicles are taxed on their “grey list” investments on a revenue account basis (dividends and realised gains) because they are normally in the business of trading in shares. As is the case with investment in New Zealand companies, collective investment vehicles face a tax disadvantage under the current tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. The new rules are aimed at creating more consistent tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares by type of investment (direct versus investment through a collective investment vehicle) and jurisdiction (grey list versus non-grey list and New Zealand) than exist at present. In particular, the changes reflect the need to ensure that investments via portfolio investment entities and other managed funds are not tax disadvantaged relative to direct investment; this is important from the perspective of encouraging investment through KiwiSaver. 20 Overall, the new rules attempt to levy a reasonable level of tax on offshore share investments. The special case for Australia reflects the fact that Australian dividend yields, like those in New Zealand, are relatively high. Consequently, dividend-only taxation is a reasonable approach for Australian-resident listed companies because a significant portion of the earnings of Australian companies are paid out as dividends because the Australian tax system encourages distributions, as the new Zealand tax system does. Dividend-only taxation is not feasible for taxing investments in companies resident in jurisdictions whose tax systems do not encourage the payment of dividends. For these investments a reasonable level of tax should be collected each year. The proposed method, which broadly taxes 5% of a portfolio’s opening value each year, attempts to do so. Detailed analysis Interests subject to the modified foreign investment fund rules The following interests, subject to certain exemptions, will be subject to the new rules from 1 April 2007: • non-controlling interests in a foreign company. The “grey list” exemption will continue to apply to non-controlling interests of 10% or more, unless the interest is held by a portfolio investment entity, superannuation scheme, unit trust, life insurance company or group investment fund because of the widely held nature of such investors; • interests in a foreign superannuation scheme subject to the current foreign investment fund rules; and • interests in foreign life insurance policies subject to the current foreign investment fund rules. NZD$50,000 minimum threshold for application of new rules for individuals (new sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d)) Individuals (“natural persons” in the bill) with non-controlling interests in foreign companies (outside those subject to the Australian exemption) costing NZD$50,000 or less will continue to pay tax only on dividends if the interests are held on capital account. This minimum threshold will also encompass any interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies. The minimum threshold will be available for a narrow variety of trusts that arise under operation of the law: when the settlor of the trust is a legal guardian of the beneficiary or a person associated with a relative or legal guardian of the beneficiary and is required by a court order to pay damages to the beneficiary; when the settlor is the ACC; and when the trust is of the estate of a deceased person. Discretionary trusts, such as family trusts, will not qualify for the minimum threshold. 21 A special rule will be available for establishing whether investments that were acquired before 1 January 2000 fall within the minimum threshold. For these shares, the market value as at 1 April 2007 may be halved and used to calculate the amount to be added to the value of interests acquired after 1999 in establishing whether the minimum threshold is breached. If this amount added to the cost of interests acquired after 1999 is more than NZD$50,000, the minimum threshold will be breached. Treating the cost of pre-2000 interests as half of the market value is optional but, once elected, the treatment cannot be changed in subsequent income years. Investment in Australian-resident listed companies (new section EX 33(1)(a)) For interests in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and held by individuals and resident entity investors other than portfolio investment entities, the current tax rules will continue to apply. These investments will be taxable only on dividends if the shares are held on capital account and on dividends and realised share gains if the shares are held on revenue account. To qualify for this treatment the Australian company must maintain a franking credit account and be liable for tax in Australia on its worldwide income. This will mean that interests in Australian unit trusts that are listed on the ASX will not qualify for the exemption. When a portfolio investment entity invests into an Australian-resident company listed on the ASX (as defined above) any realised gains on the sale of interests in the company will be treated as excluded income under new section CX 44C. Again, this exclusion will be subject to the portfolio investment entity having full equity risk in relation to the Australian share. Investment in foreign companies in which a small number of New Zealanders collectively hold a “non-portfolio” interest (new section EX 33(1)(c) and EX 46B) Investments of less than 10% in foreign companies resident in “grey list” countries will not be subject to the new rules if: • the total number of New Zealand shareholders in the foreign company is 100 or less with associated parties counting as one person; and • the New Zealand shareholders collectively own 10% or more of the foreign company; and • none of the New Zealand shareholders is a widely held company, superannuation scheme, unit trust, life insurance company, group investment fund or portfolio investment entity. Interests in these companies will be subject to tax under current tax rules: they will be taxable on dividends if held on capital account and on dividends and realised gains if held on revenue account. If the foreign company has more than 5% of its total assets in non-grey list and non- controlling grey list investments, the income from those investments will be attributed to the New Zealand investors under one of the foreign investment fund calculation methods outlined below. 22 Methods for calculating foreign investment fund income or loss Investors will be able to use any one of the following calculation methods in respect of non-controlling interests in offshore companies (other than those subject to the Australian exemption): 1. the market value method; 2. the smoothed market value method; 3. the cost method; 4. the accounting profits method; and 5. the branch equivalent method. The market value, smoothed market value and cost methods replace the current comparative value and deemed rate of return methods under the foreign investment fund rules. The smoothed market value method and cost method (if the smoothed market value method is not practical) will be the default methods under section EX 41. 1. The market value method (new section EX 44B) Under this method, all offshore interests for which this method is selected will be treated as a pool. Dividends will be fully taxable (and grossed up for foreign non-resident withholding tax with a credit allowed for these amounts). The calculation method for working out the foreign investment fund income or loss for the year is: 0.85 \* ((A + B) - (C + D)) Where: A is the market value of the pool of offshore assets at the end of the income year; B is the aggregate proceeds derived in the income year (excluding dividends, but including any proceeds from the sale of pooled assets); C is the market value of the pool at the beginning of the income year; and D is the aggregate of expenditure incurred on acquiring any assets during the income year. 23 2. The smoothed market value method (new section EX 44C) Under this method, all offshore interests for which this method is selected will also be treated as a pool. The calculation method will work as follows: Step 1: Calculating the foreign investment fund income or loss 0.85 \* ((A + B) – (C + D)) + E + F Where: A is the market value of the pool of offshore assets at the end of the income year; B is the aggregate cash receipts derived in the income year (excluding dividends, but including any proceeds from the sale of pooled assets) C is the market value of the pool at the beginning of the income year; D is the aggregate of expenditure incurred on acquiring any assets during the income year; and E dividends F is the foreign investment fund income or loss carried forward from the previous year after subtracting the gain / loss for that year, calculated using step 2. Step 2: Calculating the amount of the foreign investment fund income that is actually subject to tax or the foreign investment fund loss that is available as a loss in the year When step 1 results in foreign investment fund income, the amount of the income that is actually taxable will be the greater of: • dividends, plus proceeds from realisations (less amounts that are reinvested offshore – for individuals and some trusts only); and • a deemed percentage, 5%, of the opening market value of the pool. The amount that is taxable in a year will always be capped by the amount of the foreign investment fund income calculated under step 1. When the income in step 1 is greater than the taxable amount in step 2, the difference is the foreign investment fund income that is carried forward to the next year. When step 1 results in a foreign investment fund loss, the amount of the loss that is actually allowed in the year will be the greater of: • a deemed percentage, 5%, of the opening market value of the pool; and • a deemed percentage, 5%, of the historical cost of all offshore interests in the pool; and 24 • the amount of the foreign investment fund loss, calculated under step 1, if the closing value of the pool is zero (meaning all offshore interests have been fully disposed of in the year). Any foreign investment fund income that is carried forward will not be subject to tax on the death of an individual investor. 3. Cost method (new section EX 45B) This method will apply on an interest-by-interest basis, rather than be treated as a pool, and will work as follows: An investor will be taxable on the following two aspects: • at the higher of 5% of opening value or any dividends derived each year; and • 85% of the difference between the sales proceeds and the interest’s opening value, on disposal of the interest. In the year in which the offshore interest is acquired, the opening value will be zero. If the interest is held for the duration of that year, tax will be payable if a dividend is received. In the following year, the opening value for the year will be the sum of all acquisitions in the previous year, less any dividends plus foreign investment fund income in the previous year. In subsequent years, when calculating the opening value for the year, the formula to be used will be: Opening value in previous year + acquisitions in previous year – dividends received in previous year + foreign investment fund income in previous year. On the disposal of an interest, 85% of the difference between the sales proceeds and the opening value of the interest in the year of sale will be taxable. When only part of the interest is sold, the part of the opening value of the interest that is sold must be calculated (by reference to the percentage of the interest that is realised). 4. The accounting profits method (section EX 42) The accounting profits method set out in the current foreign investment fund rules will continue to be available. 5. The branch equivalent method (section EX 43) The branch equivalent method set out in the current foreign investment fund rules will continue to be available. 25 Rules for converting amounts from foreign currency into $NZD Under the market value, smoothed market value and cost methods, investors will have two options for performing exchange rate conversions: • conversion using the exchange rate on the day each amount is derived; or • conversion at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each month that falls in the year. Values at which offshore interests enter the new rules and other transitional rules (new sections EX 51B and EX 54B) For investors other than individuals who hold their offshore interests on capital account, the opening value, for the purposes of the market value and smoothed market value methods, is the market value of the investment at 1 April 2007. For individuals who hold their offshore interests on capital account, the opening value, for the purposes of the market value and smoothed market value methods, is the higher of cost or market value on 1 April 2007. All persons who hold their offshore interests on revenue account will enter the new rules at cost. If a taxpayer is currently using a current foreign investment fund income calculation method (for example, under the “comparative value” and “deemed rate of return” income calculation methods) the new opening value is the closing value used for the current foreign investment fund income calculation method. If a taxpayer has a ring-fenced foreign investment fund loss carry-over from 2006-07, it will become deductible in 2007-08 as foreign investment fund losses will no longer be ring-fenced (other than those arising from using the branch equivalent method). Rules for moving between income calculation methods (new section EX 51(3) and (4)) When changing from the market value and smoothed market value methods to the cost method there will be a deemed disposal and reacquisition at market value. The opening value for the purposes of the cost method will be the acquisition price. When changing from the cost method to either the market value or smoothed market value methods there will also be a deemed disposal and reacquisition at the interest’s opening value. The opening value, for the purposes of the market method or smoothed market method, will be this value. 27 Other policy matters 29 EXEMPTION FOR MILITARY SERVICE IN OPERATIONAL AREAS (Clauses 2(14), 10, 126(22) and 126(24)) Summary of proposed amendments Allowances paid to members of the New Zealand Defence Force that are directly and solely for defence force service in operational areas will be automatically exempt from income tax. A ministerial committee will also continue to have the ability to exempt from income tax the pay and other allowances paid to members of the New Zealand Defence Force who are serving in operational areas. The amendments are intended to remove administrative difficulties in the payment system. Application date The amendments come into force three months after the date on which the bill receives the Royal assent. Key features Section CW 19 is being amended to allow: • additional allowances paid to members of the New Zealand Defence Force as a direct result of their deployment to an operational area to be automatically exempt from income tax; and • a ministerial committee (which includes the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to determine that any amounts of pay and/or allowances (other than allowances paid as a direct result of the deployment to an operational area) are exempt from income tax. An “operational area” is an area that satisfies a two-part test. First, the Minister of Defence must have ordered the deployment of New Zealand Defence Force members for a specific mission authorised by the government. Second, the Chief of Defence Force must have defined the area in which the mission is to be carried out. Operational allowances currently paid under the Defence Force Allowance Programme (a special assistance programme under the Social Security Act 1964) will be exempt under this provision when it comes into force and the programme is terminated. 30 Background Allowances are paid to New Zealand Defence Force members serving in operational areas. These allowances are typically paid in recognition of the level of military and/or environmental threat associated with an operational area. Currently, section CW 19 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that all pay and allowances received by members of the New Zealand navy, military or air force while serving in an operational area are exempt income for tax purposes. A ministerial committee comprised of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Defence is responsible for determining if a specified area is an operational area. As the exemption currently applies on an “all or nothing” basis, the ministerial committee has declined to declare areas to be operational areas. It has considered that allowances paid as a result of a deployment to an operational area should be exempt, but not the full pay and other allowances paid to Defence Force members. Consequently, section CW 19 has not been used. Instead, operational allowances are paid to New Zealand Defence Force members as special assistance under the Social Security Act 1964, in a programme referred to as the Defence Force Allowance Programme. The current payment system was adopted to ensure that New Zealand Defence Force members could receive additional allowances associated with operational deployments without any flow-on reduction in entitlements to benefits that they, or their dependents, were receiving. The current payment system was intended as a temporary measure only until a long-term payment arrangement for New Zealand Defence Force service allowances could be developed. 31 CHANGES TO THE TAX TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON GEOTHERMAL WELLS (Clauses 13, 23, 24, 33, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 126, 157, 159 and 162) Summary of proposed amendments Changes to the tax treatment of expenditure on geothermal wells remove uncertainty about the deductibility of capital losses arising from failed wells drilled in New Zealand. Under the changes, the owner of a geothermal well will determine whether the well is a failure. This decision determines the tax treatment of these costs: • If the well is a failure (meaning there is no reasonable prospect of it being used in an income-earning process) a deduction for its cost or the remaining book value will be allowed. If a failed geothermal well is subsequently sold or used, the value of the well will be written back and will be assessable for income tax. In the case of a sale, the write-back value will be the lesser of its original cost or the price received. When a failed well is subsequently used, the write-back value will be the amount of the previously allowed deduction. • In other cases the costs will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the well from the date the well is completed. If the well is subsequently sold or written off, a deduction for any losses will be allowed. If the price received for a successful well exceeds its tax book value, the excess up to the original costs of the well will be assessable for income tax. The changes respond to tax-related problems identified by the industry. Application date There are two application dates. The first application date is the 2003-04 income year and relates to the proposal to allow a deduction for failed wells if drilling began, or the well was purchased in or after 2003-04. The other amendments will apply to geothermal wells begun, or purchased, after the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The proposed changes will allow a deduction for the capital cost of failed geothermal wells. In the absence of these changes, it is arguable that such expenditure is not deductible. The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • New subsection EE 6(4) provides that capital expenditure on geothermal wells drilled in New Zealand will be treated as in use, or available for use, for business purposes from the time that the well is completed. The new definition “geothermal energy proving period” is important in this respect. 32 • Section EE 32 is being amended to ensure that if the well is a failure (meaning there is no reasonable prospect of it being used in an income-earning process) its cost, or remaining tax book value, will be deductible, and in all other cases the cost a well can be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the well. • Other amendments provide that if a previously failed well is subsequently used and the taxpayer has claimed a deduction for the cost of this well the taxpayer must write back the amount previously allowed as a deduction and this amount will be accessible for income tax. Background Power generators had raised concerns about the potential non-deductibility of the cost of unsuccessful geothermal wells. As a result, an officials’ issues paper released in late 2005 sought feedback on an option to deal with these industry concerns. The original option, as set out in the issues paper, has been revised because of concerns raised about some of its features. The proposed amendments in this bill are designed to address broadly the industry’s concerns. 33 SPREADING TAXABLE INCOME ON THE SALE OF PATENT RIGHTS (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendments Vendors will be allowed to spread income from sales of patent rights evenly over three years. The change is intended to alleviate potential cashflow problems that may constitute a barrier to investment in research and technology. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2007-08 income year. Key features New section EI 3B will enable taxable income from the sale of patent rights to be spread over three years, including the year of sale. Background Patent rights are often sold for non-cash items such as shares or share options. Section CB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 makes gains on sale of patent rights taxable income, but if patent rights are sold for non-cash items, a vendor can have a tax liability without having the cash to pay it. This can create cashflow problems for vendors of patent rights, thus creating a potential barrier to investment in research and technology. The three-year spread will be at the taxpayer’s election, giving taxpayers greater capacity to plan for the required cashflows. 34 AUSTRALIAN SUPERANNUATION FUND EXEMPTION (Clauses 52, 126(3), 126(14), 126(29) and 126(30)) Summary of proposed amendments A new exemption is being added to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to apply to interests in all Australian superannuation schemes that are subject to strict preservation rules, including restrictions on the early release of those interests before a member’s retirement. The changes resolve compliance problems arising under the current rules and remove a potential disincentive for skilled people to come to New Zealand to work. Application date The new exemption applies for the income years corresponding to the 2006-07 and subsequent tax years. Key features New section EX 33 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will exempt from the FIF rules interests in the following Australian superannuation schemes: • approved deposit funds; • exempt public sector superannuation schemes; • regulated superannuation funds; and • retirement savings accounts. These schemes are subject to strict preservation rules whereby the benefits are generally locked in until the member reaches retirement age. However, individual schemes may have some capacity to pay benefits to members experiencing severe financial hardship and on compassionate grounds, although these payments are strictly limited. (For example, payments are allowed to treat life-threatening illnesses or to prevent foreclosure by a mortgagee or the exercise of an express or statutory power of sale over the family home.) When a member dies the scheme will pay benefits in cash to his or her dependents or estate. It is also possible to transfer benefits between superannuation schemes, but only to Australian schemes that meet certain regulatory standards, including the preservation of benefits. 35 Background Individuals working in Australia generally have compulsory contributions made on their behalf by their employers into a superannuation scheme. This type of scheme is an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme for New Zealand tax purposes. Australian and New Zealand citizens generally cannot access these superannuation interests until they reach retirement age. If these individuals migrate or return to New Zealand they could be subject to tax on these interests under the FIF rules if they continue to make contributions to the scheme after being resident in New Zealand for five years. Consultation with the private sector has indicated that people with Australian superannuation interests may not be complying correctly with their tax obligations under the FIF rules and, indeed, might not even be aware that they have to account for tax. This non-compliance is not unique to people with Australian superannuation interests. For those people who are aware of their tax responsibilities, determining whether they have a FIF obligation can involve high compliance costs. Although the current exemptions provide some relief from these rules, members may have difficulty in determining which exemption applies to them and what their future obligations are. In addition, the potential tax consequences under the FIF rules facing certain people with interests in particular superannuation schemes could be a disincentive for them to take up long-term or permanent employment in New Zealand. For example, members of defined benefit schemes 1 need to continue to contribute to such schemes in order to preserve the expected value of their future entitlements. If they cease making contributions, the ultimate benefit payout could be significantly reduced from the level expected had contributions continued. While it is in their interests to continue to contribute they would eventually face tax consequences under the FIF rules. A member could transfer his or her entitlements in a defined benefit scheme to another scheme such as a defined contribution scheme, but this transfer could also give rise to a FIF liability. The scope of the proposed exemption would have a fairly wide coverage because most superannuation schemes in Australia (including those schemes that receive compulsory employment superannuation contributions under Australia’s guarantee scheme) will fall within one of the listed schemes in new section EX 33. These schemes are all subject to strict prudential standards and rules relating to the preservation and early release of superannuation benefits. Therefore the proposed exemption should achieve the desired policy outcome – to resolve the tax and compliance problems arising under the FIF rules in relation to trans-Tasman migration. 1 Defined benefit schemes provide superannuation benefits that are based on the member’s salary at a particular time (or averaged over a particular period) or some other amount specified in the trust deed of the scheme. 36 Detailed analysis Description of Australian superannuation schemes The superannuation schemes listed in new section EX 33 are all constituted under Australian law. The principal legislation governing the regulation of superannuation in Australia is the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SISA) and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 (SISR). Approved deposit funds An “approved deposit fund” is defined in section 10 of SISA. Approved deposit funds receive, hold and invest certain types of roll-over funds until such funds are withdrawn in accordance with the preservation rules in SISA. They were created as roll-over vehicles into which a member could transfer superannuation benefits so as to retain them in the superannuation system. Exempt public sector superannuation schemes An “exempt public sector superannuation scheme” is defined in section 10 of SISA. Exempt public sector superannuation schemes provide for the payment of superannuation, retirement or death benefits, and are established under: • a Commonwealth, state or territory law; or • the authority of the Commonwealth, state or territory government, or a municipal corporation, another local governing body or a public authority that is constituted by or under a Commonwealth, state or territory law. These schemes are specifically listed in schedule 1AA of SISR. Although these schemes are not regulated under SISA, they do conform to the principles of that Act. Regulated superannuation funds A “regulated superannuation fund” is defined in section 19 of SISA. These funds have made an irrevocable election for the regulatory provisions of SISA to apply to them. Most entities involved in the provision of superannuation in Australia will be regulated superannuation funds. They include: • corporate/employer funds, which are established and run by an employer (usually large) for its own employees; • industry funds, which are for employees of different employers in the same industry, for example, hospitality industry or building industry; • retail or public offer funds, which are open to any one to join, and are usually run by large banks or life insurance companies; • small funds approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority 2 and self-managed superannuation funds. 3 These funds have five or fewer members and are predominantly used by the self-employed. 2 The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is responsible for prudential regulation of all superannuation funds, except self- managed funds, and for ensuring that those funds comply with the relevant regulatory standards. 3 Self-managed superannuation funds are administered by the Australian Tax Office. 37 Retirement savings accounts A “retirement savings account” is defined in section 8 of the Retirement Savings Account Act 1991. These accounts are typically offered by banks or similar financial institutions and operate in a similar way to a bank account – accumulating small amounts deposited regularly by their members and by the member’s employer and paying interest on those deposits. The money is invested in assets that are low risk. The Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997 contain preservation rules including restrictions on the early release of benefits from retirement savings accounts, which are identical to the preservation rules in the SISR. Preservation rules and restrictions on early release In general, superannuation benefits may only be paid out on the occurrence of one of the following events: • retirement on or after reaching preservation age. A member’s preservation age depends on his or her date of birth – if before 1 July 1960, his or her preservation age would be 55 years. 4 In addition, if a member is aged less than 60 the scheme must be satisfied that the member never intends to work again; • reaching age 65 years; • permanent incapacity; • termination at any age of gainful employment with an employer who had contributed to the scheme, as long as the benefits are paid in the form of a non- commutable lifetime pension. The early release of superannuation benefits is not permitted on any grounds other than those specified by the relevant legislation. The final decision on whether a release is permitted on any grounds rests with the trustees of the applicant’s superannuation schemes, subject to the governing rules of the scheme. There are two main ways in which individuals may be able to access their superannuation benefits before reaching their retirement age. They can apply to their superannuation scheme’s trustee on the grounds of severe financial hardship or apply to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for release on compassionate grounds. Benefits may be released on compassionate grounds only in very limited circumstances. These circumstances are defined in relevant legislation or in the trust deed of the scheme, and cover expenses in respect of medical treatment, medical transport, modifications necessary for the family home or motor vehicle owing to severe disability, palliative care, and funeral expenses. Funds may also be released on compassionate grounds to prevent foreclosure of a mortgage or exercise of a power of sale over the member’s principal place of residence. Benefits can also be released to meet expenses in other cases where the release is consistent with one of these grounds. 4 The preservation age is increasing from 55 to 60 on a phased basis between the years 2015 and 2025. This will mean that for an individual born before 1 July 1960, the preservation age will remain at 55 years, whereas for an individual born after 30 June 1964, the preservation age will rise to 60. 38 The regulatory arrangements attempt to balance the need for superannuation benefits to be protected for retirement purposes against the need for access to be provided where superannuation fund members experience personal emergency situations. Non-preserved or unrestricted interests The proposed exemption applies to interests in all Australian superannuation schemes that are subject to preservation arrangements. However, some interests that were acquired before certain dates might not be preserved or restricted. This is because, over the years, the rules relating to accessing Australian superannuation benefits have been gradually tightened to encourage or enforce the preservation of member interests, although the general practice has been to “grandparent” any interests that members have at the time of each change. Even so, the government considers that these unpreserved or unrestricted interests should still qualify for exemption from the FIF rules as long as the scheme itself is now subject to the preservation rules, including restrictions on early release of benefits. Excluding these interests from the exemption relief would have led to both compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, thereby negating any benefit to be gained from the proposed exemption. 39 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 89) Summary of proposed amendments The Children on the Edge (NZ) Trust, the DIPS’N Charitable Trust (International), The New Zealand Council of the Ramabai Mukti Mission Trust Board, the Waterharvest Trust and the Zonta International District 16 (New Zealand) Charitable Trust are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2006-07 tax year. Key features The following organisations are being added to section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Children on the Edge (NZ) Trust; • DIPS’N Charitable Trust (International); • The New Zealand Council of the Ramabai Mukti Mission Trust Board; • Waterharvest Trust; and • Zonta International District 16 (New Zealand) Charitable Trust. Background Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated, to a maximum of $630 a year. Donations by non-closely held companies, and closely held companies which are listed on a recognised stock exchange, qualify for a deduction to a maximum of 5 percent of their net income. A Maori authority may also claim a deduction from its net income. The maximum deduction for a Maori authority is 5% of its net income donated to charitable organisations and/or a body that has been defined as a Maori association under the Maori Community Development Act 1962. 40 Children on the Edge (NZ) Trust The initial aim of the Children on the Edge (NZ) Trust is to assist children and alleviate poverty and hardship, initially in institutions and schools in Myanmar, and in other countries where children are subject to poverty and hardship. DIPS’N Charitable Trust (International) This organisation currently works in the South Pacific, India, Bangladesh and Nepal providing basic necessities to people with intellectual or physical disabilities who are neglected by their own communities. The New Zealand Council of the Ramabai Mukti Mission Trust Board This organisation’s activities include providing children’s homes, schools and medical services in the Maharashtra State in India. Waterharvest Trust The Waterharvest Trust has been established to work in developing countries to harvest water in arid areas to provide healthy water for human and animal consumption, and for agriculture. Its activities will be focused in the Middle East. Zonta International District 16 (New Zealand) Charitable Trust This organisation will work in countries which are recognised as developing countries by the United Nations promoting education, and the relief of sickness, disease and poverty for women. 41 THE IMPUTATION SYSTEM AND COMPANIES TREATED AS BEING NOT RESIDENT UNDER A DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT (Clause 113(1)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment clarifies that companies (other than Australian imputation credit account companies) cannot maintain an imputation credit account if they are treated as being not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement. Application date The amendment will take effect from the date of introduction of the bill. Key features This is a clarifying amendment. Section ME 1(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004 is intended to prevent a company that is treated under a double tax agreement as being not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the double tax agreement from maintaining an imputation credit account. The amendment makes clear that this provision applies to all resident companies treated as being not resident under a double tax agreement, irrespective of whether they have income that is exempted from tax under that agreement. Background Currently, section ME 1(2)(b) provides that a company must not establish and maintain an imputation credit account if it is resident in New Zealand but not subject to tax on part or all of its income under a double tax agreement when it is, for the purposes of that agreement, treated as not being a resident of New Zealand. The reference in section ME 1(2)(b) to the company being “not subject to tax in respect of part or all of its income under a double tax agreement” is intended to be descriptive: it sets out the general consequence of deemed non-residence under a double tax agreement. It is possible, however, that this reference could be interpreted as narrowing the circumstances in which a company is prevented from maintaining an imputation credit account. A company that was treated as being not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement, but that did not actually have any income that was exempted from tax as a result, might consider itself to be outside the scope of section ME 1(2)(b). Section ME 1(2)(b) is intended to cover all resident companies treated as being not resident under a double tax agreement, irrespective of whether they have income that is exempted from tax as a result. The amendment clarifies the provision to put this beyond doubt, bringing the drafting more closely into line with equivalent provisions elsewhere in the Act. 42 “SALARY SACRIFICE”: ENSURING THAT EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAXED FAIRLY (Clauses 2(11), 116, 117, 118, 119, 126(33), 130 and 143) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to ensure that employer superannuation contributions are taxed at approximately the right marginal tax rate for individual employees. The changes are designed to minimise the potential for taxpayers to use excessive “salary sacrifice” as a means of paying less tax. As a result: • Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) rates under the progressive scale will be based on the total of an employee’s salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions. • The thresholds for SSCWT rates under the progressive scale are being increased by 15% over the corresponding personal income tax thresholds. In addition, to reduce the complexity of the legislation, methods of assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions that are not being used (39% SSCWT flat rate) or are used only by a small number of offshore employees (the PAYE method) are removed. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • The basis on which tax rates are selected under the progressive SSCWT scale will be the “SSCWT rate threshold amount”, which is defined as the total of salary and wages and employer superannuation contributions (section NE 2B, definition “SSCWT rate threshold amount”, Schedule 1, clause 10(a), and Part C). • The thresholds for the progressive SSCWT scale will be increased by 15% over the corresponding personal income tax thresholds (Schedule 1, Part C). • The PAYE method for assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions will be removed (section NE 2A). • The 39% SSCWT flat rate will be removed (section NE 2AA, Schedule 1, old clause 10(a)). 43 The Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to take account of the removal of the PAYE method and the 39% flat rate for assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions. Background A progressive scale for SSCWT was introduced on 1 April 2004. The intent was to ensure that lower paid workers would not be over-taxed on employer superannuation contributions, by allowing SSCWT rates to be matched with income tax rates, except that there was no 39% SSCWT rate. The rates were based on an employee’s salary and wages in the previous income year or, if the employee was new, on an estimate of salary and wages in the current year. This created the potential for employees to sacrifice a portion of salary taxed at higher rates in return for increased employer superannuation contributions taxed at lower rates. If salary and wages were reduced to below $9,500, the highest rate of taxation on remuneration, by the second year of such an arrangement, whatever form it was received in, would be 15%. Likewise, if salary and wages were reduced to below $38,000, the highest rate of taxation on remuneration would be 21%. Officials were to monitor the occurrence and extent of salary sacrifice, if any. In 2005, anecdotal evidence, some of it suggestive of systematic misuse of the rules, indicated that the incidence of salary sacrifice – and the consequent risk to the revenue base – were increasing. Excessive salary sacrifice using the progressive SSCWT scale could undermine the fairness of the tax system, because taxpayers who engage in the practice could pay significantly less tax overall than other taxpayers who earn the same or even less income. Those who engage in excessive salary sacrifice will typically be able to do so only because they have other sources of support, such as high assets or income from investments, or partners who are able to support them, so it is not available to all taxpayers. Government revenue may also be compromised, putting upwards pressure on other tax rates. An officials’ issues paper, Countering extreme salary sacrifice: ensuring that employer superannuation contributions are taxed fairly, was issued in February 2006. The issues paper suggested amending the SSCWT rules as set out in the bill. The paper also suggested reducing the complexity in the SSCWT rules by removing methods of assessing tax liabilities on employer superannuation contributions that are not being used. The government announced in April that it would introduce legislation to ensure that employer superannuation contributions are taxed at about the correct marginal rate for each employee, thus minimising the potential use of excessive salary sacrifice as a means of paying less tax. 44 Detailed analysis Changing the progressive SSCWT scale The intention of the proposed changes to the progressive SSCWT scale is to ensure that employee remuneration received in the form of employer superannuation contributions is taxed at more or less the correct marginal rate for each employee. This is consistent with the original intent of the progressive scale. New section NE 2B allows employers to choose to calculate SSCWT under the progressive scale, using the SSCWT rate threshold amount and Schedule 1, Part A, clause 10(a). A new definition of “SSCWT rate threshold amount” in section OB 1 sets out the basis for selecting SSCWT rates under the progressive scale as the total of salary and wages and employer superannuation contributions in the previous year or, when the employee is new, an estimate of the amount that he or she will receive as salary and wages and employer superannuation contributions. However, adding employer superannuation contributions to salary and wages to determine the SSCWT rate threshold amount could result in some employees being over-taxed on employee superannuation contributions if those contributions are sufficiently high to move them over an SSCWT threshold. Example 1: Over-taxation when SSCWT is based on salary and wages and superannuation contributions, and thresholds are the same as the effective personal income tax thresholds Hemi earns $36,000 salary, and also receives $3,600 in employer superannuation contributions (total of $39,600). If SSCWT rates are determined by the total of salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions, and thresholds are equivalent to personal income tax thresholds, his SSCWT rate would be 33%, and he would pay $1,188 SSCWT. Had he received those superannuation contributions as salary or wages, $2,000 of the $3,600 would have been taxed at the lower effective rate of 21%. He is over-taxed by $240 on his employer superannuation contributions. To minimise the possibility of over-taxation, SSCWT thresholds will be increased by 15% over the equivalent personal income tax thresholds. Available evidence indicates that most employer superannuation contributions are equivalent to 15% or less of salary and wages, so increasing thresholds by this percentage means that employer superannuation contributions alone should not be sufficient to push an employee from one SSCWT threshold to the next. The new SSCWT threshold scale will be: Salary and wages and employer superannuation contributions: Employer superannuation contributions taxed at: Up to $10,925 15% Between $10,925 and $43,700 21% Over $43,700 33% The rates and thresholds will be in Schedule 1, Part C. 45 Example 2: SSCWT based on salary or wages and superannuation contributions, and thresholds 15% higher than the corresponding effective income tax thresholds Kylie earns $36,000 salary, and also receives $3,600 employer superannuation contributions (total of $39,600). Under the proposed changes to the SSCWT thresholds and rates, her SSCWT rate will be 21%, and she will pay $756 SSCWT. As is the case now, there will be no 39% rate for SSCWT under the progressive scale. The 33% default rate will remain, as required under section NE 2(1) and Schedule 1, Part A, clause 10(b), so that employers can elect to pay the default rate of SSCWT. It can be paid even in respect of employees who would be subject to lower rates under the progressive scale, so that employers can elect to pay a higher rate of SSCWT in return for a simpler method of calculating SSCWT. This is similar to the approach taken with fringe benefit tax, where employers can elect to use a higher but simpler rate, or a lower but more complex rate. Because the highest rate of SSCWT (33%) will be less than the highest rate of income tax (39%), fund withdrawal tax, effectively an extra 5% tax, will continue to apply to certain early withdrawals of employer superannuation contributions from superannuation funds. There will be exceptions in some cases such as hardship and division of matrimonial property, as at present. Submissions on the issues paper raised concerns about retaining a savings incentive, the possibility of over-taxation, complexity and compliance costs. As detailed earlier, the existing difference between the top rate of SSCWT and the top rate of income tax will be retained, and KiwiSaver, which is expected to come into effect at the same time as the SSCWT changes, provides a savings incentive for all people, especially those on lower incomes. Further, the possibility of over-taxation will be minimised by increasing the SSCWT thresholds by 15% over the corresponding income tax thresholds, and employers will be able to avoid complexity and minimise compliance costs by paying the default rate of 33%. Removing two options The flat rate of 39% on all contributions made on behalf of an employee is not being used. This method was introduced so that an employee could bypass the FWT rules by having employer superannuation contributions taxed at the top marginal rate, but it is not being used. Removing this provision will simplify the legislation The method for assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions whereby they are treated as part of salary and wages and subjected to income tax using the standard PAYE mechanisms is used only by a small number off non-resident employees. Removing this provision will simplify the legislation. Affected employees could be taxed under the progressive SSCWT scale, or at the default rate of 33%. 46 Consequential amendments The rules for fund withdrawal tax are being amended to take account of the removal of the flat 39% rate of SSCWT and the PAYE methods of assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions. Both methods enabled employees to bypass FWT on withdrawing employer superannuation contributions from superannuation funds, because the full amount of tax had already been paid on the contributions. 47 CONSOLIDATED GROUPS AND FOREIGN LOSSES (Clauses 126(10), 126(36), 126(37), 162(2), 162(4) and 162(5)) Summary of proposed amendment Certain dual-resident companies will be prevented from grouping foreign losses under the rules for consolidated groups if they cannot do so under loss rules applying to non- consolidated groups. The amendment will make the rules for consolidated groups consistent with loss rules for non-consolidated groups by preventing losses from being used in two different jurisdictions. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1997-1998 income year. However, it will not apply to taxpayers who took a tax position, in a return filed before the introduction of this bill, on the basis that they could group their losses under the current consolidation rules. Key features Currently, every member of a consolidated group must be an “eligible company” as defined in OB 1. The amendment will modify the definition of “eligible company” to require that the company in question be incorporated in New Zealand or carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. The amendment will also require that an eligible company must not be liable for tax in another jurisdiction by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation. A similar amendment is being made to the Income Tax Act 1994 and will apply from the 1997-1998 income year, except for taxpayers who have already filed a return on the basis that they could group their losses under the current consolidation rules. Background Under group loss rules, a loss-making company can offset its losses against the income of another company in the same group. Companies can group their losses if they are at least 66% commonly owned. Under the consolidation rules, companies can elect to be treated as a single entity (the “consolidated group”) if they are 100% commonly owned, subject to certain other requirements contained in the definition of “eligible company”. Effectively, this means that a loss-making company can offset its income against another company in the same consolidated group. 48 There are two restrictions that limit companies in a non-consolidated group from grouping the same loss in more than one jurisdiction. First, dual-resident companies may not offset losses against the income of other companies in a group. A “dual resident company” is defined as a New Zealand-resident company which is either treated as a non-resident under a double tax agreement or is liable for tax in another jurisdiction by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Second, in order to offset losses, the loss-making company must either be incorporated in New Zealand or carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. This requirement helps ensure that companies cannot change their residence to circumvent the restriction against grouping the same loss in more than one jurisdiction. At present, these rules do not apply in the same way to consolidated groups. While the rules for consolidated groups require that a company be a New Zealand resident, they do not currently include the requirements in the loss rules for non-consolidated groups relating to incorporation or fixed establishment in New Zealand. Further, although rules for consolidated groups require that a company must not be treated as a non-resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement, there is no restriction on grouping losses if a company in a consolidated group is also liable for income tax in another country because of domicile, residence or place of incorporation. 49 ANNUAL CONFIRMATION OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendments The bill confirms the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2006-07 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same rates that applied for the 2005-06 tax year. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2006-07 tax year. Key features The rates listed in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be confirmed for the 2006-07 tax year. Background The Income Tax Act 2004 provides for the rates of income tax specified in Schedule 1 of the Act to be confirmed each year. 50 ALLOWING DOCUMENTS TO BE REMOVED FOR INSPECTION (Clauses 137 and 141) Summary of proposed amendment The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be allowed to remove documents for inspection. The new power will assist Inland Revenue in its investigation of tax evasion and avoidance schemes, such as cases involving abusive GST refund claims, and, in particular, facilitate the forensic examination of documents. Application date The amendment will apply from the day of enactment. Key features Section 16B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to remove documents accessed under section 16 of the Act for copying. This provision will be amended to give the Commissioner an additional power to remove and retain the documents for a “full and complete inspection”. The wording of the amendment will therefore be aligned with the existing wording in section 17(3), which applies to documents produced for inspection under that section. What constitutes “full and complete inspection” of documents will be defined in section 3 of the Act as including use of documents as evidence in court. It will be implicit that a right to “full and complete inspection” also includes the right to perform forensic tests and other actions within the ordinary meaning of the word “inspection”. Section 16B(2B) will provide that the documents that have been retained by the Commissioner for a full and complete inspection may be retained for as long as is necessary for the inspection. The owner of any document removed will, however, be entitled to a copy of the document under section 16B(4). Background Sections 16, 16B and 17 of the Act, relating to access to premises and requisitions for information, constitute the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s main information- gathering powers. Currently, although sections 16 and 16B of the Act allow the Commissioner to inspect documents on premises and to remove them for copying, they do not give the Commissioner any power to retain and inspect the documents without making a request under section 17. 51 However, simply relying on a section 17 request for the provision of information may often be unsatisfactory as the person may refuse to provide the requested document or may even destroy it. Although it is an offence to fail to provide information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law, there are situations when a person may choose that option. Thus a person may prefer to face a monetary penalty for not complying with a request under section 17 rather than be prosecuted for a more serious offence such as fraud or tax evasion based on the documents requested. There are a number of other reasons for giving the Commissioner the power to remove, retain and inspect documents: • Having original documents satisfies the “best evidence” rule by which courts may view an original document more favourably than a copy. • It may be necessary to conduct a forensic examination of an original document. This may happen, for example, when there is a dispute as to who has created the document or to whether the information contained in the document has been altered. • Section 17(3) of the Act already allows the Commissioner to retain and inspect original documents which are produced in response to a request under section 17. It is anomalous that Inland Revenue has wider powers in relation to documents belonging to a compliant taxpayer than it has in relation to documents belonging to a non-compliant taxpayer. A system of checks and balances will apply in relation to the use of this new power. Inland Revenue officers are subject to the normal administrative law requirements; these require any public powers to be used for their proper purpose and to be exercised in good faith. In addition, there are internal Inland Revenue rules which preclude official powers from being used for any improper purpose. Inland Revenue advises that the decision to use this new power in a particular case will be delegated to the level of a Team Leader in investigations, and no lower. 52 EXTENDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE COMMISSIONER MAY MAKE AN ASSESSMENT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST ISSUED A NOPA (Clause 149) Summary of proposed amendment The circumstances in which the Commissioner may make an assessment without having first issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) will be extended to cover the situation when the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a taxpayer may have been involved in fraudulent activity, irrespective of whether the taxpayer remains in New Zealand. The purpose of the extension is to expedite assessments and allow for efficient debt recovery when there are reasonable grounds to believe that fraud exists. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to remove the words “has left New Zealand”. Background When Inland Revenue makes an assessment of tax, it must first issue the taxpayer with a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA), unless one of the exceptions specified in section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. These exceptions include the situation when Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has left New Zealand and may have been involved in fraudulent activity. However, when Inland Revenue has grounds to believe that a taxpayer who is still in New Zealand may have been involved in fraudulent activity, under the current legislation Inland Revenue would first issue a NOPA, to which the taxpayer then has two months to respond by issuing a Notice of Response (NOR). If the taxpayer does not respond, Inland Revenue can then issue an assessment. This delay in issuing an assessment to allow time for the NOPA and NOR process could delay the debt recovery process, and consequently reduce available funds for collection. The amendment will enable Inland Revenue to issue an assessment without having first issued a NOPA when it has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer may have been involved in fraudulent activity, irrespective of whether the taxpayer remains in New Zealand. 53 Taxpayers will still have dispute rights in respect of any resulting assessments made by Inland Revenue. Extending the exception in this way will enable the Commissioner to begin tax debt recovery sooner when taxpayers do not exercise their dispute rights. 54 GST AND FINANCIAL SERVICES (Clause 164) Summary of proposed amendments The definition of “financial services” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended. The amendments will treat certain activities involving actively managed investment in connection with equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of financial services. These financial services may be zero-rated if supplied to businesses. The amendments, in combination with the zero-rating rules, remove the potential for tax cascades to arise in connection with actively managed investment in another entity. Application date The amendments will apply to supplies of financial services made on and after the date of enactment. Key features Section 3(1) is being amended by the insertion of new paragraph (kb). The new paragraph treats activities in connection with actively managed investment in equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of financial services. Section 3(2) is being amended by the insertion of a new definition of “actively managed investment”. Active investment is considered to occur if an investor has an interest in another entity: • that represents 10% or more of all the equity securities and participatory securities issued by the entity; and • in which the investor is capable of influencing the day-to-day management of the entity. Influence over an entity that is exercised through an “associated person” – for example, when the strategic or managerial role and board representation is carried out by an associated management company acting on the investor’s behalf – is also included in the definition. Background Supplies of financial services in New Zealand are generally exempt from GST. Since 1 January 2005, however, supplies of financial services to GST-registered persons whose taxable supplies equal or exceed 75% of their total supplies may be zero-rated. 55 The proposed amendment recognises that, in its absence, certain activities involved with equity investment, such as holding shares in another entity, may not be treated as supplies of goods and services for the purpose of the GST Act. As a consequence of not supplying goods and services, entities that are solely involved in investing activities, such as investment companies or equity funds, may be unable to register for GST. Any GST incurred by these investors in the acquisition of goods and services is therefore irrecoverable. To the extent that this irrecoverable GST is passed on – for example, in the form of an investment company or equity fund requiring higher returns from investments in other GST-registered entities (investees) – tax cascades may arise. The more actively managed the investment, the greater the possibility that the investment company or equity fund will seek to recover these costs from the investee. The amendment seeks to resolve this problem by treating actively managed investment in another entity as a supply of “financial services”. If the investment company or equity fund registers for GST it may elect to zero-rate the supplies of these financial services to entities in which they have an investment. This is provided that the investee is GST-registered and 75% of the investee’s total supplies are taxable supplies. Information on when financial services may be zero-rated can be found in Inland Revenue’s GST guidelines for working with the new zero-rating rules for financial services. 5 Activities associated with arranging equity investment in equity securities and participatory securities will not be recognised as supplies of financial services. Such activities will continue to be outside the definition of “financial services”. 5 See www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/ or Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 16 No 10 November 2004. 56 GST ON FRINGE BENEFITS (Clause 165) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment extends the circumstances in which fringe benefits are not subject to GST if the GST-registered person providing the benefit is unable to deduct GST when the benefit is acquired. The purpose of the amendment is to remove the possibility of GST being imposed twice on the supply of certain fringe benefits. Application date The amendment will apply to fringe benefits provided or granted on and after the date of enactment. Key features The amendment to section 10(7) of the GST Act ensures that fringe benefits deemed to be provided by a GST-registered employer under section 21I(1) have a nil value if the employer is unable to make a deduction under section 20(3) in connection with providing the fringe-benefit. Background Fringe benefits are generally subject to GST because the employer is considered to be making a supply of goods and services to the employee. GST, being a tax on final consumption in New Zealand, must be charged on fringe benefits unless the benefit is an exempt or zero-rated supply, or the employer is involved in an activity that makes exempt supplies. The GST treatment of fringe benefits assumes that the GST- registered employer can deduct any GST paid. In some instances the employer will not be able to deduct GST paid. This can occur if the fringe-benefit is a GST-exempt supply (for example, a low-interest loan), or the fringe-benefit arises as part of a GST-exempt activity carried on by the employer (for example, a motor vehicle provided by an employer that is a financial institution). In these situations the GST Act does not require GST to be charged. However, there are other situations when GST-registered employers may not be able to deduct GST paid. An example of when the amendment could apply is when gift vouchers are given to employees as a fringe benefit. 57 The rules relating to vouchers may prevent GST-registered employers from deducting input tax if the initial supply by the issuer of the gift vouchers to the employer is disregarded. Instead, under the rules, GST may be accounted for when the vouchers are redeemed for goods and services. Because GST is not charged by the issuer of the vouchers, the GST-registered employer cannot deduct GST when the vouchers are purchased. Section 21I(1) requires tax to be charged when the employer provides the vouchers to an employee. GST would therefore be charged twice in this situation, once when the GST-registered employer provides the vouchers as a fringe benefit and again when the voucher is redeemed. The amendment will, in this situation, treat the fringe benefit as having a nil value to address the fact that the GST-registered employer is unable to deduct input tax in connection with purchasing the vouchers. GST will still be imposed when the vouchers were redeemed for goods and services. 59 Remedial amendments 61 TAXATION OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURE (Clauses 2(8), 11, 47, 48, 49, 132, 142 and 158) Summary of proposed amendments New rules for business environmental expenditure were enacted on 21 June 2005 and took effect from 10 June 2005. The changes clarified and expanded tax deductions available for business environmental expenditure. They were made to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental concerns, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. Several remedial changes are required to clarify the new business environmental tax rules and ensure that the original legislation has its intended effect. Application date Amendments proposed to the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply to expenditure incurred in an income year beginning on or after 10 June 2005. The proposed change to section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will apply for income years subsequent to 1994-95 if a taxpayer has taken a tax position on the meaning of “industrial waste” before 16 November 2004. Key features Treatment of by-products The definition of “deductible environmental expenditure” allows a tax deduction for dealing with by-products on cessation of business. However, taxpayers may deal with by-products before cessation. The current wording is restrictive and creates a distortion between the treatment of by-products before and after cessation of business. The amendments will remove the words “incurred in the cessation of a business” from item 7, Part B of schedule 6B, to ensure that expenditure incurred before the cessation of business on the treatment of by-products is deductible. ERA refunds It was initially proposed that taxpayers would be able to make only one environmental restoration account (ERA) deposit or refund per year. However, in order to increase flexibility, this was subsequently changed. A drafting error means that section CX 43B, which treats certain refunds as excluded income, still refers to the limitation on multiple payments and refunds. This limitation no longer exists and therefore the proposed amendments will remove the words “or after earlier payment or request for refund” from section CX 43B. 62 The proposed amendments will also clarify that there are two types of refunds permitted under section EK 12, those requested by the taxpayer and those made by Inland Revenue when a taxpayer’s ERA exceeds the maximum balance. In calculating the latter, the amount of the refund will be the difference between the actual and permitted balance. The amendments will remove the reference to any amount of refund requested by the taxpayer in subsection EK 12(8). ERA transfers To ensure that ERA deposits follow the associated restoration liability, taxpayers are allowed to make transfers from their ERAs in a number of circumstances. However, a number of the new ERA provisions are unclear when it comes to the treatment of transfers. The proposed amendments will treat an amount as a payment under section EK 16 (transfer on death, bankruptcy or liquidation) unless the transfer is being made to the Ministry for the Environment. Section EK 6 (interest on payments to ERA) will also be amended so that interest is payable on an amount that is treated as a payment under section EK 15, EK 16 and EK 19. Removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste The previous environmental tax rules applied solely to dealing with “industrial” waste. There was no definition of this term, which led to uncertainty as to when tax deductions were available for environmental expenditure. The new rules no longer make this distinction and also retrospectively remove the word “industrial” for any income year for which a taxpayer took a position on the definition of industrial waste before the introduction of the new rules. The proposed amendment to section DJ 10 in the Income Tax Act 1994 will allow a taxpayer who initially qualifies to have the word “industrial” removed to apply this same treatment for subsequent income years up until the time that the new environmental tax rules apply. 63 TAX DEPRECIATION TREATMENT OF PATENTS (Clauses 15, 23, 26, 27, 31, 32, 37, 42, 44 and 126) Summary of proposed amendments Unintended consequences arising from the new tax depreciation rules for patents, patent applications, and plant variety rights are being corrected to prevent: • the double counting of the period a patent, patent application or plant variety rights are held when calculating the amount of depreciation loss allowed; and • an anomaly that does not take into account the remaining life of a patent, patent application, or plant variety rights when additional costs are incurred. Application date The changes will apply to patent applications lodged with a complete specification before 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 or later income years, patent applications lodged with a complete specification on or after 1 April 2005 and plant variety rights acquired or granted in the 2005-06 or a later year. Key features New section DZ 14 provides a one-off “catch up” deduction for the period a patent application was pending for patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2007 that are granted in the 2005-06 or a later income year. New section EE 24B provides the one-off “catch up” depreciation deduction for plant variety rights applications that are granted in the 2005-06 or a later income year. Sections EE 27B to EE 27E are being replaced by new section EE 27B, which provides the correct annual rate for patents acquired and patent applications granted in a person’s 2005-06 and subsequent years. This new provision provides for when a patent application has been completed and a patent is granted. Existing section EE 27 will apply to patent applications that are lodged on or after 1 April 2007 and plant variety rights that are acquired in the 2005-06 or a later income year. A number of other consequential amendments are being made to sections DB 31(4), EE 16, EE 27(1), EE 37(2), EE 51 and to the definitions of “legal life” in section EE 58 and “acquire” and “dispose” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The definition of “patent application date” in section OB 1 is being repealed. 64 Background The Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 introduced new tax depreciation rules for patents. Under the changes, depreciation begins from the date a patent application is lodged, with a complete specification for patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005. For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005, depreciation will begin from the date patent rights are granted with a “catch up” deduction for the period the patent application was pending. To accommodate the former, new sections EE 27C and EE 27D were added to the Income Tax Act 2004. To accommodate the latter new section EE 27B was added. The new patent tax depreciation provisions contain the following unintended consequences: • Sections EE 27B to EE 27D require taxpayers to make an adjustment for the period a patent application or patent is held when calculating the annual depreciation rate for a patent application or patent. However, a similar adjustment (for period of use) is also required under section EE 16 when working out the depreciation deduction that is allowed. This double counting of the period of use results in a lower depreciation deduction being allowed than should be the case. • Under section EE 19, when additional costs are incurred in relation to fixed life intangible property, these additional costs are added to the asset’s adjusted tax value. This forms the new base for depreciation. The depreciation rate that applies is effectively adjusted up to reflect remaining legal life from the start of the income year in which the additional costs were incurred until expiry of the relevant property right. However, under new sections EE 27B to EE 27D, no such commensurate adjustment to the depreciation rate for a patent application or patent right occurs. This results in the allowable depreciation deduction being lower than it should be. Similar problems arise in respect of the new provisions for depreciating plant variety rights (contained in section EE 27E). 65 DEPRECIATION RULES Depreciation formulas – apportionment of business and private use (Clauses 18, 25, 35, 36, 41 and 76) Summary of proposed amendments Two new formulas that calculate the apportionment between business and private use when there is a loss on a disposal of depreciable property are being added to the legislation. The new formulas correct mistakes in the legislation which prevent the current formulas from apportioning correctly when depreciable property is purchased and disposed of in the same income year. Application date The amendments will apply for the year starting on 1 April 2006 and subsequent years. Key features Deductions for depreciation are allowed only when assets are used or available to be used for business purposes. Therefore depreciation deductions must be apportioned for assets that are used for both business and private purposes. When assets are disposed of for a depreciation loss (the difference between the asset’s depreciated value and the amount received on disposal), the amount of the depreciation loss must be apportioned. Two identical formulas in sections FB 7 and DE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004 achieve this apportionment. The formulas, however, do not function as intended when an item of depreciable property or a motor vehicle is disposed of in the same year it is acquired. One of the variables in both formulas is all depreciation deductions that have been allowed on that asset. The problem is that this will always be zero for assets disposed of the same year they were purchased, since no depreciation deduction is allowed in the year a depreciable asset is disposed of. Therefore the formulas will always produce a result of zero, even though the taxpayer has suffered a loss. The proposed amendments will rectify this anomaly by introducing two additional formulas into the Act. The new formulas will apply only when depreciable property or a motor vehicle is disposed of in the same year it is acquired. The current formulas will continue to apply when the property has been held for longer than a year. 66 The first new formula will be inserted into section FB 7. It will apportion depreciation loss on the disposal of depreciable property that was used for both business and private purposes. The second new formula will be inserted into section DE 2. It will apportion depreciation loss on the disposal of motor vehicles used for both business and private purposes. The new formulas will work by simply multiplying the depreciation loss on disposal by the proportion the asset was used for business purposes. A person will be deemed to acquire an item of depreciable property or a motor vehicle when the person starts to use the item or the motor vehicle for business purposes or it is available for business use. For the new formula to function as intended, consequential amendments are required to the definition of “base value” in section EE 49(2) and determining the “cost of the item” in sections EE 34(3) and EE 33(2). Background The rules that govern the income tax treatment of gains and losses from the disposal of depreciable property and motor vehicles include formulas that are used to apportion the proceeds from the disposal between the business and private use of the depreciable property or the motor vehicle. The two formulas in question appear in sections FB 7(6) and DE 2(7). The former apportions an amount of depreciable loss of disposed depreciable property, while the latter does the same for motor vehicles. A recently identified problem concerns the operation of the formulas. The formulas do not work when depreciable property is purchased and disposed of in the same income year, because, in those circumstances, one of the variables in the formulas would always be zero. As a result, they produce an indefinite result. Amendments to the recently enacted tax depreciation rules (Clauses 28, 29 and 30) Summary of proposed amendments Minor remedial changes are designed to ensure that the recently enacted tax depreciation rules operate correctly. 67 Defining motor vehicles for section EE 25D Section EE 25D sets the depreciation rates for certain types of aircraft and motor vehicles. The policy intention was that section EE 25D apply only to these assets that previously had residual values above 13.5 percent of cost. The affected assets are cars, minibuses, taxis, and some domestic aircraft. Arguably, section EE 25D may also apply to a broader range of motor vehicles like vans and trucks. It is proposed that the policy intent be achieved by replacing in section EE 25D(3), “having seats for no more than 12 persons” with “that is designed exclusively or mainly to carry people, and has seats for no more than 12 people”. Section EE 25E Section EE 25E provides the Commissioner with a method of calculating depreciation rates for assets that have a residual value greater than 13.5 percent of cost. The word “before” was inserted in the legislation rather than the term “on or after”. The proposal is to amend section EE 25E so that it applies to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Section EE 26B Section EE 26B says that taxpayers can elect not to apply the new depreciation rates to plant and equipment acquired before the beginning of the 2006-07 income year. There is a question of whether this section applies to some types of plant and equipment when the depreciation rate is not calculated under the new double declining balance method. The legislation is being amended to remove any uncertainty. 68 DEATH AND ASSET TRANSFERS (Clauses 80, 81 and 151) Amendments are being made to ensure that provisions relating to death and asset transfers in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 (subpart FI) reflect their policy intention. Forestry An amendment ensures that the roll-over relief in section FI 6 of the Income Tax Act 2004 applies for forestry assets held at the date of a taxpayer’s death irrespective of whether a life tenant is entitled to part of the trust property and irrespective of who the trustees of the estate are. The roll-over will apply as long as a relative to the second degree of the deceased is beneficially entitled to the forest. The amendment is effective from 21 June 2005, the date the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 came into force. 10-year rule for land held on capital account Section FI 7 is being amended to correct a drafting error. A reference to section CB 10 is being change to section CB 12. Section CB 10 deals with situations where a development or subdivision of land began within 10 years of its acquisition. These sales are taxable, irrespective of when the sale occurred. Because a tax liability should always arise from a sale of land in these circumstances, there is no need to provide roll-over relief when an owner dies. The reference to section CB 10 is being removed prospectively from 16 May 2006, the date of the introduction of the present bill. On the other hand, section CB 12 provides that if land is sold within 10 years of acquisition and the land has been enhanced by zoning or similar factors, the profit on sale is taxable. However, if the owner had held the land for 10 years, no tax liability would have arisen on the sale of the land. Therefore the taxpayer’s death, in itself, should not trigger a tax liability. The reference to section CB 12 is being included retrospectively, from 21 June 2005. Concessionary use-of-money interest The intention of changes to the definition of “date interest starts” in section 120C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was that concessionary use-of-money interest rules should apply to any income tax liability arising in the period that ends with the taxpayer’s death (subject to the condition that the relevant liabilities are paid on time). An amendment is being made effective from 21 June 2005, to ensure the definition reflects this policy. 69 FAMILY ASSISTANCE PROVISIONS (Clauses 90-97) The bill contains several remedial amendments to the family assistance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. Some are required to fine-tune the provisions to ensure that they give full effect to the policy intent of the Working for Families package, while others correct minor drafting errors. In-work payment and weekly compensation Summary of proposed changes The proposed changes are intended to remove any doubt that concurrent entitlement to the in-work payment and weekly compensation under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 is limited to accidents on or after 1 January 2006. Application date The amendments will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment. Key features The reference in section KD 2AAA(1)(d) to subsection (7) is being replaced by a reference to subsection (8). The change clarifies that when subsection (8), relating to eligibility for the in-work payment when weekly compensation payments are received as a result of personal injury by accident on or after 1 January 2006, applies, the requirements for income from an activity and full-time earner do not apply. To further remove doubt, paragraph (xvi) of the definition of “salary or wages” is being omitted from the list in section KD 2AAA(5)(a)(i) of source deductions that are not eligible income from an activity. Paragraph (xvi) of the definition of “salary or wages” relates to payments of weekly compensation made under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001. Instead, new subparagraph KD 2AAA(5)(a)(iii) is inserted to clarify that only weekly compensation payments under the 2001 Act in respect of accidents before 1 January 2006 are not eligible income from an activity. 70 In-work payment and paid parental leave Summary of proposed change The change clarifies that recipients of parental leave payments are not precluded from entitlement to the in-work payment if they met the necessary full-time work test before receiving paid parental leave. Application date The amendment will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment. Key features Paragraph (x) of the definition of “salary or wages” is being omitted from the list in section KD 2AAA(5)(a)(i) of source deductions that are not eligible income from an activity. Paragraph (x) of the definition of “salary or wages” relates to parental leave payments made under Part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987. The inclusion of parental leave payments in the list created an inconsistency between the requirement to have income from an activity and the requirement to normally be a full-time earner, both of which must be met, with the result that recipients of paid parental leave would have been precluded from entitlement. Family assistance for shared care arrangements Summary of proposed changes The changes provide flexibility by allowing entitlement to the relevant elements of family assistance when a shared care arrangement is intended to continue for at least four months (one-third of a year), and the proportion of care is such that each parent has exclusive care for at least one third of the shared care period. This could mean, in some instances, that parts of a shared care period would fall in two tax years, something that is currently prevented if the shared care arrangement begins within four months of the end of a tax year. Application date The amendment will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment. 71 Key features The rule in section KD 2 AA(2) that defines who is a principal caregiver is being replaced with a more flexible rule that maintains the idea of one-third of a year as being an indication of some permanence to the shared care arrangement. The flexibility is introduced by allowing any four-month period so that the period does not have to fall entirely within a tax year. Example: A shared care arrangement that began on 1 February 2006 and was expected to continue at least until June 2006 would meet the proposed test. On the other hand, under current law, as there are less than four months to the end of the tax year, the sharing of the family assistance entitlement could not begin until the first day of the following tax year, 1 April 2006. The provision relating to the parental tax credit is unchanged – the requirement is one- third of the entitlement period. The current rule in section KD 2AA(2B) that defines who is a principal caregiver for the purposes of the in-work payment is slightly different in that the period of care does not have to coincide with the period of eligibility for the in-work payment. That rule is also being replaced to allow the greater flexibility in application. In-work payment for continuous eligible periods Summary of proposed changes The concept of an “eligible period” is a critical building block for the design of the system that delivers family assistance. Under the proposed changes, when there are eligible periods of part weeks that together form one continuous period, families will not lose entitlement to the in-work payment in any weeks in which the eligibility criteria are otherwise met. Application date The amendment will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006, the application date for the in-work payment. Key features The in-work payment is available only when the employment criteria are met for a full week. If an eligible period is less than a week, the current law would not allow in-work payment to be made for that week even if the eligible period is consecutive with another eligible period. This is contrary to the policy intent. 72 The replacement definition of “weeks” in section KD 2AAA(2) will allow the recognition of contiguous eligible periods as if they were one so that entitlement to the in-work payment is available for all full weeks in which the relevant employment criteria are met. It also maintains the current treatment when only one unbroken eligible period is involved. Ring-fencing of family support Summary of proposed changes The change ensures that the ring-fencing provisions reflect the policy intent that maximum family support entitlement would be guaranteed for periods spent on a benefit if a family’s annualised monthly income (calculated on a month-by-month basis while on a benefit) is below the family support abatement threshold. Application date The amendment will apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2005, the commencement date for the ring-fencing provisions. Key features Ring-fencing in the family assistance provisions is intended to protect families who move from benefit to work, or vice versa, during the year. Without ring-fencing, they would incur an end-of-year overpayment of family support if their full year income was at a higher level than their on-benefit income. However, ring-fenced periods do not currently create new “eligible periods”. This means that when the abatement formula is applied to an eligible period that contains a ring-fenced period, it is possible for the income to eliminate entitlement, even for the periods that have been ring-fenced, and the benefits of ring-fencing are lost. The proposed additional paragraph to be inserted in the definition of “eligible period” in section OB 1 will provide for a ring-fenced period also to be an eligible period so that it can be excluded from the abatement formula. 73 Minor technical and drafting amendments A number of amendments correct errors of a minor technical or drafting nature. Some of these are the result of inadvertent wording and printing changes in the drafting of the Taxation (Working for Families) Act. Other amendments are needed to clarify the effect of links to definitions that also apply elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 2004. Application date The following minor amendments are to apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2006. Formula for calculating “net specified income” The formula in section KD 1(1)(g)(ii) for calculating “net specified income” when the person is a major shareholder in a close company (generally, a company with five or fewer shareholders) is being amended to replace the item “(c – d)” with “c”. The change is needed to reflect the current tax position of a close company. Changes to close company and imputation rules created a need to amend the formula, but the need was overlooked when the relevant imputation credit provisions were introduced. Formula for calculating family assistance tax credits The definition of item “IWP or CTC” in the formula for calculating the subpart KD credits (family assistance) in section KD 2(2) is being amended to make it clear that a person may get the in-work payment (IWP) or the child tax credit (CTC) but not both concurrently. Application of definitions Section KD 3(1) is being amended to clarify that the definitions of “qualifying person” and “employment” specific to the purposes of the family tax credit apply to both the calculation of the family tax credit and the rules for the family tax credit. Drafting oversight Section KD 5(6A) (b)(ii) was amended by the Taxation (Working for Families) Act 2004 by replacing the former reference to section KD 5B with the words “sections KD 2 and KD 3”, section KD 5B having been repealed in that Act. However, the need for in-work payment in the list of rates to be included in the calculation of interim instalments in the section was overlooked. That oversight is being rectified. 74 Adjustment of amounts The method by which the Governor-General, by Order in Council, is to adjust the threshold of the family tax credit is prescribed in section KD 5C. Section KD 5C is being amended to correct an inadvertent wording change that would have required the Order in Council to change the whole of the family tax credit, rather than just the item amount in the formula, as was intended. This would have had the effect of prescribing a fixed amount of family tax credit, rather than an amount that has regard to after-tax income of an eligible family. Payment of arrears by the Commissioner Under the general rules for payment by instalment, instalment payments can be made only for a period going forward from the date of application. However, the Commissioner is able to pay the arrears of tax credits for the period since a benefit ceased when a person goes off a benefit but delays application for family assistance to be paid by the Commissioner. The opportunity has been taken to remove duplication in the relevant provisions by amending section KD 7(3A) to make it clear in what circumstances the provision can be used, and repealing section KD 7(3C). 75 LIMIT ON REFUNDS AND ALLOCATIONS OF TAX (Clauses 112 and 161) Summary of proposed amendment The imputation rules are being amended to extend the circumstances when tax overpaid before a breach in shareholder continuity can be refunded. The amendment corrects an anomaly in the legislation. Application date The change will apply from the 2000-2001 year. This date is arbitrary. It has been chosen because it will ensure that the correct tax treatment is applied to the only case that has been identified so far that is affected by the anomaly. Key features Section MD 2(4) of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts effectively allows an imputation account debit that arises on a breach of shareholder continuity to be ignored for the purpose of calculating a tax refund, but only if the debit arose after the date of payment of the first instalment of provisional tax for the year to which the refund relates. The amendment allows the discontinuity debit to be ignored for the purpose of effecting the refund, whether the tax was originally overpaid before or after the date of the first instalment of provisional tax. Background The amendment is necessary because, generally, overpaid company tax cannot be refunded if a refund would result in a debit balance to the company’s imputation credit account (ICA). Under section ME 5(1)(i), a breach of shareholder continuity in a company results in a debit arising to the ICA equal to the balance in the ICA at the time of the breach. Although a “discontinuity” debit can effectively be ignored for the purposes of effecting the refund, there is a condition that the debit arise after “date of payment of the first instalment of provisional tax” for the tax year to which the overpayment applied. Where a company does not pay provisional tax – for example, because its income tax liability is satisfied instead by resident withholding tax deducted from interest – there is no “date of payment of the first instalment of provisional tax”. Therefore no adjustment can be made to the ICA balance under current law in relation to the overpayment that arose before a breach in continuity. The anomaly has only recently been identified, although it has existed since the imputation rules were introduced. Inland Revenue is aware of only one case that has been affected by it. 76 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX TREATMENT OF VEHICLES ALREADY LEASED AT 1 APRIL 2006 (Clauses 115 and 131) Summary of proposed amendments Remedial amendments to the rules on how to value motor vehicle fringe benefits: • clarify that, in general, vehicles acquired before 1 April 2006 should be subsequently valued at cost; • qualify the reference to “the date on which the vehicle ceases to be leased”, to make it clear that it relates to all leases of the vehicle by the employer; and • clarify that the market value that can be used as the cost price for a re-leased vehicle is the market value at the time the vehicle is first leased or rented to the employer. The changes clarify the intent and application of the recently enacted changes to the fringe benefit tax rules. Application date The amendments apply to fringe benefit tax periods beginning on or after 1 April 2006. Key features A deficiency in the recent amendments to section ND 1A of the fringe benefit tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 has resulted in some confusion over how employers who had been leasing vehicles before the recent FBT changes should value those vehicles for FBT purposes once the changes come into effect. The first of these amendments addresses this deficiency. The other minor remedial drafting amendments are also aimed at further clarifying the intent of the provisions relating to leased vehicles. 77 Background Before 1 April 2006, leased vehicles were valued at their market value at the beginning of the lease. This method is no longer available because of the tax advantages it potentially provided. Instead, the policy intent was that from 1 April 2006 6 these vehicles should be valued at cost. However, in the process of streamlining the relevant provisions in light of submissions on the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the legislative clarity around existing leased vehicles was lost. Similarly, the intention was that vehicles that continue to be subject to 9 to 5 and flip- flop leases should be valued at cost. Making a change to rectify this oversight is necessary because many of the vehicles that are subject to FBT are leased, and the legislation as written has provided uncertainty for lessees. Accordingly, this legislative amendment ensures that the original policy intent is achieved. It means that one treatment applies to all vehicles on hand at 1 April 2006, irrespective of whether they are leased or owned by the employer as vehicles that were owned before 1 April 2006 must continue to be also valued at cost unless five years have elapsed since the first FBT return for the vehicle. There is an exception from this requirement to use cost if the initial return period for the vehicle begins on or after 1 April 2006 and the vehicle is not subject to a 9 to 5 or flip-flop lease. The exception enables, for example, an employer who has acquired a vehicle that was previously subject to a 9 to 5 or flip-flop lease to value it at its tax value. The second amendment is to the words in section ND 1A(1C)(a)(ii) “vehicle ceases to be leased”, to clarify that this means the date on which the vehicle ceases to be leased by the employer (or associated person), in any way. For example, if a series of leases is entered into, switching between methods can be done only once the last lease has expired. The final change involves an amendment to item 7 of schedule 2, part A to clarify that the market value referred to in that item is the market value at the time the vehicle is first leased or rented to the employer. Item 7 enables an employer who leases a vehicle that has been previously leased to use its market value as its cost price provided the employer and any previous lessee are not associated. 6 Or from the income year beginning on or after 1 April 2006 if the employer returns FBT on an income year basis. 78 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RETROSPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 2004 (Clauses 14, 16, 34, 53, 74, 77, 124, 126(16) and 134) The Rewrite Advisory Panel has identified that the Income Tax Act 2004, as originally enacted, contains some unintended changes in legislative outcomes. The Panel has recommended that these changes in outcome be corrected, with effect from beginning of the 2005-06 income year. The provisions affected are: • section DB 9B (Base price adjustment under old financial arrangement rules); • section DB 36 (Bribes paid to public officials); • section EE 33 (Transfers of depreciable property between associated persons in a non-qualifying amalgamation); • section EX 36(1) (Immigrant’s accrued superannuation entitlement exemption), • section EY 8(3)(b) (Meaning of life insurance), • section FC 21(3) (Amounts derived by non-residents from renting films), • section NG 1(2) (Application of NRWT rules), • section OB 1 (Definition of fixed rate share), and • schedule 22A (Identified policy changes). In addition, some corrections to cross-references and terms used in sections EX 52, EX 53, OD 5(6F), and OD 8(3) are being made. Section DB 9B (Base price adjustment under old financial arrangement rules) Section DB 9B was inserted into the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 to provide for a deduction on certain amounts calculated under the base price adjustment within the old financial arrangement rules. The relationship between this section and section DA 3 was inadvertently overlooked in its enactment. The amendment in this bill completes the amendment recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel, by setting out the relationship between section DB 9B and section DA 3. The new subsection states that the section supplements the general permission and overrides the general limitation. This is consistent with the application of section DB 9, which relates to a deduction for certain amounts calculated under the base price adjustment with the financial arrangement rules. 79 Section DB 36 (Bribes paid to public officials) Section DB 36 permits a deduction for a corrupt payment made to a foreign official in New Zealand. This is an unintended change in the policy underlying the rule, although the corresponding rule in the 1994 Act (section DJ 22) was ambiguous. The policy of this rule is that a corrupt payment (a bribe) made to a public official is not deductible. This policy complements the policy in sections 105 to 105E of the Crimes Act 1961 and clarifies the extent to which this type of payment is not a deduction for income tax purposes. This policy applies in determining a person’s taxable income for a year, and includes payments made both in and out of New Zealand whether paid to a New Zealand or foreign public official. There are two exceptions to this general policy, but they relate only to payments made to foreign public officials. • The first exception is if the payment is made to a foreign public official related to routine government activity and is a very minor amount. • The second exception is when the payment is made outside New Zealand and the payment is not illegal in the country which the foreign public official represents. Section DB 36 is being amended to reflect the underlying policy more clearly than the present rule does. Section EE 33 (Transfers of depreciable property in a non-qualifying amalgamation) Section EE 33 of the 2004 Act is the rewrite of the combined effect of section EG 17 and FE 5(2) of the 1994 Act. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that associated companies cannot have an uplift in the depreciable value of the asset base for depreciable property transferred in a non-qualifying amalgamation. However, section EE 33 inadvertently omitted a reference to the test of association. This amendment restores the test of association and reverses the order of sections EE 33 and EE 34. The reversal of the section order places the more generally applicable rule first, and also provides that in a non-qualifying amalgamation, the rule in the new section EE 34 will override the general rule in the new section EE 33. The amendment restores the effect of the law to that existing in the 1994 Act. Section FE 5(2) is also being amended to provide a clear relationship with the new section EE 34. Section EX 36 (Immigrants accrued superannuation entitlement exemption) Section EX 36(1) of the 2004 Act contains an unintended change in law in that the words “to the extent that “ qualify subsections (2) to (9) of section EX 36. This indicates that apportionment should be applied to all of these subsections. 80 However, in the corresponding provisions in the 1994 Act (the definition of “interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme” in section OB 1 of the 1994 Act), apportionment is required for the provisions that correspond to subsections (2) to (4). The amendment corrects section EX 36(1) to apply the apportionment rule just to subsections (2) to (4). This restores the requirement that subsections (5) to (9) are to be satisfied without any apportionment. Section EY 8(3) (Meaning of life insurance) In section EY 8(3)(b)(i), subparagraph (b)(i) did not contain a reference to a specified cause named in the a policy of accident or medical insurance. This arguably narrowed the meaning of “life insurance” from that set out in section OB 1 of the 1994 Act, The policy intent of the 1994 Act wording was to ensure that minor non-life benefits set out in a medical or accident insurance policy would not come within the life insurance taxation regime. An example of the type of benefit contemplated in this policy is funeral expenses. This amendment restores the wording of the law to that set out in the definition of “life insurance” in the 1994 Act. Section FC 21(3B) (Amounts derived by non-residents from renting films) Section FC 21 rewrites section CN 2 of the 1994 Act. Section CN 2(1)(b) and section CN 2(4) were omitted in rewriting the section. In the 1994 Act, CN 2(1)(b) extended the application of the film renter rule in section CN 2 of the 1994 Act to New Zealand-resident companies that were controlled by non- residents. Section CN 2(4) of the 1994 Act prevented tax being imposed twice on rentals. This could otherwise have occurred when rentals derived by a person subject to this rule were on-paid to another person under an agreement relating to those rentals. The reason for removing the application of the film renter rules to New Zealand resident companies was set out in the exposure draft of rewritten legislation in the Income Tax Act (published in 2001). This drafting change was intended to facilitate the rationalisation of the provision with the transfer pricing rules, as sections CN 2(1)(b), CN 2(4) and section GD 13 were considered to address the same policy question. This amendment to Schedule 22A clarifies that this rationalisation relating to the film renter rules is an intended change in law. In addition, the effect of section CN 2(4) of the 2004 Act is reinstated. The omission of this rule from section FC 21 in the 2004 Act arguably leads to tax being imposed on a film rental derived by a non-resident operating through a fixed establishment in New Zealand, and again on certain on-payments related to that film rental to another non-resident if the source of the payment is in New Zealand. The amendment restores the law as it was under the 1994 Act to prevent this potential dual imposition of taxation. 81 Section NG 1(2) (Application of NRWT rules) The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 removed the exclusion for exempt income from section NG 1. In making this change, it was intended that readers would rely on the core provisions exempt income rule to ensure that income of this nature would not be liable for non-resident withholding tax. In the 2004 Act, the change in terminology from “gross income” to “income” in NG 1 coupled with the Core Provisions Act change has led uncertainty as to whether non- resident withholding tax can be imposed on non-resident withholding income that is exempt income. The policy is that non-resident withholding tax should not be imposed on exempt income. This amendment clarifies the section to ensure that the policy is better expressed. Section OB 1 (Definition of fixed rate share) In the definition of a fixed rate share in the 2004 Act, it is unclear whether the term “dividend” in that definition includes an amount of any imputation credit or dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend. This is because the term “dividend,” as defined in sections CD 3 to CD 13, includes the amount of an imputation credit and dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend (section CD 9 is the relevant provision). The policy is an imputation credit or a dividend withholding payment credit that is attached to a dividend is not taken into account in determining whether the share on which the dividend is paid is a “fixed rate share”. The definition of “fixed rate share” is being amended to remove that uncertainty and reflect the policy more clearly. 82 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Allocation of research and development tax deductions (Clause 46) A remedial amendment will be made to the recently enacted changes to the research and development (R&D) tax rules. An amendment to section EJ 21 of the Income Tax Act 2004 will clarify that where a company has had a breach of shareholder continuity the amount of R&D tax deductions allocated to an income year is the lesser of the R&D income in that year and the R&D deductions that have not been allocated to earlier income years. This amendment accords with the previously announced policy objectives of this reform. Amendment to section HH 3C (Clause 83) Section HH 3C of the Income Tax Act 2004, which provides an exclusion from the minor beneficiary rule, is to be clarified to ensure that the test is satisfied when one or more of the conditions are met. Corporate migration terminology (Clauses 121, 125, 146 and 147) To provide consistency of terminology in the recently enacted corporate migration amendments, the reference to “emigration date” in several provisions should be replaced with the correct defined term “emigration time”. These references are in sections NF 4 and NG 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 49 and 51 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Date on which notices are delivered (Clauses 138, 139 and 140) Sections 14(9), 14B(8) and 14C(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to repeal rebuttable presumptions that notices are posted on the day on which they are postmarked. As Inland Revenue does not copy or store envelopes, the presumption is of little value. The effect of the repeal is that notices will be treated as having been given on the day on which they would have been delivered in the ordinary course of the post. That date will be determined after considering all the relevant evidence. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2005, the date the presumptions applied from. 83 Share-lending rules (Clauses 2(13), 103, 123 and 142) Three remedial amendments will be made to the recently enacted share-lending rules. The amendments will clarify that where resident withholding tax (RWT) has been paid by the share user as part of a share-lending arrangement, that the share supplier does not get an imputation credit for that RWT as well as an imputation credit under section NF 8B. The amendments will also remove unnecessary requirements that are not relevant to share-lending arrangements from the share-lending statement and dividend withholding payment credit refund sections. These amendments accord with previously announced policy objectives of this reform.

The first stage was the reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, which resulted in the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994. The second stage, the rewrite of the core provisions of the Act, was completed in 1996. The third stage involved the rewrite of Parts C to E of the Act, which was completed in 2004. This bill represents the fourth and final stage, and it rewrites Parts F to the end of the Act. The key aim of the rewrite project is to reduce compliance costs by producing tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. Clear legislation makes an important contribution to increasing voluntary compliance with tax laws because it makes it easier for readers to identify and observe their income tax obligations. The objective is to make the legislation clear while minimising changes to the effect of the legislation and associated compliance requirements of the current Act. The bill also introduces a small number of intended changes to the legislation, all of which have been presented for public consultation in recent years. They are discussed in chapter 3. The bill rewrites Parts F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, Y and the schedules to the Act. It also consolidates the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 into the Income Tax Act. Some provisions in Part B, which relate to Parts I and L, are also consequentially amended. The bill re-enacts and consolidates, but does not rewrite (except for limited consequential changes), Parts A, C, D and E. It also renumbers various sections within Parts C, D and E as a result of: • new provisions enacted since the 2004 Act came into force; and • the movement into these Parts of income, deduction and allocation rules from other areas of the Act. The new Act is to apply to income derived in the 2008-09 and later income years. A careful process was adopted in the development of the bill to ensure that its provisions have the same outcomes as those of the current Act, except in those few cases when a change is intended. The government has indicated that it will promote a remedial amendment to correct any provision in the new Act which is found to produce a different result from that which would have been produced under the 2004 Act, provided no change was intended. That remedial change would apply from the date of effect of the new legislation. 2 The re-enactment of the Act is for the benefit of users. The options for the bill were to: • amend the current Act by replacing Parts F to end of the Act with rewritten Parts; or • produce a new Act containing rewritten Parts F to the end of the Act, including the schedules and consolidated parts A to E. The second option was chosen and is supported by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The main benefit of adopting this option is that it minimises confusion over the numbering of sections For example, the differences between the two options can be compared by reference to section FC 1 of the 2004 Act. This section is about the tax treatment of profit-related debentures. In the bill, the subject matter of clause FC 1 is quite different from the content of section FC 1 of the Act. Clause FC 1 of the bill describes the operation of subpart FC, which is about the income tax treatment of transfers of certain property on death. Therefore: • If the option to amend the 2004 Act was preferred, readers would have needed to distinguish between two provisions bearing the same reference in the 2004 Act. For example, in referring to section FC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004, the reader would need to make it clear whether the reference is to section FC 1 of the Act before it was amended or section FC 1 of the Act as inserted by the amendment. • Under the option of a new Income Tax Act, readers can identify the provision as section FC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 or section FA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2006. 3 CHAPTER 2 Structure of the new Act This chapter sets out the approach that has been taken to the structure and organisation of the legislation, based on the broad role of each part. As a result of clarifying the role for each of these Parts, a number of provisions have been moved to and from the various Parts. This movement of provisions was set out in the exposure draft of legislation for each part that was released for public consultation. Parts A to E are being re-enacted, although some consequential amendments are required in subpart BC and in a limited number of other places. As well, Parts C to E have been renumbered as a result of insertions in the Act since it came into force in 2004, and the movement of provisions from other parts of the Act. Parts F to Z contain a variety of rules: • Part F deals with the taxation treatment of certain transactions or arrangements. • Part G is concerned with avoidance issues. • Part H deals with the taxation treatment of certain types of entities. • Part I deals with the carrying forward and use of tax losses. • Part L contains the rules defining when tax credits arise, the amount of the tax credit a person has, and when and how a tax credit is used. • Part M deals with tax credits for families. • Part O deals with the memorandum account rules, which identify amounts of tax or other payments that are linked to the tax credit system. • Part R sets out the rules stipulating how all taxes and other payment obligations are calculated and the time at which they are satisfied. • Part Y contains the definitions for the Act. • Part Z contains transitional rules. The general structural principles adopted in the rewritten legislation are: • Organising the legislation from the most generally applicable Part to the more specifically applicable Parts. Each Part, subpart, and (in some cases) section generally begins with more widely applicable rules and concludes with the rules having more specific application. • Using general rules to perform a pivotal role. • Using general rules to overarch more specific rules, with the tax loss rules presented in subpart IA of the bill being an example. This approach helps users to identify the inter- relationships between the provisions and any common policy intent. 4 • Minimising overlap, to make the categories used to group items as self-contained as possible. • Grouping like with like. Functions or subject matter that are the same have been grouped together to assist the reader. • Reducing repetition to minimise duplication. Applying common sets of rules is one technique that has been used to achieve this. • Using a consistent format. This aids accessibility by improving the flow of the text. • Linking the Parts back to the core provisions. • Placing terminating provisions into a separate subpart at the end of each part. This is a continuation from the current Act, although the contents of the “Z” subparts have been culled because many of the provisions are either spent or are unlikely to have future relevance. Omitting these provisions does not remove their application to relevant past situations, but it does reduce the size of the Act. • Leaving “gaps” between Parts and subparts to facilitate future drafting. This occurs throughout Parts F to R. For example, in part F, subpart FC is followed by subpart FE, and in part I, subpart IA is followed by subpart IC. These gaps reserve subpart numbers for future drafting to help overcome or at least defer the three-letter numbering of subparts (and potentially two-letter numbering of Parts) that has been necessary in recently enacted policy measures. Examples of this are the PAYE and RWT intermediary rules, which were inserted in the 2004 Act as subparts NBA and NBB. The following overview of each Part lists subparts as they are presented in the bill, and gaps in the numbering represent subpart numbering reserved for future drafting. Part F of the bill Part F of the 2004 Act contains a range of provisions, including: • apportionment rules for cross-border transactions; • modifications to the interest deductibility rules for certain types of debentures and, under the thin capitalisation rules, some foreign-owned organisations and banks; • rules for consolidated companies when calculating their income tax liability for a tax year; • rules for determining how groups of companies use imputation credits; and • modification of the tax treatment of certain transfers of property and financial arrangements under a relationship agreement or upon death. Part F contains provisions that modify the calculation of taxable income for a tax year for persons entering into certain arrangements or transactions. A rule in Part F will generally lead to a taxation effect that is different from that which would be produced under Parts C to E if this rule did not exist. 5 However, many of the apportionment provisions in Part F of the 2004 Act have been moved closer to their relevant provisions. This reflects the more specific role of Part F in the new Act. Two examples of apportionment rules in the 2004 Act moved to a different location in the bill are: • Section FB 2, which contains an apportionment rule for tax credits for foreign income tax and a source rule. The apportionment rule for tax credits has been moved to subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand). • Section FB 7, which is an apportionment rule relating to depreciation, has been moved to subpart EE, making this rule easier to access. The thin capitalisation rules, which restrict the amount of interest allowed as a deduction, are an example of the apportionment rules that have been retained within Part F. The complexity and detail of these rules has led to their retention within that Part, rather than moving them to Parts C and D and cluttering their structure. The rules relating to consolidated groups of companies are located in more than one place in the 2004 Act. Some of these rules have been moved to Part F and consolidated together in subpart FM to provide easier access. Subpart FA contains rules that alter the tax treatment of certain commercial arrangements by either recharacterising the nature of (or amounts derived under) the arrangement or by providing a different form of tax treatment for the parties to the arrangement. • Section FA 2 is an example of a rule that recharacterises the nature of the arrangement by treating a debenture as shares for income tax purposes. • Section FA 5 is an example of a rule that alters the tax treatment of the party to the transaction. This rule is intended to claw back deductions for lease payments that are effectively payments of the purchase price of the lease asset. This rule applies when an asset is leased under an operating lease, and the lessee acquires the asset at the end of the lease, and then sells the asset to a third party. As a result of this sale, the lessee has an amount of income equal to the amount of deductions allowed for the lease payments but only to the extent of any profit derived on that sale. Subparts FB and FC contain the rules that provide for the income tax treatment on transfers of certain property. Subpart FB deals with transfers made under certain relationship agreement settlements, and subpart FC is about the tax treatment of certain transfers of property after death of the owner. Subpart FE contains the thin capitalisation rules that apportion certain interest expenditure between income derived from New Zealand and other income for: • a New Zealand taxpayer subject to a certain level or type of foreign control; and • a foreign-owned bank with a lower than prescribed level of equity. Subpart FF operates to restrict the conduit tax relief for a company by an amount that correctly reflects the interest deductions of the company that relate to the assets that produce the conduit tax-relieved income. 6 Subpart FL contains the rules addressing the income tax consequences when a New Zealand- resident company changes its residence to another country and loses its New Zealand residence. Subpart FM draws together most of the rules for entry into a consolidated group and the tax treatment of certain transactions between member companies of a consolidated group. However, tax loss rules for consolidated groups are located in subpart ID because of their inter-relationship to the more general loss rules in Part I. The application of some specific anti-avoidance rules to a consolidated group has been retained in subpart GB. The consolidated group rules relating to memorandum accounts have been retained in Part O (Memorandum accounts) as they are so closely related with the general rules in that Part. Subpart FN applies when two or more companies that are part of a wholly owned group of companies form an imputation group to enable a company in the imputation group to pay an imputed dividend when another company in the imputation group has a credit for New Zealand tax paid. This subpart also includes the rules relating to trans-Tasman imputation groups. Subpart FO applies to amalgamations involving only New Zealand-resident companies that are not dual resident and do not derive only exempt income. These rules generally provide for no income tax consequences on the transfer of property and novation for liabilities that occur under the amalgamation. Subpart FZ has been retained for a range of terminating provisions. Part G of the bill Part G of the 2004 Act has a wide impact across the Act because of the scope of its provisions. It contains two types of provisions: • those dealing with avoidance; and • those dealing with certain transactions treated as taking place at market value. Two structural issues were identified in rewriting Part G: • It was not entirely clear in what circumstances a provision’s anti-avoidance nature merited locating it in Part G. This point arises because, in many cases, other existing technical base-maintenance remedial provisions could be viewed as dealing with matters of avoidance. • As other Parts of the Act also contain many provisions treating transactions as occurring at market value, the rationale for having valuation provisions in Part G was unclear. 7 As a result, the provisions proposed to be retained in Part G are those which have an anti- avoidance element or do not have a suitable alternative location. The bill retains, in subparts GA and GB, only those provisions that, in broad terms, apply to arrangements having a purpose or effect of generally defeating the purpose of the Act or specific provisions in other Parts of the Act. As has occurred with rules in other Parts, when a rule in Part G has an effect on the amount of income or a deduction and the allocation of that amount, a link is now made to its related rules in Part C, D, or E. As in other Parts, this drafting approach assists readers in their understanding of the relationship between a rule in Part G and other Parts of the Act. Part H of the bill Part H of the Income Tax Act 2004 contains groups of rules that modify the calculation of taxable income for a tax year for certain persons and entities. Some provisions within Part H also affect provisions in Parts F to N of the Act. Subpart HA contains the rules for attributing and loss-attributing companies. These are new terms replacing “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company.” As the term “qualifying” is used in the 2004 Act in many different ways, it is preferable to use terms that are more representative of the underlying policy. Most of the trust rules are set out in subpart HC. These rules provide for the taxation of distributions from trusts and the taxation of undistributed income derived by trustees. Trusts are classified as complying trusts, foreign trusts and non-complying trusts. Again, these terms have been chosen because they better reflect the policy of the rules. The agency rules are set out in subpart HD. They set out the circumstances in which a person is treated as an agent of another person in relation to the tax obligations of that other person for income tax and tax administration purposes. Subpart HE sets out the rules that apply to transactions between a mutual association and its members. These rules provide for the income tax treatment of income derived by a mutual association and also of distributions to members. The rules for Māori authorities are contained in subpart HF. These rules set out the taxation treatment for income derived by a Māori authority and distributions made from these authorities. The relationship with other Māori authority rules (tax credits, memorandum accounts, refunds, tax rates and administration rules) are also identified. Subpart HR contains rules for a variety of entities, such as partnerships, joint ventures, group investment funds, the Government Superannuation Fund and airport operators. Subpart HZ has been retained for terminating provisions. 8 Part I of the bill Part I contains the loss rules. Since these rules were first introduced, many additions have been made to the rules, including ring-fenced losses for mining, and CFC and FIF holdings. Over time, the Act has also extended the way in which a tax loss is used for purposes other than offsetting against net income of a future tax year. The new subpart IA now provides clear links to the core provisions, as well as signposts to specific rules setting out the different ways in which a tax loss may be used. The Part is structured to ensure that persons with tax losses carried forward must first use those losses by subtracting them from their net income for the tax year before they can make use of the variety of elective uses for tax losses. New terms central to these rules are “tax loss component”, “tax loss”, and “loss balance”. Subpart IA is a key part of the restructured Part I. It sets out the rules within the Act that allow a person with a tax loss to use that loss. This subpart also contains the general rules for carrying forward a tax loss, which are located in subparts IE and IF of the 2004 Act. Subparts IC to IE deal with the main company-related loss rules. The loss grouping rules for companies are in subpart IC. Subpart ID sets out how the loss grouping rules are applied to a consolidated group of companies. The loss rules that apply to companies in certain amalgamations are set out in subpart IE. The rules in subpart IP set out how losses may be used when the general loss rules and loss grouping rules are breached part-way through an income year. A breach of these rules occurs through a loss of continuity or commonality (as applicable). Subparts IQ to IT deal with how ring-fenced tax losses may be used. These losses include attributed CFC net losses, FIF net losses, mining and petroleum mining net losses and life insurance policyholder net losses. Subpart IV contains the rules restricting the amount of a tax loss that a supplementary dividend holding company may use. Subpart IW sets out the circumstances in which a tax loss may be used to satisfy shortfall penalties. Subpart IZ contains terminating provisions that apply to persons with certain types of tax losses from prior years that have restrictions on their use. Part L of the bill The rewritten Part L contains most of the tax credit rules. It has been expanded to include rebates that are located in Part K, other than the tax credits for families (retained in a separate Part – Part M). The term “tax credit” is used to represent every type of tax credit. 9 Subpart LA contains the general rules relating to the use of tax credits and includes aspects of the rules contained in sections BC 8 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act. In particular, subpart LA identifies when a tax credit arises, and sets out how the Act applies a tax credit to satisfy a person’s obligations under section BB 2. It also sets out how family scheme credits are used. Subpart LB contains a list of provisions describing the amount and time at which a person has a tax credit for PAYE, provisional tax, RWT, NRWT, under the family scheme, and for caregivers. Subpart LC lists the tax credit rules that relate to amounts that are rebates in subpart KC of the 2004 Act. This subpart describes the amount and time at which a person has the tax credit, as well as the adjustment rules for part-year residency and a change in balance date. Tax credits for donations are dealt with in subpart LD. The use of imputation credits as a tax credit is dealt with in subpart LE, and the use of FDP credits for tax credit purposes is set out in subpart LF. Subpart LJ has the rules that determine the amount of a tax credit a New Zealand resident has for foreign taxes paid on income sourced outside New Zealand. These rules more clearly identify the segmental approach to the calculation of the maximum tax credit for income from a particular source or of a particular nature. Subpart LK contains rules covering a variety of tax credits, including tax credits relating to attributed CFC income, consolidated companies and companies that have amalgamated. The underlying foreign tax credit rules are set out in subpart LL. Subpart LO sets out when Māori authority tax credits arise and when they can be used. Subparts LP and LQ deal with the tax credit rules for supplementary dividends and conduit relief. Policyholder tax credits for life insurers are dealt with in subpart LR. Again, subpart LZ has been retained for terminating provisions, and includes the tax credit rules for home vendor mortgages and special home ownership accounts. Part M of the bill Part M of the bill contains only the rules relating to the entitlements under what is referred to in the draft legislation as the “family scheme”. These rules have been retained within a separate Part because they mostly relate to the delivery of tax credits to eligible people on an interim basis during a tax year. This Part of the bill provides for the calculation of the various family scheme credits, which are then dealt with under Part L. Subparts MA to MC contain the general provisions for the family scheme rules. Subpart MB provides the rules for calculating the amount of family scheme income on which the family scheme tax credit is based. Subpart MC lists the rules under which a person may be entitled to a family scheme tax credit. Subparts MD to MF provide for the calculation and delivery of the various family scheme credits. Subpart MZ contains some terminating provisions relating to past aspects of the family scheme. 10 Part O of the bill Part O of the bill contains the rules relating to memorandum accounts. “Memorandum account” is a new, generic term used in general rules that relate to imputation credit accounts, FDP accounts, CTR accounts, branch equivalent tax accounts, ASC accounts, Māori authority credit accounts and policyholder credit accounts. The main purpose of Part O is to provide a way of tracking payments of tax, tax relief amounts and other types of payment made by or to certain entities in a way that enables the subsequent delivery of an amount of a tax credit under Part L or other tax benefits to people having interests in these entities. As a result, Part O indirectly relates to the core provisions via Part L and other provisions. This Part draws common rules together and sets out separate tables for credits and debits that summarise the credit and debit rules for each type of memorandum account. These tables follow subpart OZ. Subpart OA contains the general rules that apply to all memorandum accounts. Examples of general rules include how to determine the balance of a memorandum account at any time, continuity rules that must be satisfied to preserve the carry-forward of credits, within corporate entities, from one tax year to the next, and how to calculate a maximum permitted ratio for attachment of certain credits to certain distributions. Each of the subparts from subpart OB to OK contains the specific rules for each type of memorandum account. These specific rules detail the amount of a credit or debit and the time at which they arise. Each subpart also quantifies the amount of a credit that may be attached to a distribution from the entity. Each subpart also states the consequence of an account having a debit balance at 31 March and the additional amounts that may be payable as a result. Subpart OB deals with imputation credit accounts, OC with FDP accounts, OD with CTR accounts, OE with BETA accounts, OF with ASC accounts, OJ with policyholder credit accounts, and OK with Māori authority credit accounts. Subpart OP contains the rules that set out how a consolidated group of companies applies the individual and general memorandum account rules. It also sets out specific memorandum account rules that apply just to a consolidated group of companies. Subpart OZ contains terminating provisions. Part R of the bill Part R consolidates the rules that set out how and when persons satisfy their obligations for amounts imposed under Part BB. The rules relating to tax payments and refunds from subparts MB to MD of the 2004 Act have been moved to Part R. Those rules in subparts MB to MD of the 2004 Act related to terminal tax, provisional tax, PAYE intermediaries, tax pooling, early payment discounts and the use of tax refunds. 11 Subpart RA draws together the general rules that relate to several different payment types. In particular, Part R provides a clear link from the obligations imposed under section BB 2 to the detailed rules for each payment type in the relevant subparts within Part R. This Part also rationalises common rules – for example, the date by which payment is required – and the treatment of amounts withheld by the payer as being received by the payee. The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 have been moved to and consolidated with associated provisions in subpart RD. Administrative rules (which mainly relate to information and notification requirements) have been moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Subpart RB contains the rules that relate to the satisfaction of person’s terminal tax under section BC 8. This subpart also incorporates section NG 3 of the 2004 Act, which applies to a person with non-resident passive income when the NRWT withheld by the payer of the income is treated as the income tax liability in relation to that income. The provisional tax rules are set out in subpart RC. These rules describe the circumstances in which a person has a provisional tax obligation, the methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year, and the payment methods relating to a person’s provisional tax liability for a tax year. The PAYE and ESCT rules are now located in subpart RD because of the similarity in their operation. These rules define the PAYE rules and list the types of payments to which they apply. They also show how an employer calculates the amount of PAYE or ESCT to be withheld and when the amount withheld is to be paid to the Commissioner. Subparts RE, RF and RG set out the rules describing when and how amounts are withheld from payments consisting of resident and non-resident passive income, as well as amounts in relation to foreign dividends received by a New Zealand company. These subparts also describe when and how these amounts are paid to the Commissioner or are treated as being paid. Subpart RM consolidates the rules dealing with refunds of overpayments of taxes and other obligations under the Act. Subpart RP sets out the rules relating to PAYE intermediaries and tax pooling accounts. Subpart RZ has been retained for certain terminating provisions relating to provisional tax and withdrawal tax. Part Y of the bill Definitions continue to be located at the end of the Act, but immediately before transitional provisions. Subpart YA contains the list of defined terms, and whether the substance of a definition is set out in Part Y or is located close to its operating rules. An example of this latter approach is the definitions of the different types of trusts: • “Complying trust” is in clause HC 10. • “Foreign trust” is in clause HC 11. • “Non-complying trust” is in clause HC 12. 12 Subpart YB contains the definition of “associated person”. This definition has been restructured to better communicate the concepts underlying the various codes within the 2004 Act which define “association”. The meaning of “control” is set out in subpart YC, and includes the voting interest and market value interest rules. Subpart YD sets out the rules relating to residence and source. Subpart YE contains the rules describing how references to balance dates and years are intended to be read throughout the Act. Part Z of the bill Part Z contains the transitional rules, and it is intended that the transitional rules have the same function as the equivalent rules set out in Part Y of the 2004 Act. These transitional rules are intended to apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year that corresponds to the 2008-09 tax year. 13 CHAPTER 3 Intended changes in the legislation Making the law clearer has been achieved by using plain language within a consistent structure. The objective is to do this without substantively changing the policy content and associated compliance requirements of the current Act. Care has been taken to ensure that, apart from minor policy clarifications, the bill produces the same outcome as the existing law. The intended changes in the legislation made in the bill are of a minor nature and have been presented for public consultation in recent years. These changes are supported by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Clause FA 3 – Share dealing Clause FA 3 rewrites section FC 3 of the 2004 Act. This rule deals with the situation where a person enters into an arrangement to buy shares on revenue account, strips out a dividend from those shares, and then sells them. In the absence of section FC 3, this person would be able to generate, for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of those shares. This rule was originally enacted in 1959 (as section 136A of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954) to prevent this outcome, but also to ensure that the dividend continues to be treated as it normally would (for tax purposes) under the dividend rules. A drafting issue identified in the rewrite of this provision is an ambiguity in the proviso. This ambiguity potentially allows the “stripped-out” dividend to be counted twice in applying the proviso, and would result in the rule being largely ineffective. Clarifying this ambiguity to count the “stripped-out” dividend only once in applying the rule ensures that the provision should continue to operate as intended. Clauses FA 5(6) and FA 9(3) – Finance leases and operating leases The lease rules in sections FC 5 and FC 8E of the 2004 Act provide that when a leased asset is disposed of to an associated person of the lessee of that asset, and that associated person then disposes of the asset, the lessee is taxed on any profit on disposal. The policy of this rule is to ensure that the disposal rules applying to the lessee cannot be circumvented through transactions with associated persons. However, these rules are not clear about when the test of association applies. Clauses FA 5(6) and FA 9(3) place this test of association at the time the leased asset is disposed of to the associated person. 14 Clauses FC 2 to FC 6 – Transfer of property on death The transfer of property from a deceased person to the beneficiaries of the estate legally involves two transactions involving that property. The rules in subpart FI of the 2004 Act are intended to provide rollover relief for income tax purposes on transmission of certain types of property from the deceased person to his or her beneficiaries. Submissions to the exposure draft for this Part identified that the drafting in subpart FI of the 2004 Act could be interpreted as applying only to the transfer from the deceased person to the administrator or executor of the deceased person’s estate. As a result, clauses FC 2 to FC 8 have been clarified to ensure that they apply to the transfer of certain property to the executor or administrator of a deceased person’s estate, as well as the subsequent distribution of property to the beneficiaries of the estate. Clause GB 27(2)(c) – Attribution rule for personal services The current rule in section GB 14B(2)(c) is ambiguous as to whether the threshold of $60,000 should include income that is available for attribution or not. The rewritten provision confirms the policy intention that the threshold amount of $60,000 net income includes amounts that would be attributed under the attribution rule. Clauses GB 35(2)(d) and GB 42(2)(d) – Multiple purposes in arrangements Sections GC 22(1)(a)(iv) and GC 27A(1)(d) of the 2004 Act refer to an arrangement that has “the purpose” of obtaining a tax advantage. The context of these rules is that this purpose should not be an incidental purpose, indicating that the section actually contemplates there may be more than one purpose for the arrangement. The use of “the purpose” is thus inconsistent with the context and application of the drafting and is linguistically incorrect. It is clear from the drafting of these two sections that they are intended to apply when one purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage, irrespective of the number of purposes of the arrangement. However, the section is not to apply when the purpose giving rise to the tax advantage is incidental to the arrangement. As a result, in both rewritten provisions, the term “the purpose” has been clarified as “a purpose”. Clause HC 34(2) – Taxable distributions from a non-complying trust Section HH 3 of the Act treats taxable distributions from a non-complying trust as a special class of income that is not included in the annual return of income. These distributions are derived from trust funds when the trustees have not complied with their New Zealand tax obligations. 15 A taxable distribution of this nature is subject to a special tax rate, but the rules do not expressly contain a due date for payment of that tax. The current practice is to require the payment of this special tax by the terminal tax date of the person liable for the tax on the distribution. (Either the trustee or the beneficiary can be liable.) Clause HC 34(2) provides that the due date for payment of tax on a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust is the same as the due date for the payment of terminal tax of the person liable to make the payment of the tax on this distribution. Clause IA 4(1) – Tax losses The relationship between the tax loss carry-forward and the grouping rules is unclear. A potential ambiguity exists as to whether losses carried forward by a person should be applied to the person’s own net income before the grouping rules can be applied. The policy intention is that, when persons carry forward tax losses, they must first use these tax losses to offset against their own net income. In other words, other uses of tax losses carried forward from a prior tax year (including grouping of losses) are elective actions that can be made only if carried-forward losses exceed a person’s net income for the current tax year. Therefore clause IA 4 clarifies that a person who carries forward tax losses from one tax year to the next tax year must first use that carried forward loss balance to reduce net income for that next tax year. It also clarifies that a person can apply the elective loss rules only to losses carried forward from the previous tax year if the balance of carried-forward tax losses exceeds the net income of the current tax year. Clauses LA 1 to LA 10 – Tax credits and rebates The rewritten Parts K and L consolidate the concepts of rebate and tax credit. The rationalisation of these terms and the restructuring of these rules gives rise to a minor adjustment in the use of rebates and tax credits. The 2004 Act takes an inconsistent approach to the time at which tax credits arise and the tax year in which those tax credits are used to satisfy an obligation under the Act, particularly in a business context. The restructuring of the tax credit rules achieves a matching of the income year in which the tax credits arise to the corresponding tax year. This change overcomes timing problems inherent in some of the tax credit rules and better reflects the policy intention. However, the clarification does not apply to credits of tax that arise under subparts KC (individual rebates) or KD (Tax credits for family support and family plus) of the 2004 Act as these credits can only arise and be used in relation to a tax year. 16 Clause YA 1 – Definition of “natural resource” The concept of “natural resource “is found in two definitions in the Act and is also a term used in many of New Zealand’s double taxation agreements. The 2004 Act does not define this term, and as part of the Rewrite project’s objective is to provide clear legislation, it is desirable to define it. The new definition of “natural resource” is derived from a review of all natural resource- related definitions within other New Zealand legislation. The definition in clause YA 1 includes land, water, air, soil or subsoil, minerals, geographic or geologic features, electromagnetic spectrum, forms of energy, living organisms, ecosystems and any rights or interest in any of these things mentioned. The use of the defined term “tax year” in business related rules In the rewrite of Parts F to O, officials identified a number of provisions that refer to the defined term “ tax year” (31 March year), when the context of these rules indicate that the reference should be to the defined term “income year” (balance date-related). This is particularly evident in rules relating to commercial activity. The term “tax year” in the provisions listed below has been either omitted from the rule, as the term is unnecessary in the context of the rule, or has been rewritten to better reflect the income year context of the rule. This list in the left-hand column (Clause in new Act or in TAA section) is set out as an appendix to schedule 51.

Core provisions Clause BC 4 of the bill now reflects the wide range of uses to which a net loss may be put. Sections BC 6 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act provide a framework for determining the income tax liability of a person and how the Act uses tax credits to satisfy this liability. As this framework has been more closely integrated with the detailed tax credit rules in Parts L and M of the bill, these sections have been simplified and harmonised with Part L. As a result, clauses BC 6 to BC 8 and subpart LA of the bill now cover the same subject matter as sections BC 6 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act. Parts C to E of the bill Some provisions in Parts F to Z have been moved to a new location within Parts C to E. For example, clauses CV 16, CV 17, and DW 3 in the bill are the new location for the operative aspects of sections FC 18 to FC 21 of the 2004 Act. The transitional rules in the 2004 Act relating to Parts yet to be rewritten have been omitted from the rewritten bill. These transitional rules are sections CW 51, CX 45, CY 1, DY 1 and DY 2. However, sections BD 3(2) and BD 4(2) operate to permit rules located in Parts F to I of the Act to have a timing effect. These rules are retained in the bill to ensure that any timing rule retained within Parts F to Part I can continue to have an operative effect. However, when a provision in Parts F to the end of the Act have an effect on income or a deduction (including, in some instances, a timing effect), a new rule has been inserted into Parts C or D. The insertion is made either within an existing rule or as a new section that has an overriding effect on the related rule. Examples of these new rules in the bill include: • clause CB 2 (which relates to amounts received on disposal of business assets that include trading stock); • clauses CC 11 to CC 13 (which relate to finance leases and hire purchase agreements); • clause CD 11 (which relates to various avoidance arrangements); • clause DB 11 (which relates to profit-related or substituting debentures); and • clauses DB 56 to DB 58 and DC 5 (which relate to various avoidance arrangements). 20 Part F of the bill As the apportionment function is better related to the main rules relating to the subject matter, Part F in the bill no longer deals with apportionment. This has led to a number of provisions being moved from Part F to other Parts of the Act, for example: • Section FB 2, which apportions tax credits, has been merged with the source rule in YD 5. Under subpart LJ of the bill, the calculation of a tax credit on foreign income is linked to the amount of the foreign income. Consequently, the amount of tax paid on foreign income is expected to be determined by the relationship between subpart LJ and the source rule in clause YD 5. • Section FB 3 has been moved to clause CB 2, as this provision is an apportionment rule that is better aligned with the business income and trading stock rules. • Section FB 4A has been moved to clause DB 30 as this provision is an apportionment rule related to the land sale rules. • Section FB 7 has been moved to clause EE 52 as it is an apportionment rule that is better aligned with the depreciation rules. Some income and deduction rules have been moved to other parts in the bill. For example: • Sections FC 13 to FC 15 and FC 18 to FC 21, relating to non-resident insurers, shippers and film renters, have been moved to Parts C, D, and Y. The new provisions are in, respectively, clauses CR 3, CV 16 and CV 17, DW 3, and YD6 to YD 8. This move ensures that these income and deduction prohibitions and the attribution of a New Zealand source to that income are appropriately treated in the scheme of the Act. • Sections FC 16 and FC 17 have been moved to clauses HD 16 and HD 17 to reflect the agency relationship that arises on payment of certain insurance premiums to non- resident insurers. The relationship between the provisions in Part F and those in other Parts of the Act are signalled with new provisions. Examples of rules relating to this approach include: • clauses CC 11 to CC 13, which relate to the finance lease and hire purchase agreement rules; • clause CH 9, which relates to the downward adjustment to the income tax liability for deductions under section FG 8B of the Act as this rule is in essence a “negative deduction”, clause CH 9 ensures that this adjustment is more consistent with the manner in which the Act addresses other “negative deductions”; • clause DB 10, which relates to the limitation on deductibility of interest in certain thin capitalisation situations; • clause DB 26, which relates to the cost of cancelled shares when the shares were held as revenue account property; • clause DV 15, which relates to the amalgamation rules; and • clause EB 24, which relates to the valuation of trading stock. 21 Rules moved to subpart FZ of the bill, as terminating provision, are: • sections FC 6 to FC 8, relating to the specified lease rules, which have been moved to clauses FZ 2 to FZ 4; • section FF 5, relating to commercial bills, which has been moved to clause FZ 6; • section FF 18, relating to specified activities carried on before 11 October 1982, which has been moved to clause FZ 5; and • sections FI 9 and FI 10 of the 2004 Act, being transitional rules applying to transfers of property on death, which have been moved to, and combined in, clause FZ 7. Part G of the bill Rules in which a discretion of the Commissioner has been replaced with an objective test are clauses GB 4, GB 6, GB 31, GB 36(1), GZ 1, and Schedule 5, Part A, Clause 4. The relationship between some rules in Part G and other parts of the Act are now signalled clearly, and include: • clause CD 11, which relates to the treatment of dividends as a result of an avoidance arrangement; • clause CH 7, which relates to an adjustment to arising as a result of an avoidance arrangement; • clauses CH 8 and DB 58, which relate to the disposal of trading stock and the valuation of lease rentals at other than market value • clause CW 62, which relates to adjustments for exempt income as a result of an avoidance arrangement; • clause CX 18, which relates to benefits provided to associates of both employees and shareholders; • clause CX 54, which relates to adjustments for excluded income as a result of an avoidance arrangement; • clause DB 57, which relates to adjustments to the amount of a deduction as a result of an avoidance arrangement; and • clause EJ 9, which relates to an adjustment to the allocation of certain film expenditure as a result of an avoidance arrangement. Provisions moved from Part G to other Parts are: • subsections GC 15(3) and (4), which have been moved to clause CX 18; • section GD 4, which has been moved to clause DC 5; and • section GC 9, which has been moved to clause EX 3. 22 Omissions from Part G are: • section GC 14D(6), as clause GB 29(4) incorporates its effect; • section GC 14F(2), as its effect is dealt with in the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1; • section GC 19, as it duplicates the effect of clause RA 2 (section NF 13 of the 2004 Act) and is therefore unnecessary; • sections GC 18, GC 20, which are unnecessary as public policy law operates to void any agreement that does not comply with New Zealand legislation; • section GC 27A(6)(d), which has been removed as it is unnecessary because the Commissioner chooses which of subsection (5) or (6) applies, so both subsections cannot apply at the same time; • section GD 3(3), which has been removed as its effect is taken up in clause GB 23(1) to (3); • section GD 10(3), which is omitted as its effect is incorporated in subclauses GD 5(1) and (2); and • sections GC 17(a), GE 1, and GZ 1, which have been omitted on the basis they are spent provisions. Part H of the bill Terminology changes in Part H are: • “Qualifying company” is now an “attributing company” and, similarly, a “loss attributing qualifying company” becomes a “loss-attributing company”. The term “attributing” reflects the dictionary meaning of the term “attribute”, being “regard as belonging to; ascribe to”. • “Qualifying trust” and “non-qualifying trust” have been renamed, respectively, as “complying trust” and “non-complying trust”. This reflects that policy of the legislation for trusts that comply with their taxation obligations which is that they are able to make distributions to beneficiaries (other than beneficiary income) without further income tax consequences for the beneficiary. • The concept of transfer of value is applied to the definition of distributions, as the concepts in the definition of “distribution” in the 2004 Act have extensive similarities with the definition of “transfer of value” used in subpart CD (Dividends) of the Act. The relationship of various rules in Part H to the scheme of the Act, particularly in relation to Parts C to E have been clarified. Examples of this type of clarification include: • clause CB 32, which lists income from mutual transactions as income (section HF 1(1) of the 2004 Act); • clause CB 33, which applies to distributions (including rebates) made to members of mutual associations (section HF 1 of the 2004 Act); 23 • clause CD 12, which ensures that when a superannuation scheme that is a unit trust becomes a superannuation fund, the loss of the company status is treated as a liquidation, which clarifies how the change in status of the unit trust relates to the dividend rules, as intended by section HH 1(9) of the 2004 Act; • clause CD 37, which ensures that a Māori authority distribution is not a dividend (section HI 4(2) of the 2004 Act); • clause CV 11, which lists certain distributions from a Māori authority as income (section HI 4, HI 5 and HI 7 of the 2004 Act); • clause CV 12, which relates to amounts received by a trustee after a person’s death in relation to clause HC 8 (section HH 8 of the 2004 Act); • clause CV 13, which lists as income an amount of beneficiary income, a taxable distribution from a foreign trust and certain settlements of property on trust, the list relating to sections HH 1(7), HH 3(1) of the 2004 Act; • clause CV 14, which relates to section HH 3(5A) of the 2004 Act and the treatment of distributions from a community trust; • clause CV 15, which provides for certain amounts to be income of a beneficiary of a trust on the day a person regains New Zealand residence for tax purposes (section HH 3(3) of the 2004 Act); • clause CW 14, which lists as income certain dividends derived by an attributing company (section HG 10 of the 2004 Act); • clause CW 15, in which distributions from an attributing company are either treated as fully imputed dividends or as exempt income (section HG 13 of the 2004 Act); • clause CW 52, which ensures that distributions that are not beneficiary income derived from a complying trust are not included in the calculation of a beneficiary’s taxable income an example of a distribution to which this provision applies being a payment of a pension from a superannuation fund; • clause CW 53, which relates to income derived by trustees of a trust with no resident settlor (subsection HH 4(3B) of the 2004 Act); • clause CW 54, which provides for certain distributions from a Māori authority to be exempt income, as set out in section HI 5(1) of the 2004 Act; • clause CX 55, which treats income derived by a trustee in relation to minors as excluded income of the minors (sections HH 3A to HH 3F of the 2004 Act); • clause CX 56, which lists as excluded income, a taxable distribution from a non- complying trust, which is consistent with the “stand-alone” tax treatment in Part H for these taxable distributions (section HH 3 of the 2004 Act); • clause DB 9, which rewrites section HG 9(3) to (5) of the 2004 Act to restrict the amount of deduction a person is allowed for interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the acquisition of shares in an attributing company; • clause DV 19, which lists the conditions under which a mutual association has a deduction for a rebate paid to a member of the association (section HF 1 of the 2004 Act). 24 Provisions moved in or out of Part H include: • The requirements set out in section OB 3 of the 2004 Act for attributing companies have been moved to subpart HA. • Most of the rules relating to a consolidated group of companies have been moved to subpart FM of the bill. • Section HK 18 of the Act, which relates to an administrative relationship between Customs officers and the Commissioner has been moved to draft section 166B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (schedule 50 of the bill). Part I of the bill Sections IH 4(1) and IH 5 of the 2004 Act have been omitted as they are historic in nature and are redundant. Section IG 1(4) also has been omitted on the basis that it is no longer necessary within the structure of the Act. Sections IE 2, IF 1(5), IF 1(6), IF 2, IG 2(2)(c), (d)(ii)(B), IH 1(2), and IH 2(1) of the 2004 Act have been moved to subpart IZ as, respectively, clauses IZ 1, IZ 4, IZ 5, IZ 6, IZ 7, IZ 3, IZ 2. Parts L and M of the bill Sections BC 9 and BC 10 of the 2004 Act are now largely contained in subpart LA of the bill. This drafting provides a clear relationship between the core provisions and the various tax credit rules. Subpart KD has been relabelled as Part M in the bill, apart from: • the rule providing for the use of the family tax credit, which is located in clause LB 4 of the bill; and • sections KD 5(9), KD 6, and KD 7, which have been moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see schedule 50, draft sections 80KI to 80KW). Other provisions moved from Part K are: • subparts KB, KC, and KE to KZ, which have been moved to Part L of the bill; and • section KB 3, which has been moved to clause MA 4. Provisions moved to subpart LZ include: • section LF 6(1) and (3), which have been moved to clause LZ 1; • section KE 1, which has been moved to clauses LZ 6, LZ 7 and LZ 8; and • section KG 1, which has been moved to clauses LZ 9 to LZ 11. 25 Part O of the bill Part M of the 2004 Act has been relabelled Part O. A major improvement in the redrafting of Part M is the presentation of all debit and credit rules in summary form in a series of tables at the end of Part M. Two consequential changes have been made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 that relate to the new term “memorandum account”. These changes insert a reference to “memorandum account” and are made in the definition of “tax position” in section 3, and also in section 22(2) of that Act. The reference to Māori authorities in the imputation credit account rules has been omitted from the bill. Following the enactment of section ME 1(2)(j) in the 2004 Act by the Taxation (Māori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, a Māori authority may not maintain an imputation credit account. Provisions moved from Part M of the 2004 Act to Part R of the bill are subparts MB, MBA, MBB, MC and MD. Provisions moved from Part M of the 2004 Act to subpart OZ of the bill include: • section ME 4(1)(viii), which has been moved to clause OZ 1; • section ME 5(1)(e), which has been moved to clause OZ 2; • section ME 5(1)(n), which has been moved to clause OZ 3; • sections ME 5(4), MG 5(4), which have been moved to clause OZ 4; • section MJ 4, which has been moved to clause OZ 5; and • section MJ 7, which has been moved to clause OZ 6. Part R of the bill Part R of the bill contains the rules that set out how and when persons satisfy obligations imposed on them under Part B of the Act. The relationship of the rules relating to the conversion of credits to a tax loss component and their use are also linked with Part I. Most of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 have been moved into subpart RD of the bill. The Schedule to the regulations is moved to new Schedule 4. Redundant provisions include: • sections MB 11 and MB 26 of the 2004 Act, which relate to the change of taxable periods for GST periods and have been omitted because they duplicate rules that are also contained in the Goods and Services Tax Act; • section MB 28, which has also been omitted as it duplicates provisions in the Tax Administration Act; and 26 • section NZ 1, which has been omitted on the basis that its historic nature renders it redundant. Provisions moved to the Tax Administration Act (TAA) include: • administrative rules in sections MBA 3 to MBA 6, MBA 8, and MBA 9 (relating to tax pooling), which have been moved to sections 15N to 15S and section 120OE of the TAA; • administrative rules in sections NBA 1 to NBA 3, NBA 5, and NBA 8, which have been moved to sections 15C to 15F, and 15J to 15L of the TAA; • administrative rules in sections NBB 2, NBB 3, NBB 4, NBB 5 and NBB 7, which have been moved to sections 15C, 15G to 15I and 15M of the TAA; • PAYE rules in sections NC 7(1), (3), NC 8(1), (1AA), (2) to (4), (7), (9A), (10), (12), NC 8A, NC 9, NC 12A(1) to (3), NC 14 and NC 15(1) to (3), which have been moved to sections 24B to 24J, 24L and 24P of the TAA; • FBT rules in sections ND 1(6), ND 2(3), ND 9(2), (3), ND 10(2) to (5), ND 11, ND 12, ND 13(5), (6), ND 14(5), (6), and ND 15(7), (8), which have been moved to sections 46B to 46E of the TAA; • RWT rules in sections NF 2AA, NF 8(2) to (4), NF 9, NF 10(1)(a), (d), (3) and NF 11, which have been moved to sections 24K and 32E to 32L of the TAA; • NRWT rules in sections NG 5 to NG 7 and NG 16(5), which have been moved to sections 32M and 165B of the TAA; • administrative rules in sections NH 2(4), NH 3(6) and NH 4(5)(b), (c), which have been moved to sections 32N and 71B of the TAA; and • Regulation 5 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, which has been moved to section 24M of the Tax Administration Act. The appendix to Schedule 19 of the 2004 Act has been omitted on the basis that it serves no useful purpose. While an employer must withhold PAYE from employment income, the employer must also take into account obligations under other Acts, so the information in this appendix is of little assistance to employers. Part Y of the bill Part O of the 2004 Act is relabelled Part Y. Although retained in clause YA 1 as index entries, the substance of a number of definitions has been moved closer to their related provisions, including: • OB 1 “absentee”, which is moved to clause HD 18(2); • OB 1 “beneficiary income”, which is moved to clauses HC 5 and HC 6(1) to (3); • OB 1 “category A income”, which is moved to clause HR 3(1) and (2); 27 • OB 1 “category B income”, which is moved to clause HR 3(3); • OB 1 “consideration”, “lessee’s acquisition cost”, “ lessor’s disposition value,” which are moved to clause FA 7; • OB 1 “consolidation rules”, which is moved to clause FM 2(2); • OB 1 “corpus”, which is moved to clause HC 4; • OB 1 “current value”, which is moved to clause HR 3(4); • OB 1 “designated investment fund”, which is moved to clause HR 3(6); • OB 1 “distribution”, which is moved to clause HC 14; • OB 1 “dividend withholding payment rules”, which is moved to clause RG 1; • OB 1 “effective interests”, which is moved to clause HA 43; • OB 1 “eligible company”, which is moved to clause FM 31(1); • OB 1 “foreign company”, which is moved to clause HA 6(2); • OB 1 “foreign trust”, which is moved to clauses HC 10(2) to (4) and HC 11; • OB 1 “full time earner”, which is moved to clause MA 7; • OB 1 “fully conduit tax relief credited”, which is moved to clause RF 9(6); • OB 1 “non-qualifying trust”, which is moved to clause HC 12; • OB 1 “NRWT rules”, which is moved to clause RF 1; • OB 1 “PAYE rules”, which is moved to clause RD 2(1), (2); • OB 1 “provisional tax rules”, which is moved to clauses RC 2 and RC 3; • OB 1 “qualifying person” (a)(ii), which is moved to clause MC 4; • OB 1 “qualifying person” (a)(iii), which is moved to clause MC 5; • OB 1 “qualifying trust”, which is moved to clause HC 10(1); • OB 1 “resident imputation subgroup” and “trans-Tasman imputation group”, which are moved to clause FN 8; • OB 1 “settlor”, which is moved to clauses HC 27 and HC 28; • OB 1 “specified period” and “eligible period”, which are moved to clause MC 11; • OB 1 “taxable distribution”, which is moved to clause HC 15; and • OB 1 “trustee income”, which is moved to clauses HC 5 and HC 7(1). Provisions moved out of Part O include: • OB 2, which is moved to clause RD 3(1) to (4); • OB 3(1)(a), (b) and (g), which is moved to clause HA 6; • OB 3(1)(f), which is moved to clause HA 5(2); 28 • OC 1(2), which is moved to clause HR 5; • OC 1(2)-(6), which are moved to clause HR 6; • OC 1(6), which is moved to clause HR 7; and • OF 2, which is moved to clause HC 6(4) and (5). Some definitions in clause YA 1 that have been rationalised and updated are: • “applicable basic tax rate”, which is changed to “basic tax rate”; • paragraph (a) in the definition of “land”, which reverts to an operative rule in clause CB 6(3); • the definitions of “pay” and “payment”, which are rationalised and consolidated; • the definitions of “resident withholding income” and “non-resident withholding income”, which become “resident passive income” and “non-resident passive income” respectively; • “rebate”, which is replaced by “tax credit” and other terms referring to a type of “rebate” are omitted; • the definition of “trading stock”, which is simplified; • “source deduction payment”, which becomes the new term “PAYE income payment”. A number of definitions have been omitted as they are no longer required or are outdated terms relating to repealed legislation or relate to rules moved to the TAA. This list of defined terms being omitted includes: • Acquisition of control or income interests • Adjusted income tax liability • Allocation debit • Allocation deficit debit • Allowable rebate • Amount of the debenture • At all relevant times • Base ratio • Basis of exemption • Body • Commencement date • Commission agency contract • Commission agent • Communal home • Controlled foreign company tax credit • Co-operative marketing company • Corporation • Council 29 • Council-controlled trading organisation • Current grower • Director election • Disposal of control or income interests • District committee • Dual resident company • Effective date • Eligible company • Farm ownership requirements • Fishing vessel ownership requirements • Foreign company aggregates • Full employment • Gross tax deductions • Group quarter day • Grower • Imputation return • Imputation year • Insurance premium • Land owned • Lessee’s acquisition cost • Lessee’s outstanding balance • Lessor’s disposition value • Lessor’s outstanding balance • Licence area • Low tax jurisdiction company • Māori authority distribution penalty tax • Measurement day • National • Net balance due • Net specified income • Nil period • Nominee • Non-resident petroleum mining operator • Notional income tax liability • Overseas company • Part E timing rules • Payment • Preceding year • Primary employment earnings • Protected amount • Provisional taxpayer • Qualifying payments 30 • Qualifying superannuation scheme • Reconciliation statement • Reduced deduction • Refundable rebate • Relevant associate • Relevant time • Repealed provision • Resident withholding tax deduction reconciliation statement • Return of the taxpayer’s income • Scheduler income subject to final withholding • Secondary employment earnings • Serving employee • Shareholder election • Special farm ownership account • Special fishing vessel ownership account • Special tax code certificate • Specified foreign social security pension • Specified fund • Specified income • Specified preference shares • Specified value • Start date • Sufficient interest • Tax code certificate • Tax code declaration • Tax rate • Taxation Review Authority • Unadjusted income tax liability • Variation in control or income interests • Year of determination 31 CHAPTER 5 Transition to the new Act The new Act comes into force on 1 April 2008 and first applies to income derived in the 2008-09 income year. For amendments to other Acts, such as the Tax Administration Act, the commencement date of these rules is related to the 2008-09 income year. Transitional provisions Clause ZA 3 of the bill sets out the transitional provisions. These provisions ensure that a reference in any Act or document to the new Income Tax Act can be read as a reference to the 2004, 1994 or 1976 Acts, and a reference to one of those Acts can be read as a reference to the new Act. Clause ZA 3(3) to (5) provides that the new Act and relevant Tax Administration Act provisions are intended to represent the 2004 Act in rewritten form, except where an intended change in the legislation is indicated in schedule 51 of the new Act. These provisions also highlight that, although the new Act has the force of law, if a rewritten provision is unclear or leads to an absurdity, the 2004 Act is be used to determine the correct meaning of the new law. Saving of binding rulings Clause ZA 4 is designed to ensure that binding rulings continue to apply, despite the repeal of the 2004 Act. This continuation is to apply to binding rulings that were: • based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 or earlier income tax legislation; • intended to apply in one or more of the years following the date of effect of the new Act; and • applied for before the beginning of a person’s 2008-09 income year. The clause provides that when a binding ruling has been issued about a provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 (or the 1994 or 1976 legislation), it will be treated as if it had been issued about the equivalent provision in the new Act at the time the new Act begins to apply. An equivalent provision is one that corresponds to the provision in any of the 2004, 1994 or 1976 Acts on which the ruling was based. If that provision in the new Act is subsequently amended, the provisions of section 91G of the Tax Administration Act (which can void the ruling) will apply in the same way as if the binding ruling had been made under the new Act. 32 Clause ZA 4(1)(c) uses the words “corresponds to the old law” to link the provision in the 2004 Act on which the ruling was based with the provision in the new Act which has the same effect. These words are designed to reflect the government’s intention that existing binding rulings should not be affected by the enactment of the new Act, but should continue to apply as if they had been made about provisions in that Act at the time it came into effect. Clause ZA 4 also provides that a binding ruling cannot be issued concerning the application of the new Act to an arrangement already governed by a binding ruling subject to the savings provision. Therefore it is intended that the words used in these savings provision are given an appropriately purposive interpretation, so that taxpayers and Inland Revenue do not have to go to the effort of obtaining or issuing replacement binding rulings. In other words, the intention is that the requirement that the new law corresponds to the old law should not to be given any narrow, obstructive interpretation to prevent binding rulings being saved. Saving of accrual determinations Clause ZA 5 is designed to ensure that accrual determinations which were based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 (or earlier income tax legislation), and were intended to apply in one or more of the years following the date the new Act came into force, will continue to apply. It applies to accrual determinations made before the beginning of the 2004 income year. The clause provides that when an accrual determination has been issued about a provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 (or either of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the Income Tax Act 1976), it will be treated as if it had been issued about the equivalent provision of the new Act at the time the new Act began to apply. An equivalent provision is one that corresponds to the provision in the earlier Act on which the determination was based. Clause ZA 5(1)(d) uses the words “corresponds to the old law” to link the provision in the earlier Act on which the determination was based with the provision in the new Act which has the same effect. These words are designed to reflect the government’s intention that existing accruals determinations should not be affected by the enactment of the new Act, but should be able to continue as if they had been made about a provision in that Act at the time it came into force. It will also be important that these words are not given a narrow interpretation that would prevent accrual determinations from being saved. Depreciation determinations Depreciation determinations are made under the authority of section EE 25B of the 2004 Act. However, there is no provision in the 2004 Act or the Tax Administration Act 1994 that provides that these determinations cease to have effect on repeal of the 2004 Act. Therefore they continue to have effect by virtue of section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1999 as section EE 25B is to be replaced, without modification, by clause EE 26 of this bill.

Since 1 April 2006, student loans for most borrowers who live in New Zealand have been “interest-free”. That is achieved, however, by charging interest on these loans but then writing it off at the end of the year, which adds complexity to the legislation. The rationale for introducing interest-free loans was to reduce the costs to students of tertiary education, to encourage tertiary-educated New Zealanders to stay in New Zealand and contribute to the economy, and to remove barriers to skilled New Zealanders returning home. There are a number of concerns about the operation of the student loan scheme rules in the new “interest-free” environment. The financial incentives for borrowers to leave New Zealand without informing Inland Revenue have increased, since borrowers who are based overseas generally attract interest on their loans. It is also difficult for Inland Revenue, which collects repayments, to know who is and who is not overseas. Furthermore, compliance is low amongst borrowers overseas, while the legislation appears to be creating disincentives for them to return to New Zealand. The bill introduces changes to deal with these and other problems and generally updates the legislation to make it consistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans. The main administrative change in the bill will allow Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service to match information, to help determine whether a borrower is eligible for an interest-free loan. New rules for borrowers who go overseas include the introduction of a repayment “holiday” of up to three years, and the introduction of progressive repayment rules, based on the size of a borrower’s loan account, for all overseas borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday. Interest-free loans for people studying full-time overseas will be extended from post- graduates to undergraduates. The amnesty for overseas borrowers in arrears, introduced last year, is to be extended by a year, allowing those borrowers to make a “fresh start”. The late payment penalty for all borrowers, whether in New Zealand or overseas, will reduce from 2% to 1.5% a month to make it less punitive, and the hardship provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act are being amended to give Inland Revenue greater flexibility in administering them. These and other proposed changes are explained in this commentary. Unless otherwise indicated, section references in the text are to the Student Loan Scheme Act. 2 3 Policy changes 4 5 INFORMATION MATCH BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND CUSTOMS (Clauses 28, 36, 38 and 39) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed changes introduce an information match between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs). The purpose of the information match is to assist Inland Revenue in determining whether a borrower is: • eligible for an interest-free loan; • based in New Zealand or overseas; or • resident or non-resident. Application date The changes will apply from the day after enactment. Key features New section 62A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and new sections 280G and 280H of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 allow an information match of student loan borrower information. Sections 81 and 87 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are also being amended. Inland Revenue will provide Customs with the names, aliases, dates of birth and tax file numbers of student loan borrowers. An information match will occur by Customs comparing the name and date of birth information against any arrival and departure information it holds. If Customs has arrival or departure information relating to any borrower, it will supply Inland Revenue with the time and date of arrival or departure for that particular borrower. Inland Revenue will use the border crossing information obtained from Customs to determine whether borrowers are eligible for interest-free student loans. Borrowers who are overseas for more than six months are generally not eligible. Inland Revenue will also use border crossing information to help ascertain whether borrowers are: • based in New Zealand or overseas; or • resident or non-resident. 6 Borrowers are considered resident if they are present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any period of 12 months or have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Borrowers are considered non-resident if they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any period of 12 months, provided they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Chief Executive of Customs may enter into an agreement to determine the frequency, form and method for the exchange of information. Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993 is also being amended. This means that the information match will be subject to the rules in Part 10 of that Act. Background At present, borrowers are required to inform Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, overseas for more than three months. The introduction of interest-free student loans has increased the financial incentive for borrowers not to advise Inland Revenue of their absence overseas. This is because borrowers who are overseas for more than six months are generally not eligible for interest-free student loans, while borrowers remaining in New Zealand are eligible. The government agreed to introduce an information match to help Inland Revenue identify which borrowers are eligible for interest-free loans. 7 ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE INFORMATION (Clauses 28, 36 and 39) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed change allows Inland Revenue to obtain access to any information recording system that stores arrival and departure information that is used by the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs). The purpose of the access is to assist Inland Revenue in determining whether a borrower is: • eligible for an interest-free loan; • based in New Zealand or overseas; • resident or non-resident; or • in New Zealand. Application date The changes will apply from the day after enactment. Key features Under new section 62A of the Student Loan Scheme Act and new section 280I of the Customs and Excise Act, the Chief Executive of Customs may allow authorised Inland Revenue employees to have access to information stored in any recording system used by Customs to store arrival or departure information. Inland Revenue is able to gain access to such a recording system only for the purposes of assisting in determining which borrowers are eligible for the interest write-off that gives effect to interest-free loans, whether they are based in New Zealand or overseas, resident or non-resident and whether they are in New Zealand. Inland Revenue will be required to maintain a record of every time the database is accessed, to allow the appropriate use of database to be monitored. Obtaining access to a Customs’ database will allow Inland Revenue to confirm borrowers’ arrival and departure dates on an ad hoc basis – for example, if a borrower challenges the date that the information match shows that he or she left New Zealand. Background Under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue can seek arrival and departure information from the New Zealand Customs Service on a case- by-case basis. The changes will allow Inland Revenue to have direct access to the Customs database for information on arrivals and departures. 8 EXTENDING THE AMNESTY ON STUDENT LOAN PENALTIES (Clauses 4, 19, 30 and 35) Summary of proposed amendments The amnesty on student loan penalties, announced last year, is being extended until 31 March 2008. The purpose of extending the amnesty is to give the chance of a fresh start to non-resident borrowers in arrears who have been identified as the result of the proposed data match. Under the amnesty, borrowers who were non-resident at some time in the past but who have returned to New Zealand will not have any new non-resident liability established. The accounts of borrowers who repaid their loans by 13 November 2006, the date of introduction of the bill, will not be adjusted, even though the borrowers concerned might have been technically in arrears. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features The existing amnesty (sections 45A to 45D) is being repealed. A new Part 8 (sections 89 to 105) is being inserted, and section 2 is being amended. “Fresh start” If Inland Revenue has not raised non-resident assessments for tax years before 1 April 2007, it will not be required to do so. For borrowers with arrears who are non-resident as at 31 March 2006, existing penalties will be removed and the unpaid balance of assessments (whether resident or non-resident) will be cancelled up to 1 April 2007. Compounding interest at the applicable rate(s) applies on the loan balance over the period of default. The effect of these amendments is to wipe the slate clean for borrowers who are non- resident as at 31 March 2006. For borrowers who are resident as at 31 March 2006, but who were non-resident at any time before that date, Inland Revenue will not issue any non-resident assessment if not already made. For borrowers who have repaid their loan by 13 November 2006, their account will not be reopened. 9 Amnesty conditions In exchange for not establishing or removing penalties under the “fresh start” amendments, borrowers who are non-resident as at 31 March 2006 will have the chance to apply to Inland Revenue for the amnesty and begin making regular payments. Borrowers will have from 1 April 2007 until 31 March 2008 to apply to Inland Revenue to come within the amnesty. Meeting repayment requirements Borrowers will be considered to have complied with the amnesty terms if they repay an amount based on the size of their loan balance (as at the date they apply for the amnesty). The amount they are required to repay is as follows: • $2,000 for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $4,000 for loan balances of $15,001 to $30,000; and • $6,000 for loan balances of over $30,000. The amount must be paid by the borrower in four equal instalments, which are due as follows: • for amnesty applications between 1 April 2007 and 31 August 2007, the first payment is due on 30 September 2007 and every six months thereafter; • for amnesty applications between 1 September and 29 February 2008, the first payment is due on 31 March 2008 and every six months thereafter; and • for amnesty applications made in March 2008, the first payment is due on 30 September 2008 and every six months thereafter. Inland Revenue will have a once-only discretion to follow up any missed repayment and, provided the payment is made within one month of Inland Revenue contacting the borrower, the missed payment will not be treated as a failure to meet the terms of the amnesty. Inland Revenue will be able to reduce, in part, the amount payable in cases of significant financial hardship. Significant financial hardship includes difficulties that arise because of: • borrowers’ inability to meet minimum living expenses; • their inability to carry out their usual occupation because of illness, injury or disability; • their inability to meet mortgage repayments on their primary residence, resulting in the mortgagee seeking to enforce the mortgage on the residence; • the cost of modifying a residence to meet special needs arising from a disability of a borrower or a borrower’s dependant; • the cost of palliative care for a borrower or a borrower’s dependant; or • the cost of a funeral for a borrower’s dependant. 10 Amounts payable under the amnesty will replace any overseas repayment obligations. If borrowers become New Zealand-based during the two-year period in which repayments are due under the amnesty, the amounts they pay to meet their New Zealand-based repayment obligations (which are income-based) will count towards the amnesty’s required repayments. Amnesty conditions for borrowers who applied for the existing amnesty Borrowers who applied for the existing amnesty (which ends on 31 March 2007) must meet the repayment requirements as outlined above. Under the proposed extension, Inland Revenue will give credit for amounts already paid under the existing amnesty. Borrowers who do not apply for the amnesty or who do not comply with its terms Borrowers who do not apply for the amnesty by 31 March 2008 will have their loan balance increased by five percent of the balance at that date. However, if Inland Revenue considers that the resulting increase is more than the late payment penalties the borrower might otherwise have attracted, it may adjust the increase to an amount it considers fair and reasonable. If borrowers apply for the amnesty but fail to meet its terms, their loan balances will also be increased, but by a smaller amount that takes into account the degree of their compliance with repayment requirements. The increase in the loan balance will occur on 1 April of the year following a borrower’s failure to meet the terms of the amnesty. Borrowers who had repaid their loans by 13 November Some borrowers who were non-resident as at 31 March 2006 would have found themselves in arrears had they been correctly assessed, and would therefore technically be subject to the amnesty conditions. The changes ensure that borrowers who have repaid their loans by 13 November 2006 will not have any changes made to their account. Objection to decisions concerning amnesty Borrowers can object to Inland Revenue’s decision to increase their loan balance if they have failed to come within the amnesty or comply with its terms, on the grounds that the decision is erroneous. Background The existing amnesty on student loan penalties applies for the year to 31 March 2007. Borrowers who are non-resident and have arrears and penalties at the start of the amnesty period are eligible to have all penalties written-off, provided they meet their obligations under the Student Loan Scheme Act for two years. The amnesty was introduced to remove barriers to borrowers to returning to New Zealand. Extending the amnesty will allow borrowers identified as non-resident as a result of the data match – which will take effect after the existing amnesty ends – to apply to come within the amnesty. 11 SIMPLIFYING THE LAW ON WHICH REPAYMENT RULES APPLY (Clauses 4–8, 17 and 24) Summary of proposed amendments To simplify the law as to which set of repayment rules – those for people based in New Zealand or those for people based overseas – that borrowers are subject to, their annual repayment obligations will be based on whether or not they are eligible for an interest-free loan, rather than on their tax residence. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Section 2, the heading to Part 2, sections 14, 15, 44 and 57 of the Student Loan Scheme Act are being amended. A new section 14A is being inserted. Borrowers’ repayment obligations will be based on whether they satisfy the eligibility criteria for an interest-free loan, rather than on their tax residence, as at present. Aligning repayment conditions with when a borrower ceases to be entitled to an interest-free loan will simplify matters in that there will be just one, clear-cut rule for both: borrowers will be either eligible for an interest-free loan, and therefore subject to the repayment rules for New Zealand-based borrowers, or they will not be eligible for an interest-free loan, so will be subject to the repayment rules for overseas-based borrowers. Borrowers will become subject to the repayment rules for borrowers in New Zealand from the day they became entitled to an interest-free loan. Generally, borrowers who are overseas for more than six months are not eligible for interest-free loans. However, Inland Revenue is able to grant an exemption to these rules in certain circumstances. Borrowers who are granted an exemption will also be subject to the repayment rules for New Zealand-based borrowers. Background Currently, borrowers’ residence status for student loans purposes is based on tax residence. Tax residence can be difficult to determine because it is subject to whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, which is not always clear- cut (and Inland Revenue cannot always establish whether a permanent place of abode exists). It also makes administration of the student loan scheme difficult and makes it complicated for borrowers to understand which repayment rules they are subject to. 12 NEW REPAYMENT RULES FOR BORROWERS BASED OVERSEAS (Clauses 9 and 33) Summary of proposed amendments New rules for borrowers based overseas will automatically entitle them to a three-year repayment holiday, and introduce progressive repayment obligations that are based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features The existing Part 3 is being repealed. A new Part 3 (sections 31 to 36A) and a new Part 9 (sections 106 to 111) introduce changes so that borrowers based overseas will automatically be entitled to a three-year repayment holiday. During the holiday they will not have compulsory repayment obligations, although their loan balance will attract interest. If they do not use the full three-year holiday, they will be entitled to use the remainder next time they become an overseas based-borrower. Borrowers can also opt not to make use of the repayment holiday. The other major feature of the new rules for borrowers who are based overseas is the introduction of progressive repayment obligations, which will be based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances, as follows: • $1,000 a year for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $2,000 a year for loan balances of $15,001 – $30,000; and • $3,000 a year for loan balances of over $30,000. The progressive repayment obligations apply to all overseas borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday. Transitional provisions will apply to borrowers who are based overseas as at 1 April 2007: • Borrowers who have been met their student loan repayment requirements will be entitled to a three-year repayment holiday. • Borrowers who have not met repayment requirements and who come within the amnesty on student loan penalties and meet its terms are eligible to apply to Inland Revenue for a three-year repayment holiday once they have met the amnesty’s required repayment behaviour. 13 • Borrowers who have not met repayment requirements and who do not come within the amnesty or who come within the amnesty but fail to meet its terms are entitled to a repayment holiday whose length depends on the time they have been non-resident: – Borrowers who have been non-resident for one year or more but less than two years are eligible for a two-year holiday. – Borrowers who have been non-resident for more than two years but less than three years are eligible for a one-year holiday. – Borrowers who have been non-resident for more than three years are not eligible for a repayment holiday. A repayment holiday ensures that the loan balances of those going overseas short- term will not increase at a punitive rate. The holiday recognises the New Zealand tradition of taking “OE” – and that it may be unrealistic to expect borrowers to make repayments while they are travelling and doing holiday jobs. Background Non-resident repayment obligations were initially designed so that loans would be repaid in a maximum of 15 years. This was achieved by requiring quarterly payments of a fixed amount of the principal (based on the loan balance at the beginning of the tax year following the year of departure), plus the estimated interest for the year. If the loan balance was less than $15,000, $1,000 of principal was required each year. For loans over $15,000, principal of 1/15th of the original loan balance was required. For many borrowers the amount that they are currently expected to pay is simply not achievable. The existing repayment rules are not consistent with the objective of encouraging borrowers to return to New Zealand and are undermining the government’s intent of ensuring that debt levels are commensurate with the benefits borrowers receive from their tertiary study. 14 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY RATE (Clause 17) Summary of proposed amendment The late payment penalty rate will be reduced from 2.0 percent per month to 1.5 percent. Application date The change will apply to amounts subject to a late payment penalty on or after 1 April 2007. Key features Section 44 is being amended to reduce the penalty on overdue amounts to 1.5 percent. Background Any amount not paid by the due date incurs a late payment charge of 2.0 percent. A further 2.0 percent compounding penalty is charged for each subsequent month of default. This is equal to an annual interest rate of 26.82 percent, which is often criticised as being too punitive. 15 HARDSHIP APPLICATIONS (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendments Borrowers who have met their repayments as they fall due during the tax year may be granted relief after the end of the tax year, once the extent to which payment of the full amount of their annual repayment obligation would cause (or has caused) serious hardship is established. Borrowers who anticipate that they will qualify for serious hardship relief may apply to have any payments which fall due during the year reduced, including to zero. However, the extent to which relief for a tax year should be given will not be finally determined until after the end of the year. Application date The change will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Section 54 is being repealed. New sections 55 to 55D clarify that payments of obligations that fall due during a tax year do not preclude a borrower from being granted relief from meeting a repayment obligation. Any amount which has already been paid that exceeds the amount of the repayment obligation determined at the end of the tax year may be refunded. Inland Revenue will be able to reduce any payments which fall due during the year, including reducing them to zero, upon application by a borrower if it considers that the borrower is likely to qualify for hardship relief. However, this will be provisional, and the extent to which hardship relief should be given will be established after the end of the tax year, when all the facts for that year are established. Background New Zealand-based borrowers are required to have repayment deductions made from their salary and wages during the tax year if their primary employment earnings are expected to exceed the repayment threshold. Other New Zealand-based borrowers with an end-of-year liability of more than $1,000 in a year are required to make interim payments (akin to provisional tax) during the following tax year. These payments are credited towards their annual repayment obligation after the end of the tax year. Borrowers based overseas are required to make instalments of their repayment obligation during the tax year. 16 Borrowers may be granted relief from payment of their repayment obligation in cases of serious hardship. (The payment is not written off, but is payable from future obligations.) However, under current law, the repayment obligation cannot be reduced below payments made during the year, and the obligation to make payments due during the year cannot be suspended. 17 INTEREST-FREE LOANS FOR BORROWERS STUDYING OVERSEAS (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will be able to grant interest-free loans to borrowers studying full- time overseas at undergraduate level. At present, they are limited to postgraduates studying overseas. The change does not mean that borrowers will be able to take out a loan for study that is undertaken overseas; rather, it means that any existing loan they had before leaving New Zealand will be interest-free while they are studying. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Section 38AJ is being amended to give Inland Revenue the power to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level an interest-free loan. Undergraduate level will be defined as study that leads to a qualification equivalent to level 7 on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications (bachelor’s degree level). Borrowers will be required to provide proof to Inland Revenue in the form of verification from the National Qualifications Framework that establishes the equivalency of their course. They will also be required to provide Inland Revenue with evidence from their overseas tertiary provider that establishes their full-time enrolment in the undergraduate course. Background Inland Revenue already has the power to grant borrowers studying full-time overseas at postgraduate level an interest-free loan. 18 REMOVAL OF INTEREST WRITE-OFFS FOR BORROWERS INELIGIBLE FOR INTEREST-FREE LOANS (Clauses 16 and 23) Summary of proposed amendments The bill updates the legislation by abolishing interest write-offs for borrowers who are ineligible for interest-free loans. The interest write-offs are being abolished because they are inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans, which is to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Sections 38A to 41 and section 55 are being repealed to abolish the interest write-offs that were in place before the introduction of interest-free loans. They are the full interest write-off for resident borrowers who are studying, the base interest write-off for resident borrowers, the partial base interest write-off for resident borrowers, the interest write-off for non-resident borrowers studying full-time overseas. Background Under current law, borrowers who are overseas for more than six months and who are ineligible for interest-free loans may be eligible for one of the following interest write-offs. Full interest write-off for resident borrowers studying Borrowers who are resident for tax purposes but who are not eligible for an interest- free loan for an entire tax year may be eligible for a full interest write-off for the entire year if they have studied for part of that year. Eligible borrowers who complete their study part-way through the academic year are entitled to a full interest write-off to 31 March the following year. Borrowers receive the write-off even if they have been overseas for most of the year. Base interest write-off for resident borrowers Borrowers who are not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retain their tax residence and who earn below the repayment threshold are eligible to have their base interest written off for up to two years. 19 Partial base interest write-off for resident borrowers Borrowers who are not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retain their tax residence and whose base interest charged is more than half of their repayment obligation are eligible to have the difference written off for up to two years. Interest write-off for non-resident borrowers studying full-time overseas Non-resident borrowers can qualify for a base interest write-off or base interest reduction in certain limited circumstances. Borrowers can qualify for either provision if they have: • renegotiated all or part of their assessed repayment obligation for a year on financial hardship grounds; and • satisfied Inland Revenue that they have been engaged in full-time study overseas and payment of base interest charged during the year in which they were in full-time study would cause serious hardship. 20 INTEREST WRITE-OFFS VALIDATED (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendments Borrowers who had an interest write-off to which they were not entitled, but had repaid their loans by 13 November 2006 will not have the write-off reversed. Application date The amendments will apply from the day after enactment. Key features New section 88 ensures that borrowers whose loan balance was treated by Inland Revenue as being less than or equal to zero on 13 November 2006 and who were given a full interest write-off, a base interest write-off or a partial base interest write- off will have any write-off they received validated. This amendment does not affect any loan obtained on or after 14 November 2006. Background A significant number of borrowers have received interest write-offs to which they were not entitled, and the write-offs would otherwise need to be reversed. 21 Miscellaneous technical amendments 22 23 OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT EXEMPTION (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendments The law on allowing interest-free loans to borrowers who are overseas for more than six months because of the nature of their employment is being strengthened to ensure that their salary or wages are derived in New Zealand. The change is intended to ensure that the interest-free exemption is available only to those who earn employment income from New Zealand. Application date The changes will generally apply from the day after enactment. In the case of applications made for an exemption before enactment, the changes will apply from 1 April 2008. Key features The words “derived from New Zealand” are being inserted into section 38AH(c)(i) of the Act. Background Generally, borrowers who are overseas for more than six months are ineligible for the full interest write-off that gives effect to interest-free student loans. However, Inland Revenue is able to grant an exemption from this rule for borrowers who are overseas because of the nature of their employment. To be eligible for this exemption. borrowers must: • be a tax resident; • have a permanent place of abode only in New Zealand; • provide proof that they receive a “source deduction payment” (as defined in section OB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004); and • provide proof that the majority of absences from New Zealand are because of the borrower’s employment. 24 INTEREST-FREE STUDENT LOANS FOR NEW BORROWERS (Clauses 15 and 29) Summary of proposed amendments Inland Revenue will have the discretion to grant new borrowers a full interest write- off for up 183 days. The full interest write-off gives effect to interest-free student loans. The changes make it possible for new borrowers who have gone overseas briefly during their required 183-day presence to have interest-free loans from the beginning. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2006. Key features New section 38AL will give Inland Revenue the discretion to grant new borrowers a full interest write-off for up to 183 days from the date they first become a borrower. Section 65A is also being amended to allow borrowers to object if Inland Revenue does not grant them an interest write-off. Background For new borrowers to be entitled to an interest-free loan from the start, they must be in New Zealand for 183 consecutive days or more from the day they first draw down a loan. If they travel overseas for 31 days or less during what would otherwise have been a period of 183 consecutive days in New Zealand, the time overseas will be counted as if the borrower had remained in New Zealand. New borrowers who travel overseas for more than 31 days in the 183 days from the day they first become a borrower will not be eligible for the full interest write-off until 183 days after they return to New Zealand (at which point all interest charged from the day they returned to New Zealand would be written off). The diagram gives an example of a borrower who, under current law, would not be eligible for an interest-free loan from the time she first became a borrower. 25 Person who has lived in New Zealand for all of his/her life Student loan drawn down for the first time - the person becomes a "borrower" Borrower not eligible for an interest-free loan Borrower holidays overseas for 6 weeks 1/02/20071/07/200715/08/2007 Borrower eligible for an interest-free loan 183 days from 15/08/07. Once eligible, all interest charged from 15/08/07 written-off Someone who has lived in New Zealand all her life begins studying in the 2007 calendar year, draws down a student loan for the first time on 1 February 2007 and becomes a “borrower”. On 1 July 2007 she goes overseas for a six-week holiday. She has been away from New Zealand for more than 31 days so the time overseas is counted as time overseas. She returns permanently to New Zealand on 15 August 2007. Under the existing legislation, the borrower in the example is not eligible for an interest-free loan from 1 February 2007 because she has not been in New Zealand for 183 consecutive days (including periods of 31 days or less overseas) from the date she became a borrower. She would be eligible for an interest-free loan only after 183 days in New Zealand (from 15 August 2007), despite living in New Zealand, for all intents and purposes, throughout the entire period since becoming a borrower. This problem arises as a consequence of having to deliver interest-free loans by way of an interest write-off. If interest-free loans could be delivered by way of a pure “interest-free” policy, no borrowers would be charged interest unless they were away from New Zealand for at least 184 consecutive days – and the borrower in the preceding example would be eligible for an interest-free loan from 1 February 2007 onwards. A transitional provision in the proposed legislation ensures that the same result is achieved as if interest-free loans could be delivered as pure “interest-free” loans. The discretion will allow Inland Revenue to treat periods when a borrower was overseas for more than 31 days in aggregate as if the borrower had remained in New Zealand (for the six months from when he or she first drew down a loan). Providing Inland Revenue with the discretion to grant an interest write-off needs to apply to the 183 days only from the date someone becomes a borrower. The reason is that once a borrower has become entitled to an interest-free loan, entitlement is lost only when he or she has been out of New Zealand for 184 consecutive days (including in the aggregate periods of 31 days or less in New Zealand). 26 REFUNDS OF OVER-PAYMENTS WHEN ASSESSMENTS ARE REOPENED (Clause 25) Summary of proposed amendments Borrowers will be able to claim a refund, in any tax year, of the difference in assessed student loan repayment obligations when their repayment obligation is reduced as a result of a reassessment. An over-payment is any amount deducted or paid in excess of a borrower’s repayment obligation for a year. Application date The amendment will apply for any tax year. Key features Section 58A(1) is being amended so that if a borrower’s repayment obligation is reduced upon reassessment by Inland Revenue, he or she will be able to claim a refund of the difference in the assessed repayment obligations. The borrower has six months from being notified by Inland Revenue of the difference in the assessed repayment obligations to claim a refund. Background The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2005 introduced changes so that when a borrower’s repayment obligation is reduced upon reassessment for tax years before 1 April 2006 the borrower can claim a refund of the difference in the assessed repayment obligations. The bill extends this provision so it applies for any tax year. 27 APPLICATIONS IN WRITING (Clauses 21 and 23) Summary of proposed amendments The bill removes the requirement that applications for relief from penalties or having to meet a repayment obligation on hardship grounds must, in all circumstances, be made in writing. The change is intended to prevent unnecessary work for both borrowers and Inland Revenue when a written application is not necessary. Application date The change relating to penalties will apply to applications made from the day after enactment and that relating to hardship, from 1 April 2007. Key features The requirement in existing sections 53 and 54 to make a written application is being removed, and Inland Revenue may accept an application by telephone, in writing or by any other manner acceptable to it. Inland Revenue may still require written applications in some circumstances, however. Background Borrowers must currently apply for relief from penalties or from having to meet their repayment obligation on hardship grounds in writing. In many cases, Inland Revenue already holds the information necessary to verify a borrower’s financial position. Requiring a written application can therefore create unnecessary work for both borrowers and Inland Revenue. 28 OTHER TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS The bill makes a number of fairly minor technical amendments intended to update the rules. Charging late payment penalties (Clause 18) A remedial change ensures that amounts which have become overdue, and thus subject to late payment penalties, are not also subject to interest. Interest on student loans is charged under the contract which borrowers enter into with the Crown. A change to the contract in 2005 failed to include the provision, which ensured that interest ceases to be charged once a payment becomes overdue and thus subject to late payment penalties. New section 44B corrects this problem. The change will apply from 1 April 1992, the date the student loan scheme was introduced. Overdue amounts of less than $250 (Clause 22) Section 54 is being amended to allow Inland Revenue to refrain from collecting amounts in arrears of less than $250, since they do not incur late payment penalties and are uneconomical to collect. The amount in question will not be written off but will be payable in a future year. The change will apply to amounts in arrears from the day after enactment. Raising of small balance write-off thresholds (Clauses 20 and 26) The small balance thresholds in section 51 ($5 for borrowers’ end-of-year repayment obligations and underpaid employer repayment deductions) and section 60 ($10 for final loan balances) are being raised to $20. The thresholds allow Inland Revenue to write off amounts that are uneconomical to pursue and have not been increased since the student loan scheme was introduced. The changes will apply from 1 October 2007. Declaration of worldwide income (Clauses 7, 8, 11, 12 and 14) New sections 14A and 38AEA and amendments to sections 15, 38AE and 38AJ provide that borrowers who are New Zealand-based but not resident for tax purposes will be required to declare to Inland Revenue any income that does not have a source in New Zealand. The change is aimed at people who seek an interest-free loan under the exemption for borrowers who are volunteers for charitable organisations overseas or for full-time study overseas. The changes will apply from 1 April 2007. 29 Advising of absence from New Zealand (Clause 10) Borrowers will be required to inform Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, overseas for more than six months, instead of three months, as currently required. Section 37 is being amended accordingly. The changes will apply from 1 April 2007. Transitional provisions repealed (Clauses 31, 34 and 35) The heading to Part 7 and transitional provisions in sections 89 to 102, relating to assessments and repayments for tax years before 1 April 1994, are being repealed because they are now redundant. The changes will apply from 1 April 2007. New section 112 will ensure that Tax Administration Act provisions will continue to have effect. Removal of information match between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education (Clauses 27, 37 to 39) Sections 62(2)(ab) and 62((2AA) and section 85D of the Tax Administration Act are being repealed, and section 307C of the Education Act 1989 and schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1993 are being amended because the information match between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education, to verify borrowers’ study status, is being abolished. This data match is now redundant, given that the full interest write-off for borrowers who are studying is being abolished. Removal of need to set a base interest rate (Clauses 4, 32 and 40) Sections 2 and 87 and the Student Loan Scheme (Interest Rate Formulas) Regulations 2006 are being amended because there is no longer a need to set a base interest rate because of the proposed change to abolish the base interest write-off and partial base interest write-off.
Business Tax Review A discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in July 2006 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington. Business Tax Review: a discussion document. ISBN 0-478-27139-5 FOREWORD The Business Tax Review is a policy priority for the government and a key condition of the Confidence and Supply Agreements with United Future and New Zealand First. This discussion document is a first step in a dialogue on a range of possible business tax initiatives that will help transform the New Zealand economy. The initiatives are designed to enhance productivity and boost New Zealand’s international competitiveness. Company tax reductions would assist all profitable companies and increase our competitiveness with Australia. Productivity gains could also be promoted by supporting innovation, expanding our export base and building a more skilled workforce. Reducing the cost of investing in assets which increase productivity also has a part to play. The amount of tax businesses pay is not the whole story. We can also direct our efforts to reducing compliance costs for small businesses, since compliance costs are a burden borne disproportionately by small businesses – and New Zealand has many small businesses. That would free up time for business owners to concentrate their attention on innovation and growth. We need you, the public, to tell us which measures you believe will best boost New Zealand’s productivity in the future and their relative importance. We also need to hear any other ideas you have that should be explored.

Continued transformation towards an economy that has higher levels of productivity, business investment, innovation and skills is central to the government’s economic policy. Tax policy has an important role to play in support of these objectives. The tax policy initiatives discussed in this document are examples of measures that may further boost New Zealand’s strong economic growth, which has been consistently ahead of the OECD average over the last six years. 1.2 This discussion document is a first step towards engaging with the public on tax reforms that will help transform the New Zealand economy. Its purpose is not only to obtain the public’s views on the initiatives described here, and their relative priorities, but also to elicit suggestions on other initiatives that should be explored. Increasing productivity and competitiveness 1.3 The objective of the Business Tax Review is to provide better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia. This is a policy priority for the government and a key condition of the Confidence and Supply Agreements with United Future and New Zealand First. 1.4 Support for business can be delivered through tax rate reductions, changes to the tax base or compliance cost reduction measures. In recent years the government has focused on changes to the tax base and compliance cost reduction, introducing changes to depreciation, provisional tax and other simplification measures. The Review suggests a reduction in the company tax rate and a range of possible tax base changes and compliance cost reduction initiatives designed to increase competitiveness, productivity and the potential for growth. 1.5 Figure 1 illustrates how business tax affects productivity and competitiveness. Central to this concept is the wide range of ways that businesses can invest in expanding and improving their performance – including investment in depreciable assets, investment in intangibles and innovation, risk-taking and entrepreneurship, and investment in staff. Tax rates influence investment in all these areas, by affecting the return to investments. 2 1.6 The design of the tax base can also affect all these investments, but is usually focused on particular investments. For example, changes to depreciation affect investment in depreciable assets and changes to the tax treatment of R&D primarily affect innovation. Tax compliance affects all investments directly by increasing the costs of doing business and indirectly by consuming scarce management resources. In turn, these investments all influence labour productivity and competitiveness. 1.7 Business investment in plant and equipment will make labour more productive and enable workers to earn higher wages. It is also important to highlight the role of human capital: tax policy changes that increase skills will also add to labour productivity and growth. Figure 1. Tax linkages to productivity and competitiveness What can be spent? 1.8 The government’s fiscal strategy has delivered prudent fiscal management over the past six years. Its revenue strategy contributes to this by seeking to maintain the tax to gross domestic product ratio at around current levels. As indicated in the recent Budget, the government faces very tight fiscal constraints over the next few years. Nevertheless, there may be some fiscal headroom for tax changes proposed in the Review.

Priorities must be established and choices made to ensure that any measures advanced represent the best value in light of the objectives of the Review. The government seeks feedback on the relative merits of the initiatives presented in this document in relation to those objectives. Not all the initiatives can be progressed, and informed trade-offs will have to be made. Pressures on New Zealand’s tax system 1.10 New Zealand’s tax system currently faces a number of pressures. As figure 2 illustrates, over the last 20 years there has been a downward trend in statutory company tax rates in OECD countries. The same downward trend is also evident in other countries. Figure 2. NZ and OECD average corporate tax rates 1 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 New ZealandOECD (unweighted)OECD (GDP weighted) 1.11 A company tax rate higher than those of our trading and investment partners puts pressure on the New Zealand tax system because it creates incentives to stream profits to countries that have lower tax rates. In particular, maintaining a competitive tax rate is important in relation to Australia, which has a 30 percent company tax rate, since almost half of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is Australian. 1.12 Other economic costs arise from a higher company tax rate. Higher company taxes in New Zealand create an incentive for New Zealand companies to relocate or be established elsewhere. They also discourage internationally mobile firms from locating their businesses in New Zealand. 1 Source: OECD and Institute of Fiscal Studies. 4 1.13 Statutory corporate rates are not the whole story, however. Many countries have other taxes that can impinge on productivity and competitiveness. New Zealand could afford a lower statutory company rate if some of these other taxes were adopted, but this need not benefit New Zealand. For example, Australia has a comprehensive capital gains tax, state payroll taxes and a number of stamp duties. The last include duties on property sales, mortgage registration and transfer of securities. Moreover, New Zealand, like Australia, has a full imputation scheme. Many other countries impose higher taxes on dividend payments than New Zealand does. Figure 3 illustrates the contribution other taxes make to tax revenues around the world. Figure 3.

The government is committed to a fair distribution of the tax burden, reflecting the ability to pay of different individuals. • Efficiency. The tax system should not distort private decision-making. Under an efficient tax system, resources flow to the most productive areas, which will enhance productivity and growth. Exemptions and concessions should be considered in the context of the full range of policy options and accepted only when the benefits for New Zealand can be shown to outweigh the costs. • Simplicity. Measures with low compliance and administrative costs are to be preferred as long as they are consistent with other objectives. • Integrity. The government supports a robust tax system in which people pay their intended rates of tax and appropriate tax revenues can be obtained to fund government programmes. Deep company tax cuts 1.16 The Review has also considered deep company tax cuts. However, total tax revenues raised need to be sufficient to support high quality government services. That means that deep rate cuts are not an option by themselves. Some other countries have a significantly lower company rate but they will also typically have other taxes. A payroll tax has been considered as a possible replacement revenue source. After careful analysis, the government is not convinced that this would be an effective means of achieving its objectives, and the option has not been developed further. The difficulties with this approach are discussed in chapter 4. Summary of possible initiatives 1.17 A summary of the possible initiatives presented in the discussion document, together with an indicative fiscal cost when it is available, is provided below. As is standard practice, all fiscal costs are reported on a static basis so that any behavioural changes are ignored. To the extent that these measures enhance growth, static costings will tend to overstate costs. Any revenue raised as a result of the possible initiatives would be available to fund other productivity-enhancing measures. 6 POSSIBLE INITIATIVES Para Ref Description Cost per year ($m) Tax rate measures 2.7 Reduction in the company tax rate to 30% (from 33%) 540 Tax base measures 3.8 – 3.26 Targeted tax credits for • R&D activities, • export market development activities, and • skills improvement 45 to 350 Uncosted Uncosted 3.27 – 3.28 Deferral of losses from significant upfront expenditure (extension to Budget 2005 R&D measures) to allow losses to carry through a shareholder change Uncosted 3.29 – 3.35 Deduction for other “blackhole” expenditure, such as losses on buildings 150 to 300 3.37 – 3.40 Increased depreciation loading on new assets to: • 30% • 40% 120\* 230\* 3.41 – 3.42 Reduced depreciation loading on new assets to: • 10% • 0% (120)\* (250)\* 3.43 Aligning depreciation loading at 20 percent on new and second- hand assets 90\* Tax compliance measures 3.46 – 3.47 Increasing low value asset write-off threshold (figures given for increase from $500 to $1,000) 170\* 3.48 – 3.50 Reducing compliance costs for assets that reach a low depreciated value (say, $100) Uncertain 3.51 Increasing the threshold for taxpayers allowed to submit an annual FBT return 0\*\* \* These are average costs over the first five years. The cost of depreciation changes is a matter of timing, and no allowance is made for reduced depreciation outside the five-year period. \*\* While there should be no difference in aggregate tax collections in any fiscal year, there will be a time-value of money cost. 7 When will the changes take place? 1.18 If any of the measures were to be enacted, the application date would be from the 2008/09 year, subject to this being administratively and fiscally feasible. How to make a submission 1.19 The government invites submissions on the relative merits of the initiatives presented, having regard to the revenue and resource constraints and tax policy principles discussed earlier. The government also welcomes submissions on any similar measures that meet the objectives of the Review. Those who make submissions are asked to prioritise between these initiatives. 1.20 Submissions should be made by 8 September 2006 and be addressed to: Business Tax Review C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Business Tax Review” in the subject line. 1.21 There is a very tight reporting timeframe and extensions to the 8 September deadline are not feasible. Late submissions cannot be considered. 1.22 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact those making submissions and to discuss their submission, if required. 1.23 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 8 Chapter 2 COMPANY TAX RATE REDUCTION 2.1 This chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 percent, which would align our company tax rate with that of Australia. 2.2 An important consideration for the government is how New Zealand-owned businesses would benefit from a tax rate reduction. The changes considered in the next two chapters would affect different businesses differently. For example, reducing the company rate alone would benefit only profitable businesses that choose to operate as companies, while the tax base and compliance cost measures would benefit both companies and unincorporated enterprises. 2.3 An important question is how best to promote productivity and competitiveness. The extent to which businesses become more dynamic and innovative as a result of the possible initiatives may be influenced by other factors such as their profitability, ownership and size. Some sectors of the economy – for example, finance and insurance, mining and electricity, gas and water – are relatively more profitable than others, and would benefit more from company rate reductions. Thus the impact of company rate reductions on productivity will depend on how companies in these sectors respond: for example, whether they choose to innovate and invest more in New Zealand.

It highlights that the largest businesses in many industries are majority foreign- owned, while co-operatives and government-owned businesses are also important in some industries. This may be important, if ownership affects the ways that businesses respond to changes in the company tax rate, and other business tax changes. 2.5 The tax base and compliance measures would be likely to benefit different sectors and different types of businesses. An R&D tax credit, for example, would favour entities with increasing levels of R&D and innovative businesses that make losses in their early years. 2.6 Compliance cost measures may often benefit smaller firms which have limited scope to absorb such costs. Although New Zealand is itself a small country, the proportion of small firms (those with less than 20 employees) is within the OECD average, so compliance cost measures should not be given special consideration on this ground alone. Reducing the company tax rate 2.7 To reduce New Zealand’s company tax rate to 30 percent, and so align it with the Australian company rate, would have a cost of $540 million a year. 2.8 Reductions in the company tax rate would improve New Zealand’s productivity and growth in a number of ways. 2.9 Most business activity in New Zealand is undertaken by companies. Reducing New Zealand’s company tax rate would boost the competitiveness of New Zealand-based companies. It would encourage increased inbound investment by firms that have decided to locate in New Zealand. As a result, it would tend to increase New Zealand’s stock of plant, equipment and buildings which would, in turn, boost labour productivity and wage rates. 2.10 It is not possible to measure and tax economic income perfectly, so income taxes will inevitably distort investment decisions and impede corporate capital from flowing to its most productive uses. A reduced company tax rate would boost capital productivity by reducing these distortions. 2.11 Reducing New Zealand’s company rate would also reduce incentives for firms to stream profits away from New Zealand. Profits can be diverted from New Zealand by way of artificially low sales prices or excessive interest deductions, for example. 2.12 Reducing the company tax rate also has a number of disadvantages. There is growing evidence that the gap between the company and top personal tax rates causes pressures on the integrity of the personal tax system. At present, both companies and trusts are taxed at a rate of 33 percent, while the top personal marginal rate is 39 percent. This gap provides incentives for companies and trusts to be used to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax, so reducing the company tax rate would increase these incentives even further. 10 2.13 For companies, the tax-sheltering benefits are generally a matter of timing only because the imputation system ensures that profits are taxed at the marginal tax rates of shareholders when they are ultimately distributed as dividends. Thus substantial benefits are available only if funds are sheltered in the company for a long period of time. 2.14 For trusts, the tax-sheltering benefits are permanent because income that is taxed as trustee income at a final rate of tax of 33 percent can be distributed to beneficiaries in the future without any further personal tax. There appears to have been growth in tax sheltering between 1998/99 and 2003/04. 3 2.15 Many countries have larger differences between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal rate than New Zealand has. At first glance, it might seem that a moderate reduction in the company rate to 30 percent should not create greater problems for New Zealand than those faced in many other countries. However, other countries also have features in their tax systems which help to protect them from exploitation of the difference between tax rates. 2.16 Another disadvantage of a company rate cut is that, by itself, it would not ensure that the benefits of the cut were passed through to New Zealand- resident shareholders. The incentive to invest in domestic companies is increased only to the extent that income is retained in the company. 2.17 Finally, cutting the company tax rate would be of benefit only to businesses operating as companies, and many businesses are not incorporated. For example, some businesses may efficiently operate as unincorporated sole proprietorships or as partnerships of individuals. Other tax rate initiatives pursued outside the business tax review 2.18 The government acknowledges that company tax rate changes may have implications for the design of the wider income tax system. For example, briefing papers to the Minister of Revenue discussed proposals which would combine a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 percent, with a corresponding reduction of the top personal marginal tax rate to 36 per cent and an increase in the trustee rate to 36 percent. 2.19 Changes to the system of personal income taxation or to the taxation of trusts, however, are outside the scope of the Business Tax Review. Any changes in those areas will need to be considered within the context of the overall personal tax regime and have regard to the revenue constraints and tax policy principles discussed in chapter 1. 3 For example, tax paid by trusts grew by 105 percent, tax paid by companies grew by 71 percent, and tax paid by individuals other than salary and wage-earners grew by 16 percent over this time. Over the same period trustee income (taxed at a 33 percent rate) grew by 256 percent, whereas beneficiaries’ income (taxed at the rate of beneficiaries) grew by only 28 percent. Changes to the minor beneficiaries rule may account for a little of this large growth in trustee income. 11 The consequences for savings vehicles 2.20 Individuals can save directly or they can save through a number of savings vehicles. If there were to be a reduction in the company tax rate, the consequences for savings vehicles would need to be considered. Savings vehicles include the proposed portfolio investment entities (PIEs); superannuation funds; unit trusts and group investment funds; investment companies; and life insurance companies. 2.21 The tax treatment of these entities is as follows: • Under the rules proposed in the taxation bill currently before Parliament, income from portfolio investment entities will be taxed on a flow-through basis at investors’ marginal rates, capped at 33 percent. • Superannuation funds are taxed at the trustee rate of 33 percent. • Unit trusts and certain group investment funds are taxed as companies at a rate of 33 percent. If a unit trust distributes its profits, full imputation operates, and the income ends up being taxed at the marginal tax rates of resident shareholders. However, many unit trusts do not distribute profits, instead accumulating earnings within the trust, and members who want to leave the fund can sell their interests to the fund manager. When that happens, the company tax rate on the unit trust will generally be a final tax provided units are held on capital account. • Investment companies are taxed as companies, dividend payouts are subject to the imputation system, and sales of shares on the open market are often treated as capital gains. • The policyholder base of life insurance companies is taxed at a rate of 33 percent. 2.22 If the company tax rate were reduced, the government would need to consider how best to tax these different savings vehicles. In principle, it would be desirable for income to flow through and be taxed at the marginal rates of the ultimate beneficiaries of the income, although that would not always be feasible. For example, in the case of investment companies with multiple classes of shares or with both shares and options, it would not be clear who the ultimate beneficiaries were. It would also appear to be inconsistent with the proposed tax treatment of PIEs. 2.23 Investing through a savings vehicle has both costs and benefits. Costs include management fees, while benefits include the ability to diversify risks. As much as possible, it is desirable that taxes do not bias decisions on how to invest or on which type of savings vehicle to invest through. 12 2.24 If the company tax rate were to be reduced, there would appear to be two viable options for the taxation of savings vehicles: • taxing all savings vehicles at the new company tax rate; or • continuing to tax all (or most) savings vehicles at a 33 percent tax rate. 2.25 Although a lower rate on savings vehicles appears attractive, there is an obvious concern with taxing all savings vehicles at the new company tax rate. Reducing the company rate only would increase the bias against direct investment for individuals on the top marginal tax rate, and it would similarly distort the decisions for individuals on the 33 percent marginal rate. 2.26 Moreover, over the longer term, if international pressures were to lead to further reductions in company tax rates, there would be a growing divergence between the tax rates applying to similar types of personal income, depending upon how the underlying assets were held. 2.27 Continuing to tax all (or most) savings vehicles at the 33 percent rate would mean that superannuation funds, group investment funds and unit trusts would no longer be taxed at the same rate as companies. This would not increase the bias in favour of such vehicles for taxpayers on the top marginal rate. Arguably, it would increase fairness because top marginal rate taxpayers investing through PIEs would bear a closer tax burden to that of direct investors. However, it would reduce the attractiveness of KiwiSaver relative to direct investment for taxpayers on the top personal marginal rate. The transition 2.28 Any change in company tax rates would give rise to a number of transitional and consequential issues, although the preference is not to take any measures in this area unless there is a good case to do so. In particular, any company rate changes would require consideration of consequential changes to the areas of provisional tax, imputation, resident withholding tax and a number of the international tax rules. 13 Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters in particular: Tax rate changes ● The desirability and priority of a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 percent. Savings vehicles ● The most appropriate tax treatment of savings vehicles if there were to be a reduction in the company rate. ● Whether there are viable ways of including investment companies in the set of savings vehicles if the company tax rate were to be reduced and the treatment of savings vehicles remained unchanged. 14 Chapter 3 TAX BASE AND COMPLIANCE COST MEASURES 3.1 Productivity and competitiveness may also be fostered by changes in the company tax base and by reducing compliance costs, building on the achievements of Budget 2005’s business tax package. Some of these changes are likely to come at a fiscal cost, which would have to be taken into account when prioritising their importance relative to each other and to tax rate changes. Other changes may raise revenue that could be used to provide scope for reductions in tax rates or other tax base or compliance cost initiatives. 3.2 With company rate cuts, much of the benefit may flow to highly profitable, foreign-owned firms, without necessarily doing much to boost competitiveness and productivity. Some of the tax base initiatives discussed in this chapter may be better targeted at doing that. 3.3 The tax base and compliance cost initiatives discussed in this chapter would benefit both companies and unincorporated enterprises. Compliance cost measures may often benefit smaller firms, for which these costs may be high relative to income. 3.4 Tax base changes would tend to benefit specific types of firms. For example, increasing depreciation rates would most benefit capital-intensive firms or an incentive for export market development would benefit firms breaking into new export markets. 3.5 The examples of tax base and compliance cost initiatives described in this chapter are not intended to be an exhaustive list of possible measures. The public and tax professionals are invited to suggest similar base and compliance initiatives that promote productivity and competitiveness. 3.6 The examples discussed in this chapter are grouped under two themes: • improving productivity, business investment, innovation and competitiveness through tax base initiatives; and • improving productivity by reducing compliance burdens. Tax base initiatives 3.7 A number of tax base initiatives could improve productivity, business investment, innovation and competitiveness. Several examples are described here. 15 Targeted tax credits 3.8 Although it is generally undesirable to favour some business activities over others, tax concessions for a particular activity may be justified when: • there is under-investment by business in an activity because the investing firm does not capture all of the benefits of the investment – the investment results in wider benefits to New Zealand; and • the government can intervene effectively, with the benefits of the intervention outweighing the costs; and • delivery of assistance through the tax system is the most efficient mechanism to provide that support. 3.9 The government considers that there are wider benefits to New Zealand when businesses invest in R&D, export market development and enhancing skills in the workforce. It therefore currently provides support by way of various grant programmes to encourage business investment in those areas. 3.10 These activities could be further supported by way of tax concessions, and, in relation to R&D at least, there is evidence that tax credits can be a more effective way of supporting these activities than discretionary assistance. In relation to R&D, this would bring New Zealand into line with other OECD countries, three-quarters of which provide non-discretionary support for R&D through the tax system. (Support through the tax system for export market development and skills development is less common.) 3.11 A government objective in designing the concessions is to reduce to a minimum the bureaucracy that can accompany such measures. There are several key design issues: the definition of “eligible expenditure”; approval of expenditure; whether the support is incremental or volume-based; the level of assistance; and the delivery mechanism. Definition of “eligible expenditure” 3.12 A clear and objective definition of the relevant expenditure is critical for the workability and integrity of a tax credit mechanism. The challenge is to have definitions that are sufficiently broad to capture expenditure that generates wider benefits, but are sufficiently precise to be clear and workable. These definitions would need to cover businesses’ own expenditure and their expenditure on activities delivered by external providers. 3.13 For R&D, there are numerous precedents in New Zealand and overseas which could be used. The definitions currently used in the Income Tax Act are based on accounting standards set out in Financial Reporting Standard 13. The system of discretionary grants administered by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology uses a definition which summarises the Frascati manual (an OECD manual written to assist in the collection and issue of R&D data). 16 3.14 In relation to enhancing skills, there is less guidance. A range of definitions is possible, from the narrow – for example, foundation numeracy, literacy and language skills – through to broader definitions that include, for example, trade and technical skills that are not firm-specific. 4 There could also be an overriding requirement that courses be externally provided, NZQA-approved and provided to employees who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. 3.15 The current discretionary grant programme for assisting export market development has a definition of “eligible expenditure” that includes market visits, in-market representation, advertising and promotion, marketing materials, market research, and trade fairs. At its broadest, the initiative could target the same expenditure. Alternatively, it could apply to a more limited range of this activity. There could also be overriding requirements that businesses receiving the tax credits are below a certain size (e.g. a turnover of less than $50 million), that the market development is not business as usual (e.g. involves taking new products to new markets), and that the businesses can only receive a limited amount of tax credit in any one year or in total (e.g. $100,000 in one year and $500,000 as a lifetime total). Approval of expenditure 3.16 In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, those wishing to take advantage of tax concessions must first register or apply to a board for approval of their expenditure. This would be an option in New Zealand, although the government would prefer to minimise the bureaucracy this involves while still adequately monitoring the type of expenditure to which the concessions apply. 3.17 The preference, therefore, would be for selective audit of the expenditure (by an expert body, perhaps in conjunction with Inland Revenue) after it has been incurred. If this approach were adopted, it might also be possible for people to seek pre-approval from the expert body to increase certainty that the expenditure was eligible. Incremental vs volume-based subsidy 3.18 The tax credit could be designed using an incremental or a volume-based approach. A volume-based credit provides tax relief in proportion to the total volume of eligible expenditure in each year. An incremental credit provides tax relief in proportion to the increase in the volume of eligible expenditure above a base. 3.19 There are advantages and disadvantages with both schemes. A volume-based scheme is less complex to design and administer – tax relief can be calculated at the level of individual companies, rather than groups, and is neutral as to when the expenditure is incurred. 4 The evidence suggests there is under-investment in the development of generic skills that are easily transferred from one employer to another. Firm-specific training - in skills that are not transferable - does not suffer from the same problems. 17 3.20 An incremental scheme targets relief on new investment in R&D, market development and enhancing skills, and offers the same rate of relief for a lower cost. It seeks to avoid subsidising activity that would have occurred in the absence of the tax credit. However, it is more complex and more prone to tax planning. Ascertaining base year expenditure may also at times be difficult. 3.21 The government preference would be for an incremental approach, from a base year of 2004/05. Level of support 3.22 International evidence around the level of assistance for R&D indicates that the effectiveness of government support for business R&D declines at levels beyond 14 percent of the R&D, though the optimal rate of support will vary across countries depending on their particular characteristics – such as size and industrial composition of businesses. 3.23 The government proposes a tax credit of between 7 to 15 percent for expenditure on all three types of activity – that is, each $100 of expenditure could generate a refundable tax credit or cash refund of $7 to $15. Based on a 33 percent tax rate, this is equivalent to allowing a deduction for 121 percent to 145 percent of eligible expenditure. These rates of support are consistent with those provided by R&D tax credits in most OECD countries. It would be reasonable to assume that a similar level of support should apply to market development and skills enhancement. 3.24 The preliminary estimated fiscal cost for this level of support to R&D is: • for 7 percent to 15 percent support on an incremental basis, $45 to $90 million a year rising to $140 to $230 million a year after four years; • for 7 percent to 15 percent support for a volume-based credit from $100 to $210 million a year rising to $200 to $350 million a year after four years. 3.25 It is not possible to cost reliably such support for export market development and skills training – this will depend to a greater extent on the detailed design and scope of eligible expenditure. Delivery mechanism 3.26 Ideally, the delivery mechanism would ensure that the tax credits are available to entities in a loss position and to those exempt from tax. The credits should also retain their value for non-resident owners of New Zealand businesses and not be clawed back by other parts of the tax system – that is, should not lower the imputation credits available when dividends are paid. The government is considering whether a refundable tax credit will achieve this. 18 Deferral of losses from significant and upfront expenditure 3.27 Encouraging productive investment in the economy is a priority for the government. This was highlighted in the Budget 2005 measure allowing firms to defer claiming deductions for expenditure on R&D. Previously, firms found that tax deductions for R&D could effectively be lost. That happened when there was a breach of loss continuity as a result of bringing in substantial amounts of capital from new shareholders to commercialise and exploit their successful R&D activities. 3.28 It would be possible to extend this measure to a wider set of expenses to encourage productive investment. Doing so would ensure that early deductions which might normally be expected to promote investment did not inhibit a growing business from taking advantage of those deductions. Similar expenditure might include petroleum exploration and development or forestry. In examining possible areas for the extension of this treatment, the underlying policy intent of the continuity of ownership rules – to prevent the trading of losses – must be kept in mind. Deductions for “blackhole” expenditure 3.29 “Blackhole” expenditure is expenditure that proves worthless, or leads to an asset which falls in value over time, and is neither immediately deductible nor amortisable. The government is looking at the problem on a case-by- case basis and has recently provided for the deductibility of patent and Resource Management Act application expenses. A number of taxpayers have raised concerns around specific examples of blackhole expenditure. 3.30 Dealing with these concerns would give taxpayers certainty that particular expenditure incurred for their businesses would benefit from tax deductions or amortisation. It would also ensure neutrality in the tax system and would not discourage taxpayers from undertaking certain types of expenditure and investment solely because of their tax treatment. 3.31 An example of blackhole expenditure is the lack of deduction for losses on the sale or demolition of a building. A loss incurred on the involuntary destruction of a building is now deductible, but the more general problem has been deferred for more careful consideration. 3.32 There can be a concern with allowing deductions for losses on assets, such as buildings, that combine price volatility with slow depreciation. Allowing a deduction for a loss in value when a gain would not generally be assessable appears anomalous in these circumstances. 3.33 A further concern is the potential for abuse. Taxpayers acquiring property with a view to demolishing and replacing an existing building may seek to attribute much of the value of the property to the building rather than the land. While this may be limited by professional valuations, there is considerable variability and uncertainty in the valuation process. 19 3.34 If allowing a deduction for losses on buildings were to lead to .5 to 1 percent of the depreciated value of the building stock being written off in any year, it would have a fiscal cost of $150 million to $300 million a year. 3.35 Another example of blackhole expenditure is the cost of certain feasibility studies. Allowing such expenditure to be deducted or amortised would clearly have a fiscal cost, though it is not possible to estimate it with any accuracy. Adjusting depreciation loading for new assets 3.36 There are two possible directions for adjustments to depreciation loadings: • increasing the loading from 20 percent to 30 percent or 40 percent; or • reducing the loading to 10 percent or to 0 percent, with the revenue gained to be used to fund other measures. Increasing depreciation loadings 3.37 Inflation produces a tax bias that favours investment in longer-lived assets relative to shorter-lived assets. Allowing depreciation loading is a relatively simple way of reducing this bias. 3.38 Accelerated depreciation reduces the cost of capital goods for taxation purposes and promotes investment. By itself, such a policy is likely to lead to capital deepening and add to labour productivity, which in turn is likely to increase GDP growth. New Zealand currently allows a loading of 20 percent to be added to the depreciation rate for most new assets. One option is to increase the loading to 30 percent or 40 percent, to reduce further the cost of capital goods and promote investment. 3.39 Increasing the loading, however, would increase the extent to which risk- adjusted returns for some investments fall short of their actual cost. Encouraging investment that is not profitable, in the absence of tax, would tend to reduce national welfare, as the cost of financing the investment more than offsets the increased level of production. 3.40 The fiscal cost of increasing the loading has been estimated (excluding buildings) at: Year 1 2 3 4 5 30% depreciation loading (cost) $50m $110m $130m $140m $150m 40% depreciation loading (cost) $90 $220m $260m $280m $280m 20 Decreasing depreciation loadings 3.41 An alternative option would be to reduce or remove the loading. This would raise revenue that could be made available for funding cuts in tax rates or other tax changes. Australia partly funded its company tax rate cut by removing accelerated depreciation. 3.42 The revenue gained from such a measure has been estimated at: Year 1 2 3 4 5 0% depreciation loading $90m $230m $290m $320m $330m 10% depreciation loading $50m $110m $140m $150m $160m Aligning depreciation loading on new and second-hand assets 3.43 Depreciation loading does not apply to second-hand assets. If the loading is retained for new assets, it can provide a bias against firms acquiring second- hand assets. That can lower productivity by standing in the way of assets being acquired by their best users. The estimated fiscal costs of extending the current 20 percent loading to second-hand assets are set out below. Year 1 2 3 4 5 $30m $90m $110m $115m $110m Improving productivity by reducing tax compliance burdens 3.44 Tax compliance activities impose burdens on business by consuming funds and time. Reducing these burdens would allow business owners to focus more on business operations than compliance issues, and contribute to the improved productivity and growth potential of their businesses and, consequently, the economy. Over recent years the government has made a commitment to reducing tax compliance costs, and a number of the pressing and soluble compliance problems have already been dealt with. 3.45 Even so, the government is continually looking for ways to improve upon what has already been achieved. The initiatives discussed in the remainder of this chapter are examples of threshold adjustments. Increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold 3.46 The threshold below which low-value assets can be expensed immediately, rather than being capitalised and depreciated, was raised in Budget 2005 from $200 to $500. 21 3.47 Further raising this threshold is likely to lower compliance costs even further. The recent rise in the threshold was welcomed by taxpayers and tax professionals alike, although there was some indication that the government should go further. However, to do so would mean that benefits would accrue disproportionately towards firms which have relatively high levels of assets falling below the threshold, and would come at a high fiscal cost. The estimated fiscal costs of raising the threshold to $1,000 are set out below. Year 1 2 3 4 5 $270m $220m $170m $120m $70m Assets that reach a low depreciated value 3.48 Another compliance concern that has been raised is the large number of assets on depreciation registers that have been depreciated to a low level. Options to deal with this concern include: • allowing assets to be written off once they reach a particular tax book value; • allowing assets to be moved into a simplified pooling system – for example, allowing them to be depreciated in a single pool or a limited number of pools, regardless of their depreciation rate; or • reducing the technical constraint that such assets must still be in use or available for use while they continue to be depreciated. 3.49 The first two of these measures could provide significant tax savings to firms, while the third may not. It should be noted, however, that to the extent there are costs of removing assets from asset schedules, these first two options may in some instances increase compliance costs. 3.50 Fiscal costs of any changes in this area clearly depend on the option adopted. It is not possible to cost reliably any of these options at this time. However, the first option’s costs will be significantly higher in the first year than in subsequent years. Fringe benefit tax threshold 3.51 At present, employers whose deductions of PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax do not exceed $100,000 can file fringe benefit tax returns annually. One option, for example, would be to raise this threshold to $250,000, which would generally mean that only firms with more than 10 to 20 employees would need to file returns quarterly. This would not be expected to change aggregate tax collections in any fiscal year, but would have a time-value of money cost of approximately $4 million a year. 22 Other relevant initiatives pursued outside the Business Tax Review 3.52 This discussion document does not deal with two important measures that are currently being worked on. The first relates to the examination of New Zealand’s international tax rules and, in particular, the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. It will involve analysis of whether New Zealand should modify its treatment of CFC income and whether there are measures which could reduce tax compliance costs for CFCs. The work will also consider other parts of the system such as non-resident withholding tax rates, the thin capitalisation rules, foreign dividend withholding payments and the conduit relief rules. A discussion document on these matters will be released later this year. 3.53 Work is also under way on a review of tax penalties aimed at increasing voluntary compliance. A discussion document on this issue will also be released this year. Submission points The government invites those making submissions to rank initiatives (including their own), given the likely fiscal costs and effect on productivity and competitiveness. Having more expensive initiatives means that fewer could be implemented – see the summary of initiatives on page 6 for comparative fiscal costs. It would also be useful to know the advantages and disadvantages of the various initiatives from the perspective of those making submissions. Submissions are specifically sought on: Targeted tax credits • the desirability and priority of introducing tax incentives for eligible expenditure on R&D, export market development and skills; • the definitions of “eligible expenditure”; • whether the tax credits should be volume-based or incremental in design; and • how the tax credits should be delivered by Inland Revenue, having regard to the criteria set out in paragraph 3.26. Deferral of losses from significant expenditure The types of expenditure which should be included in any changes in this area. “Blackhole” expenditure The types of blackhole expenditure (apart from losses on buildings and feasibility studies) that should be considered. Tax compliance The key compliance concerns that should be considered. 23 Chapter 4 OTHER INITIATIVES CONSIDERED AND REJECTED 4.1 In the course of the Business Tax Review, more radical options such as deep company rate cuts have been considered. Deep company rate cuts would require a replacement revenue source, for which a payroll tax has been considered. Payroll taxes are levied in many other countries and can raise substantial amounts of revenue. The government is not willing to countenance an increase in the rate of GST as a method of funding a deep cut in the company rate. The simple reason is that high-income households save a greater proportion of disposable income than do low-income households, so an increase in the rate of GST falls disproportionately on the latter. 4.2 After a thorough consideration of these possibilities, the government has decided against deep company rate cuts because of the revenue cost, concerns about the desirability of a payroll tax and the significant integrity problems that would need to be resolved. A payroll tax, while having some attractions in principle, is much less attractive in practice. Deep company rate cuts 4.3 Deep company rate cuts have attractions as a means of enhancing productivity and competitiveness by allowing firms greater scope for retaining funds for reinvestment. 4.4 On the other hand, deep company rate cuts can be extremely expensive. Without an alternative revenue source, the government could no longer afford to provide the high quality of services that New Zealanders demand. 4.5 Moreover, by themselves, any company rate cuts would increase the gap between the company tax rate and higher rates of personal tax. This would magnify a number of concerns, including tax base integrity pressures, inconsistencies with other parts of the tax system, the impact on savings vehicles and concerns that much of the benefit may flow to large, foreign- owned firms. 4.6 As discussed in chapter 2, there is evidence that the current gap between the top personal marginal rate of 39 percent and the 33 percent company and trustee tax rates is already placing pressure on the integrity of the personal tax system. Deep company rate cuts would add to these pressures. 24 4.7 Full imputation would give rise to inconsistencies if deep company tax rate cuts were introduced. Deep cuts would provide a permanent benefit to companies owned by non-residents or domestic non-taxpayers but, generally, only a timing benefit to companies owned by domestic taxpayers. For companies owned by non-residents or by domestic non-taxpayers, the company tax is a final tax. For companies owned by domestic taxpayers, however, it is a withholding tax only, with a final wash-up tax when dividends are paid. For companies owned by domestic taxpayers, there is an apparent inconsistency in reducing the company tax rate but clawing it back when dividends are paid. 4.8 By itself, a deep company rate cut would not benefit all businesses. It would benefit only those structured as companies. 4.9 Again, the impact on savings vehicles is a concern. As discussed earlier, in the context of a moderate cut in the company rate to 30 percent, there would be concerns about how best to tax PIEs and other savings vehicles. These concerns would be magnified if deep cuts in company tax rates were introduced. 4.10 If there were to be a deep company rate cut, the question arises as to what, if any, other measures should accompany it. There are three broad options: • reduce significantly personal tax rates at the same time as a reduction in the company rate; • move to a model with a low company tax rate aligned with a low rate on capital income more generally, with rules differentiating labour income from capital income, as in Nordic countries; or • move to a model which has a low company tax rate on business income only, with a number of provisions to ensure investment income is taxed at marginal personal rates, as in Ireland. 4.11 Either of the first two approaches would, at least in principle, be ways of allowing for deep company rate cuts without compounding existing misalignment problems. 4.12 Reducing personal tax rates significantly together with company tax rates would come with a large fiscal cost and require a substantial alternative revenue source. Unless there is a viable revenue source that is more efficient than the current income base, this is unlikely to promote productivity and growth. An alternative, which would also avoid exacerbating misalignment problems, would be to reduce only the top two marginal rates – the 39 and 33 percent marginal rates – in line with the cut in the company rate. This would, however, make the tax system less progressive. 25 4.13 Pursuing the Nordic or dual rate approach would involve cutting personal rates only on capital income. Although this would be less costly than cutting personal tax rates on all income and would potentially make deeper company rate cuts more viable, it would require systematically differentiating between labour and capital income. That would introduce considerable complexity, and the costs of this approach are likely to outweigh its benefits. Fairness concerns also arise, since investment income is heavily concentrated in the hands of higher income individuals. 4.14 Either of these measures would be comprehensive approaches to resolving the misalignment problem. An alternative approach is to provide deep company tax rates but to put in place specific anti-avoidance measures to help counteract the pressures a deep company rate cut would create. This is essentially the Irish approach. 4.15 On balance, the government does not believe that these measures are likely to lead to an improvement in New Zealand’s tax system. 4.16 A final consideration which weighs against any deep company rate cut option is that many large corporate taxpayers are foreign-owned firms with very high levels of profit from their New Zealand operations. Deep cuts in the company rate may be of benefit to foreign shareholders without necessarily doing very much to promote additional investment by these firms. In this case, to the extent that replacement taxes are borne by New Zealand residents, deep company rate cuts may make New Zealand worse off. 4.17 For all these reasons, the government is not convinced that deep company rate cuts would be an effective way for it to achieve its objectives. Payroll tax 4.18 Many countries rely on payroll taxes to raise revenues. Often payroll taxes are used to fund social security contributions, but in Australia payroll taxes are the principal state tax base. Australia also has a federal superannuation levy which requires employers to make contributions to the superannuation funds of employees. One way of funding deep company rate cuts would be for New Zealand also to introduce a payroll tax. 4.19 There are a number of different possible payroll tax bases. They include payrolls of: • companies only; • all employers; or • all employers plus the labour income of the self-employed. 26 4.20 In principle, a broad-based payroll tax on all employers plus the labour income of the self-employed along the lines of the current ACC base might appear a relatively neutral way of raising revenue to fund a deep company rate cut. However, it would be more problematic to levy any general payroll tax on this base. In practice, the current ACC base for the self-employed carves out passive investment income such as interest and dividends, which is appropriate if the aim is to tax labour income. However, part of the income of the self-employed may reflect a return on capital assets employed in the business, including plant and equipment (such as cars, trucks and computers), buildings and trading stock. Carving out this further income would be complex. 4.21 Australian payroll taxes are not levied on the labour income of the self- employed. In addition, there are general thresholds, so firms with relatively low payrolls (thresholds for which differ across states/territories) are exempt from payroll tax so as to reduce compliance costs. However, introducing thresholds provides a bias for labour to be employed by firms that are below the threshold rather than by firms that are subject to payroll tax. This is unlikely to promote labour productivity. It also could have large revenue costs. 4.22 Another approach would be to attempt to levy payroll taxes only on companies if the proceeds were being used to fund deep company rate cuts. This was not considered viable as companies would have had incentives to outsource employment to unincorporated entities such as partnerships of individuals or trusts. Again, this would not have promoted labour productivity. 4.23 A further concern in levying a payroll tax to fund deep company rate cuts is that the company rate cuts might be of little benefit to many new and rapidly- expanding or innovative companies, which may be in tax loss or have very low income tax liabilities. On the other hand, any new payroll tax would impose an important new cost on these firms. A payroll tax would also have an uneven impact across the economy, because it would be levied disproportionately on sectors with a high labour cost. It is unclear whether such a switch would promote productivity and growth. 4.24 Thus, even if there were thought to be substantial benefits from a deep company rate cut, there are some important practical concerns about employing payroll taxes as a way of financing such cuts. Submission point Submissions on the issue of deep company tax cuts are welcomed but they should make clear how they are to be funded and how misalignment problems should best be addressed.
Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations A government discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in October 2006 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington. Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations: a government discussion document. ISBN 0-478-27143-3 Foreword In issuing this discussion document the government acknowledges the invaluable contribution the charitable, community and voluntary sectors make to New Zealand society. The options canvassed in this discussion document are aimed at reinforcing and encouraging giving by providing further incentives to those who donate money and/or give of their time and skills to charities and other non-profit organisations. Alternative mechanisms for achieving this objective are also discussed. Among the reasons that the government wants to further encourage the act of giving to charities and other non-profit organisations is that they assist the government in furthering its own social objectives, such as increasing its support to those members of society in need and the provision of community benefits generally. We acknowledge that the effect of favourable tax policies on charitable giving and the level of giving are not yet adequately understood and that the views in this area are divided, in particular, about whether tax-based incentives will actually persuade people who do not give to make philanthropy a more important part of their lives. Even so, it is generally accepted that tax incentives should reinforce an existing inclination to give and help make giving better informed and more effective. We also acknowledge that tax incentives introduced in isolation are unlikely to change philanthropic behaviours and attitudes significantly. A range of promotional efforts seems to be required, including campaigns that educate and raise public awareness of the work of the charitable, community and voluntary sectors and other promotional strategies. The Australian and United Kingdom experience suggests that such strategies have the potential to change philanthropic behaviours and, in the longer-term, have a positive effect on them. The challenge will be for the government and the charitable, community and voluntary sectors to work together to achieve an environment that encourages greater giving amongst New Zealanders.

There are an estimated 90,000 charities and other non-profit organisations operating in New Zealand; they vary in size, and many depend on the voluntary commitment of time and money of ordinary New Zealanders and businesses, as well as government funding. 1.2 Giving to charities and other non-profit organisations by individuals and businesses takes several forms – whether it is a matter of donating money, goods and services or time. While the overall magnitude of this giving is unknown, cash donations to charities and other non-profit organisations by individuals each year, as reported on tax returns, is estimated at $356 million, which represents about one-sixth of the expenditure of the non-profit sector. 1.3 In New Zealand, charitable giving is encouraged by the availability of a tax rebate for individuals and by tax deductions for companies and Māori authorities, for cash donations they make to donee organisations. A donee organisation is an entity or trust whose activities are not carried out for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and whose funds are applied principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. 1 Some of the major donee organisations include churches, and social-service organisations. 1.4 Other countries often use other types of tax incentives to encourage philanthropy. They are discussed in chapter 4. What the review aims to do 1.5 This discussion document has been issued as part of the government’s commitment in its Confidence and Supply Agreement with United Future, to develop a new tax rebate regime for charities during the current term of Parliament. The aim is to encourage more New Zealanders to give of their money, skills and time, and to reinforce the concept of giving, to charities and to other non-profit organisations. 1.6 The review is looking at the current mechanisms by which the government provides assistance, through the tax system, to charities and other non-profit organisations in respect of donations they receive from individuals, companies and Māori authorities. It also involves an examination of alternative mechanisms that may help to reinforce and encourage charitable giving. 1 The full criteria for donee organisation status and the list of organisations specifically named in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 are set out in the annex A. 2 1.7 The review is consistent with wider government measures for developing the charitable and non-profit sector, including: • The establishment of the Charities Commission, which was set up to administer a new registration, reporting and monitoring framework for charities. It is seen as an important factor in increasing philanthropy in New Zealand by improving the overall accountability and transparency of organisations that receive public monies through private donations or grants. • The Government Policy on Volunteering (December 2002), 2 which is aimed at actively supporting and valuing a society with a high level of volunteering. • The government’s policy of promoting and supporting our national identity by reinforcing the pride New Zealanders take in who we are and what we do. 1.8 Although the review focuses on promotion efforts to spur greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, it is acknowledged that there are other tax measures that may also support the development of the charitable and non-profit sector. They include making imputation credits to charities refundable for tax purposes and clarifying the current uncertainties relating to the tax treatment of payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients. 1.9 In the government’s consideration of the initiatives canvassed in this discussion document, it is necessary to take into account the trade-off between increasing spending on assistance to charities and other non-profit organisations and increasing spending in other areas, such as transport, or other policy priorities, such as initiatives being considered by the Business Tax Review. The government seeks readers’ views on the relative merits of each of the initiatives described in this discussion document so it can establish priorities and make choices that represent the best value for money. Scope of the review 1.10 The review considers options for improving the existing rebate and deduction mechanisms and a new tax rebate that recognises the time given by volunteers to charities. The current tax mechanisms used in other countries to promote charitable giving, and their feasibility in the New Zealand context, are also examined, as are non-tax initiatives for promoting charitable giving. 2 Available on the website of the Office of the Community and Voluntary Sector at http://www.ocvs.govt.nz/work-programme/volunteering.html 3 1.11 There have been many calls from the charitable sector for the government to deal with the question of whether imputation credits to charities should be refundable for tax purposes. The government acknowledges the importance of this issue to the charitable sector. For this reason, it will be examined separately as part of a wider review of imputation credits, and who should be entitled to use those credits. The review is expected to take place in 2007. The case for promoting charitable donations 1.12 Over the last decade there have been significant and sustained efforts around the world to increase charitable donations through changes in government policy. These efforts have focussed on three areas: • improving the regulatory framework for charities and other non-profit organisations; • developing tax incentives that favour charitable donations; and • increasing institutional accountability and transparency of charities and other non-profit organisations. 1.13 Among the reasons that governments seek to promote charitable giving are: • Charities and other non-profit organisations help governments to further their social objectives, such as increasing support to the disadvantaged members of society and fostering a more caring and cohesive society. • Many of the activities of charities and other non-profit organisations provide wider benefits to society over and above the value of the benefits received by the recipient or supplier of the activity. • The activities of charities and other non-profit organisations may be more responsive to the needs of society than government programmes, since donors and charities can often respond more quickly to changing social needs. Also, the donations people make to such organisations provide an effective indicator of the extra goods and services people feel are needed. • Because charitable activities use donated goods and volunteer labour they may be a more efficient way of providing social assistance than government programmes. The relationship between tax incentives and charitable giving 1.14 Research undertaken by Johnson, Johnson and Kingman (2004) examined the promotional strategies, efforts and challenges for increasing philanthropy around the world. It was noted that many countries are debating the efficacy of more favourable tax policies in encouraging philanthropy, and that there is no clear consensus about the impact of tax incentives on the practice. While there are some who believe that the lack of tax incentives contributes to low 4 levels of charitable giving in many countries, many others believe there is little relationship between the two. 3 1.15 Some empirical evidence suggests that tax incentives to donors can and do reinforce an existing inclination to give to charities and other non-profit organisations and can lead to larger donations being made, and that high- income people tend to be more responsive to tax incentives. For example, the Asia Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment has undertaken research on the strategies that have been applied in different countries to encourage giving, especially by the wealthy in the United States, Britain and Australia. 4 1.16 The general view is that tax incentives introduced in isolation are unlikely to change philanthropic behaviour or attitudes significantly. Rather, a range of initiatives is likely to be required, including better education aimed at promoting awareness of the activities of the charitable and non-profit sector, as well as other promotional strategies. This would have the potential to change philanthropic behaviours and, in the longer-term, have a positive effect on giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. 1.17 In 2002, Philanthropy New Zealand commissioned a survey on the individual giving behaviours and attitudes of New Zealanders. The results showed that there is a diverse range of motivations for charitable giving, and people like to give their money and time in different ways. While the main reasons for donating money to organisations or causes varied greatly among donors, the more frequent reasons they cited related to their trust in an organisation or cause and to altruism. 1.18 Respondents did not comment on tax rebates as either a reason to give or a reason not to give, nor were respondents questioned with particular reference to tax as an incentive for charitable giving. 5 1.19 The philanthropic behaviours and attitudes of companies and Māori authorities have not been surveyed. 1.20 Understanding the motivations and the ways in which people prefer to give is important in considering how best to stimulate greater charitable giving by New Zealanders and how best to provide tax-based incentives to encourage it. 3 Johnson PD, Johnson SP and Kingman A, “Promoting Philanthropy Global Challenges and Approaches”, International Network on Strategic Philanthropy, December 2004. 4 Asia Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment, “How the wealthy give” (October 2004) and “Encouraging wealthy Australians to be more philanthropic” (February 2005). 5 BRC Marketing and Social Research, “The Philanthropy New Zealand 2003 Giving Attitudes Survey”, Philanthropy New Zealand, 2003. 5 Criteria for assessing the options 1.21 A basic principle of the government’s revenue strategy is that the use of tax exemptions and concessions will be considered only in the context of the full range of policy options and only if the benefits can be shown to outweigh the costs for New Zealand. 1.22 In assessing the merits of individual policy options, consideration should be given to the effect they would have on the growth of the charitable and non- profit sector in New Zealand and the resulting benefits to New Zealand. The policy options should also be fair. The costs of different policy measures that need to be considered include: • the cost to businesses, community and voluntary organisations and individuals of complying with the tax rules – compliance costs; • the cost to the government of administering the tax rules – administrative costs; and • the costs that arise from the effects of the tax system on decisions to produce, consume, work, save and invest – deadweight costs. 1.23 Consideration of these benefits and costs will inevitably lead to policy trade- offs being made. Summary of possible measures to promote charitable giving A summary of measures presented in the discussion document is provided below. Individual tax rebate for donations • raising the threshold at which the rebate is capped; • increasing the rate of the rebate claim; or • a combination of both. Company deduction for donations • increasing the company deduction limit; and • extending the company deduction to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange. Māori authority deduction for donations • increasing the Māori authority deduction limit. 6 A volunteer’s rebate • introducing tax relief for volunteers in the form of a tax rebate to recognise the value of the time given by volunteers to charities registered with the Charities Commission, which, like the tax rebate for cash donations, would be subject to limitations; or • as an alternative to the volunteer’s rebate, providing grants directly to charitable organisations. Reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients • clarifying the uncertainties in the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients and reducing their compliance costs. 1.24 The discussion document also looks at other tax initiatives for encouraging charitable giving. If there is support for any of these initiatives the government will undertake further analysis on them before making a decision on their feasibility. This work would be carried out separately from the proposed changes shown in the summary. Timing of possible changes 1.25 Any legislation resulting from this review is expected to be included in a taxation bill to be introduced in 2007. The government envisages any new measures taking effect from the beginning of the 2007-08 year, provided it is administratively and fiscally feasible. Tax relief from any new measures could be claimed at the end of the 2007-08 year. How to make a submission 1.26 The government invites submissions on the relative merits of the measures presented in this discussion document. It also welcomes submissions on any similar measures that would reinforce and encourage charitable giving in New Zealand. Those who make submissions are asked to prioritise between the measures and to rank the relative importance of each. 1.27 Submissions should be made by 28 November 2006 and can be addressed to: Tax and Charitable Giving Project C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Tax and charitable giving” in the subject line. 7 1.28 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact those making submissions and to discuss their submission, if required. 1.29 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Accordingly, those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 8 CHAPTER 2 Tax rebates and deductions – options 2.1 Donations of money made by individuals, companies and Māori authorities are partly subsidised through the tax system. Individuals receive rebates, and companies and Māori authorities are able to claim deductions for money given to donee organisations. 2.2 The rebate is essentially a refund of a portion of a donation, which is calculated at a set rate. Deductions, on the other hand, reduce the donor’s pre-tax income. A rebate or deduction effectively provides the donor with more after-tax income and reduces the “cost” of donating relative to the price of other goods and services consumed by the donor. Both forms of assistance are capped and are subject to limitations to make them easier to administer and to protect the revenue base. 2.3 This chapter presents a number of options for enhancing the current rebate and deductions to facilitate greater charitable donations to charities and non- profit organisations. The government invites submissions on these options. Tax rebate for donations by individuals 2.4 Individuals can claim a tax rebate at a set 33 1/3 cents in the dollar up to a maximum of $1,890 for cash donations made to donee organisations. The maximum rebate is therefore $630. The rebate is not available for donations which exceed the maximum amount, although any excess may be transferred to a spouse who has not used the full $1,890. 2.5 Donations of $5 or more that are supported by a receipt from the donee organisation qualify for the rebate. The sum of the donations claimed cannot exceed the taxable income of the individual in the year in which the rebate is claimed. 6 2.6 The rebate is claimed through a separate process at the end of the year. Until 2000, individuals could claim their rebate as an offset against their income tax liability as part of their end-of-year tax return. 2.7 In the 2004-05 income year the total rebate claimed was $94 million, an amount based on reported donations of $356 million. 6 Section 41A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the sum of the charitable donations and housekeeper payments must not be more than a taxpayer’s taxable income in the tax year in which the donation and or payment is made. 9 2.8 Figure 1 shows the wide variety of income groups in New Zealand that claimed the donation rebate in 2005. Even though the proportion of people who claim a rebate increases as their income increases (from around 5 percent at $10,000 to nearly 26 percent at $100,000), those with annual taxable incomes under $40,000 claimed 62 percent of the total rebate, or $59 million. In addition, the proportion of those claiming the maximum rebate across all income bands ranged from 14 percent to 24 percent. Figure 1: Donation rebates by taxable income for 2005 5% 10% 12% 12% 13% 15% 18% 19% 20% 22% 26% 0 5 10 15 20 25 $0 - $10000 $10001 - $20000$20001 - $30000$30001 - $40000$40001 - $50000$50001 - $60000$60001 - $70000$70001 - $80000$80001 - $90000 $90001 - $100000 over $100000 Income bands $million 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% % taxpayer population Rebate claimed ($m)Percentage claiming rebate by income band 2.9 The donation threshold was last increased in 2003, from $1,500 to $1,890. This increase was in line with the increase in the Consumer Price Index from March 1990, when the threshold was last reviewed, to December 2001. At the time of the 2003 change, the government indicated that it looked forward to more frequent increases once better information was available to assess with confidence that the incentive is appropriately targeted. 2.10 Figure 2 plots the number of people claiming rebates for the period 2000 to 2005. It shows that the number of people claiming rebates steadily declined over that period, despite the increase in the rebate threshold in 2003. This decline was undoubtedly due in part to the removal of the requirement for a large number of individuals to file personal tax returns and to the introduction of a separate rebate claim process for donations and housekeeper rebates. 10 Figure 2: Rebate claiming donors $727 $776 $825 $898 $1,044 $965 $0 $200 $400 $600 $800 $1,000 $1,200 200020012002200320042005 310,000 320,000 330,000 340,000 350,000 360,000 370,000 380,000 Average reported donations (in dollars) by rebate claiming donor (left axis) Number of individual taxpayers claiming donation rebates (right axis) 2.11 Figure 2 also plots average reported donations (in dollars) per donor claiming a rebate. It shows that even though the number of people claiming rebates has fallen, the average reported donation has been rising, from $727 in 2000 to $1,044 in 2005. 2.12 Total reported donations for the 2000-2005 period were. Year 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 $2005 Total reported donations $271m $274m $288m $307m $325m $356m Options for change 2.13 There are a number of possibilities for increasing the overall level of the current tax rebate for individuals. They include: • raising the threshold (currently $1,890) at which the rebate is capped; • increasing the rate (currently 33 1/3 cents in the dollar) of the rebate claim; or • a combination of both. 2.14 Raising the threshold would increase the tax benefit for people who donate more than $1,890 a year. In 2005, at least 20 percent of people who claimed the rebate made donations of $1,890 or more and, therefore, they claimed the maximum rebate of $630. 11 2.15 The further away the current donations of taxpayers are from $1,890, either above or below the threshold, the less likely it is that raising the threshold would have any effect on the amount of their donations. 2.16 The revenue cost of raising the threshold is estimated at: 7 Threshold $1,890 $2,120 $3,000 $5,000 Rebate claim $94m $108m $112m $116m Revenue cost $0m $14m $18m $21m 2.17 On the other hand, increasing the rate would increase the tax benefit for every donor regardless of the amount donated. The revenue cost of increasing the rate is estimated at: Rate 33 1/3% 39% 45% 50% Rebate claim $94m $110m $127m $141m Revenue cost $0m $16m $33m $47m 2.18 Therefore increasing the rate would be more likely to influence the donating behaviour of a greater number of donors. 2.19 Another option would be to adopt a combination of raising the threshold and increasing the rate. The revenue cost of adopting a threshold of $2,120, which represents the Consumer Price Index-adjusted threshold since it was last reviewed in 2002, and increasing the rate is estimated at: Rate 33 1/3% 39% 45% 50% Rebate claim $108m $127m $146m $162m Revenue cost $14m $32m $52m $68m Deduction mechanism for donations by individuals 2.20 An alternative approach would be to allow individuals to claim a deduction rather than a rebate as was allowed before 1 April 1978. 8 Under a deduction mechanism, charitable donations would be deducted from the donor’s pre-tax income. This would mean that the tax value of charitable donations to donors would be determined by the donor’s marginal tax rate. 7 The revenue cost figures in this chapter are based on officials’ assessment of the amount people are contributing at the new thresholds according to the 2005 reported donations data. However, these estimates do not take into account any behavioural changes. 8 The deduction was allowed as a special exemption against income. See section 58 of the Income Tax Act 1976. 12 2.21 Under the current rebate system, donations are paid from after-tax income, so the tax value of donations to donors is set at 33 1/3 percent. For donors on marginal tax rates below 33 1/3 percent, the value of the tax rebate would surpass the amount of tax they would have paid on the income that had been donated. It could be argued, therefore, that the tax relief on charitable donations should be determined according to a donor’s marginal tax rate. 2.22 A key concern with the deduction mechanism, however, is that low-income donors would be disadvantaged relative to their current position because the tax benefit of their donations would be of a lower value. 2.23 Delivering tax relief for charitable donations made by individuals by way of a tax deduction would represent a significant change but also would lead to increased compliance costs for some donors and increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue. These costs would arise because people who, at present, make donations but do not file a tax return would have to do so in order to claim the deduction against their taxable income and obtain the tax benefit of the rebate. This would likely affect an estimated 10 percent of individual taxpayers (340,580). Such a change would have the disadvantage of reversing the simplification benefits arising from past efforts to minimise personal income tax return-filing in New Zealand. 2.24 Moving to a deduction mechanism for cash donations by individuals would result in an estimated revenue gain to the government of $22 million, excluding any compliance and administration costs involved. 9 Company deduction for donations 2.25 Under section DB 32 of the Income Tax Act 2004, companies other than certain close companies 10 are entitled to a limited deduction for cash donations made to donee organisations. This deduction extends to close companies whose shares are quoted on the official list of a recognised stock exchange. 11 2.26 The deduction for all donations made by the company in an income year cannot exceed 5 percent of the company’s net income for that year. In this regard, the net income is the company’s total income less deductions (excluding those allowed for the cash donations). 9 This revenue cost is based on the taxable income data for donors, the donation data, and the statutory tax rates for the 2005 tax year. 10 A company controlled by five or fewer people, as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 11 “Recognised exchange” is a defined term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 13 2.27 The company deduction limits were last liberalised in the 2002-03 income year. Previously, there were monetary and percentage limits on donations made to one donee organisation and by one donor. Options for change 2.28 Encouraging charitable donations by companies could be achieved by increasing the deduction limit to help reduce the cost of donating, and/or removing the current exclusion for close companies whose shares are not quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. In the 2002-03 income year, the close company exclusion was relaxed for close companies whose shares are quoted on a recognised stock exchange. This change was justified on the basis that listed companies are subject to greater public scrutiny and disclosure requirements, whereas unlisted companies are not subject to the same level of oversight. 2.29 The government is interested in readers’ views on whether extending the company deduction to close companies whose shares are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange would give rise to any concerns. 2.30 There is no readily available information on the amount of the deductions claimed by companies. Therefore it is not possible to say how much revenue would be forgone by the government if the deduction limit was increased and the close company exclusion was removed. A further difficulty in quantifying the revenue cost is that some companies use sponsorship rather than donations to support charitable activities as there is no monetary cap on deductions for sponsorship expenditure. Māori authority deduction for donations 2.31 Under section DV 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004, Māori authorities are entitled to deduct donations to donee organisations, in the same way as companies do, and to Māori associations. The deduction for donations made by a Māori authority in an income year cannot exceed 5 percent of the authority’s net income for that year. 2.32 The deduction was extended to apply to donations to donee organisations from the 2002-03 income year. (Previously, the deduction was limited to donations made by Māori authorities to Māori associations. 12 ) Option for change 2.33 The most obvious way of promoting greater charitable giving by Māori authorities would be to increase the current deduction limit. 12 A “Maori association” is defined in the Māori Community Development Act 1962. 14 2.34 As with the company deduction, there is no means by which the government can know how much it is spending on the Māori authority donations deduction as there is no readily available information. A key question for the government is whether the current limit represents a constraint on charitable donations by Māori authorities. Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters, in particular: The tax rebate for donations by individuals • Should the tax rebate be changed to a tax deduction? • Are the current rebate threshold and rate a constraint on the money that individuals donate? • If the tax rebate is retained, should the government raise the donations threshold, increase the rate, or do both? • What would be an appropriate level for the donations threshold and rate? Company deduction for donations • Is the current 5 percent limit on donations made by companies a constraint on corporate giving and, if so, what would be an appropriate limit to encourage further donations by companies? • If the company deduction for donations was extended to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange, what concerns may need to be dealt with? Māori authority deduction for donations • Is the current 5 percent limit on donations made by Māori authorities a constraint on their charitable giving and, if so, what would be an appropriate limit to encourage further giving by Māori authorities? 15 CHAPTER 3 Recognising the contribution of volunteers 3.1 Volunteering is an essential part of civil society. In recognising the vital contribution that volunteers make to New Zealand society, the government is seeking feedback on the desirability of introducing a tax rebate for individuals who donate their time to charities, in recognition of the value of the time they donate. 3.2 The development of a rebate to recognise the efforts of volunteers is also consistent with the Government Policy on Volunteering (December 2002). That policy is aimed at achieving “a society with a high level of volunteering, where the many contributions people make to the common good through volunteering and fulfilment of cultural obligations are actively supported and valued.” 3.3 The rebate would not attempt to recompense all the time that volunteers give as that would not be possible. Moreover, recompensing volunteers’ time would be contrary to one of the basic tenets of volunteerism – that people contribute their time not for private pecuniary gain but because they believe their contribution will benefit the common good or fulfil a cultural obligation. 3.4 The 2003 Philanthropy New Zealand survey indicated that many people who give their money often give of their time and expertise as well. Forty-two percent of those surveyed participated in voluntary work. They reported that they had decided to volunteer for reasons of the cause itself and its focus, and their decision was deeply rooted in altruism and trust, which is very similar to the motivation for making charitable donations. 13 A volunteer’s rebate 3.5 Volunteers would be eligible for the proposed tax rebate if they have given their time to a charity registered with the Charities Commission. 14 Volunteers would be able to claim the rebate provided they have received a declaration certificate (such as a receipt) from the registered charity to which they have volunteered their time. The declaration certificate would show the number of hours volunteered. 3.6 Like the current tax rebate, the volunteer’s rebate would be subject to limitations. The number of hours for which a volunteer could claim the tax rebate would be capped and a nominal hourly rate would be set. The hourly rate would be the same for every volunteer and would not be dependent on factors such as individual expertise. 13 BRC Marketing & Social Research (2003) “The Philanthropy New Zealand 2003 Giving Behaviours and Attitudes Survey”, Philanthropy New Zealand, at page 7. 14 The registration requirements for charities are set out in annex B. 16 3.7 The declaration certificate would be used by a volunteer to claim the rebate through the current donations claim process. Like the donations rebate, a volunteer’s rebate would be available only if the volunteer had derived a certain amount of taxable income for the year. Some important considerations 3.8 Specifying a nominal hourly rate and a limit on the maximum number of hours in a year should simplify the operation of the proposed rebate for charitable organisations and minimise the compliance costs associated with valuing a volunteer’s time. The government is interested in readers’ views on how the nominal hourly rate and the limit on the number of hours in a year should be set. 3.9 Limiting the rebate to people who give their time to only charitable organisations that are registered with the Charities Commission should provide certainty as to whether a volunteer’s time was eligible for the rebate. The attraction of limiting the volunteer’s rebate in this way is that organisations registered with the Charities Commission will be subject to reporting and monitoring rules. The downside is that volunteers of sports, recreational clubs, other non-profit organisations and government agencies may not be entitled to the rebate unless the organisations are registered. 3.10 Because volunteers provide a very wide range of services for their organisations, the government would like to hear readers’ views on whether the rebate should be limited to specific activities, such as help with fund- raising, office administration and social assistance. And if it should be limited, what types of volunteer services should it cover? Limiting the rebate to certain types of services might also help to make it more affordable and to target government resources better. 3.11 A further option for increasing the overall level of encouragement to individual donors is to provide that the volunteer’s rebate is in addition to the current donations rebate. Concerns about the proposal 3.12 There are some concerns with this proposal. One is that it would be necessary to rely on charities to validate the time that volunteers have served, although individual charities might not always have the time and resources to do that accurately. Whatever the time and resources available, however, it would mean a slight increase in compliance costs for both volunteers and charitable organisations, as well as an increase in administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 3.13 There is also a concern that the rebate would be inconsistent with the notion of volunteerism – that people give their time not for private pecuniary gain but because they believe they are contributing to the common good. 17 3.14 The revenue cost of introducing a volunteer’s rebate would depend on the level of the hourly rate, the cap on hours and the number of volunteers claiming it. The estimated revenue cost of a volunteer’s rebate based on a $5 hourly rate, a cap of 52 hours a year, and 143,000 volunteers claiming the maximum rebate would be $37.18 million. 15 Other ways to recognise volunteers’ time 3.15 Instead of providing a rebate to recognise the value of volunteers’ time, the government could direct the funds to charitable organisations. Grants could be made on the same basis as the volunteer’s rebate – that is, based on the number of volunteers in the organisation and the number of hours volunteered, with a cap on the number of hours eligible for the rebate. Alternatively, grants could be given to selected charities that have a high level of volunteering. 3.16 The key difference between providing grants and providing a tax rebate is that government funds would be directed to charities instead of volunteers. 3.17 A grant system, however, would not provide a direct incentive for individuals to donate their time and money, and might result in less effective targeting of government assistance, particularly if the government grants were not matched to the time and money donated. 3.18 The government is interested in hearing readers’ views on whether a grant system would be a better alternative to the volunteer’s rebate. Other matters being considered 3.19 The government is already reviewing the related matter of what is the proper tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and people who receive honoraria from charitable organisations. Reimbursement payments to volunteers 3.20 Many volunteers receive small payments as reimbursement for the actual or estimated expenses they incur in carrying out their volunteer duties. For instance, a volunteer may be reimbursed for travel expenses on an actual basis, or paid $5 per day as reimbursement for the estimated cost of buying lunch. The proper tax treatment of these reimbursement payments is not clear under current law. 15 The number of volunteers claiming the maximum rebate is based on the Philanthropy New Zealand Survey finding that 42 percent of the New Zealand population aged 18 years and over currently undertake unpaid work (1.3 million). It is also assumed that the proportion of people claiming the volunteer’s rebate would be the same as those claiming a donation rebate (11 percent). 18 3.21 Under present law, such payments are treated as income, and volunteers are required to file income tax returns and provide proof of their expenses in order to claim deductions for expenditure incurred. In practice, however, adopting this approach imposes considerable compliance costs on volunteers, particularly when payments received in relation to volunteering are the only payments a person receives that are not subject to withholding tax or PAYE. This approach also imposes unnecessary administrative costs on Inland Revenue when payments are small and not of an income nature. 3.22 As a result, certain administrative practices have developed within Inland Revenue, mainly with a view to minimising compliance costs for volunteers. When reimbursement payments appear “reasonable” and not excessive, Inland Revenue does not require volunteers to file an income tax return and provide documentary evidence of their expenses. 3.23 The government’s view is that the compliance costs faced by volunteers should be reduced, and the tax treatment of payments to volunteers should be clarified to provide certainty for volunteers and volunteer organisations. One possible way of achieving this would be to exempt from income tax reimbursement payments below a specific threshold. 3.24 Reimbursement payments up to a set amount could reasonably be considered to have been provided to cover actual expenses that have been, or will be incurred – and then treated as exempt income. The volunteers who received the payments would not have to file income tax returns in respect of the payments. Volunteers and their organisations would have to decide what level of accountability was necessary. 3.25 Reimbursement payments over the set amount would be subject to the current tax rules as to whether they constituted income and, if so, how much of the income would be taxable. In that case, it would be necessary for a volunteer to file an income tax return and produce evidence of amounts claimed as deductions. Tax would be payable when there was an element of “profit”. It would be possible to preserve the “exempt income” status of the payments up to the set amount. However, that would be inconsistent with the treatment of other taxpayers, who are required to support claims for deductions with evidence of expenses incurred. Honoraria 3.26 A further issue concerns small honoraria. Such payments are often made to office holders to reimburse them for the expenses they may incur in the performance of their duties (such as travel expenses or the cost of office supplies). Under current law, honoraria and any associated payments (including reimbursement for actual expenses) are classified as withholding payments, and withholding tax is deducted at 33 cents in the dollar. 19 3.27 Like volunteers, people who receive honoraria can incur considerable compliance costs, particularly when small honoraria are the only payments they receive. Under the law, all taxpayers who receive withholding payments are required to file income tax returns at the end of the income year, are liable for ACC levies when the amount owing is more than $50, and must provide proof of their expenses in order to claim deductions. 3.28 The government’s view is that the correct amount of withholding tax should be deducted at source, to avoid the situation where too much tax is deducted by way of the withholding tax and recipients are required to wait until they file an income tax return to claim expenses. One possible option would be to allow the payer of the honoraria to determine what amounts should be exempt from tax – in other words, the amount of income that the person would be able to claim as a tax deduction. The compliance costs would be on the payer in assessing whether the payment should be exempt from tax. The next step 3.29 The government will make a decision on how and when these matters are to be dealt with following the consultation process on the initiatives outlined in this discussion document. Special points for submissions Volunteer’s rebate • Should a rebate for recognising volunteers’ time be adopted, even though the rebate may be viewed as inconsistent with the notion of volunteering? • If it were adopted, what should the nominal hourly rate be and how should it be set? • Likewise, what should be the limit on the number of hours in a year and how should it be set? • Should the rebate form part of the current donation rebate or be in addition to the current donation tax rebate for individuals? • Should the rebate be limited to volunteers who give their time to charities that are registered with the Charities Commission only? • Should the rebate be limited to specific activities and, if so, what activities should be covered? • Would a grant system be a better alternative to a volunteer’s rebate? 20 Other matters • What is the best way to resolve the problems relating to the current tax treatment of reimbursements payments to volunteers and of honoraria? • What should be the set amount under which reimbursement payments to volunteers are considered exempt income? • Should volunteers who receive reimbursement payments over the set amount be required to file an income tax return for the total amount, or only for that part that is over the set amount? • Should honoraria payments up to a certain level be treated as exempt income? 21 CHAPTER 4 Tax incentives used in other countries 4.1 This chapter examines the tax incentives for encouraging charitable donations offered by other countries, with particular emphasis on the United Kingdom and Australia. It also assesses the implications of introducing these incentives in New Zealand and invites readers’ views on whether the government should consider them further. United Kingdom 4.2 The United Kingdom encourages charitable donations through the gift aid scheme and tax deductibility for cash donations and property provided to charitable organisations. Gift aid scheme 4.3 The gift aid scheme was introduced in 2000 and applies to all individuals and companies who make cash donations from their after-tax income. In general, the tax paid by the donor on the amount donated can be reclaimed by a registered charity if the donor has provided the charity with a gift aid declaration and the charity can establish an audit trail. 4.4 The amount of the tax that can be claimed back depends on the amount of tax that has been deducted from the income on which a charity is claiming. To reclaim the tax, the charity returns a schedule for each income year listing the donors, the dates of the donations and the amounts donated. The tax to be reclaimed is calculated on the total amount donated and is at the basic tax rate, which is 22 percent. This means that a donation of £10 made under the scheme would be worth £12.82 to the charity. (The amount of tax that may be reclaimed is 22/78 multiplied by the dollar value of the donation. In the example, the tax to reclaim would be equal to £2.82.) 4.5 Donors who pay tax at a rate higher than the basic rate can claim the difference between the higher rate and the basic rate, which had not been claimed by the charity, through their own tax return. Since April 2004, donors have been able to give the difference between the higher rate and basic rate directly to a charity, which means that the original donation could be worth even more to the charity. 4.6 There is no limit on the donations that may be claimed or the tax that may be reclaimed by the charity. 4.7 The scheme replaced the highly complex Deed of Covenant scheme, which involved donors entering into legally enforceable commitments to make regular donations to a charity for a period of more than three years. 22 Implications of a gift aid scheme in New Zealand 4.8 The main difference between the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme and New Zealand’s current rebate system is that, under the former, at least part of the tax benefit of charitable donations may be claimed by donee organisations, instead of the full tax benefit being claimed by donors. Therefore, it has the potential to increase the overall level of donations made to donee organisations, provided that donors do not decrease their level of donations in response to the lower tax benefit they receive from their donations. Under New Zealand’s rebate system, donors can choose to give a portion of the tax benefit they receive by donating part of their rebate back to donee organisations. Alternatively, they can nominate a donee organisation to receive the full tax benefit of their charitable donations as part of the claim process. 4.9 Another difference between the gift aid scheme and New Zealand’s rebate system is that the value of the total tax benefit under the gift aid scheme is dependent on the donors’ marginal tax rates – as donors on higher marginal tax rates can claim the difference between their rate and the basic rate claimed by charities. The concern about having tax benefits that are dependent on marginal tax rates is outlined in paragraph 2.22. 4.10 The current rebate system could potentially be modified to ensure that donee organisations receive the full tax benefit of the tax rebate that is currently received by individual donors. Instead of donors claiming a rebate, donee organisations could be allowed to claim 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated up to a cap of $1,890 per donor. Similarly, donee organisations could be allowed to receive the value of the deduction received on the donations made by companies and Māori authorities. This change would shift compliance costs from donors to donee organisations as donee organisations would be required to file a schedule of donations and keep receipts of donations. Payroll giving 4.11 The United Kingdom also operates a pre-tax payroll giving scheme. This scheme is available to any employee who pays income tax through the PAYE system and who chooses to make charitable gifts through an employer- operated payroll system. The employer deducts the amount of the gift from the employee’s salary before deducting tax. The payment is usually passed on to an approved payroll giving agency, which forwards the money to the chosen charity. 4.12 There is no limit on the level of donations that can be made for which tax may be claimed under this scheme. 23 Implications of a payroll giving scheme in New Zealand 4.13 A pre-tax payroll giving scheme enables a simple and convenient way for employees to make regular donations through their pay. Donors receive the tax benefit immediately, and do not have to wait until the end of the financial year to claim. The recipient organisation benefits from certainty of donations being received on a regular basis and lower administration costs. 4.14 If the tax rebate limits were maintained, compliance costs would be incurred by employers in monitoring each employee’s level of donations to ensure that the maximum rebate was not exceeded, particularly if employees changed jobs during the year. Compliance costs for employers would also arise in passing the donation on to the charity. 4.15 Payroll giving would involve administrative costs for Inland Revenue, since levels of rebates claimed would have to be matched against payroll giving to ensure that the rebate limits were adhered to. 4.16 In addition, because the scheme involves a deduction mechanism, there are likely to be concerns about fairness, and compliance and administrative costs due to increased filing of tax returns. (See paragraphs 2.22 to 2.23). 4.17 It would be possible to use the current payroll system to receive most of the benefits that pre-tax payroll giving results in, without the need to move to a deduction mechanism. At present, some New Zealand employers make deductions for donations from their employees’ after-tax income and pay these amounts to a nominated charity or a “clearing house”. The employee claims a donation rebate in the normal way. This method increases the regularity and certainty of donations to charities, although tax benefits can still only be accessed at the end of the year. Shares and other property giving schemes 4.18 In 2002, the government in the United Kingdom introduced a new tax relief measure for shares and other property donated to charities. In general, an amount equal to the market value of the donated investments (plus miscellaneous costs) is permitted as a deduction against the donor’s gross income. Implications of such schemes in New Zealand 4.19 The 2001 Tax and Charities discussion document concluded that the idea of allowing donations other than in cash to qualify for the tax rebate for individuals and the tax deduction for companies should not be pursued. There was concern at the time that this extension would have led to increased compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, since it would have given rise to questions as to the valuation of the non-cash donations. 24 4.20 If the giving of shares and other property to charities were to be eligible for the current tax rebate, individuals would need to determine the value of the non-cash donations and claim them as a donation in their tax rebate claim form. A company or Māori authority would claim a deduction up to the 5 percent taxable income cap. While the value of shares in publicly listed companies is readily available, there would be difficulties in valuing the shares in private or unlisted companies. To resolve these difficulties, any tax relief could be restricted to shares in listed companies only. Australia 4.21 In Australia, philanthropy is encouraged by way of tax deductibility of donations made to charitable organisations. Since 1999, the Australian government has introduced a suite of income tax measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy. These measures were in response to the report on philanthropy in Australia by the Business and Community Partnerships Working Group on Taxation Reform. 16 Among these initiatives were the introduction of workplace giving (similar to the United Kingdom’s payroll giving scheme), a new private charitable trust regime and a range of deductions for donations of cash and property. 17 4.22 Initial research indicates that the total amount donated and claimed as deductions by individual Australian taxpayers increased by 11 percent after the measures had been enacted. Private charitable trusts 4.23 Australia’s Prescribed Private Trust Regime was introduced in 1999. It enables individuals, families and businesses to establish their own private trusts for philanthropic purposes. Donations made to these trusts are deductible to the donor. There is no limit on the donations that may be eligible for tax deduction by the donor. The trusts must disburse their funds for charitable purposes. These trusts provide a planned formal mechanism for giving, which offers greater control for donors. 4.24 Applications for prescribed private trust status are made to the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Limits apply to the accumulation of money within these trusts, such that investment income can be accumulated only at a rate equal to the Consumer Price Index, with the rest disbursed for charitable purposes. A simple annual return is filed with the ATO outlining the source of the funds and the payment of funds to various gift deductible recipients (charitable organisations) as well as the extent and recipients of management fees. 16 “Report on philanthropy in Australia”, Business and Community Partnerships Working Group on Taxation Reform, March 1999. 17 www.partnerships.gov.au, “Taxation Initiatives to Encourage Philanthropy”. 25 Implications of introducing private charitable funds in New Zealand 4.25 In New Zealand, anyone can set up a trust as a donee organisation and donors can receive tax relief for donations made to the trust. 4.26 There is no limit on donations that are eligible for tax relief in Australia, whereas in New Zealand, tax relief on donations made to charitable trusts would be restricted by the current rebate limits or the company or Māori authority deduction limits. Therefore any increase in the current rebate limit or the company or Māori authority deduction limit would also increase the tax relief received by taxpayers who make donations to charitable trusts. Deductions for non-cash donations 4.27 In Australia, the following measures provide tax relief for non-cash donations by way of a tax deduction. • Donors may receive a tax deduction for gifts of property held by the donor for more than 12 months and valued in excess of $5,000, including environmental and heritage property donated to approved environmental organisations. (2001) • Deductions for donations of property valued in excess of $5,000, and donations of cultural property made through the Cultural Gifts Programme, may be spread over a period of up to five income years. (2002) • Bequests of property and gifts of cultural property made through the cultural gifts programme are exempt from capital gains tax, thus maximising the appreciated value of these gifts for tax deduction purposes. (1999) 4.28 Adopting any of these measures in New Zealand would recognise the value of non-cash donations and could encourage more donations of this kind. However, a key concern for the government is the difficulty of valuing non- cash donations, which could result in tax avoidance as well as significant compliance and administrative costs. In addition, the concerns relating to a deduction mechanism as outlined in paragraphs 2.22 to 2.23 would also arise. Even so, it would be possible to modify these measures so that donors received tax rebates instead of tax deductions for their donations. The next step 4.29 If there is support for any of the initiatives raised in this chapter, the government will undertake further analysis on them before making any decision. Further consultation might also be required. This work would be carried out separately to the review of the existing tax rebates and deductions. 26 Special points for submissions Submissions are sought on the following matters: • Would payroll giving provide a better mechanism for promoting charitable giving in New Zealand? • Would the United Kingdom’s gift aid scheme be more effective? • Would it be a good idea to allow non-cash donations to be deductible for tax purposes? • Would it be a good idea to adopt Australia’s Prescribed Private Trust Regime? • Could any of these ideas be modified to be better suited to the New Zealand environment while still encouraging donations? 27 CHAPTER 5 Other ways of promoting charitable giving 5.1 Until recently, the promotion of philanthropy in many countries has largely focussed on changes in government policy that sought to reduce constraints on its growth. Often these changes would include making improvements to the regulatory environment for the charitable and non-profit sector, developing tax incentives that favour charitable donations and introducing measures to increase the accountability and transparency of organisations in the sector. 5.2 International evidence suggests that a more pluralistic approach to promoting philanthropy has a greater positive effect on its growth. This approach involves a range of strategies and organised efforts to “grow” philanthropy through public awareness campaigns, donor leadership, and donor education. 5.3 Promotion efforts to spur greater charitable giving have been undertaken in both the United Kingdom and Australia. 5.4 The United Kingdom’s Giving Campaign sought to encourage a broad culture of giving and to increase the number of donors and the amount given. The campaign targeted specific audiences, including the wealthy and their advisors, employees and employers, and young people. The key themes included encouraging a culture of giving amongst the British public; improving the public perception of the charitable sector; and getting young people into the habit of giving both their money and their time to the sector. 5.5 In Australia, the Prime Minister’s Community Business Partnership has focussed on identifying and addressing incentives and impediments to corporate social responsibility and encouraging a culture of giving in Australia. 5.6 In New Zealand, creating an environment that promotes philanthropy has taken a big step forward with the enactment of the Charities Act 2005 and the creation of the new Charities Commission. The Commission has an important role to play in improving the overall accountability and transparency of charities and raising public awareness about the sector. The information collected by the Commission should enable a better understanding of how charitable donations and grants are being used by the sector. 5.7 Promotional efforts to encourage the giving of time include Sports and Recreation New Zealand’s “Cheers Volunteers” campaign, as well as smaller promotional activities related to International Volunteer Day and Volunteer Awareness week. Philanthropy New Zealand’s booklet A Toolkit for Giving, the rewards of generosity 18 is one example of the promotional efforts to encourage greater giving in New Zealand and to make giving better informed and more effective for donors. 18 Philanthropy New Zealand, “A Toolkit for Giving, the rewards of generosity”, 2004. 28 5.8 The Philanthropy New Zealand research on the giving behaviours and attitudes of individual New Zealanders showed that educating and informing New Zealanders in general will not only encourage those who give to do so more or more often, but may also encourage those who currently do not donate to do so. People were particularly interested in knowing a charity’s main type of work; who benefits from the activities of the charity; how its money is spent; and the honesty and reliability of a charity. 5.9 The government is interested in readers’ views on what further initiatives can be employed to encourage increased generosity and to support any tax measures that may arise out of this discussion document. 29 ANNEX A List of donee organisations in section KC 5(1) A “donee organisation” includes: • a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand • a public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in the first bullet point • a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in the first bullet point, by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual • a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in the first bullet point • the Red Cross Society Incorporated • the Pacific Leprosy Foundation • the Leprosy Mission New Zealand Incorporated • the Volunteer Service Abroad (Incorporated) • the Commonwealth Foundation • the Sir Walter Nash Vietnam Appeal • the Food Bank of New Zealand • the Norman Kirk Memorial Trust Fund • the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) • World Vision of New Zealand (Incorporated) • Save the Children New Zealand (and its branches) • Sport and Recreation New Zealand • Christian World Service • Caritas Aotearoa-New Zealand • “Raphael” (The Ryder-Cheshire Foundations of New Zealand) • New Zealand Sports Foundation (Incorporated) • The New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped (Incorporated) • Amnesty International • The Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund (TEAR Fund) • CORSO (Incorporated) • Operation Hope (Aid Ship to Africa) • The New Zealand Rotary Clubs Charitable Trust • Alhay Buhay Foundation Trust • Cyclone Ofa Relief Fund • Water for Survival • International Christian Aid (ICA) • Christian Children's Fund of New Zealand Limited (CCFNZ) • Cyclone Val Relief Fund • Channel 2 Cyclone Aid for Samoa • Community Action Overseas (Oxfam NZ) • The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust 30 • The Fred Hollows Foundation (NZ) • Christian Blind Mission International (New Zealand) • Four Sherpa Trust • Adventist Development and Relief Agency • Mobility Equipment for the Needs of Disabled Trust • The Serious Road Trip Charitable Trust • Valehead Community Health Centre Trust • Nelson Mandela Trust (New Zealand) • African Enterprise (New Zealand) Aid and Development Fund • New Zealand Viet Nam Health Trust • Mission Without Borders (NZ), Humanitarian Aid Account • Bangladesh Flood Appeal Trust • Karunai Illam Trust • Cry for the World Foundation New Zealand Humanitarian Aid Fund • Akha Rescue Ministry Charitable Trust • Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand • The Hillary Himalayan Foundation • Together for Uganda • Open Home Foundation International Trust • Books for Africa • Bright Hope International Trust • Help a Child Foundation New Zealand • Greater Mekong Subregion Tertiary Education Consortium Trust • The Sir Edmund Hillary Trust • Cheboche Area Trust Inc • Sampoerna Foundation Limited • Surf Aid International Incorporated • Plan New Zealand • St Stanislas Charitable Trust of New Zealand • Medicine Mondiale • New Zealand Jesuits in India Trust • Operation Vanuatu Charitable • Habitat for Humanity New Zealand Limited 31 ANNEX B Registration requirements for charities An organisation can register as a charitable entity if: 19 • it is established and maintained for charitable purposes; • it is not for the private profit of any individual or group; • it has a name that complies with the Charities Act 2005; and • all the officers of the charitable organisation are qualified to be officers. The Charities Commission will use the well-established common law test for charitable purposes. The test requires a charitable organisation to have a purpose that either: • advances education; • advances religion; • relieves poverty; or • is otherwise beneficial to the community. Furthermore, the organisation’s object must be of benefit to the public (public benefit test). To register, organisations will have to complete the prescribed application form and: • submit a copy of their rules, constitution, trust document or similar; • provide information about their current and proposed charitable activities; and • register the officers of the organisation. Once registered, organisations will need to: • file an annual return within six months of their nominated balance date; and • notify the Charities Commission within three months if certain information about their organisation changes. 19 A guide to the Charities Act is available on the website of the Charities Commission at http://www.charities.govt.nz/news/updates/electronic-guide.htm
New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change A government discussion document Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in December 2006 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington. New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change: a government discussion document. ISBN 0-478-27149-2 FOREWORD The government is committed to creating an environment that enables New Zealand business to thrive in the global economy. Our tax system plays an important role in fostering a competitive business environment, and is therefore a key focus of the government’s Economic Transformation agenda. New Zealand’s International Tax Review is an important step for the government in advancing its economic priorities and the objectives of the Confidence and Supply Agreements with United Future and New Zealand First. This discussion document complements the range of possible business tax initiatives that are being advanced through the Business Tax Review to help transform the New Zealand economy. It makes a case for a major change in New Zealand’s paradigm for taxing offshore income – the introduction of an active-passive distinction. Offshore active income of New Zealand business would no longer be taxed as it is earned, but would be exempt from New Zealand tax. It also looks at possible changes to New Zealand’s tax treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax. These changes would make our rules for taxing offshore income more consistent with those of our major trading and investment partners. Bringing our international tax rules into line with international norms would reduce barriers faced by New Zealand-based firms under current tax rules to exploiting the benefits of operating internationally. Together these changes would encourage New Zealand-based businesses with international operations to remain, establish and expand. Many important details of implementation remain open. Consultations with New Zealand business and submissions from interested parties will pay a critical role in determining the final form of the proposals.

Generally includes income derived from active business, such as manufacturing or industrial activity. Approved issuer levy (AIL). A mechanism that allows NRWT on interest paid to an unrelated lender to be reduced to nil provided the borrower agrees to pay a 2 percent levy. Base company income. Defined by rules designed to counter situations where domestic income is shifted offshore to benefit from an active income exemption. Capital export neutrality. The idea that residents should face the same amount of tax on income from domestic and foreign investments. This promotes efficient capital allocation worldwide and is achieved by taxing residents' foreign income on accrual with a credit for foreign taxes. Conduit rules. Rules that remove the tax liability of New Zealand companies on foreign income to the extent of their non-resident ownership. Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. Rules that apply to the income from direct investment in foreign companies controlled by a small number of resident shareholders. Deferral-with-credit system. Method of implementing an exemption for offshore active income. The income is exempt from accrual taxation. Taxation is deferred until profits are repatriated, with a credit for foreign taxes paid. Direct investment. Substantial investment in the shares of a company – typically, an interest of 10 percent or greater. Dividend withholding payment (DWP). Withholding payment imposed at 33 percent on foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. Such dividends are exempt from income tax. Double tax agreement (DTA). A bilateral treaty between countries designed to avoid, or provide relief from, double taxation and to prevent fiscal evasion. Entity approach. An approach to attributing CFC income to resident shareholders that looks at whether the CFC is active or passive. All income of the company is taxed according to that categorisation. Exemption system. Method of implementing an exemption for offshore active income. The income is exempt from accrual taxation, with no taxation of subsequent dividends. Foreign direct investment (FDI). Direct investment from a resident of one country in a company resident in another country. Foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Rules that apply to investments in foreign entities not covered by the CFC rules, including portfolio investments in CFCs, direct or portfolio investments in foreign companies not controlled by New Zealand residents, and beneficial interests in a foreign life insurance policy or superannuation scheme. Foreign investor tax credit (FITC). A mechanism that reduces company tax on profits distributed as dividends to non- residents so that the total New Zealand tax impost (company tax and NRWT) does not exceed the normal company rate. Foreign tax credit. A method of relieving international double taxation. If income received from abroad is subject to tax in the recipient's country, foreign tax imposed on that income may be credited against the domestic tax on that income. Grey list. A list of eight countries considered to have tax systems similar to New Zealand. They are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Income from grey list companies is exempt from accrual taxation. Gross domestic product (GDP). The total value of goods and services produced in a year within a country’s borders. IMF. International Monetary Fund. Non-resident contractors withholding tax (NRCWT). Withholding mechanism for contract payments to non-resident contractors. Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT).

The International Tax Review is linked to the government’s Business Tax Review, the aim of which is to facilitate economic transformation by improving incentives for productivity gains. 1.2 New Zealand’s tax system plays an important role in fostering a competitive business environment. It sits alongside other elements such as infrastructure, skills and education, and research and development that are a key focus of the government within its Economic Transformation agenda. 1.3 It is important that New Zealand’s tax system is not out of line with systems in comparable jurisdictions, particularly Australia. Within an increasingly borderless global economy, New Zealand must be able to attract and retain capital, and our businesses must be able to compete effectively in foreign markets. 1.4 New Zealand’s rules for taxing offshore investment through controlled foreign companies (CFCs) 1 are more stringent than those of other countries. Since 1988, New Zealand residents have been taxed on all income earned by their CFCs 2 at the time that income is earned (accrual taxation). Other countries limit accrual taxation of offshore income to passive income and certain special categories. 3 Active income is generally exempted or taxation is deferred until the income is returned in the form of dividends. 1.5 Concern has been expressed by the Tax Review 2001 4 and other commentators that the current system could inhibit the internationalisation of New Zealand business. 1.6 This discussion document deals with the taxation of outbound, non-portfolio investment by focusing on: • relaxation of the current CFC rules by introducing an active/passive distinction – offshore active income would be exempted from accrual taxation, and passive income would continue to be taxed as it accrues; 1 A controlled foreign company is essentially a company resident in a foreign jurisdiction that is controlled by a small number of New Zealand residents. 2 The main exception being CFCs resident in eight grey list countries. This exclusion is described further in chapter 2. 3 Passive income includes investment income such as interest, dividends, royalties and rents. The concept is often extended to other transactions which could erode the domestic tax base, so-called base company income. Together, such income is often referred to as “tainted” income and is subject to accrual taxation. 4 The independent Tax Review 2001, under the Chairmanship of Robert McLeod, commissioned to undertake a broad review of the tax system and to develop proposals to guide the future direction of New Zealand tax policy. It made its final report to the government in October 2001. 2 • the implications for other aspects of our international tax rules to protect the New Zealand domestic tax base; and • possible changes to New Zealand’s tax treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends, interest and royalties. 1.7 An exemption for the active income of CFCs would put New Zealand companies on a more equal footing internationally by removing an additional tax cost not faced by firms based in comparable jurisdictions, such as Australia. 1.8 Lower treaty limits for NRWT would also reduce tax barriers to offshore investment. New Zealanders receiving payments sourced in countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement would enjoy lower rates of foreign withholding taxes. 1.9 Bringing our international tax rules into line with international norms would reduce the barriers faced by New Zealand-based firms, under the current tax rules, to exploiting the benefits of operating offshore. These changes would encourage businesses with international operations to remain, establish and expand. Links with the Tax Review 2001 1.10 The issues canvassed in the discussion document were raised in the Tax Review 2001 and then, more recently, by other commentators such as the New Zealand Institute. 1.11 Indeed, international tax reform has been on the government’s agenda since the release of the Final Report of the Tax Review in 2001. Many of the recommendations of the Review centred on proposals to reform the taxation of inbound and outbound investment. As a result, the government has considered the following issues: • A major reduction in taxes imposed on inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) to increase levels of FDI in New Zealand. As the government announced in September 2003, it had decided not to proceed with this proposal because the expected spill-over benefits would be outweighed by substantial fiscal costs. • A temporary tax exemption on the foreign income of new migrants, to facilitate the migration of skilled labour to New Zealand. The government agreed with the Tax Review’s recommendation and has since passed legislation implementing a four-year tax exemption on foreign income for both new migrants and returning New Zealanders. 3 • Examination of a risk-free return method (RFRM) for taxing income from offshore portfolio investments. The government has proposed new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment that are broadly consistent with this proposal. The measures examined in this discussion document do not affect those proposed rules. 1.12 The other important recommendation of the Tax Review was that the government explore the merits of adopting an active/passive distinction in our CFC rules. The Tax Review expressed the broad concern that our comprehensive taxation of CFC income was out of step with international norms. 1.13 The New Zealand Institute echoes the Tax Review’s concerns. In its 2006 discussion paper, The Flight of the Kiwi, the Institute argues that the current CFC rules generate “real economic costs in terms of aspirational companies being lost to the New Zealand economy rather than electing to go global from a New Zealand base (or deciding not to venture abroad at all).” 1.14 The government shares these concerns. Providing an exemption for offshore active business is intended to help retain dynamic companies in New Zealand. Otherwise, there can be economic costs from migration of existing businesses or the establishment offshore of potential businesses, or by inhibiting the expansion of existing business into offshore markets. Key features of the reform 1.15 The central feature of the reform described in the discussion document is to provide an exemption for offshore active income. Consequently, new rules will need to ensure the exemption does not extend to passive or domestic income. 1.16 New Zealand can benefit from extensive international experience in distinguishing between active and passive income. Even so, international experience can take us only so far. In the end, New Zealand’s international tax rules need to be developed to reflect the realities of our business environment and other features of our tax system. 1.17 A critical issue informing the development of a new system will be the compliance and administrative burden imposed by new rules. While the rules themselves will inevitably be complex, reflecting the complexity of international business arrangements, the government believes that the system described here could be much simpler in actual operation than the current system. 4 1.18 While the discussion document expresses a clear preference on the direction for change, many important issues of implementation remain open. Final decisions will be made only after consultation with the businesses that will have to apply the new rules. In the process, trade-offs between the scope of the active income exemption and the implementation of the various base maintenance measures will be inevitable. Submissions will be important in evaluating those trade-offs. SUMMARY OF POSSIBLE CHANGES A new direction for taxing CFC income Possible changes 1. Under a new active/passive distinction, offshore active income would be exempted from accrual taxation, and passive income would be taxed as it accrues. 2. Complementary changes to other aspects of our international tax rules, in particular, the thin capitalisation rules, would be needed to protect the New Zealand domestic tax base. 3. New Zealand’s tax treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax could also change. Implementing an active/passive distinction Possible changes 1. Offshore active income would be exempt. 2. The broad international consensus to define passive income positively would be adopted, leaving active income as the residual undefined concept. 3. Passive income and base company income (collectively called “tainted income”) would continue to be taxed on accrual. 4. The main categories of tainted income would include: • Passive income: dividends, interest, royalties and rents. It could include income which is passive in form but the derivation of which involves certain activity. • Base company income. Base company rules would be designed to counter situations where domestic income is shifted offshore to benefit from the active income exemption. 5 The transactional and entity approaches Possible approaches The government could adopt one of two approaches to attributing the income of a CFC to its resident shareholders: • The transactional approach examines each item of income derived by a CFC to determine whether it produces tainted income or non-tainted income. Accordingly, different income streams of the CFC attract different treatment depending upon their category; or • The entity approach looks at whether the company is active or passive. Once categorised, then all of the income of the company is taxed in the corresponding manner, regardless of the nature of the income derived. Interest allocation and transfer pricing rules Possible changes 1. The current thin capitalisation rules would be: • extended to cover all New Zealand entities with outbound investments, taking into account the compliance cost considerations; • modified to deal with outbound investments in CFCs; and • reviewed to ensure that the safe harbour ratio is appropriate. 2. Technical aspects of the thin capitalisation rules would be reviewed to make them consistent with the minimum capital requirement rules for banks. 3. The transfer pricing rules would be strengthened by shifting the burden of proof on transfer pricing matters from the tax administration to taxpayers. Implications for the taxation of dividends and other international tax rules Possible changes 1. A key issue is whether dividends from CFCs should continue to be taxed. The government is more attracted to the exemption method provided such an exemption would not lead to erosion of the New Zealand tax base. 2. Repeal of the grey list exemption and conduit rules would be consistent with an active/passive distinction that focuses on exempting active income rather than whether the income has been comparably taxed in the host country. 3. Consideration should be given to whether the active/passive distinction should apply in respect of foreign branches and non-portfolio interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs). 6 Non-resident withholding tax Possible changes 1. NRWT on dividends could be lowered through bilateral treaty negotiations, although the case for this is stronger for non-portfolio dividends. The changes would have implications for the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. 2. Reducing NRWT on either interest or royalties is a possibility but may not be justified. 3. A number of technical changes to the NRWT and approved issuer levy (AIL) rules would rationalise information requirements and withholding arrangements across different payments. How to make a submission 1.19 The government invites submissions on the issues raised in this discussion document. Submissions should be made by 16 February 2007 and be addressed to: International Tax Review C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or e-mail policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “International Tax Review” in the subject line. 1.20 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.21 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 1.22 In addition to seeking written submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials intend to discuss the issues raised in this discussion document, including detailed design issues, with key interested parties. 7 CHAPTER 2 A new direction for taxing CFC income Possible changes 1. Under a new active/passive distinction, offshore active income would be exempted from accrual taxation, and passive income would be taxed as it accrues. 2. Complementary changes to other aspects of our international tax rules, in particular, the thin capitalisation rules, would be needed to protect the New Zealand domestic tax base. 3. New Zealand’s tax treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax could also change. Details of how the rules within this general framework might work are the subject of consultations and submissions. 2.1 How best to tax income on outbound direct investment is one of the most vexed tax policy issues. 2.2 New Zealand’s current system of international taxation is to tax offshore income as it accrues, with credits given for foreign taxes that have been paid. No other OECD country has adopted this approach. All other OECD countries either defer taxing offshore active income or exempt it altogether. Since New Zealand taxes the income of its CFCs more heavily than other countries, it can be attractive for innovative and dynamic firms to migrate from New Zealand, establish themselves in other countries or simply stay small and local. 2.3 Since New Zealand’s rules applying to CFCs were introduced in 1988, other countries, including Australia, have liberalised their tax rules for the active income of their CFCs. Moreover, it has become easier for both firms and workers to shift across international borders. 2.4 For these reasons, the government supports a change to New Zealand’s paradigm of comprehensive taxation of CFC income toward providing an exemption for offshore active income. Other measures, to protect the domestic tax base, would form an integral part of the new system. 8 Current approach to taxing CFC income 2.5 New Zealand generally taxes both active and passive offshore income of its CFCs as it accrues, with a credit for foreign taxes. As a departure from this comprehensive taxation, income from CFCs in eight grey list countries 5 is exempt. The policy motivation for the grey list is to reduce compliance costs. Income earned in a grey list country is considered to be taxed comparably to New Zealand-earned income, so there would be negligible New Zealand tax to pay after allowing foreign tax credits. 6 2.6 It is sometimes argued that despite New Zealand’s tax treatment of the income of its CFCs being relatively stringent by world standards, it is not stringent enough. Standard economic analysis would suggest that there is a case for taxing on a pure residence basis. Under a pure residence basis, foreign taxes would be treated as a cost just like other costs of doing business, and deductions rather than credits would be allowed for foreign taxes. Such a tax system is, under strong assumptions, said to promote national welfare maximisation. It would provide incentives for investing abroad only if the benefits to New Zealand (which are net of any foreign taxes) exceed the benefits from investment in New Zealand. 7 2.7 Even so, under international tax treaties and in practice, countries of residence relieve double taxation by either providing credits for foreign taxes or exempting foreign-source income. 2.8 A system of comprehensive taxation of CFC income, with credits for foreign taxes paid, is sometimes advocated on the grounds of “capital export neutrality”. Other things being equal, it provides incentives for capital to be allocated around in the world in ways which lead to the highest, risk-adjusted, pre-tax returns. This is consistent with promoting the global efficiency of capital allocation. 8 In practice, it makes very little sense for a small, open economy like New Zealand’s to “go it alone” in promoting capital export neutrality. New Zealand is much too small to do anything significant to promote global efficiency in the way that worldwide capital is allocated. 5 “Grey list” countries are those considered to have tax systems similar to that of New Zealand. They are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. 6 Tax preferences available abroad or asymmetries in tax systems may mean that income sourced from these eight grey list countries need not necessarily be comparably taxed. This is discussed further in chapter 3. 7 While standard analysis suggests a “first-best” case for full taxation of outbound investment, the see-saw principle suggests that there can be a “second-best” case for a lower tax on outbound investment. If, for some reason, an economy is constrained to levy a higher than optimal rate on inbound investment, there can be a case for a somewhat lower tax rate on outbound investment. 8 If instead the income of CFCs is exempt or taxed with a credit only when dividends are remitted, this can lead to investment in low-tax jurisdictions being more attractive on an after-tax basis than domestic investments, even when the pre-tax returns are lower than those obtained on domestic investments. 9 2.9 The main argument in favour of New Zealand’s current approach to taxing the income of its CFCs would appear to be that while it falls short of the pure residence base which might be advanced on grounds of national welfare maximisation, it is the nearest internationally acceptable alternative. A secondary attraction of New Zealand’s current approach is that it avoids any need to distinguish between active and passive income. Other countries cope with such a distinction, although there are inevitably contentious borderlines. 2.10 The key argument against New Zealand’s current approach is the disincentive it provides New Zealand-based companies to internationalise their businesses from a New Zealand base when other countries offer much more lenient rules for CFCs. This will be explored in greater detail in the next section. 2.11 There is a second concern. A foreign tax credit system can provide incentives for domestic firms to channel offshore investment into higher-tax foreign countries in ways which are not in New Zealand’s best interest. This is illustrated in Table 2.1. In the example, investment into Country A, a higher- tax country, provides a higher pre-tax return than an investment into Country B, a low-tax jurisdiction. From New Zealand’s perspective, it would be better if the investment were channelled into the low-tax country B as there is a higher net return of 990 to New Zealand, split 737 to the investor and 253 to the government. However, under a foreign tax credit system, the investor ends up preferring the investment in Country A on an after-tax basis. Thus investment into higher-tax countries can displace investment into low-tax countries even though New Zealand as a whole would be better off from investment into the low-tax countries. T ABLE 2.1 Investments in high-tax and low-tax countries – an example Country A High-tax Country B Low-tax Gross Return 1200 1100 Host Country Tax 300 110 New Zealand Tax 9 96 253 Return to Investor 804 737 Return to New Zealand 900 990 9 New Zealand tax is net of foreign tax credits. In Country A, the potential New Zealand tax of 396 (.33x1200) is reduced by a tax credit for the 300 of foreign tax paid; in Country B, the potential New Zealand tax of 363 (.33x1100) is reduced by a credit of 110. 10 2.12 Finally, a number of taxpayers have commented that not only are New Zealand’s tax rules for CFC income comparatively harsh, the associated compliance costs can also be high, with firms required to restate the accounts of non-grey list CFCs under New Zealand tax rules. This can be very difficult when foreign accounting and tax rules are substantially different from New Zealand’s, the degree of control is limited, and the CFC’s financial accounts are prepared in a different language. There are also aspects of the CFC rules that are extremely complex and difficult to comply with. As the Tax Review 2001 concluded, it is important to take these into consideration when framing any new rules. Pressures caused by tax treatment in other countries 2.13 In contrast to New Zealand, other OECD countries either exempt offshore active income or defer taxation of the active income of CFCs until the time that dividends are remitted by the CFCs to their parents. Some non-OECD countries, such as Singapore, have territorial systems which exempt all forms of offshore income from domestic taxation (see Table 2.2). This means that companies with active business subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions may pay little or no tax on this income for long periods of time. Even then, tax minimising strategies may reduce the effective tax rate further. TABLE 2.2 Taxation of outbound investment in other countries Accrual taxation of income Treatment of dividends Active Passive Exempt Tax with deferral Australia X √ √ United States X √ √ United Kingdom X √ √ Singapore X X √ Japan X √ √ New Zealand (non-grey list) √ √ NA 10 NA 10 New Zealand taxes dividends under the DWP rules but there is no deferral as offshore income is taxed as it accrues. 11 2.14 Australia’s tax rules are particularly important. The proximity of Australia to New Zealand as a choice for a multinational’s regional headquarters, the ease of migration, the integration of imputation systems and the large levels of FDI between the two countries make Australia the most likely destination for migrating firms. 11 Greater alignment of New Zealand’s tax rules with those of Australia can only enhance and deepen trans-Tasman integration. Such alignment is consistent with the government’s wider set of single economic market initiatives. 2.15 If New Zealand taxes offshore income more heavily than other countries (especially Australia), a company planning to expand into active businesses in third countries has a tax incentive to relocate its headquarters outside of New Zealand. If it retains its headquarters in New Zealand, it is taxed on active income from the third-country CFC as the income accrues. This could lead to a substantial tax impost if the third country has low tax rates on active income. If, however, it relocates its headquarters to a country offering an exemption or deferral of taxation on offshore income, no tax need be paid on the income accruing in the CFC. 2.16 There are many commercial factors that influence where firms choose to locate their operations. Firms may be attracted to deeper capital markets, proximity to global markets, and the access to skilled labour and global stocks of knowledge in other countries. Relocation may be the best way to benefit from having a presence in such markets. Given the strength of these factors, some migration of New Zealand firms is likely to continue regardless of tax changes. Nevertheless, it is unattractive for New Zealand’s tax treatment of CFC income to inhibit the retention or establishment of New Zealand-based multinational businesses. 2.17 Migration of even one or two of New Zealand’s large dynamic firms could have a substantial negative effect on the economy. Such firms help New Zealand to maintain close connection with new ideas and commercial developments in other countries. They also help maintain a base of intellectual property within New Zealand. Not only would migration lead to jobs within head offices being shifted offshore, so too would be the demand for associated professional services. 2.18 Firm migration also reduces the extent to which New Zealand could benefit from cluster effects. When a number of firms locate near each other, or cluster, they can attract higher levels of skilled labour and customers than a single firm could. Once a critical number of firms locate in an area they can become a cluster, and benefits of economies of scale may be available to them. Within New Zealand, potentially in Auckland, clusters involved in specialised areas of R&D could be envisaged. It is important therefore that policies do not prevent the achievement or the maintenance of clusters. 11 Australia represents New Zealand's most significant source of foreign capital, contributing 46 percent of inward FDI. 12 2.19 Finally, higher taxes on offshore income may also make it difficult for New Zealand-based firms to expand out of local markets; so, if they stay in New Zealand, they may stay small. For example, a New Zealand-based company which seeks to exploit lower cost production in a non-grey list country might be disadvantaged relative to other companies operating in that jurisdiction. New Zealand’s outbound FDI performance 2.20 It is of interest to examine how New Zealand’s level of outbound FDI has compared with that of other countries in recent times. The stock of outbound direct investment from New Zealand has remained relatively constant as a share of GDP, fluctuating between around 10 to 15 percent of GDP over the period since the early 1990s. In contrast, the stock of outbound direct investment in OECD countries increased steadily from around 10 percent of GDP in 1990 to around 30 percent of GDP in 2002 (see figure 1). F IGURE 1 Outbound FDI stock 12 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 1 9 89 1 99 0 1 99 1 1992 1993 1 99 4 1 99 5 1996 1997 1 99 8 1 99 9 2000 2001 2 00 2 2 00 3 2 00 4 % GDP New ZealandAus traliaOECD weighted average Source: IMF, UNCTAD 2.21 The relative change between 1990 and 2004 in outbound investment as a percentage of GDP is shown for selected OECD countries in figure 2. The data, reported by the New Zealand Institute, show that New Zealand is the only country that has experienced a drop in the intensity of outbound FDI. 12 Figure 1 illustrates total outbound direct investment, which includes both debt and equity. Ideally, the comparison would focus on outbound direct equity investment only. However, the outbound direct equity investment series for New Zealand is affected by a large structural break in 2001 which makes comparisons difficult. 13 FIGURE 2 Level of outward FDI as a % of GDP 2.22 There are many factors which may be affecting the evolution of outbound FDI in different countries. Commercial factors such as closeness to markets may be more important influences than taxation. 13 However, over the time that New Zealand’s comprehensive international tax rules have been in place, New Zealand has been exceptional in not having the same strong growth in FDI that has been evident in other OECD countries. New Zealand’s tax rules may have been a contributing factor on the margin. Implications for GDP growth and labour productivity 2.23 Any relaxation of New Zealand’s CFC rules could increase outflows of FDI from New Zealand. At first sight, this would appear likely to reduce New Zealand’s capital stock, thereby reducing labour productivity and GDP growth. 13 These figures should be interpreted cautiously for a number of reasons: – Investment that is taxed under New Zealand’s CFC rules is not the same as direct investment as measured by statistical agencies. – The data are not always comparable – both across time (for example, a methodological change affects the New Zealand data from 2001 onwards), and across countries (for example, countries may use different methodology in compiling the data). – Tapping into offshore markets and access to offshore distribution channels may be more or less important for firms in different industries. For example, in some industries it may be more important to access offshore distribution channels. Different levels of outbound direct investment across countries may, in part, be explained by differences in industry structure across countries. – Different levels of outbound direct investment across countries could, in part, be explained by distance from other countries, as this could make it more difficult to invest offshore. 14 2.24 There are a number of important offsetting factors which can work in the opposite direction. First, New Zealand is a net capital importer. To the extent that some firms invest capital abroad that would otherwise have been located in New Zealand, this provides scope for other firms to profitably increase their investment in New Zealand. Moreover, investment abroad and domestic activity in New Zealand are not necessarily substitutes. Investment abroad can be complementary with the demand for products from New Zealand. Moreover, there can a upgrading of the types of jobs being undertaken, with lower value-added tasks being moved offshore while R&D and higher value- added tasks increase in New Zealand. 2.25 For these reasons, the government believes that there is no strong reason to expect that measures to liberalise the tax treatment of outbound CFC income would reduce capital and productivity in New Zealand. Indeed, to the extent that they provide incentives for firms to locate or stay in New Zealand and to expand to exploit opportunities offshore, they are likely to have the opposite effect. 2.26 Even if New Zealand wanted to prevent outflows of capital from New Zealand, it is unclear that an internationally stringent tax treatment of outbound CFC income is in its best interests, given the real world flexibility for companies and workers to migrate to other countries. Put bluntly, firms can always choose to escape New Zealand tax by moving overseas (or perhaps never coming). A new paradigm for New Zealand 2.27 In the almost twenty years since New Zealand’s rules for taxing CFCs were developed, the world of international finance, investment and production has evolved considerably. FDI and exports of most OECD countries have increased significantly as a percentage of GDP, but New Zealand has not kept pace. There are many reasons for this situation. However, New Zealand stands out as the only country to tax offshore active income on accrual. 2.28 As noted by the Tax Review 2001, while the current system is conceptually attractive, its lack of conformity with international taxing norms puts pressure on the New Zealand tax system. There is a concern that it inhibits the internationalisation of New Zealand business. The current system risks inducing New Zealand businesses with significant international operations to migrate, and it could inhibit the development of multinational enterprises based in New Zealand. 2.29 On balance, the government believes that the current tax rules applying to CFCs are no longer well adapted to the world of international business. Accordingly, the government supports the introduction of an exemption for the offshore active income of CFCs. 15 2.30 There are two ways of implementing the exemption: • by deferring taxation of active income earned offshore until the profits are repatriated, with a credit for foreign taxes paid; or • by allowing a permanent exemption for offshore active income, with no taxation of subsequent dividends. 2.31 The Tax Review recommended a deferral, with credits for investments made outside of the grey list. However, there is considerable debate as to the effectiveness of the deferral-with-credit approach relative to the exemption method. Taxes that are imposed only when the dividend is repatriated may not be particularly effective because imposition is at the discretion of the company distributing the dividend. Attempts by countries to shore up their dividend taxation rules have been sources of tax system complexity and have been of limited effectiveness. 2.32 An exemption system would be simpler. It would go further in improving incentives for New Zealand-based firms to take advantage of international opportunities while remaining in New Zealand, and, it would go further in ensuring that such firms are able to compete and succeed on the world stage. 2.33 There is greater attraction to a permanent exemption for active income earned offshore. Adoption of this approach would require adequate confidence that it would not endanger the taxation of domestic-source income. Otherwise the taxation of dividends with credit might need to be examined further. 2.34 The Tax Review noted that an active income exemption should be enacted in a manner that does not jeopardise New Zealand’s domestic tax base. The government agrees. 2.35 A number of measures which are intended to ensure that the active income exemption did not result in an inappropriate reduction of New Zealand’s domestic tax base would form an integral part of any package introducing it. 2.36 The Tax Review referred specifically to an enhancement of the thin capitalisation rules as an area for development, and the discussion document examines some significant changes in this area. Consistent with the practice of many other OECD countries, offshore passive income would continue to be taxed on accrual, and its taxation could be extended with the elimination of the grey list exemption for such income. 16 CHAPTER 3 Implications for the international tax system of an active income exemption 3.1 A move to an exemption for active income earned offshore would represent a major shift in New Zealand’s international taxation paradigm. This chapter provides an overview of the implementation issues of such a shift. 3.2 The fundamental implementation concern is to ensure that the exemption is targeted to offshore active income in a manner which does not impose an undue compliance burden on New Zealand businesses. Rules to measure such income properly would form an integral part of providing the exemption. For example, rules would be required to distinguish active income from passive income and the thin capitalisation rules would have to be extended and amended. 3.3 A change in the paradigm would have significant implications for other features of the rules for taxing offshore income. Affected areas would include the taxation of dividends, the grey list, the conduit rules, the treatment of foreign branches and non-portfolio FIFs and the calculation of foreign tax credits. 3.4 Choices among alternative implementation options would involve trade-offs, as the various features are inter-related. Current approach to taxing offshore income 3.5 New Zealand’s current international taxation paradigm is based on comprehensive accrual taxation of offshore income. In principle, to the extent all income is considered to be taxable, all costs are deductible. 14 3.6 In practice, there are exceptions, and not all income is subject to full New Zealand taxation: • The grey list effectively exempts income earned in grey list countries from New Zealand taxation. • Application of foreign tax credits has the effect of removing some foreign income from taxation in New Zealand. • The conduit and DWP rules effectively lower the rate of tax applied to the offshore income of foreign-owned companies. 14 For example, in the thin capitalisation rules, which seek to protect the New Zealand base from excessive leveraging by foreign controlled companies, no adjustment is made to New Zealand equity for offshore investments by the New Zealand subsidiary. 17 3.7 As a consequence, limitations on the deduction of interest expenses are provided for in certain situations: • A limitation is imposed on foreign tax credit claims to ensure credits do not shelter domestic income from tax. In principle, the limitation is intended to restrict the claiming of interest deductions or foreign tax credits when money is borrowed to fund offshore investment giving rise to foreign tax credits. • Special thin capitalisation rules, which are intended to ensure that a disproportionate share of the interest costs are not applied against New Zealand-sourced income, apply to conduit and DWP companies. Thus interest costs are restricted when tax-reduced offshore investments are made. 3.8 In practice, however, these limitations to interest deductions are not particularly effective, given the safe-harbours and technical deficiencies in the rules. 3.9 On the other hand, no restriction on interest deductions applies with respect to dividends benefiting from the grey list underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) rules. 3.10 Furthermore, it is a reality of international taxation that there are, inevitably, asymmetries between the tax systems of different countries. These provide opportunities for deducting offshore financing costs from New Zealand income, while the foreign income is not subject to effective New Zealand taxation. For example, asymmetries can arise when countries have different definitions of “debt” and “equity”. Dividends arising from preferred shares may be treated as dividends receiving conduit relief in New Zealand, while being treated as interest and deductible in another country. The current system is vulnerable to such exploitation. 3.11 Therefore, while the current system has in place rules that are designed to attribute interest costs to foreign income when it faces lowered levels of New Zealand tax, they are not comprehensive and not particularly effective in practice. Considerations in designing an active income exemption 3.12 The change to an exemption for active income earned offshore would mean that borders would need to be defined between active and passive income, and between domestic and offshore income. Such distinctions inevitably involve a degree of complexity. In developing the rules, it would be necessary to make trade-offs between those protecting the tax base and maintaining a reasonable compliance burden for firms. The government’s ability to achieve the policy goal of exempting active business income from taxation would depend upon attaining an assurance that there were robust rules to prevent the erosion of the domestic tax base. 18 3.13 The different aspects of the tax system are linked and must be conceptually consistent for it to function properly. Decisions to relax the rules in one area implies that other features would need to be correspondingly tighter. 3.14 The crucial implementation trade-off would seem to be the precision with which the rules attempt to target the exemption to offshore active income versus the complexity of the rules. A more precise system would require more detailed and potentially more complex rules. A looser system, say, one using higher thresholds, might impose a lower compliance burden, but would be less cost-effective in delivering the intended policy as more room would be available for passive or domestic income to receive the benefit of the exemption intended for active offshore income. Lessons from international experience 3.15 There is considerable international experience in designing and implementing tax rules that distinguish between active and passive income. New Zealand can learn from that experience. 3.16 All OECD countries, except New Zealand, provide some form of tax relief for active business income that is earned abroad. In most cases, this treatment is not extended to passive income, and considerable efforts are made to ensure comprehensive domestic taxation of such income as it accrues. 3.17 The detailed features of the CFC rules of different countries vary considerably, as can be seen in the Appendix. 15 They have been developed over time and reflect trade-offs that responded to pressures and concerns which existed at that time and place. No single approach is clearly superior on all counts. 3.18 Therefore, while international experience and norms can greatly inform the New Zealand exercise, there is no consensus on the details of taxation of offshore income. New Zealand’s system will need to be developed to reflect the realities of its business environment and other features of its tax system. Decisions will be a pragmatic compromise between the policy goals of the new approach, protecting the New Zealand revenue base and keeping the administrative and compliance burden to a minimum. Moreover, as New Zealand’s economy and business activity evolves, any rules will need to be monitored to ensure that they remain appropriate for the changing environment in which New Zealand business operates. 15 The Appendix outlines the systems of a number of New Zealand’s major trading and investment partners. They demonstrate the variety of ways that different countries have chosen to deal with the implementation of an active income exemption. Reference to other countries’ rules throughout the discussion document have been chosen on the basis of interesting features of their taxation of offshore income. The description of CFC rules in different countries is based on a mixture of publicly available information (such as the websites of revenue agencies in Australia and the United Kingdom); OECD Studies in Taxation of Foreign Source Income – Controlled Foreign Company Legislation, OECD (1996); and Studies on International Fiscal Law, International Fiscal Association (2001). 19 Compliance concerns 3.19 Rules to tax and/or exempt offshore income are irreducibly complex, given the variety and complexity of international business arrangements. The rules must be written so that they can be applied to the myriad of transactions and business forms that firms adopt in relation to particular business situations. Therefore a new paradigm, with borders between active and passive income, together with other rules needed to target the exemption appropriately, would be unlikely to result in legislative simplification, indeed, it might result in the reverse. 3.20 In actual application, however, an active/passive distinction could be much simpler for the types of firms and activities which it seeks to benefit. A firm with genuinely active operations abroad would no longer need to face the calculation burden that exists under the current branch-equivalent rules. If dividends could be exempted, the firm would not need to comply with the DWP rules. The one area of extra complexity could be the extension of the thin capitalisation rules, although these rules would rely on domestically available information, and are reasonably straightforward. 3.21 Under the transactional method described in chapter 5, considerably more complexity would be faced by firms with a mix of active and passive income in a single subsidiary. Even so, they would have the opportunity to reduce this potential complexity by arranging their affairs accordingly – for example, by placing passive investments in separate, special purpose vehicles. In this way, the more complex aspects of the rules would provide a precautionary function, rather than being an integral part of most firms’ tax compliance. Major implementation concerns 3.22 The fundamental implementation concern is to ensure that the exemption is appropriately targeted to offshore active income and does not allow tax on domestic New Zealand income to be reduced. As noted earlier, the New Zealand tax system already faces challenges in fully taxing New Zealand- source income. Nevertheless, a general active income exemption would make resolving this problem more critical. Accordingly, the major design challenges (refer to figure 3, at the end of this chapter) are distinguishing active and passive income and ensuring the appropriate allocation of income and expenses between the domestic tax base and offshore. Distinguishing active and passive income 3.23 Most countries distinguish between the active and passive income of their CFCs. To protect the domestic taxation of investment income, passive income is commonly taxed as it accrues, with a credit for foreign taxes. The rationale is that offshore passive income is easily substituted for domestic investment income, with no fundamental change in the economic characteristics of the investment. Accrual taxation of passive income would be an essential part of protecting the New Zealand tax base. 20 3.24 Different approaches can be taken to distinguishing active from passive income. One approach, in principle, would be to define “active income” conceptually, based on criteria relating to the nature of the activities performed within the business. International experience suggests that this is a difficult border to police, creating uncertainty for businesses and exposing the tax system to significant erosion, as a small amount of activity can be attributed to what is, in fact, a passive investment. 3.25 New Zealand would adopt the international norm of defining passive income directly, by listing investments which are passive in nature. Other types of income could also be taxed on accrual – for example, some “active” income – so-called base company income – which could otherwise erode New Zealand’s tax base. 3.26 A critical question is whether passive income would be taxed on a transaction- by-transaction basis or by the characteristics of the entity (such as having a level of passive income above a prescribed amount). The former method is more consistent with the policy of restricting any exemption to active income. On the other hand, the entity approach appears, at first sight, to be simpler; particularly when it allows generous thresholds for passive income in “active” entities. However, a level of threshold under an entity approach which is too high could expose the New Zealand tax base to erosion. 3.27 These issues are discussed in chapters 4 and 5. Allocation of expenses 3.28 The appropriate measurement of offshore active income requires that costs which are associated with that income should be deducted against it and should not reduce income that is subject to tax in New Zealand. 3.29 The most significant example of this in the New Zealand tax system is the allocation of interest expense between taxable and tax-exempt activities. The rules applied to tax-reduced conduit income and the new minimum capital rules applied to foreign-owned banks provide a framework for how rules of more general application could be designed. With the provision of an active income exemption to all businesses, it would be appropriate to extend similar rules to all businesses making offshore investments. What level of safe- harbouring to provide would involve a trade-off between the proper measurement of New Zealand and offshore income and minimizing compliance burdens of businesses. 3.30 These issues are discussed in chapter 6. 21 Other implications of the new approach Taxation of dividends 3.31 The government favours an active income exemption without taxes being levied on subsequent dividends. However, it would proceed in this direction only if confident that the non-taxation of dividends would not lead to an erosion of tax on New Zealand-sourced income. If this confidence cannot be achieved, it would be necessary to determine whether taxation of repatriated dividends would continue to be required. Grey list 3.32 The repeal of the grey list exemption would be more consistent with active/passive CFC rules that focused on exempting active income rather than whether the income has been comparably taxed in the host country. On the other hand, a number of countries, including Australia, provide some form of grey list exemption for passive income. Conduit rules 3.33 The conduit rules were introduced in 1998 to remove the income tax liability of New Zealand companies on foreign income to the extent of their non- resident ownership. These rules were introduced as a result of the comprehensive nature of our CFC rules. 3.34 If foreign active income is no longer subject to accrual taxation, there will be no need for the conduit mechanism in relation to such income. At the same time, there is a strong case for removing the conduit mechanism in relation to foreign passive income, while subjecting it to accrual taxation. Taxation of foreign branches 3.35 A move to an active/passive distinction to the CFC rules may have implications on the way foreign branches should be taxed. A key consideration is trying to ensure that New Zealand-resident investors are not influenced by tax considerations in deciding whether to operate in a foreign jurisdiction through a subsidiary or a branch. Treatment of non-portfolio FIFs 3.36 Changes to our CFC rules are likely to have implications for the tax treatment of New Zealand residents who hold non-portfolio interests in FIFs. Ideally, non-portfolio investors in either CFCs or FIFs would all be subject to the same accrual rules. However, international practice is to distinguish between FIF and CFC interests in terms of implementing an active/passive distinction. 22 3.37 The tax treatment of offshore portfolio investments (with investor interests of less than 10 percent) is currently being reviewed. The possible changes described in this discussion document would not affect reforms that are already under way. Calculation of foreign tax credits 3.38 While active business income earned in CFCs would be exempt, some categories of income, such as passive income and income of foreign assets not held through an offshore branch, would continue to be taxed domestically. In that case, foreign tax credits would be provided. An important area for examination would be the allocation of costs to the foreign income for purposes of the limitation rules on foreign tax credits, to ensure that the credits did not effectively offset tax on domestic income.

Offshore active income would be exempt. 2. The broad international consensus to define passive income positively would be adopted, leaving active income as the residual undefined concept. 3. Passive income and base company income (collectively called “tainted income”) would continue to be taxed on accrual. 4. The main categories of tainted income would include: • Passive income: Dividends, interest, royalties and rents. It could include income which is passive in form but the derivation of which involves certain activity. • Base company income: Base company rules would be designed to counter situations where domestic income is shifted offshore to benefit from the active income exemption. Details of how the rules within this general framework might work are the subject of consultations and submissions. Distinguishing between active and passive income 4.1 Passive income generally comprises investment income which the investor does not actively participate in earning. Approach to defining the active/passive boundary 4.2 There is a question as to how the boundary should be defined. The general approach of many countries is to define passive income positively, with active income defined by default as any income falling outside the passive income definition. 4.3 The challenge of using a positive definition of passive income is that any item which is inherently passive but is omitted from the list will not be passive income for the purposes of the CFC rules, and will therefore be exempt from attribution. There may be drafting techniques, such as the use of an inclusive definition augmented by examples, which would minimise this risk. 24 4.4 The alternative, a positive definition of active income, may provide legislators with less control and certainty over the scope of the active income exemption than would occur under a positive definition of passive income. That is because even a small amount of “activity” associated with an inherently passive transaction would bring the transaction within the active income net. 4.5 On balance, the government considers it preferable to define passive income positively. Types of passive income 4.6 The following income types are generally considered to comprise passive income and would generally form part of any definition introduced in New Zealand. Potential exceptions to this approach are discussed later. Interest 4.7 Interest is generally considered to be part of passive income. 4.8 As a general proposition, a wide definition of “interest” would be required in this context – including income derived from a finance lease or other financial arrangements. Rents and royalties 4.9 Rent and royalties are generally considered to be passive income. Dividends 4.10 Dividends received by a CFC are generally considered to be passive income. 4.11 Australia excludes non-portfolio dividends paid to a CFC by a non-Australian resident company. It considers this exclusion to be a natural consequence of the general exemption for participation dividends. 16 If New Zealand exempted dividends (see chapter 7) it would be necessary to consider whether we should also follow the Australian approach to non-portfolio dividends earned by a CFC. 16 A participation dividend is a dividend paid by a foreign company to an Australian-resident company that has a 10 percent or greater interest in the voting power of that company. 25 Other passive income 4.12 In addition to the preceding categories of income, the following categories of income could be treated as passive: • Gains from commodities transactions. 17 The United States includes gains from commodities transactions unless they are part of hedging transactions connected to the CFC’s business. Australia also includes such gains, but there is an exception for CFCs that produce or process the commodity, or use the commodity as a raw material (and other conditions are satisfied). • Foreign currency gains. Australia, however, treats such gains as active in certain limited circumstances – for example, if the CFC was carrying on the business of currency trading and no other party to the transaction was an associate or Australian resident. • Income from annuities and insurance products. Base company income − active in form but subject to accrual taxation 4.13 CFCs engaged in nominally active business could be used to divert income that should properly be taxable as domestic income. The response of many countries (for example, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom in the context of their active business exemption) has been to carve out “base company income” from their active exemption. 4.14 Generally speaking, “base company income” refers to income derived by a CFC from selling property or providing services on behalf of the group of companies in a manner intended to avoid or defer domestic tax. An example would be a CFC of a New Zealand company that simply processed the paperwork for a sale from New Zealand to some third market, but captured a “marketing” margin which consisted of the bulk of the profits from the sale. The concern would be that the CFC had been established to avoid New Zealand tax. With a base company rule, the margin captured in the CFC would be “base company income” and would be attributable to the controlling New Zealand shareholders on accrual. 4.15 In principle, base company income rules should not apply to commercially driven transactions between New Zealand companies and their CFCs. It would be difficult to draw an appropriate boundary between legitimate commercial transactions and those that should be included within base company income. 17 Commodities transactions and foreign currency transactions fall within our financial arrangements rules. As such, any gain derived would be “interest”, and thus passive income, even in the absence of a specific rule related to these transactions. 26 4.16 Following international best practice, it would appear to be preferable for New Zealand to have base company income rules as part of a system having an active/passive distinction. There is, however, considerable variation in the design and implementation of base company rules internationally. 4.17 Generally, two major factors are relevant to the determination of base company income: the first is the geographical location of the transaction, and the second is the relationship of the parties to the transaction. Transactions with the domestic jurisdiction 4.18 Transactions by a CFC with the domestic jurisdiction of its controlling shareholder can clearly reduce the domestic tax base. For example, when a CFC provides services or sells property in the country in which its controlling shareholder is resident, the arrangement could result in an artificial reduction of domestic tax. The income derived by the CFC, unless the CFC has a permanent establishment in the domestic jurisdiction, will not be subject to any domestic tax. The concern is that the sale or services are, in reality, made or provided by the controlling shareholder, or other domestic subsidiary, and income which would be taxable in the domestic jurisdiction has been inappropriately converted to exempt foreign income. 4.19 The United Kingdom’s rules focus on transactions in the domestic jurisdiction. Under the United Kingdom’s rules, the active business exemption is denied if the CFC performs services in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a CFC whose main business consists of dealing in goods for delivery to or from the United Kingdom, unless the goods are physically delivered into the CFC’s country of residence, is excluded from the United Kingdom’s active business exemption. 4.20 Australia’s base company income definition is also focused on transactions in the domestic jurisdiction. These rules require income from the supply of services by a CFC to an Australian resident, or Australian permanent establishment of a non-resident, to fall prima facie within the definition of base company income. This is true whether the supply is to related or unrelated parties. In addition, in relation to sales transactions, Australia includes income derived when a related Australian resident or an Australian permanent establishment of a related non-resident either purchases the goods from the CFC or supplies goods to the CFC as prima facie base company income. Related party transactions 4.21 Some countries use their base company income concept to supplement their transfer pricing rules. When that happens, the focus is on transactions between related parties. 27 4.22 Countries vary, however, over whether income derived from related party transactions in a CFC’s local market should be outside the concept of base company income. Some countries consider that income from transactions in a CFC’s local market should be exempt because current domestic taxation on such income would adversely affect the ability of the CFC to compete there. However, when a CFC derives income outside its local market, current domestic taxation would not affect its ability to compete in its local market. 4.23 Under the United States’ rules, if a CFC purchases goods from a related party and sells the goods to any person, or purchases goods from any person and sells to a related party, the sales income will be prima facie base company income. However, the income derived will be excluded from base company income if the property purchased was manufactured, used or consumed in the CFC’s local jurisdiction. 4.24 Australia’s rules similarly provide an exemption for related party sales income. As already noted, income from the sales of goods is included within base company income when a related party resident in Australia or an Australian permanent establishment of a related non-resident is involved. However, the income derived will not be base company income if the CFC substantially alters, manufactures or produces the goods sold. 4.25 The United Kingdom takes a different approach. Under its rules, whether a transaction takes place in the CFC’s local market is irrelevant. If a CFC is primarily engaged in a wholesale, distributive, financial or service business, income from related parties could cause the CFC to be ineligible for the active business exemption, whether or not the transactions take place in the CFC’s local market. 4.26 It is reasonable that income derived by a CFC from related party transactions should be exempt if that income is a reflection of genuine business activity in the CFC’s local market. Even so, care must be taken in designing a test which cannot be easily manipulated. Interaction with transfer pricing rules 4.27 A key issue is how the base company income concept interacts with a country’s transfer pricing rules. Transfer pricing applies to transactions between related parties and seeks to determine correct prices with precision on a transaction by transaction basis. The base company rules apply to a wider set of circumstances, to groups of transactions, and have an anti-avoidance purpose. Base company income rules are generally viewed as a necessary reinforcement of the transfer pricing rules. 4.28 Take the example of NZ Co, a New Zealand-resident company which manufactures goods costing $10 (see figure 4). NZ Co sells the goods to its CFC, resident in a low-tax jurisdiction, for $11. The CFC then sells the goods to unrelated third parties for $20. 28 FIGURE 4 Example of base company income 4.29 One dollar of the profit from the sale is sourced in NZ Co, and $9 in the CFC. However, assume very little activity took place in the CFC to justify the profit sourced there. Say, for example, the arm’s length consideration for the supply by NZ Co to its CFC is determined to be $17. The result of the application of the transfer pricing rules, then, is that $7 of the profit will be taxable in NZ Co (and $3 in the CFC). Under the CFC rules, however, all the income derived by the CFC ($9) would be base company income and taxable on attribution to NZ Co in New Zealand. 4.30 The appropriate interaction between the base company income concept and New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules will have to be determined. Special cases − passive in form but with activity 4.31 The approach that New Zealand takes to various boundary issues should have regard for the New Zealand business environment. There may be times when it is appropriate for the new rules to depart from international norms. On the one hand, this may give rise to concerns that an over-cautious approach could inhibit the establishment of some new offshore activity that might otherwise develop. There are risks, however, associated with instituting an exemption that tries to anticipate changes to the current business environment. This section explores the question of when it might be appropriate to limit the active income exemption, recognising, however, that the active/passive boundary will need to evolve over time as New Zealand business conditions change. NZ Co CFC Unrelated third parties Profit = $1 Goods Profit = $9 $20Goods $11 Cost = $10 29 4.32 One issue on which New Zealand might depart from international norms is whether a CFC that is actively engaged in the business of earning a category of income that is typically passive (the classic example being interest earned by banks) should qualify for the active exemption. This issue is particularly problematic and is dealt with by countries in different ways for different types of passive income. 4.33 This section examines areas where businesses which arguably are active earn income which is passive in form. The question is whether the active income exemption should be extended to them. Banks and financial institutions 4.34 In the case of banks and other financial institutions, interest often would constitute active business income and should therefore be excluded from the definition of passive income. The problem is that interest earned by a CFC of a bank might be passive in nature. Therefore treating all interest of a bank as active income creates potential for an erosion of tax revenues because banks can be established in low-tax jurisdictions with minimum capital or presence in that jurisdiction. 4.35 For example, a bank could put a portfolio of its loans to non-residents into a CFC, effectively moving such loans out of the domestic tax base. Identifying such arrangements can be difficult, particularly if the CFC carries on some legitimate active banking business of its own. 4.36 A few countries attribute income derived by banks and other financial institutions. For instance, in Denmark, the CFC rules are targeted at income from financial activity (including insurance). An entity will be a CFC if its financial income is in excess of 33 1 / 3 percent of its gross income or its financial assets are in excess of 33 1 / 3 percent of its total assets. 4.37 Other countries provide exemptions for interest earned by banks. Australia exempts interest derived by financial institutions in principle, although such interest might still be attributable if it falls into the definition of base company income. Similarly, the United Kingdom exempts CFCs dealing in banking, deposit-taking, money-lending or similar activities in principle, but requires them to satisfy a complex capital structure test (as well as satisfying minimum presence and effective management requirements) in order to be eligible for the active business exemption. 4.38 If New Zealand had a local retail banking industry that operated offshore through CFCs there could be merit in extending the exemption to interest earned by these CFCs. However, it is difficult to design an appropriate exemption in anticipation of such an industry development. Moreover, there is a fiscal risk that such an exemption would be used to exempt interest not intended to be covered by the exemption. It is possible that the problems associated with attempting to design and institute a suitable exemption in a vacuum outweigh any potential benefits from providing such an exemption. 30 Inter-affiliate financing 4.39 Multinational groups will often be organised in such a way that one subsidiary operates as an intra-group financial centre, with loans from third parties channelled through the subsidiary to other group members. Those subsidiaries can be used to consolidate financial expertise in one specialist centre and manage intra-group financing transactions. In such situations, they might receive interest payments from other members of the group which are then consolidated and used to pay interest on the loans from third parties. 4.40 Without an exception to the general rule, those subsidiaries would be considered to be earning passive income and potentially taxed in New Zealand. 4.41 To relieve this taxation, it is sometimes suggested that the treatment of income received by a CFC from a related party borrower should be dependent on the origin of that income. Under this principle, interest that is received by a CFC from a loan to a related party borrower and deducted against active income of the borrower should be treated as active income of the recipient CFC. 4.42 The United States has an exclusion from passive income for inter-affiliate financing if certain “same country” (and other) conditions are met. Other countries (including Australia) always treat interest on loans to related parties as passive income. Implementing an inter-affiliate financing exception would necessarily be complex, given the fungibility of money and the complexity of intra-group financial arrangements. As such, the government does not favour exempting interest derived from inter-affiliate financing from accrual taxation. Income from insurance 4.43 Many countries consider the insurance industry to be another special case. As with banks and other financial institutions, countries vary in the way they treat the business of insurance. 4.44 The United Kingdom’s rules, in broad terms, provide that a CFC whose main business is insurance cannot be eligible for exemption unless less than 50 percent of its business is derived from the risks of related parties. Japan’s rules also require a CFC whose main business is insurance to conduct more than 50 percent of such business with unrelated parties for the CFC to be eligible for exemption. In Canada, income from insurance is prima facie attributable, but will qualify for exemption, if not related to the insurance of Canadian risks, if the CFC’s business is conducted principally with arm’s- length persons and more than five individual employees are employed full- time in the active conduct of the business. Australia has special rules for calculating the passive income of life assurance and general insurance CFCs. The effect of these rules, in broad terms, is to require attribution for income from assets held to meet liabilities on policies held by associates or Australian residents or that are in excess of the assets required to meet the liabilities referable to policies. Income from insurance can also fall within the definition of base company income in certain circumstances. 31 4.45 Concerns particularly arise when companies use offshore captive insurance companies to provide “insurance” for their operations. As the premiums for such insurance are deductible against domestic income, such companies can be used to shift income out of the domestic tax base. Management of real and other property 4.46 There is an argument that rent derived by a company actively engaged in owning and managing commercial property should be excluded from attribution. Similarly, royalties derived by a company engaged in owning and managing intellectual property could be said to constitute active business income and, arguably, should be excluded from attribution. 4.47 Countries vary in the way they treat rents and royalties derived from active management in their CFC rules. 4.48 The United Kingdom takes a strict approach and treats rent and royalties as always passive: a CFC whose main business is holding intellectual property or leasing any property or rights will not qualify for exemption. 4.49 The United States treats rents and royalties as active if they are: • derived by a CFC in the active conduct of a business, if derived from unrelated parties; or • for the use of property within the CFC’s jurisdiction, if derived from related parties. 4.50 Australia provides an exemption for property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. However, to be exempt, a substantial part of the rental income must be attributable to the provision of labour-intensive property management services in connection with the land by the CFC. Australia also provides an exemption for royalties received from unrelated parties if derived in the course of carrying on a business and either the property or right in respect of which the royalty is consideration originated with the CFC, or the CFC substantially develops, alters, or improves the property or right for which the royalty is paid. 4.51 While there is a conceptual argument to exempt rents and royalties that are actively managed, it would be extremely difficult to administer a boundary that has the more general “active business” exemptions used in the United States and Australia. (There is already concern that intellectual property is being moved offshore to reduce New Zealand taxation.) It would appear preferable to follow the United Kingdom’s approach and treat all rent and royalties as passive. 32 Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters, in particular: • whether positively defining passive income, with active income defined by default as the remainder, is appropriate; • the appropriate scope of the definition of “tainted income”: – the list of passive income to be included (interest, dividends, royalties and rent); – treatment of a CFC which is actively engaged in the business of earning a category of income that is typically passive; and – extent of base company rules. 33 CHAPTER 5 The transactional and entity approaches Possible approaches The government could adopt one of two approaches to attributing the income of a CFC to its resident shareholders: • The transactional approach examines each item of income derived by a CFC to determine whether it produces tainted income or non-tainted income. Accordingly, different income streams of the CFC attract different treatment depending upon their category; or • The entity approach looks at whether the company is active or passive. Once categorised, then all of the income of the company is taxed in the corresponding manner, regardless of the nature of the income derived. Details on how the rules within this general framework might work are the subject of consultations and submissions. Attribution of profits using the transactional approach 5.1 Australia and the United States apply a transactional approach to income of CFCs. Under this approach, the shareholder in the CFC is attributed certain “tainted” income of the CFC as it is earned by the CFC. Income is designated as tainted income if it is passive investment income or base company income. 5.2 The transactional approach has the attraction of being the most precise approach to achieve the policy goal of exempting active business income. This is because the obligation to attribute income arises only in relation to those sources of income that are viewed as passive or base company, and so susceptible to manipulation. 5.3 The main disadvantage that the Tax Review 2001 saw with the transactional approach was that it would seem to impose some significant compliance and administrative costs – relative to the entity approach. As will be explored in more detail later, this conclusion must be qualified by comparing the intended precision of the implementation. 5.4 Complexity arises in part because each transaction of a CFC must be considered to determine on which side of the tainted/non-tainted boundary it falls. 34 5.5 Complexity is also associated with attribution of income to shareholders under the transaction approach when the CFC derives a mix of tainted and non- tainted income. This complexity stems from the requirement to allocate expenses and foreign tax credits to that tainted income. 5.6 For instance, to calculate the amount of income that should be attributed to the shareholder, it would be necessary to calculate the expenses of the CFC that are deductible in earning that income. This might require some apportionment when expenditure is incurred by the CFC for the purposes of earning both tainted and non-tainted income. 5.7 Similarly, if the CFC has paid tax in the foreign jurisdiction in respect of all its income, those foreign taxes would need to be allocated between the tainted and non-tainted income. That would be necessary to determine the amount of the underlying foreign tax credit available to the New Zealand shareholder for the tainted income. 5.8 Considerable complexity arises in the systems of other countries when an attempt is made to tax the income as it is distributed to the shareholder (with a credit for tax previously paid as the income accrued). If a system of taxing the tainted income once, as it accrues, were implemented, this area of complexity would be avoided. 5.9 Finally, if the CFC has passive losses, those losses would need to be separately calculated and ring-fenced to be set off against future passive income of the CFC, consistent with current law. These losses would not be deductible against the domestic income of the New Zealand-resident controlling shareholders. Active losses would similarly need to be ring-fenced from passive and domestic income. Hybrid transactional approaches 5.10 Australia introduces an element of an entity approach in conjunction with its transactional approach when the proportion of tainted income is very low (a minimum threshold rule). The United States has both a minimum threshold and a maximum threshold rule. 5.11 The concept of a minimum threshold is that a taxpayer should be able to avoid the compliance features of a transactional approach when the proportionate amount of tainted income is small. Australia has an active income exemption if (among other things 18 ) less than 5 percent of a CFC’s gross turnover is tainted income. In that case, none of its income is attributed. 5.12 In principle, this minimum threshold seems to be a sensible simplification measure. Active businesses may legitimately derive small amounts of tainted income, such as interest on bank deposits, and should not be required to incur the compliance costs of attribution in relation to that small amount. 18 There are additional requirements that the CFC has a permanent establishment, has kept accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (which are satisfied if it complies with the accounting standards applicable in the CFC’s country of residence), and it has complied with certain substantiation requirements. 35 5.13 The main downside of a minimum threshold exemption is that it still has the potential to facilitate the erosion of the domestic tax base, using a CFC earning mostly active income, up to the minimum threshold. Also, if the threshold is set as a proportionate amount, the size of the exemption could, arguably, be too generous, depending on the size of the CFC. These concerns may be dealt with by limiting the exemption to tainted income sourced outside New Zealand from unrelated parties. 5.14 The United States uses a maximum threshold approach in relation to foreign base company income. If foreign base company income exceeds 70 per cent of the total income of the CFC, all of the income of the CFC is subject to attribution. This type of rule also has merit – particularly if used in tandem with a minimum threshold rule. Attribution of profits using the entity approach 5.15 Many European countries, including the United Kingdom, implement their CFC rules using an “entity approach”, best described as an “all or nothing” approach. In other words, if the CFC satisfies an active business test, none of the income earned by the entity is attributed to the shareholder of the CFC on an accrual basis. 5.16 Countries which use the entity approach exempt CFCs primarily engaged in active business. Eligibility is often determined by focusing on whether: • The CFC has a substantial presence in the jurisdiction. • The income derived by the CFC is from activities in its country of residence. • The business of the CFC is mainly “active”. • The CFC deals with unrelated parties. As such, eligibility requirements for exemption under an entity approach incorporate features that are analogous to the definition of base company income under a transactional approach. Substantial presence 5.17 Many countries (including the United Kingdom) require a CFC to have a substantial presence in its local jurisdiction for the CFC to qualify for their active business exemption. This is designed to prevent “letter-box” CFCs from being eligible for exemption. The test focuses on whether the CFC has permanent business premises in its jurisdiction of residence for use in carrying on its business. This may depend on whether the CFC has sufficient employees in that jurisdiction to conduct its business. It may also depend on whether the CFC has effective management and control of its own business. 36 Income derived from country of residence 5.18 Some countries also require the CFC to earn its income (or a certain percentage of its income) in the country of residence. The idea behind this requirement is that a CFC which primarily derives its income in its jurisdiction of residence is likely to have legitimate reasons for its presence in that jurisdiction. Active business criteria 5.19 The requirement that the business of the CFC be active has two key elements under the entity approach. The first element is the identification of the types of activity that will qualify as active. The second element is the requirement that the qualifying activity be the primary or main business of the CFC. 5.20 Identifying the types of qualifying activity is sometimes implemented by positively defining active businesses (such as manufacturing or agriculture). For example, the French exemption is limited to CFCs principally engaged in manufacturing or production, services or the purchase of goods for sale or lease. Finland limits its exemption to CFCs whose income is principally derived from industrial or any other comparable production activities or shipping activities, or sales and marketing related to those activities. 5.21 Alternatively, countries can positively define passive activities (such as investing or leasing). For instance, the United Kingdom’s exemption is not available to CFCs whose main business is investment. This includes the holding of securities or intellectual property, dealing in securities other than as a broker, leasing, or “money box” functions. Similarly, Japan excludes from exemption a CFC whose main business is investment – holding stocks, bonds or debentures, providing patents, other rights regarding intellectual property, and leasing ships or aircraft. 5.22 Countries have different approaches to determining whether the qualifying/disqualifying activity is the principal activity of the CFC. In the United Kingdom, the “main business” of the CFC must not be an “investment business”. The term “main business” is not defined. Comparative turnover, profitability and capital investment in different activities are taken into account in applying this test. Japan also refers to the “main business” being other than the non-qualifying activities – without specifically defining the term “main business”. Portugal requires 75 percent of income to be from the permissible activity. 5.23 A related issue is whether the threshold for tainted income should be set as a proportionate amount – as is the case in Portugal and France. That would mean that the quantum of tainted income that escapes attribution would depend on the size of the CFC. Arguably, this raises equity concerns because large operations will be able to shelter much more passive income than smaller operations. 37 5.24 Finally, there would need to be rules for dealing with CFCs that moved above or below the threshold, and therefore in and out of the exemption, across income years. Transactions with unrelated parties 5.25 Countries usually require that the income, or a sufficient proportion of income, derived by a CFC should be derived from transactions with unrelated parties. If a CFC deals primarily with related parties the CFC is considered to be more likely to be a tax-avoidance vehicle used to divert income which should be properly taxable in the country where the controlling shareholders are resident. For example, the United Kingdom’s rules exempt CFCs whose main business is “wholesale, distributive, financial or services business” but only where 50 percent or more of the CFC’s gross trading receipts from that business are derived from unrelated parties (and certain specified unconnected United Kingdom companies and individuals). Level of threshold 5.26 Countries typically provide that an entity is “active” if it is primarily (50 percent or more) engaged in earning active income. Such a test could in principle be applied using ratios of gross or net income, or assets. Consideration also could be given to using a lower threshold, say 25 percent, for passive income in categorising the entity. In that case a CFC would be taxed on accrual if its percentage of passive income or assets exceeded 25 percent of the total. Evaluating the transactional and entity approaches 5.27 On the surface, the entity approach is considered to be simpler than the transactional method. However, much of this apparent simplicity arises because passive income thresholds used to determine what qualifies as a passive entity are typically much higher (around 50 percent) than the minimum thresholds under which the transactional method does not apply. If approaches with a similar level of precision are compared, then, the apparent differences in complexity between them cease to be significant. 5.28 The entity approach appears technically simpler because, within the firm, there are none of the apportionment or allocation issues in relation to expenditure or foreign tax credits. Arguably, an entity system which sought to segregate active and passive income with the same precision as is theoretically possible with a transactional approach would involve a similar level of technical complexity. 5.29 Most of the complexity concerns associated with a transactional approach have direct analogues in an entity system. 38 5.30 For example, under an entity approach applied to a group with a mix of active and passive subsidiaries, the same allocation concerns arise if costs, such as interest, are disproportionately allocated to the passive subsidiary. 5.31 If dividends from passive income were to be taxed when the income was repatriated, the character of the underlying income and taxes paid with respect to different streams of income would need to be tracked through chains of subsidiaries. 5.32 From a taxpayer perspective, the disadvantage of an entity approach that has a low tolerance of passive income is that if the entity fails the active entity test, all of its non-tainted income is attributable to the shareholder. On the other hand, from the point of view of the government, a problem with a fairly generous threshold of passive income would arise if the entity passed the active entity test and none of its tainted income was attributed to the shareholder. 5.33 The critical question is how much tainted income should be allowed to accumulate in the active CFC under the entity approach. As discussed in chapter 3, a key issue in the design of CFC rules is prevention of the erosion of the New Zealand tax base by accrual of untaxed tainted income in CFCs. If tolerance of tainted income is too high, achieving that objective is seriously compromised. Submission points Submissions are sought on problems that might arise if: • a transaction approach is adopted to determine the income of a CFC that must be attributed to resident shareholders as it accrues in the CFC; or • an entity approach is adopted to determine the income of a CFC that must be attributed to resident shareholders as it accrues in the CFC. 39 CHAPTER 6 Interest allocation and transfer pricing rules Possible changes 1. The current thin capitalisation rules would be: • extended to cover all New Zealand entities with outbound investments, taking into account the compliance cost considerations; • modified to deal with outbound investments in CFCs; and • reviewed to ensure that the safe harbour ratio is appropriate. 2. Technical aspects of the thin capitalisation rules would be reviewed to make them consistent with the minimum capital requirement rules for banks. 3. The transfer pricing rules would be strengthened by shifting the burden of proof on transfer pricing matters from the tax administration to taxpayers. Details of how the rules within this general framework might work are the subject of consultations and submissions. Interest allocation in multinational companies and taxation of New Zealand income 6.1 A number of interest allocation rules have already been introduced into the tax legislation in an attempt to address the interest allocation problem presented by multinational companies. These rules, which include the general thin capitalisation rules for foreign controlled entities, conduit company interest allocation rules and the minimum capital requirement rules for New Zealand banking groups, are intended to limit the interest costs that multinational companies can claim against their New Zealand-sourced income. Current general thin capitalisation rules 6.2 The overall objective of the general thin capitalisation rules is to protect the New Zealand tax base against excessive interest deductions. This is achieved by requiring certain multinational groups to allocate their global interest costs in accordance with their worldwide gearing ratio. Thus, the rules are intended to ensure that New Zealand does not bear a disproportionate share of the global interest costs of multinational groups. 40 6.3 The general thin capitalisation rules apply to foreign controlled entities: non- residents operating in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, New Zealand companies controlled by a single non-resident, and certain forms of trust. That is because such entities, being controlled by a single non-resident, could thinly capitalise their New Zealand operations to reduce their New Zealand tax without any effective commercial constraint. 6.4 Under the current rules, interest deductions for an entire New Zealand group are examined, but are not challenged if its group debt percentage does not exceed 75 percent (a debt to equity ratio of 3:1 for the entire New Zealand group). If the group’s total debt-to-asset percentage exceeds the safe harbour ratio, allowable interest deductions for the group will be limited to the higher of a level consistent with 75 percent group debt percentage or 110 percent of its worldwide group debt percentage. The interest allocation problem under active income exemption 6.5 Exempting foreign active income would exacerbate the interest allocation problem that the current thin capitalisation rules aim to resolve. Under the proposed active/passive rules, the active income of CFCs would no longer be taxable in New Zealand. To the extent that New Zealand has a higher tax rate than the jurisdiction in which the CFC is located, the revised rules would also create an incentive for firms to allocate their interest costs against New Zealand income as opposed to the tax-exempt foreign income. This can be done by the parent company financing investments in active CFCs in the form of equity, as opposed to debt. 6.6 In the example in figure 5, a New Zealand entity, NZ Co, has $2,000 capital, made up of $1,000 equity and $1,000 loan (with 10 percent interest). NZ Co made a domestic profit of $100 and a $1,000 outbound investment in a CFC which generates a profit of $100, and is funded purely by way of equity. Table 6.1 shows that if the income of the CFC is not taxable in New Zealand, NZ Co could allocate its entire financing costs against its New Zealand domestic income, even though half of its income is exempt active income of a CFC. In this case, the exemption of foreign income could lead to an erosion of the New Zealand-sourced income as the overall profits of NZ Co are reduced to zero by the over-allocation of its global interest costs. 41 FIGURE 5 Interest allocation problem under active income exemption NZ Co CFC EquityDebt $1,000$1,000 @ 10% interest Equity$,1,000NZ OVERSEAS Profits $100 Profits $100 T ABLE 6.1 Existing thin capitalisaiton rules: New Zealand tax calculation Domestic income 100.00 CFC income – exempt - 100.00 Interest cost (100.00) Net income - New Zealand tax Nil New Zealand income is entirely sheltered 6.7 Current thin capitalisation rules would not deal with this concern, for three reasons. First, the general thin capitalisation rules apply only to foreign controlled entities. The scope is too narrow as it does not apply to all entities with investments in CFCs that would have access to the active income exemption. 6.8 Second, these rules limit total debt of the New Zealand group as a fraction of total assets, whether the assets are employed domestically or overseas. This means that the New Zealand group effectively takes on the debt funding costs of the assets employed to generate foreign income. This would create a mismatch between deducting the interest costs and exempting the associated income. By contrast, the thin capitalisation rules for banks and conduit companies, in effect, limit the level of debt and interest deductions on the basis of assets employed to generate taxable income in New Zealand. 42 6.9 Third, the general thin capitalisation rules contain a 75 percent debt-to-asset safe harbour ratio. This ratio is used as a compliance cost reduction mechanism for foreign controlled entities under the current rules. However, if the ratio is applied to entities with outbound investments, it would allow these entities to claim full interest deductions in New Zealand up to the 75 percent debt-to-asset ratio while earning a significant amount of tax-exempt income offshore. In this sense, the safe harbour ratio would operate more as a concession than a compliance cost reduction mechanism if applied to entities with outbound investments. Policy considerations in the development of general thin capitalisation rules 6.10 To provide greater protection for the domestic tax base, it would be necessary to extend and strengthen the general thin capitalisation rules. The following sections set out the main policy concerns that would have to be resolved if the general thin capitalisation rules were to provide the necessary safeguards to New Zealand’s tax base under an active income exemption. Extending the thin capitalisation rules to entities with outbound investments 6.11 There is a case for applying the general thin capitalisation rules to non-foreign controlled entities with outbound investments. These rules would protect New Zealand’s tax base by ensuring that the global interest costs of companies with outbound investments were allocated in proportion to their worldwide debt ratio. However, companies with no outbound investments would not be subjected to these rules. Australia has a comprehensive set of interest allocation rules for entities with outbound investments based on the worldwide debt ratio. 19 6.12 The rules would not be unduly restrictive on the financing methods that entities use for their outbound investments because interest costs would be allocated by reference to their worldwide debt ratio. Compliance cost considerations 6.13 The compliance costs that could be imposed by the thin capitalisation rules are an important consideration. 6.14 The current thin capitalisation rules apply to foreign controlled entities and are designed to deal with these entities specifically. Extending the thin capitalisation rules to domestic entities with outbound investments would require a careful consideration of the differences between these entities. 19 The interest allocation rules used in Australia limit the allowable debt (and interest) of outward investing entities (an Australian entity that has a permanent establishment overseas or a 10 percent or more controlling interest in an Australian controlled foreign entity) and their associates to the maximum of the safe harbour ratio, the arm’s length amount and the worldwide gearing debt amount. 43 6.15 For foreign controlled entities, relying solely on the worldwide debt ratio as a benchmark for interest allocation could be problematic as the balance sheet information required is not located within New Zealand. On the other hand, domestic entities in New Zealand would not face similar obstacles in accessing the balance sheet information needed to apply the worldwide debt ratio. 6.16 Compliance cost-reduction measures would be investigated to ensure that entities that already use a funding structure that is consistent with the worldwide gearing ratio would not be required to apply the thin capitalisation rules. In addition, other thresholds could be developed to ensure that domestic companies with a small amount of outbound investments would not be required to apply the thin capitalisation rules. Entities with outbound investments in passive CFCs 6.17 The interest allocation problem for non-foreign controlled entities is most evident when the outbound investments are in tax-exempt CFCs, as illustrated in the example in figure 5. The treatment of passive investments under the extended thin capitalisation rules would have to be considered carefully. On the one hand, passive investments would be taxable in New Zealand, and interest incurred on behalf of these investments should be deductible in New Zealand. On the other hand, foreign tax credits would be provided to offset the New Zealand tax liabilities on passive income, and the calculation of these foreign tax credits should, in theory, take into account an appropriate share of the interest costs so that New Zealand does not bear both the interest costs as well as the foreign tax credits associated with passive investments. 6.18 Australia does not provide special rules for entities with outbound passive investments. Interest costs incurred by Australian entities with respect to CFCs with passive investments are subject to the thin capitalisation rules, while the passive income is also taxed on accrual. Adjustment for equity investments in CFCs 6.19 The general thin capitalisation rules limit total debt of New Zealand companies as a fraction of total assets. Assets for the purpose of these rules are measured on the basis of generally accepted accounting practice. Debts are defined as all financial arrangements that provide funds to the taxpayer and give rise to an allowable deduction. 6.20 In effect, the restriction imposed by the current thin capitalisation rules is determined by reference to a ratio and can be summarised as follows: TD / TA where TD is total debts TA is total assets 44 This formula does not distinguish between assets that have been used domestically or overseas. 20 New Zealand firms would be allowed to have more debts against their New Zealand income for every dollar of assets invested. 6.21 Under the current thin capitalisation rules, if foreign active income were exempt, firms could effectively deduct interest costs attributable to their overseas CFCs against New Zealand income. To prevent this, an adjustment would be needed to the thin capitalisation rules for the equity invested in an offshore CFC. Similar adjustments are also made in the interest allocation rules for conduit companies and the minimum capital requirement rules that apply to New Zealand banking groups. 6.22 In principle, the restriction imposed by the revised thin capitalisation rules would be determined by reference to: TD / (TA-CFC) where TD is total debts TA is total assets CFC is the equity investment in CFCs 6.23 The revised thin capitalisation rules would make specific adjustments to account for equity investments in the CFCs. Table 6.2 summarises the impact of the specific adjustments for NZ Co in the example in figure 5. With this adjustment its total asset base would be reduced from $2,000 to $1,000. Ignoring the safe harbour ratio for this example, a worldwide ratio of 50 percent would apply. NZ Co would be allowed to have an interest deduction of $50, instead of the full $100. T ABLE 6.2 Revised thin capitalisation rules: New Zealand tax calculation Domestic income 100.00 CFC income – exempt - 100.00 Deductible interest 1 (50.00) Net income 50.00 New Zealand tax at 33% 16.50 1 New Zealand group debt percentage: TD/(TA–CFC) = $1,000/($2,000–$1,000) = 100%, using the 50% worldwide debt percentage, 50% of interest costs would be deductible. 20 This formula is a highly simplified example and does not take into account other adjustments such as the on- lending concession. 45 Safe harbour ratio 6.24 The effects of the safe harbour ratio in the current thin capitalisation rules would have to be considered if these rules were to apply to New Zealand entities with outbound investments. With the safe harbour ratio, the interest deductions of New Zealand entities would not be restricted if their total debt- to-asset percentage does not exceed 75 percent. This is considered a compliance cost reduction measure under the current rules but it would have more significant effects when applied to entities with outbound investments. 6.25 The example in figure 6 illustrates the operation of the safe harbour ratio in the case of a New Zealand company with a debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent initially when it is purely a domestic company. If the company is undertaking outbound investment, it could make equity investments in active CFCs of up to $66 without triggering the thin capitalisation rules because of the 75 percent safe harbour ratio, even after the adjustment for outbound investments discussed in the previous section. F IGURE 6 Impact of safe harbour ratio NZ Co EquityDebt $100$100 NZ Co Active CFC EquityDebt $100$100 $66 equity investment (a) Initial - no outbound(b) With outbound NZ OVERSEAS 6.26 The example in figure 6 shows that a New Zealand company (assuming that it has a 50 percent debt-to-asset ratio currently) could move 33 percent of its total assets (or $66 in the example) offshore to an active CFC and still stay within the 75 percent safe harbour ratio. This means that the income from those investments would not be taxed in New Zealand, while the interest costs associated with the investments would be deductible against New Zealand income. 46 6.27 In effect, when the thin capitalisation rules are applied to entities with outbound investments, the safe harbour operates as a concession for these entities. The benefits would vary depending on the existing debt-to-asset ratio of the New Zealand firms – the safe harbour benefits New Zealand firms that have low debt-to-asset ratios more than those firms that are already highly geared. Is the 75 percent safe harbour ratio appropriate? 6.28 A safe harbour ratio that is too high would allow New Zealand entities to restructure their affairs to achieve a tax advantage and result in under-taxation of these entities. Conversely, a safe harbour ratio that is too restrictive might impose unnecessary compliance and administrative costs. 6.29 Although it is common practice to have a safe harbour, the level of the safe harbour ratio is set differently in different countries. The United States adopts a 60 percent debt-to-asset safe harbour ratio under its earnings stripping rules. Germany lowered its safe harbour debt-to-asset ratio for thin capitalisation rules from 75 percent to 60 percent in 2001, although it has kept the 75 percent ratio for holding companies. Australia uses a 75 percent safe harbour ratio. 6.30 The safe harbour ratio of 75 percent under the current interest allocation rules is relatively high compared with debt limitations that are commonly found in commercial debt contracts. Empirical evidence from commercial public debt contracts, such as debentures, tends to require New Zealand borrowers to maintain a maximum 60 percent debt-to-tangible-asset ratio. 21 6.31 Furthermore, as New Zealand has a high level of foreign direct investment from Australia, a lower safe harbour ratio could be justified. Australian controllers of New Zealand entities would prefer to pay tax in Australia to maximise the franking credits that they can attach to dividends to Australia shareholders. 6.32 Practical, anecdotal experience in the administration of the current safe harbour ratio suggests that some overseas controlled New Zealand entities have been taking advantage of it by gearing their New Zealand operations up to the allowable debt limit, thereby reducing the tax they pay in New Zealand. 6.33 On balance, it would appear appropriate to lower the existing safe harbour ratio. Businesses operating in an environment requiring higher leverage could continue to operate at a level consistent with their worldwide group debt percentage. 21 Law, S., The choice of fixed accounting ratios as safe harbours in thin capitalisation rules – some guidance from commercial debt contracts, Australian Tax Forum 21 (2006), pp 363-386. 47 Design issues 6.34 A number of other design issues are being considered in the development of the general thin capitalisation rules that would apply to foreign controlled entities, as well as to non-foreign controlled entities with outbound investments. 110 percent loading on worldwide group debt ratio 6.35 Under the current thin capitalisation rules, if an entity has breached the safe harbour ratio, it is further protected by the 110 percent loading on the worldwide group debt percentage. The example in figure 7 illustrates the operation of the 110 percent loading for a company with outbound investments in an active CFC, assuming that there is a safe harbour of 75 percent and adjustments are made for outbound investments, as discussed earlier. 6.36 In this example, the company’s group debt-to-asset ratio exceeds the 75 percent safe harbour. As its worldwide group debt percentage is 80 percent, the 110 percent loading will allow the company to take 88 percent of its global interest costs ($352 of a total of $400) as deductible, while only 80 percent of its income ($400 over a total of $500) would be taxable in New Zealand (see Table 6.3). F IGURE 7 Impact of 110 percent loading in worldwide debt ratio NZ Co CFC EquityDebt $1,000$4,000 @ 10% interest Equity$1,000 NZ OVERSEAS Profits $100 Profits $400 48 TABLE 6.3 Impact of 110 percent loading on worldwide debt ratio Domestic income 400.00 CFC income – exempt - 400.00 Deductible interest (352.00) Net income 48.00 New Zealand tax at 33% 15.84 6.37 In principle, the worldwide gearing amount should be the appropriate benchmark for allocation of global interest costs. When the worldwide gearing ratio represents the average gearing over a range of industries and the New Zealand business is substantially different from the worldwide group, the worldwide gearing ratio may not be entirely appropriate. This could result in either an over-allocation or an under-allocation and does not really justify the use of the 110 percent loading. Australia is the only other country that uses the worldwide group debt ratio as a benchmark in its interest allocation rules for outbound entities. It does not use the 110 percent loading. Consistency with the minimum capital requirement rules for banks 6.38 For the purpose of the current thin capitalisation rules, assets are measured on the basis of generally accepted accounting practice. In addition, worldwide group debt percentage ratios are calculated on a consolidated basis, taking into account generally accepted accounting practice and the financial reporting standards of the country which are applied in the preparation of a group’s consolidated financial accounts. Debts are defined as all financial arrangements that provide funds to the taxpayer and give rise to an allowable deduction. This mixture of concepts can lead to a mismeasurement of the true debt-to-assets ratio of the company. 6.39 To ensure consistent comparisons, the government made specific adjustments to these concepts of assets and equity/debt when the minimum capital requirement rules were developed for banks, in legislation that was enacted last year. It would be appropriate to align these aspects of the current thin capitalisation rules with similar concepts adopted under the minimum capital requirement rules for banks. This would also take into account the impact of international financial reporting standards – for example, in the way goodwill is treated under generally accepted accounting practice. 49 6.40 The adjustments that would be considered for the purpose of the general thin capitalisation rules include: • Definition of liabilities – the scope of the definition of liabilities could be examined to ensure that all ‘debts’ are included for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. • Goodwill – goodwill could be excluded from the asset base for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. • Foreign tax credits – foreign investments that generate foreign tax credits could be excluded from the New Zealand asset base for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. • Preference shares – instruments such as preference shares that are equity in legal form but are debt in economic substance could be treated as debt for the purpose of the thin capitalisation rules. Other miscellaneous issues 6.41 Non-residents with investments in New Zealand generating New Zealand- sourced income without using a fixed establishment are subject to New Zealand tax. For example, non-residents who own land in New Zealand earning rental income are taxable on their New Zealand-sourced rental income. Interest costs incurred by these non-residents are deductible against the rental income. The current thin capitalisation rules do not work properly for investments by non-residents when there is no fixed establishment in New Zealand. This aspect of the existing rules should be examined. 6.42 The amount of debt that New Zealand groups are allowed to have under the existing thin capitalisation rules is increased by the amounts that have been on- lent. This on-lending concession applies to funding provided by the New Zealand groups to non-residents, third party borrowers or certain related party borrowers. The application of these on-lending concessions would be reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate under the revised thin capitalisation rules. 6.43 Conduit companies are provided with a tax relief for foreign income earned on behalf of their non-resident shareholders. Such companies are subjected to interest allocation rules. If the conduit rules are repealed, as discussed in chapter 7, it would not be necessary to retain the interest allocation rules for conduit companies. If the conduit rules are retained in whatever form, the interest allocation rules for conduit companies will have to be modified accordingly. 50 Transfer pricing issues 6.44 The existing transfer pricing rules provide another, and a more general, method for dealing with inappropriate erosion of the domestic tax base that could arise from an active income exemption. These transfer pricing rules require all transactions between New Zealand businesses and their foreign affiliates to be carried out under arm’s length conditions. The arm’s length standard provides a necessary safeguard against erosion of the New Zealand tax base by ensuring that foreign affiliates’ profits are commensurate with their assets, functions and risks. 6.45 The active income exemption would increase the incentives for New Zealand businesses to shift profits offshore (either by moving global expenses to New Zealand or moving income offshore). That would probably put more pressures on the current transfer pricing rules and transfer pricing audit resources. An amendment to shift the burden of proof on transfer pricing matters to taxpayers would be necessary to strengthen the protection that the rules could provide. Burden of proof 6.46 Taxpayers have an obligation to determine the appropriate arm’s length transfer prices. To challenge the transfer prices adopted by taxpayers the tax administration has to demonstrate that better transfer prices exist (unless the taxpayers do not co-operate with the Commissioner’s administration of the transfer pricing rules). The “burden of proof” lies with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 6.47 The existing burden of proof requirement is workable at present because the comprehensive CFC rules provide the first line of defence against inappropriate transfer pricing behaviour. The transfer pricing rules would be under more pressure if the active income exemption were to be introduced. As such, the requirement for the tax administration to discharge the burden of proof might become impractical in this new environment. 6.48 The requirement for the taxpayer to discharge the burden of proof is not uncommon internationally. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia place the initial burden of proof on taxpayers when dealing with transfer pricing matters. Taxpayers in these countries are required to make transfer pricing adjustments, taking into account the arm’s length principle, under a self-assessment system. 6.49 It would therefore be appropriate to shift the burden of proof from the tax administration to the taxpayers. This would be more consistent with the placement of the burden of proof on tax matters generally. 51 6.50 At the same time, it would be necessary to take special care and to use restraint in relying on the burden of proof in the course of the examination of a transfer pricing case because of the difficulties with transfer pricing analyses. The tax administration should be prepared to justify its choice of transfer price in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, even if the burden of proof is on the taxpayer. Submission points Submissions are invited on the following issues: • What business and compliance cost concerns would arise if the general thin capitalisation rules were extended to all New Zealand entities with outbound investments? • Should any distinction between foreign-controlled and domestic entities be taken into account in the thin capitalisation rules? • What business and compliance cost concerns would arise if the safe harbour ratio in the thin capitalisation rules were lowered? • What are the concerns if the burden of proof on transfer pricing matters were shifted to the taxpayers? 52 CHAPTER 7 Implications for the taxation of dividends and other international tax rules Possible changes 1. A key issue is whether dividends from CFCs should continue to be taxed. The government is more attracted to the exemption method provided such an exemption would not lead to erosion of the New Zealand tax base. 2. Repeal of the grey list exemption and conduit rules would be consistent with an active/passive distinction that focuses on exempting active income rather than whether the income has been comparably taxed in the host country. 3. Consideration should be given to whether the active/passive distinction should apply in respect of foreign branches and non-portfolio interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs). Details of how the rules within this general framework might work are the subject of consultations and submissions. Taxation of dividends from CFCs 7.1 Approaches to the taxation of dividends from CFCs vary among countries, regardless of whether they use the transactional or entity approaches to attribution. As mentioned in chapter 2, in the case of active income, they adopt one of the two basic approaches: • deferral of taxation of active income earned offshore until the profits are repatriated, with a credit for foreign taxes paid (referred to as “the deferral with a credit” method); or • a complete exemption for offshore active income with no taxation of subsequent dividends (referred to as the “exemption” method). 7.2 The United States uses the transactional approach and taxes all dividends from the CFC to the extent tax has not been paid on the underlying profits. The result is that tainted income is taxed to United States shareholders on accrual and then on distribution – to the extent tax was not imposed on accrual. By contrast, tax on active income is deferred until the profits are repatriated by way of a dividend with a credit for foreign taxes. 53 7.3 The United Kingdom uses the entity approach and, like the United States, the United Kingdom has adopted the “deferral with a credit” method. Accordingly, shareholders in active CFCs are taxed only when the income is distributed with a credit for foreign taxes. Shareholders in passive CFCs are taxed on accrual and then again when the profits are distributed, with credit for taxes paid on accrual. 7.4 Australia uses the transactional approach but exempts all dividends from the CFC. This means that Australian tax is levied on the tainted income of a CFC on accrual. Active income is subject to a permanent exemption from Australian taxation. 7.5 The government is more attracted to the exemption method adopted by Australia. Exempting all dividend flows would be simpler than taxing them on deferral. In the case of active income, it recognises the limitations of the integrity of credit with deferral approach highlighted in chapter 2. In the case of passive and base company income, it assumes that income has been taxed on accrual. 7.6 That said, there are legitimate reasons why countries have not taken that step. First, there may be a concern that rules for taxing passive income on accrual are not sufficiently robust to exempt the dividend with confidence. Second, exempting any cash flow presents opportunities for tax arbitrage and avoidance – regardless of whether the transaction takes place domestically or in a cross-border context. For instance, it could be possible to circumvent loss grouping/ring fencing rules by swapping a deductible stream of income from a profitable New Zealand company for an exempt dividend stream from the CFC. 7.7 As mentioned in chapter 2, the government would proceed in this direction only if it is confident that the exemption would not lead to an erosion of tax on New Zealand-sourced income. If this confidence cannot be achieved, it would need to examine whether some form of taxation of repatriated dividends would be required. Dividend withholding payment rules 7.8 All foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies are exempt from income tax. However, New Zealand companies are required to make dividend withholding payment (DWP) deductions on behalf of their shareholders. 7.9 If it were decided to exempt dividends from CFCs, it follows that DWP on CFC distributions should be removed. If some or all dividends from CFCs were to be taxed on repatriation, the DWP rules could be retained for that purpose. (Some modifications would probably be required to make DWP compatible with new CFC rules.) 54 7.10 Refundability of DWP credits is also an issue. Under the DWP rules, the payment of DWP gives rise to DWP credits that can be attached to dividends paid to shareholders. These DWP credits are refundable to the shareholders to ensure that the total tax liabilities of these shareholders do not exceed their marginal personal income tax rate. In particular, this ensures DWP credits are refundable to non-resident shareholders when conduit relief on the DWP liability has not been claimed. 7.11 The move to an active/passive distinction and the consequential repeal of the conduit rules (see below) would make it necessary to consider whether it is desirable to continue to refund DWP credits to residents or non-residents. At least in relation to passive income, there would seem to be no justification for preserving this feature of the DWP rules. If DWP credits were no longer refundable, it may make sense to remove DWP and include foreign dividends in the company tax calculation. Grey list 7.12 The existing grey list exempts the income of CFCs in eight countries from New Zealand tax on the grounds that the tax systems of those countries are comparable with New Zealand’s tax system. The exemption is provided regardless of whether the CFCs earn active income or passive income. Repeal of the grey list exemption would be consistent with active/passive CFC rules that focus on exempting active income rather than on whether the income has been comparably taxed in the host country. 7.13 The original rationale for the current grey list exemption to the CFC rules was to reduce the compliance costs associated with a comprehensive accrual system. Grey-list jurisdictions have tax systems similar to New Zealand’s that can be expected to impose a similar level of tax as would be imposed if the activity were carried on in New Zealand. As New Zealand provides credits for foreign tax paid, the New Zealand tax payable on attributed income from a CFC resident in a grey list jurisdiction, after the application of foreign tax credits, may often be little to none. In such circumstances, it was considered that there was little point requiring compliance with the CFC rules. 7.14 The retention of a grey list exemption would mean that all income (both active and passive) derived from CFC investments into grey list jurisdictions would remain exempt. However, the logic of exempting offshore active income does not extend to passive income, which is to be generally taxed on accrual. This would be consistent with the abolition of the grey list for passive income. Accordingly, all offshore passive income should be taxed on accrual, with a credit allowed for any taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction. This approach has been taken in a number of countries (such as the United States and Canada). 55 7.15 On the other hand, some CFC rules applying in other countries do provide relief for passive income depending upon either a comparable level of taxation test or a short grey list (for example, Australia). The Tax Review 2001 implicitly recommended the retention of the grey list for passive income. The concept for such an exemption would, again, be to reduce compliance and administrative burdens. However, the variability of domestic tax rules applying to such income in other countries and the vulnerability of passive types of income to tax avoidance might make maintaining a reasonable grey list difficult over time. 7.16 The Tax Review recommended that an exemption for offshore active income be supplemented with a black list of countries where accrual taxation would continue for all income. Black listed countries would be tax havens with little or no taxation and economic substance. Problems with a black list include the need to update the list as tax systems evolve and the reality that special features in otherwise normal tax systems may give the same tax avoidance effect as a tax haven for certain arrangements. The need for a black list would depend in part on the rules for passive income and base company income, which would be intended to eliminate the tax advantages of typical tax haven arrangements. If they were sufficiently robust a black list approach would not be necessary. The government therefore does not favour the introduction of a black-list. Conduit rules 7.17 Repealing the current conduit income rules would be consistent with the reform of the taxation of CFCs. 7.18 Conduit reform was introduced in 1998 to remove the income tax liability of New Zealand companies on foreign income to the extent the company was owned by non-residents. That was done because the combined effect of our comprehensive CFC rules and residence rules for companies was, in substance, inconsistent with our policy of not taxing the foreign income of non-residents. In particular, there was a concern that the rules could discourage foreign multinational companies from using a New Zealand-based subsidiary as a regional headquarters for subsidiaries in other jurisdictions. 7.19 If the foreign active income from CFCs is no longer taxable on accrual in New Zealand there is no need for the conduit mechanism in relation to that income. 7.20 On the other hand, there is a strong case for removing conduit in relation to foreign passive income while subjecting it to accrual taxation: • First, as mentioned, the justification for the conduit rules was linked to the fact that, unlike most jurisdictions, New Zealand taxes the active income of CFCs on accrual, which could discourage using New Zealand entities to hold shares of offshore active subsidiaries. The same concern does not arise with passive income. Providing conduit relief on foreign passive income is not supported by international practice. Australia does 56 not provide any conduit relief for the foreign passive income earned by non-residents through Australian entities. • Second, continuing to provide conduit relief on passive income could facilitate the erosion of the New Zealand tax base. It provides an incentive for New Zealand-resident companies with non-resident shareholders to recharacterise domestic income as foreign passive income. While such recharacterisation may contravene the general anti- avoidance provision, the government’s preference is to remove the incentive for these arrangements to occur in the first place. 7.21 The removal of the conduit rules would simplify a particularly complex area of our tax laws. This is because providing conduit tax relief as income accrues in the CFC requires New Zealand companies to track this relief until it is passed on to non-resident shareholders. In particular, rules are needed to: • maintain a memorandum account to track conduit tax relief; • track distribution of conduit income; • monitor changes in the shareholding between the time income is derived and distributed; and • provide for interest allocation for conduit companies. 7.22 Australia does provide conduit relief from non-resident withholding taxes on dividends paid from foreign active income earned through Australian companies and permanent establishments. 7.23 Under the Australian conduit rules, foreign active income that is not taxable at the entity level can be distributed to non-resident shareholders free of NRWT. 22 This conduit mechanism does not apply to passive income, which is fully taxable on accrual. This reform was introduced as part of a number of reforms designed to promote Australia as a regional headquarter location for foreign multinational companies. 7.24 Matters relating to domestic rates of NRWT on dividends should be considered in conjunction with treaty policy on NRWT rates. This is discussed in chapter 8. 22 Some examples of conduit foreign income in Australia are foreign non-portfolio dividends received by an Australian company; foreign income and certain capital gains derived directly or indirectly by an Australian company from carrying on business in a foreign country through a permanent establishment; capital gains on the disposal of shares in a foreign company with an underlying active business; and foreign income (such as royalties) and net capital gains included in the assessable income of a corporate tax entity when the Australian tax liability on that income is reduced by foreign tax credits. 57 Branches 7.25 Currently, investments in CFCs and in foreign branches are both taxed on accrual. 23 In fact, the taxation of CFCs is referred to as the “branch equivalent”, or BE, method. 7.26 The move to an active passive/distinction for CFCs may have implications for the way foreign branches are taxed – depending on whether New Zealand adopts the exemption method for dividends. 7.27 Typically, countries such as the United States and United Kingdom that adopt the deferral with a credit method discussed in chapter 2 continue to tax branches on accrual. This makes sense because, although taxable only on distribution, the profits of the CFC are ultimately taxed in the jurisdiction. 7.28 By contrast, Australia extends the exemption for active income of CFCs to active branches. If New Zealand adopts the exemption method, it would be necessary to consider whether we should follow the Australian model and also exempt active branches. 7.29 A key consideration is whether it is desirable to provide the same tax treatment to active branches so that New Zealand residents are not influenced by tax considerations in deciding whether to operate in a foreign jurisdiction through a subsidiary or a branch. In the absence of neutral treatment, firms expecting to make a loss would have an incentive to use the branch structure, whereas firms expecting to make a gain would probably prefer to operate as an exempt CFC. Taxation of non-portfolio interests in foreign investment funds 7.30 International tax rules frequently distinguish between portfolio investors and non-portfolio investors. In broad terms, portfolio investors are regarded as passive investors, whereas non-portfolio investors are viewed as having a significant stake in the entity in which they invest and some influence over the affairs of that entity, if not a controlling interest. 7.31 The tax treatment of offshore portfolio investments (with investor interests of less than 10 percent) is currently being reformed. 24 The proposals in this discussion document do not affect these reforms in any way. 23 This is different from the domestic context because profits earned in domestic entities are not taxed on accrual in the hands of investors, but this is because domestic entities are taxable in their own right. 24 The Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, which contains the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment, was before Parliament at the time of writing. 58 7.32 For non-portfolio investors in FIFs, the current rules enable the use of the “branch equivalent” (BE) method, which shareholders in CFCs are required to use to calculate their attributed income. However, a FIF investor has the choice of using alternative methods for attribution: the comparative value method, the accounting profits method or the deemed rate of return method. The rules allow non-portfolio investors in FIFs to elect out of the BE calculation because many of them may not have sufficient information to comply with the BE calculation. 7.33 Changes to our CFC rules are likely to have implications for the tax treatment of New Zealand residents who hold non-portfolio interests (of at least 10 percent) in FIFs. Ideally, non-portfolio investors in either CFCs or FIFs would all be subject to the same accrual rules. In principle, non-portfolio investors in FIFs should be able to access the same active/passive exemption applying to investments in CFCs. However, there are the same compliance concerns underlying the choice to opt out of the BE rules: non-controlling investors may not have sufficient information to determine the amounts or nature of the underlying income and activity. 7.34 In practice, countries do distinguish between FIF interests and CFC interests when they implement the active/passive distinction. 7.35 Australia’s CFC rules primarily follow a transactional approach to attribution. In contrast, Australia’s FIF rules follow an entity approach to attribution. If 50 percent or more of the value of a FIF’s assets are active, none of its income will be subject to attribution. 25 Otherwise, all of the FIF’s income, including its active income, is subject to attribution. 7.36 Similarly, the United States’ CFC rules primarily follow a transactional approach to attribution. However, the United States’ passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules (equivalent to FIF rules) effectively take an entity approach by the method by which a PFIC is defined. A foreign corporation will be a PFIC only if 75 percent or more of its gross income is passive, or if assets representing more than 50 percent of the total value of its assets are passive. 25 This is the test in terms of the balance sheet method for determining exemption. The balance sheet method is based on a detailed examination of a company’s assets to determine whether assets are used in carrying on an active business. The stock exchange listing method, the alternative, is a proxy for the balance sheet method – available for small investors with insufficient information to apply the balance sheet method. If neither method can be applied, the FIF cannot qualify for exemption. 59 7.37 In its Final Report, the Tax Review recommended that, in essence, the CFC rules, with an active/passive distinction, be extended to FIF interests of 30 percent or greater – the logic being that an investor with a 30 percent interest in a FIF should have sufficient information to perform a BE calculation for attribution. Under this approach, an active/passive distinction could still apply to non-portfolio FIF interests of less than 30 percent. Again, the question would be what the rules that apply to FIF interests of less than 30 percent might look like. Implications for foreign tax credits 7.38 Even though active income would be exempt from taxation, a number of sources of foreign income would continue to be taxable in New Zealand and so would be eligible for foreign tax credits: • Passive income would be taxable on accrual, and credits would be provided for foreign taxes paid, subject to the limitation that credits should not exceed New Zealand tax otherwise payable on the income. • Foreign assets, such as loans, held directly by a New Zealand company, but not through an offshore branch, might attract foreign taxes, perhaps withholding taxes, and so would still require foreign tax credits. • Finally, depending on final policy decisions on the treatment of offshore branches, non-portfolio FIFs and dividends from CFCs and other forms of foreign income that are potentially taxable in the source country might be taxable in New Zealand, so foreign tax credits would need to be provided. 7.39 Experience has shown that the practical application of foreign tax credit systems can be difficult, and considerable care is required to ensure that they do not, in effect, reduce taxes payable on domestic income. As noted in chapter 3, current methods of allocating deductions to the calculation of the foreign tax credit limitations are not fully effective and would require some amendment. 7.40 In many cases, the allocation of interest expenses is the key issue in appropriately limiting foreign tax credit claims. Chapter 6 has outlined possible changes to the thin capitalisation rules which are intended to ensure that interest expense is deductible only to the extent that it is attributable to income which is taxable in New Zealand. However, some foreign income, while technically taxable in New Zealand, is not effectively taxed as any New Zealand tax is offset by foreign tax credits. This situation is not dealt with in the current thin capitalisation rules. 7.41 There are a number of potential ways to attribute interest expenses to the foreign income which would need to be considered. 60 Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters in particular: • Should we continue to tax dividends from CFCs? If not, why not? • If an active/passive distinction were to be adopted, the appropriateness of repealing: – the grey list; – the conduit rules; and – the DWP rules or the refundability of DWP. • The appropriateness of introducing an active/passive distinction for non- portfolio FIFs, and if so: – whether that distinction should be the same as that for CFCs; – whether that distinction should be made for non-portfolio interests over a certain percentage, say 30 percent, or for all non-portfolio FIF interests; and – whether possible alternative methods of calculating FIF income should be retained for non-portfolio investors. 61 CHAPTER 8 Non-resident withholding tax Possible changes 1. NRWT on dividends could be lowered through bilateral treaty negotiations, although the case for this is stronger for non-portfolio dividends. The changes would have implications for the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. 2. Reducing NRWT on either interest or royalties is a possibility but may not be justified. 3. A number of technical changes to the NRWT and approved issuer levy (AIL) rules would rationalise information requirements and withholding arrangements across different payments. 8.1 Like many countries, New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends, interest and royalty payments to non-residents. NRWT rates are generally reduced by our double tax agreements. There are also arrangements under domestic law to reduce the impact of NRWT in certain circumstances. 8.2 This chapter considers the case for lowering NRWT rates. The focus is on bilateral treaty reductions, rather than unilateral changes through domestic law, because of the potential benefits of agreeing reciprocal changes with our major trading partners. Submissions are sought, in particular, on whether New Zealand should move away from the current policy of keeping NRWT treaty limits relatively high and using domestic-law mechanisms to reduce total tax on inbound investment. The alternative, discussed in this chapter, is a treaty- based approach that would also benefit New Zealanders investing offshore. Related changes to domestic law are also discussed. 8.3 Changes to NRWT treaty limits have the potential to support the wider objectives of the International Tax Review, complementing the introduction of an active income distinction for CFCs. They would increase New Zealand’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment by reducing headline rates of tax and bringing us more closely into line with international norms. Securing lower rates of foreign NRWT through treaty negotiations would reduce tax barriers to offshore investment. This would help to increase the competitiveness of our tax system and facilitate the internationalisation of New Zealand businesses. But there are also avoidance risks and other drawbacks associated with lower treaty limits that argue for a measured approach to reform. 62 Current rules and their rationale 8.4 Table 8.1 compares the rates of NRWT specified in domestic law with the lower limits set by our double tax agreements (DTAs). The DTA rates are reciprocal: by agreeing to limit NRWT on outgoing dividends, interest and royalties, we secure the same limits on payments coming into New Zealand from the other country. The country where the payments have their source is allowed to impose NRWT up to the treaty limit. The country where the recipient is resident can also tax the payments, but if it does so, it must give credits for any NRWT imposed by the source country. T ABLE 8.1 NRWT rates in domestic law and NZ double tax agreements 1. Minimum rates accepted by New Zealand in negotiations. Some actual treaties include higher rates. 8.5 For countries like New Zealand that are net importers of capital, source taxation can be important. Without NRWT, all the tax on dividends, interest and royalties sourced here would accrue to the country where the investor was resident. On the other hand, foreign investors may respond to New Zealand taxes by demanding higher pre-tax returns, effectively shifting the tax burden onto domestic users of capital. Debt and portfolio investors, in particular, are likely to respond to tax rates in this way. 8.6 For this reason, New Zealand has taken steps to reduce the total tax impost on certain forms of foreign investment. The policy to date has been to do this unilaterally under domestic law, rather than by reducing NRWT limits in double tax agreements. Two mechanisms are relevant here: • Foreign investor tax credit (FITC). FITC reduces company tax on profits distributed as dividends to non-residents. The total tax impost (company tax and NRWT) is currently equal to the company rate of 33 percent. • Approved issuer levy (AIL). NRWT on interest paid to an unrelated lender can be reduced to nil provided the borrower agrees to pay a 2 percent AIL. Dividends imputed unimputed Interest Royalties Domestic law rate 15% 30% 15% 15% NZ DTA rate 1 15% 15% 10% 10% 63 International trends 8.7 The NRWT limits in New Zealand’s double tax agreements are relatively high by international standards. Treaty practice varies widely, but many countries do prefer to include lower limits in their double tax agreements when possible. Lower limits on certain payments are also recommended by the OECD in its model tax convention. 8.8 The key difference between the limits in New Zealand’s treaties and those in the OECD model are that the OECD recommends a 5 percent (rather than 15 percent) limit for non-portfolio dividends and a zero (rather than 10 percent) rate for royalties. Consistent with New Zealand’s current treaty practice, the OECD model includes a 10 percent limit for interest, although the commentary notes that some countries may prefer a zero rate for certain kinds of interest. 26 8.9 Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom are three of our key treaty partners. In recent years, these countries have negotiated lower treaty limits on NRWT – with each other and with third countries. A good example of this trend is the 2001 protocol amending the double tax agreement between Australia and the United States, which limits NRWT on non-portfolio dividends to 5 percent. When the investor holds at least 80 percent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend and satisfies certain public listing requirements, a zero rate applies. The limit remains at 15 percent for other dividends. The limit for NRWT on interest generally remains at 10 percent, but has been reduced to zero for interest derived by a government body or financial institution resident in the other country, provided in the latter case that the lender is unrelated to the borrower. The limit for NRWT on royalties has been reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent. 8.10 Table 8.2 compares the NRWT limits generally included in New Zealand’s double tax agreements with those recommend in the OECD’s model tax convention and with the limits agreed between Australia and the United States in 2001. T ABLE 8.2 NRWT limits in various treaties Dividends Interest Royalties non-portfolio portfolio > 80% holding > 10% holding < 10% holding banks other NZ DTA rate 15% 15% 15% 10% 10% 10% OECD model 5% 5% 15% 10% 10% 0% Australian-United States DTA 0% 5% 15% 0% 10% 5% 26 Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital. (OECD, July 2005). Commentary on Article 11, Paragraph 7.1 et seq. 64 NRWT on dividends and the foreign investor tax credit 8.11 New Zealand’s treaty rate of NRWT on dividends is 15 percent. There are arguments both for and against reducing NRWT treaty limits on dividends. The case for doing so is probably stronger in relation to non-portfolio dividends, where the international trend is to reduce rates. Lower treaty limits on portfolio dividends are less common internationally and may often be difficult to achieve in practice, particularly given that the OECD continues to recommend NRWT of 15 percent on such dividends. Impact on outbound investors 8.12 Although the current treaty rate of NRWT on dividends is 15 percent, when combined with the lower company tax rate resulting from FITC, the total amount of company tax and NRWT on profits distributed to foreign investors is limited to 33 percent. This approach leaves NRWT treaty limits relatively high. One consequence of this is that our treaty partners may impose high rates of NRWT on payments flowing into New Zealand. These high rates of foreign NRWT are perhaps the most serious drawback of current policy settings. While the total tax impost on inbound equity investment has already been reduced through FITC, this has been done without securing reciprocal reductions in NRWT from our treaty partners for New Zealanders investing offshore. 8.13 High foreign rates of NRWT may act as a barrier to offshore investment and to the repatriation of profits when such investment does occur. Increasingly, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Australia: companies wishing to invest in third countries may prefer to base themselves in Australia to take advantage of the more favourable rates available under its treaty network and, in particular, in its double tax agreement with the United States. 8.14 Having said that, New Zealanders with offshore portfolio investments will often be able to claim offsetting credits in New Zealand, although these credits may be clawed back through the imputation system when individuals invest offshore through a New Zealand company. Even for direct investors, the actual impact of a reduction in foreign NRWT will depend on the domestic law of the treaty partner in question. While some countries (like the United States) do impose NRWT up to the treaty limit, others (like Australia) already exempt most dividends under their domestic law. Impact on inbound investors 8.15 A necessary step in reducing NRWT treaty limits on either portfolio or non- portfolio dividends, would be to remove the FITC mechanism for the relevant class of dividend. To avoid an increase in the total New Zealand tax impost on inbound equity investment, an exemption from NRWT would be introduced under domestic law for fully imputed dividends paid to non-residents. Australia has a similar exemption from NRWT for franked dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. 65 8.16 It would, of course, be possible to introduce such changes irrespective of our treaty policy. The FITC mechanism does have drawbacks. In certain circumstances it can increase compliance costs for New Zealand companies wishing to pay dividends to foreign shareholders. In addition, while FITC reduces total New Zealand tax on inbound investment, it does so without transparently reducing headline rates of tax. Anecdotal evidence suggests that headline rates can affect investment location decisions. 8.17 One problem with replacing FITC is that this would make New Zealand taxes less creditable overall, without reducing the total tax impost. The result would be to increase the effective rate of New Zealand tax for some foreign investors. This would mainly affect portfolio investors, who generally cannot claim credits for underlying foreign company tax. 8.18 For many investors, however, FITC will offer little practical advantage. This is generally true for direct investors, who are likely either exempt at home on foreign dividends or able to claim credit for underlying company tax. Around three-quarters of inbound equity investment is direct. In addition, FITC offers no particular advantage, even for portfolio investors, when the investor has surplus foreign tax credits at home, is in a loss position, or is exempt from tax. Some countries – such as Hong Kong – exempt all foreign-sourced dividends, including portfolio dividends, from domestic taxation. Avoidance issues 8.19 Current levels of NRWT provide some measure of protection against the avoidance of tax by non-residents. Reducing NRWT therefore risks exposing the tax base to increased avoidance activity. There are two main risks: • Imputation credit streaming. Under current policy, FITC is available only to the extent that dividends are imputed. This helps to reduce incentives for companies to stream imputation credits to resident shareholders because those credits also have a value to non-resident shareholders. With a lower rate of NRWT on dividends, that value would be reduced and the incentive to stream credits would increase accordingly. • Repatriation of untaxed profits. Under current policy, even if foreign equity investors manage to structure their affairs so as to avoid paying company tax in New Zealand, in principle they will still be liable to NRWT at 15 percent upon seeking to repatriate those untaxed profits as dividends. NRWT on dividends therefore provides a backstop against avoidance activities. 8.20 These risks are material. Accordingly, any move to a policy of seeking to negotiate lower NRWT treaty limits would need to be accompanied by other changes reducing the scope for avoidance activity. In particular, a reduction in NRWT on dividends would need to accompanied by stronger rules to combat imputation credit streaming. 66 NRWT on interest and royalties 8.21 New Zealand’s treaty rate of NRWT is 10 percent for both interest and royalties. Reducing NRWT on either interest or royalties is likely, in particular, to have material fiscal and avoidance implications and may therefore not be justified. High effective rates 8.22 Imposing NRWT on interest and royalties can be problematic (particularly for payments between unrelated parties) because the tax is imposed on gross income. Even though NRWT is generally limited to 10 percent, this can represent a high effective rate if the non-resident incurs expenses in deriving the income. 8.23 The AIL rules already operate to exempt interest on third-party loans, provided the borrower pays AIL of 2 percent. The policy rationale behind AIL is that the borrower can choose to pay the levy when the lender is unable or unwilling to obtain credits for NRWT. Interest payments between related parties continue to attract interest of 10 percent. The AIL mechanism substantially reduces the effective rate of New Zealand tax on non-residents in the business of borrowing and on-lending. That said, even small taxes may have an effect. As foreign lenders do not receive a credit for the payment of AIL, the economic incidence is likely to be borne by the borrower, increasing the cost of borrowing. 8.24 A high effective tax rate on royalties will not matter to the extent that royalty payments reflect economic rents, or when the non-resident owner of the intellectual property has already offset R&D costs and is receiving pure profits from New Zealand. When payments do not reflect rents or pure profits, however, the economic incidence of NRWT may either be passed back to the New Zealand user of intellectual property through higher prices or borne by the foreign owner, reducing the level of intellectual property licensed to New Zealanders. It is common for contracts licensing intellectual property to include clauses grossing up charges on account of NRWT. However, it is almost impossible to tell what prices would be in the absence of NRWT, and therefore the extent to which these gross-up clauses indicate an actual transfer of tax costs to New Zealand residents. Fiscal cost 8.25 For New Zealand, as a net importer of capital and intellectual property, reducing NRWT on interest or royalties would be likely to involve material fiscal cost, despite offsetting savings on inbound payments through a reduced need to give credits for foreign withholding taxes. The precise cost would obviously depend on the size of any reduction. It would also depend to some extent on the number of treaties affected. 67 Avoidance concerns 8.26 Because interest and royalty payments are deductible, they may be used inappropriately to reduce taxable profits, with debt or intellectual property being shifted offshore to generate deducible payments that can reduce profits taxable in New Zealand. NRWT currently reduces the incentive for such structures by imposing tax on outbound interest and royalty payments. With a lower rate of NRWT, the incentive to engage in avoidance activity of this sort would increase. 8.27 In certain instances, the AIL rules are already being used inappropriately to avoid NRWT on interest payments which, in economic terms, are made between related parties. Structures also exist to avoid NRWT and AIL on cross-border interest payments altogether. Options will be examined to tackle the avoidance of AIL and NRWT on interest, and the inappropriate use of AIL. Taxation of debt versus equity financing 8.28 NRWT on interest is an important component in determining the relative taxation of debt versus equity financing in New Zealand, particularly on related party lending (for which AIL is unavailable). Foreign debt investment into New Zealand is already taxed more lightly than equity investment. Ideally, taxation should not influence how foreign investors fund their New Zealand business operations. Excessive debt investment also raises base maintenance concerns because, as noted earlier, interest payments (unlike dividends) are deductible. A reduction in NRWT on interest would exacerbate the existing bias in favour of debt investment and put further pressure on the thin capitalisation rules. Technical issues relating to NRWT and AIL 8.29 The following paragraphs outline some possible technical changes to our domestic rules on NRWT and AIL. These changes would rationalise information requirements and withholding arrangements across different payments. This section is largely independent of the preceding discussion about NRWT treaty limits and FITC. Obligations on borrowers to supply information about AIL 8.30 New Zealand borrowers who deduct NRWT from interest paid to foreign lenders are required to file a non-resident withholding tax deduction certificate and an annual reconciliation statement. There are no equivalent information requirements in the AIL rules. Even so, information on interest payments covered by AIL is as relevant as information on interest payments subject to NRWT. The current lack of reporting requirements makes it difficult to verify the correct application of the AIL rules. Lack of information about AIL also compromises our ability to exchange full information with treaty partners. 68 8.31 Therefore, New Zealand borrowers who elect to pay AIL on outbound interest would be subject to the same information requirements as currently apply in relation to NRWT. Rationalising the withholding rules 8.32 The imposition of withholding tax on interest, dividends and royalty payments is inconsistent across different payments, and the government sees a case for rationalising the arrangements. NRWT may be final tax or minimum tax 8.33 Under domestic law, NRWT may be either a final tax or a minimum tax. On most payments, NRWT is a final tax under domestic law. But on industrial royalties, and on interest and investment society dividends from an associated person, domestic law provides that NRWT is effectively the minimum rate of tax. For countries with which we have a double tax agreement, NRWT is generally a final tax on these payments, too, because most of our treaties limit withholding tax on these payments to 10 percent or 15 percent. 27 Even when no treaty limit applies, additional tax would normally be payable only if income tax liability calculated on a net basis exceeded NRWT on gross payments. Royalties may be subject to NRWT or NRCWT 8.34 Payments relating to equipment leases are within the definition of “royalties” in New Zealand’s double tax agreements. However, they are not royalties under domestic law. They are therefore subject to non-resident contractor withholding tax (NRCWT) rather than NRWT. The domestic rate for NRCWT is 15 percent. Unlike NRWT, NRCWT is neither a final tax nor a minimum tax under domestic law. It is simply a withholding mechanism, equivalent to PAYE. Income from renting films not subject to NRWT 8.35 Amounts derived by non-residents from renting films in New Zealand are not currently subject to NRWT. Ten percent of gross receipts is instead subject to income tax, giving an effective tax rate of 3.3 percent. This concessionary treatment is a historical anachronism for which there is no longer a sound policy rationale. Neither the fiscal cost nor the additional complexity associated with having separate rules for non-resident rental income from films seems justified. 27 The exceptions are our double tax agreements with Fiji, Malaysia and Singapore, which all allow unlimited source taxation of interest between associated persons, and our agreement with Japan, which makes no provision on either interest or royalties. 69 The case for rationalisation 8.36 There is a case for rationalising these arrangements, subjecting all payments to NRWT and making this a final tax in all cases. That would involve the following changes: • For industrial royalties, or interest or investment society dividends from an associated person, NRWT would become a final tax rather than a minimum tax under domestic law. • Payments relating to equipment leases would be brought within the domestic law definition of royalties and subject to NRWT as a final tax. • Gross royalties derived from renting films would be made subject to NRWT. Points for submission • Does a policy of trying to reduce NRWT treaty limits on portfolio/non-portfolio dividends seem attractive? • Is the FITC mechanism helpful in attracting inward equity investment, and does this justify the associated compliance costs? Or is there a case for removing FITC on portfolio/non-portfolio dividends irrespective of our treaty policy on NRWT? • Have the key issues in relation to maintaining NRWT rates on interest and royalties been correctly identified? • Submissions are also invited on the possible technical changes to rationalise information requirements and withholding arrangements. 70 APPENDIX TABLE 1: CFC Rules: “Passive” income under a transactional approach Country Interest Rents Royalties Dividends Other Australia • interest income and amounts in the nature of interest; • accrued interest on discounted and other deferred interest securities issued after 16 Dec 1984; • income from property financing transactions; 28 • interest deemed to be derived where a CFC assumes the rights of a lender through the purchase of securities through a secondary market; 29 • factoring income. Interest derived by a CFC that is a subsidiary of an Australian Financial Institution (AFI) is active income (but the interest income of an AFI may still be tainted income if it is tainted services income). • rent in respect of a lease with an associate or paid to the CFC by an associate; • income from leases of land except where the land is located in the same country as the CFC is resident if a substantial part of the income is related to the provision of labour-intensive property management by the CFC; • income from the lease of a ship or aircraft, a cargo container for use on ships or aircraft or plant or equipment for use on board ships, unless related to the provision of operating crew in relation to ships and aircraft or maintenance or management services by the CFC. Exclusions for rent which is: • derived from an associated CFC resident in the same country; • subject to the normal company rate of tax in that country; and • did not give rise to a notional allowable deduction for the associated CFC. Royalties – except for: • royalties received from a non-associate in the course of carrying on a business where either: – the property or right in respect of which the royalty is paid originated with the CFC; or – the CFC substantially develops or improves the property or right for which the royalty is paid. Dividends, including: • unit trust dividends; • a distribution made by a liquidator which is deemed to be a dividend. But: • non-portfolio dividends paid to a CFC from a non-Australian resident are notionally exempt; • dividends paid by a company resident in a listed country to a listed country CFC are exempt. • annuities; • consideration for the assignment of any copyright, patent, design, trademark or other like property or right; • income derived from trading in tainted assets (investment type assets); • net gains from the disposal of tainted assets; • net tainted commodity gains, which arise from the disposal of tainted commodity assets (a future or forward contract, or right or option in respect of such a contract). Exception if: – the CFC carries on business of producing or processing the commodity, or uses the commodity as a raw material and the right or contract relates to the carrying on of that business; or – the contract was entered into to eliminate/reduce the risk of adverse financial consequences that might, under another contract, from fluctuations in the price of the commodity and the CFC does not derive tainted sales income from a transaction under that other contract; • net tainted currency exchange gains and losses unless the underlying transaction was: • for the purchase of goods from a non-associate; 28 Income from property financing transactions is only passive for the purposes of the active income test. 29 Such deemed interest is only passive for the purposes of the active income test. 71 • for the purchase or sale of depreciable plant or equipment used mainly to produce income that is not passive, or tainted sales or services income; • a hedge for one of the preceding transactions. ¾ also exclusion for a CFC carrying on as a currency trader and no other party to the transaction is an associate or Australian resident. United States Interest – except for: • qualified banking or financing income. The CFC must be predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking business and conduct substantial activity with respect to that business. Seventy percent of the CFC’s gross income must be derived from the banking business, be an institution licensed to be a bank in the United States or be a registered United States securities broker or dealer. The activities must be conduced in the CFC’s home country unless its branch activities meet the substantial activity requirements; • interest derived by a CFC engaged in a banking business for “export financing interest” – interest from financing a sale for use or consumption outside the United States of goods manufactured in the United States; • interest received from a related person which is a corporation organised under the laws of the same foreign country as the recipient and such related person has a substantial portion of its business located in the same foreign country except where the payment reduces the subpart F income of the payer. Rents and royalties – except for: • rent or royalties derived by a CFC in the active conduct of a trade or business which is not received from a related party (“active trade or business exception”); • rent from a related corporation for use of property within the CFC’s jurisdiction; • royalties received from a related corporation for the use of property within the CFC’s jurisdiction. Dividends – except for: • dividends received from a related corporation in the same jurisdiction with a substantial portion of its business located in the same jurisdiction. However: • the exception does not apply to a dividend attributable to earnings accumulated during any period during which the CFC receiving the dividend did not hold stock directly or indirectly. • capital gains from the sale of an asset which gives rise to dividends, interest, rents or royalties or gives rise to no income at all is tainted (but gains from the sale of property used in active trade or business are excluded, as are gains from the sale of an asset that gave rise to rent or royalty income excluded under the active trade or business exception); • net foreign currency gains; • net gains from commodities transactions (unless part of hedging transactions connected to the CFC’s business); • amounts received under a personal services contract, and from the sale of the contract, in certain circumstances related to the individual designated to perform the services; • insurance income (special rules similar to active banking rules may apply); • income from the operation of ships and aircraft, activities on the high seas, outer space and similar activities; • income from the processing of minerals extracted from oil into their primary products, the transportation of such minerals or products, and the distribution or sale of such minerals or products for use outside the CFC’s country of incorporation; 72 • income from operations in countries participating in international boycotts; • an amount equal to bribes and kickbacks paid to a government or its employees or agents. 73 TABLE 2: CFC Rules: “Base company income” under a transactional approach Country Base company sales income Base company services income Australia Income from the sale of goods by a CFC when an Australian-resident associate or an Australian permanent establishment of a non-resident associate either purchases the goods from the CFC or supplies goods to the CFC. Exclusions for: • hospitality – broadly, sales arising fro m the tourism and hospitality industry; • where a CFC substantially alters, manufactures or produces the goods sold. Income from the provision of services by a CFC to an Australian resident, or an Australian permanent establishment of a non-resident. Exclusions for: • hospitality – broadly, services that aris e from the tourism and hospitality industry; • where the service relates to goods substan tially altered or manufactured by a CFC. Also does not include: • royalties; • any income in respect of a lease of land; • any income from trading in assets; or • gains from currency exchange rate fluctu ations, commodity inve stments and assets. Income from services provided indirectly to certain Australian residents or Australian permanent establishments will also be tainted services income if: • the services are provided by the CFC to an associate are received by another entity that is an Australian resident or Australian permanent establishment; • the services are provided under a scheme; and • the income from the services would have been tainted if provided directly by the CFC to the ultimate recipient. United States Sales income if: • a CFC purchases goods from a related pe rson and sells those goods to any person; or • a CFC purchases goods from any person and sells to a related person. Exclusions for: • the property purchased was manufactured in the CFC’s jurisdiction or substantially transformed in the CFC’s jurisdiction; • the property sold is used or consumed in the CFC’s country of incorporation; • the CFC is the manufacturer, regardle ss of where the manufacturing is done (although the special branch rules (see below) would apply). If goods are acquired from or sold to a relate d company resident in the United States, the income may still be foreign base co mpany sales income unless the CFC is engaged in a United States trade or business and its income is subject to United States corporate income tax. If the related company to whom the CFC se lls the goods is resident in the same country as the CFC, there is an exclusion if the related party uses or consumes the property in the same country that the CFC is incorporated. If not, the sales income will be included. Special branch rules apply in the case of branches of a CFC engaged in either manufacturing or selling activity outside th e CFC’s country of incorporation. Services income if: • a CFC performs services for or on behalf of any re lated person, and the services are performed outside the CFC’s jurisdiction. Exclusion for: • services directly related to the sale or exchange by the CFC of property manufactured by it and which are performed before the time of the sale or exchange, or which are related to an offer or effort to sell or exchange such property. Also included if a related United States-resident party provides substantial assistance to a CFC which is performing services itself. 74 TABLE 3: CFC Rules: Features of an active business exemption under an entity approach Country Substantial presence Effective management Main business United Kingdom The CFC must have a business establishment in its territory of residence: premises occupied and used (or intended to be used) with a reasonable degree of permanence, and from which its business in that territory is wholly or mainly carried on. The CFC’s business must be effectively managed in its territory of residence. Satisfied if: • sufficient employees in that territory to deal with the volume of its worldwide business; and • substantially all services provided by the CFC for persons resident outside its territory of residence are performed outside the United Kingdom – unless provided through another person for arm’s length consideration or through a United Kingdom branch which is subject to United Kingdom tax. The CFC’s main business must not be “investment business” (holding securities or intellectual property, dealing in securities other than as broker, leasing of any property or rights, and “money-box” functions). The CFC’s main business must not be dealing in goods: • for delivery to or from the United Kingdom; or • for delivery to or from connected persons; unless the goods are physically delivered into the CFC’s territory of residence. Dealing implies buying and selling in unchanged form. If the CFC manufactures or processes the goods, it main business is probably not dealing. If the CFC’s main business is wholes ale, distributive, financial or service business (dealing in good s wholesale, shipping or air transport, banking, deposit-tak ing, money-lending or debt factoring or similar, trust administ ration, dealing in securities as a broker, dealing in commodity or financial futures, insurance (whether long-term or general) and the provision of any other services), it must derive less th an 50 percent of its gross trading receipts from that business from connected persons and certain specified unconnected Unit ed Kingdom companies and individuals. If a CFC is mainly engaged in ba nking or similar business, the 50 percent gross trading receipts test is modified. In particular, the CFC must satisfy a complex 15 percent “capital structure test”, looking at the amount of its shar e capital and funds provided by connected persons, and loans to connected persons. The 50 percent gross receipts test is also modified for CFCs engaged in insurance business. A captive insurance company cannot satisfy the test if 50 percent or more of its business is derived from carrying the risks of connected persons. Japan The CFC has a fixed establishment necessary for carrying out its main business in the jurisdiction concerned. The CFC has its own effective management or control and operation in respect of its main business in the jurisdiction concerned. The CFC’s main business is business other than holding stocks or bonds and debentures; providing patents, and other rights regarding technology or a secret process or formulae, or know-how or copyrights; or leasing ships or aircraft. If the CFC’s main business is any business other than wholesale, financial, shipping or air transportation, that business must be conducted primarily (more than 50 percent) in the CFC’s jurisdiction. If the CFC’s main business is whol esale, financial (banking, trust services, or insurance), shipping or air transportation, its main business must be conducted prim arily (more than 50 percent) with unrelated parties.

The impetus for these reforms stems, in part, from a separate government initiative to introduce modern limited partnership rules to facilitate venture capital investment. The limited partnership vehicle is an internationally preferred business structure for investing in venture capital. 1.3 Introduction of a new limited partnership vehicle raises some issues around the taxation of entities generally, and partnerships in particular. To resolve these issues, the government proposes to clarify and modernise the tax treatment of partnerships and limited partnerships generally – rather than put in place special rules for venture capital partnerships. 1.4 In undertaking this initiative, the government recalls the work of the Valabh 1 Committee. That committee highlighted many problems associated with the taxation of partnerships. These problems are expected to become more acute as the use of limited partnership structures increases. For this reason, the government has decided to deal with the underlying concerns raised by the Valabh Committee at the same time. 1.5 This discussion document outlines a number of proposals on which the public is invited to comment. The new tax rules will cover a variety of business activities operating in partnership form, including: • small, closely held businesses; • small, medium and large professional practices; • small investment activities; • widely held investment activities; and • all sectors, including agriculture, forestry and manufacturing. 1.6 It is impossible to speculate on how these rules might affect these different businesses. It may be desirable to provide minimum threshold rules for all or part of these reforms, or make parts of the reforms elective. However, it is important for the integrity of the tax system to ensure that any exceptions are justified. The government encourages submissions on what, if any, minimum threshold rules would be required in relation to the proposals in this discussion document. 1.7 This discussion document looks only at the income tax side of partnerships. It does not propose any changes to the GST treatment of partnerships. 1 Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, appointed in 1989 and chaired by Mr Arthur Valabh. 2 SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Except where specifically stated, the proposals in this discussion document would apply to each of the following: • any partnership under the Partnership Act 1908; • a limited partnership registered as a “limited partnership” under a future Limited Partnership Bill, which will deal with the regulatory side of limited partnerships; • any New Zealand-resident partners of foreign general partnerships; and • any New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign limited partnership (with at least one general partner) that is not publicly traded and does not have separate legal personality. Partnerships with two to five owners (none of whom have limited liability with respect to the business) may elect either to apply the proposed rules outlined in Chapter 9 or to treat each owner as owning an undivided interest in all assets, liabilities and income of the business. Tax rules for partnerships • When apportioning income and expenses, partners would derive income/expenses from each source, in proportion to their profit share. • Salary and wages paid to a partner would generally not be deductible to the partnership unless they are included in a written contract of service. • Payments of rent and interest (on amounts over and above the capital contributed to the partnership) received by a partner from a partnership would be deductible to the partnership, provided the payments meet the general test of deductibility and are at market value. • The current approach of applying the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to partnerships would be retained. • The dividend withholding payment and underlying foreign tax credit rules would apply to New Zealand-resident companies that are partners. • Non-resident partners would be subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) – at the domestic rate or the applicable treaty rate – on any New Zealand-sourced dividends, interest, or royalties derived through the partnership on their behalf. • A New Zealand-resident company would be eligible for a foreign investor tax credit in relation to a dividend derived by a non-resident partner through the partnership. • Foreign partners would not be taxed on their proportionate share of foreign- sourced income. • An interest in a partnership would be treated as a distinct asset (similar to a share in a company). 3 • The entry and exit of partners would not result in the dissolution of the partnership for income tax purposes. • Exiting partners may be taxed on taxable gains attributable to underlying partnership assets on disposition subject to a minimum threshold rule. • The new partner and the partnership may jointly elect, in certain circumstances, to allocate the cost of the new partner’s partnership interest over the new partner’s share of partnership assets and liabilities. • The new tax rules would generally apply to all partnership interests (other than special partnership interests unless a special partnership elects for the new rules to apply). • Two options would be available for the calculation of the opening basis amount for existing partnership interests: the market value option and the historical method option. • A simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership would not generally result in the triggering of income or deductions to the partnership. Specific rules for limited partnerships • The introduction of the “partner’s basis” concept (basis tracking) to track the tax value of a partner’s interest in a partnership. • The introduction of loss limitation rules to ensure that the net tax losses claimed by a limited partner in relation to a limited partnership interest reflect the actual level of that limited partner’s economic loss. Proposed timeline/application date 1.8 It is proposed that a bill be introduced in 2007, with application from the 2008–2009 income year. Submission process 1.9 The government welcomes submissions on the proposals in this document. Submissions need not be limited to the suggested submission points. 1.10 Submissions should be addressed to: Partnerships C/- The Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Partnerships” in the subject line. 4 1.11 The closing date for submissions is 11 August 2006. 1.12 Please note that submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If there is any part of your submission which you consider could be properly withheld under that Act (for example, for reasons of commercial sensitivity), please indicate this clearly in your submission. 5 Chapter 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 The tax reform of partnerships is being driven in part by the government’s proposal to introduce a set of modern limited partnership rules to replace the current special partnership rules. In undertaking this reform it is necessary to take into account the views of the Tax Review 2001 on entity taxation generally, and the findings of the Valabh Committee on the taxation of partnerships in particular. Replacing special partnerships with a new limited partnership vehicle 2.2 One of the government’s principal aims is to raise New Zealand’s sustainable rate of economic growth through innovation. Greater access to investment capital has been identified as a means of encouraging innovation and enhancing economic growth. For example, venture capital is a critical source of funding for new and creative businesses attempting to develop innovative and advanced technologies. 2.3 Limited partnerships are an internationally preferred vehicle for investment into a foreign country (particularly in relation to private equity and venture capital investments) for two principal reasons. First, limited partnerships typically allow investors to limit their exposure to liability to the amount of their investment. Second, limited partnerships provide a flow-through tax mechanism for investors in relation to gains and losses. This allows the foreign investor to recognise those gains or losses in their home country. 2.4 New Zealand already has special partnership rules. However, these rules are restrictive and outdated from a regulatory perspective. In particular, the government understands that it is necessary to provide modern limited partnerships with separate legal personality to reinforce the limited liability nature of the partnership interest. This feature addresses a particular concern which is that, in the absence of a separate legal personality, a limited partner could be held personally liable for liabilities of the limited partnership by a foreign court – particularly in relation to actions of negligence. 2.5 Therefore the government plans to replace the special partnership legislation with more modern limited partnership rules. This new limited partnership vehicle will have separate legal entity status. Tax implications of a modern limited partnership 2.6 Without any change to the tax legislation, a limited partnership with separate legal entity status would be characterised as a company for income tax purposes. This would not be acceptable for venture capital investors and could inhibit the flow of foreign venture capital into New Zealand. 6 2.7 One option would be to introduce special venture-capital limited partnership rules similar to the venture-capital limited partnership rules (VCLPs) in Australia. However, there are problems associated with providing special tax treatments for different industry groups. Accordingly, the government has decided to take this opportunity to review the tax treatment of partnerships and limited partnerships generally. 2.8 In undertaking this review, the government has taken into account the work of two consultative committees. First, it has considered the observations made by the Tax Review 2001 2 on the broad subject of entity taxation. Second, it has taken account of the findings and recommendations of the Valabh Committee 3 on the taxation of partnerships. Tax Review 2001 2.9 According to the Tax Review 2001, the income of all entities ideally should be taxed at the marginal rate of their owners. However, this would involve high administrative and compliance costs in allocating income and identifying the marginal tax rates of owners for widely held vehicles. The Tax Review 2001 advocated treating widely held vehicles as companies and closely held vehicles (fewer than six members) as partnerships. It recommended that future legislative reform should head in this direction. 2.10 There is merit in the simplicity of the Tax Review’s “first principle” approach. However, international trends suggest that to facilitate both domestic and foreign investment, countries need to provide entities that offer “flow-through” tax treatment as well as entities that offer company tax treatment. Indeed, the United States, through its check-the-box rules, has gone as far as to make the tax treatment elective for entities that have a mix of corporate and partnership characteristics. 2.11 The government also agrees with other key observations of Tax Review 2001 on entity taxation. Its Issues Paper examined the relevant economic efficiency considerations relating to the taxation of entities. It observed that differences in the taxation of entities create incentives to shop among different sets of rules (“entity shopping”). It also identified the following types of efficiency costs: • conducting business in an organisational structure that differs from the form that would have been chosen in the absence of tax differences; • searching for, designing and complying with tax-effective entity regimes and structures; and • lobbying to procure the favourable features of other tax rules on the basis of consistency and fairness. 2 The Tax Review 2001 was an independent review commissioned to undertake a broad review of the tax system and to develop proposals to guide the future direction of New Zealand tax policy. 3 The first task the Valabh Committee undertook was to look at the simplification and rationalisation of existing tax rules. 7 2.12 The Tax Review 2001 also said that one of the primary goals of tax policy is to minimise compliance costs. With this in mind, it recommended the following principles for the taxation of entities: • Minimising the number of different general entity treatments. When specific rules are necessary to deal with a special characteristic they should be attached to a general treatment rather than cause a separate holistic treatment of the particular entity. • The boundaries between different entity-specific tax rules should be drawn so that business structures falling on either side of a boundary are not closely substitutable. • Equity or debt instruments that are issued by an entity and that are substitutable for each other should have a uniform tax treatment. • The tax rate applying to an entity should be aligned with the highest personal marginal tax rate, where possible. 2.13 New Zealand already has comprehensive company and trust (partial flow- through) tax treatments on its statute books. If the proposals outlined in this discussion document go ahead, New Zealand will have a new flow-through treatment for partnerships and limited partnerships with separate legal personalities. These new tax rules will complement the existing company and trust alternatives. Taxpayers will then be able to choose between these four different vehicles for their general business and investment undertakings. 2.14 The introduction of new partnership flow-through rules does raise the question of whether it is necessary to retain similar tax treatments offered by the qualifying company (QC) and loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) rules. It is inconsistent with the Tax Review’s principles to proliferate our laws with a variety of flow-through treatments. 4 Submissions are invited on this issue. 2.15 Finally, although the government does not propose to adopt the Tax Review’s proposal to restrict flow-through treatment to entities with fewer than six members, such treatment should not be available for publicly listed vehicles. 4 However, a review of the various flow-through treatments in the Act would not encroach on the proposed portfolio investment entities, the subject of a bill currently before Parliament. 8 Valabh Committee findings 2.16 In 1991 the Valabh Committee 5 undertook a review of the taxation of partnerships and identified six shortcomings of the tax law applicable to partnerships. These were: • The taxation treatment for the entry and exit of partners to or from the partnership (or, more properly, the dissolution and creation of new partnerships as a consequence of these events). In particular, it was noted that the reallocation of interests within a partnership is uncertain and inconsistent. • The allocation to partners of income from different sources or of different types. Specifically, the treatment of partnerships with non- resident partners or in receipt of foreign-sourced income is uncertain. • The treatment of particular transactions (such as the payment of interest on capital and current accounts) and the treatment of asset transfers between partners and the partnership is uncertain. • The allocation of balance dates to a partnership that may differ from individual partners, and the resulting impact on returning income and losses is uncertain. • The treatment of certain payments made to or by partnerships with both resident and non-resident partners is unclear. • The definition of what constitutes a “partnership” for tax purposes is unclear. 2.17 Following consultation, the Valabh Committee recommended that a comprehensive review of the tax treatment of partnerships should be undertaken by officials with a view to developing tax rules that are: • clear in meaning and application; • consistent in approach to the taxation of partners and partnerships, and also with economically equivalent entities; and • able to redress or correct the various problems identified above. 2.18 The Valabh Committee also identified several issues to be considered in a more in-depth review of the taxation of partnerships. Specifically, it recommended that the following areas be reviewed in depth: • the allocation of income between partners; • transactions between partners and the partnership, especially the difference between the treatment of interest on capital accounts and the treatment of interest on current accounts; 5 Key Reforms to the Scheme of Tax Legislation, (The Valabh Committee), October 1991, p.90. 9 • payments made to or by partnerships, especially looking at how the flows are apportioned between resident and non-resident partners; and • the status of “special partnerships”. 2.19 The proposed partnership tax rules aim to deal with these concerns. 10 Chapter 3 FRAMEWORK FOR TAXING INCOME FROM PARTNERSHIPS Summary of proposals • The aggregate approach would prevail in connection with the allocation of income/loss to the partners. • In relation to the entry and exit of partners and the disposal of partnership interests, the government proposes moving towards an entity approach. 3.1 There are generally two conceptual approaches to considering the tax treatment for partnerships – the “aggregate” approach and the “entity” approach. Aggregate approach 3.2 Under a strict aggregate approach, each partner is treated as an owner of a fraction of all the assets of the partnership for tax purposes. The partnership does not exist independently from the partners. There is no calculation of the partnership income at the partnership level. Partners are apportioned their share of each item of income and expenditure from the partnership and the tax consequences are determined for each individual partner at the partner level. When partners sell their interest in the partnership, they are treated as selling a share in each of the underlying assets of the partnership. This may trigger tax adjustments for all of the partners (such as tax depreciation recovery calculations on any disposal of depreciable property). Entity approach 3.3 The entity approach views the partnership as an entity separate from its partners. Each partner owns an interest in the partnership (akin to a shareholder in a company). The income is therefore determined at the partnership level and then apportioned to the partners. It is the net result (income less deductions) that is flowed through to the partners. Partners then include their share of the net result in their own tax return. When a partner disposes of an interest in the partnership it is similar to the sale of a share in a company. Under this framework, complicated tax adjustments are not generally required. 11 International experience 3.4 Strict adherence to either of the approaches outlined above provides logical coherence, but can result in undesirable practical consequences. In reality, many countries adopt a hybrid approach that combines elements of both the aggregate and entity approaches. 3.5 The United States uses aspects of both the entity and aggregate concepts and has developed a comprehensive scheme for the taxation of partnerships. The aggregate concept prevails in connection with the taxation of partnership income of individual partners. By contrast, the entity approach largely prevails when transferring partnership interests. However, a number of special rules and elections have the effect of providing an aggregate treatment to the transfer of partnership interests. 3.6 Australia differentiates general partnerships from limited partnerships. Limited partnerships are taxed as companies in Australia, not as partnerships. 6 In the case of general partnerships, 7 the taxation of partnership income follows an entity-type of approach. The net income of a partnership is calculated as if the partnership is a taxpayer in its own right. Each partner then derives a share of the net partnership income, which becomes assessable income in the hands of any resident partner. When there is a change in the membership of a partnership, Australia adopts more of an aggregate approach, and the partnership is dissolved and a new partnership is formed. 3.7 In the United Kingdom the profits of the partnership are determined at the partnership level and each partner is apportioned a share of the partnership profits (or losses). However, unlike Australia (which follows an aggregate approach), it is only when there is a complete change in the composition of the partnership that the partnership ceases to exist. When someone joins a partnership, the new partner is treated as if he or she had set up and started their own business at that time. If a partner leaves the partnership, his or her business is treated as ceasing on the date of exit. Therefore it appears that the United Kingdom imports more entity concepts into its partnership tax law. 3.8 Currently, New Zealand (while adopting a hybrid approach) is more closely aligned with the aggregate approach. Even though a partnership is defined as “a person” in the Income Tax Act 2004, the Act does not impose income tax on a partnership. 8 Accordingly, when calculating tax payable in respect of a partnership business (which involves identifying the income and allowable deductions applicable to each partner), this is not calculated at the partnership level. Partners must file their own income tax returns, including the share of the income and expenditure apportioned to them by the partnership. 6 However, venture capital limited partnerships (VCLPs) are taxed as partnerships in Australia. 7 And VCLPs. 8 Section HD 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004. The partnership does have limited obligations as a taxpayer under the PAYE rules and the RWT rules. 12 3.9 The problems with our existing tax laws, as identified by the Valabh Committee, are largely as a result of the aggregate approach. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is especially true when partners enter and exit the partnership. 3.10 The current practice is to allow deviations from the purely aggregate approach for administrative and compliance simplicity. Accordingly, some partnerships may take different approaches for tax purposes, depending on their circumstances, and this can result in uncertainty. This uncertainty and the mix of approaches is unsatisfactory. 3.11 In this discussion document the government proposes to codify the tax rules for the purposes of certainty and to provide a reasonable balance between the integrity and accuracy of the “flow-through” mechanism afforded by the aggregate approach and the administrative and compliance convenience of the entity approach. 3.12 The government also proposes a change to New Zealand’s framework for taxing partnerships. This change is similar to the approach adopted in the United States. The aggregate approach will prevail in connection with the allocation of income/loss to the partners, and the rules for doing this will be codified in the Income Tax Act. However, in relation to the entry and exit of partners and the disposal of partnership interests, the government proposes moving towards an entity approach although, as in the United States, some aspects of the aggregate approach will remain. 13 Chapter 4 SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF NEW RULES TO GENERAL AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS Summary of proposals Except when specifically stated, the proposals in this discussion document would apply to each of the following: • any partnership under the Partnership Act 1908; • a limited partnership registered as a “limited partnership” under the proposed Limited Partnership Bill; • any New Zealand-resident partners of foreign general partnerships; and • any New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign limited partnership (that has at least one general partner) that is not publicly traded and does not have a separate legal personality. The generic nature of this reform means that the new rules will apply across a wide range of business activities and investment. It is impossible to anticipate all the administrative and compliance issues that might arise. A comprehensive discussion of these issues will be an important part of the consultation on the proposals in this document. Application of new tax rules to a “partnership” 4.1 There is no general definition of “partnership” in the Income Tax Act. 9 The current partnership tax rules in that Act apply to an arrangement that constitutes a “partnership” under the Partnership Act 1908. 4.2 The Partnership Act 1908 defines a “partnership” as “...the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit...”, but does not include a company. 10 4.3 A partnership is one relationship in which two or more persons can carry on a business together. Each partner will contribute something to the business (often capital) in return for a share in the profit or loss of the partnership. Each partner is also jointly and severally liable for any obligations of the partnership. 9 While not a general definition, section NF 10(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004 currently refers to the definition of “partnership” in the Partnership Act 1908. 10 Partnership Act 1908 (NZ), section 4. 14 4.4 The law recognises that when individuals carry on business together in partnership, certain expectations will arise. Legislation provides for a minimum standard of protection of those expectations, subject to modification by explicit or implicit agreement by the partners. 4.5 A partnership is not a legal entity. A partnership consists of a collection of rights and obligations between the partners. Ownership of partnership assets is vested in the partners, not the partnership. Consequently, the partnership does not own property on its own account. Rather, each partner is treated as jointly owning a share of each of the partnership’s assets. 4.6 As outlined above, whether or not a partnership exists for tax purposes is a question of fact, determined by consideration of all the surrounding factors. New Zealand tax law will generally recognise the existence of a partnership if it exists under general or common law. 11 Application of the new rules to joint ventures 4.7 The current approach of applying partnership tax rules to those partnerships that are found to exist under general partnership law will be retained. This means that those arrangements that do not constitute a “partnership” under general law will not come within the scope of these reforms. 12 The most common example of an investment relationship that does not constitute a partnership is a joint venture. 4.8 The term “joint venture” generally refers to an arrangement that is something less than a partnership. 13 For example, in a contractual joint venture the parties usually carry on separate businesses, although the parties will collaborate on a specific joint-venture activity. Accordingly, the parties will have a different set of rights and obligations as part of the joint-venture activity than would be the case if the parties were in partnership . Common law has attempted to differentiate when a joint venture is not a partnership. 14 The typical features of a joint venture are: • Each party can generally assign its rights in the joint venture without the need for the consent of the other parties. • A party can dispose of its share of the joint venture in any way it chooses. • A party is not responsible for the acts or liabilities of the other parties. • A party is not prevented from competing with the other business participants in business operations outside the joint venture. 11 It should be noted that the existence of a formal written agreement is not conclusive evidence that a partnership exists. Similarly, the absence of such a written agreement is not evidence of a partnership not being in existence. 12 Section 5 of the Partnership Act 1908, outlines rules for determining the existence of a partnership. For example, joint tenancy, tenancy in common, joint property or part ownership do not themselves create a partnership, nor does the sharing of gross returns. 13 The Partnership Act 1908 does not apply to “joint ventures” that do not of themselves qualify as partnerships. 14 United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Ltd (1985) 157 CLR 1; Aotearoa International Limited v Paper Reclaim Limited HC Auckland Registry (CP No 117/01), 19 March 2004; Commerce Commission v Fletcher Challenge Ltd \[1989\] 2 NZLR 554. 15 • Each party retains its own autonomy and control. • Each party to the joint venture may contribute the use of its assets in the joint venture activities but will retain ownership of them. • Each party may be entitled to a share of the output from a joint venture. 4.9 Joint ventures will continue to be taxed as they are currently. However, it may be desirable that some co-owned businesses, with six or more members (that are not partnerships under New Zealand law), are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. Submissions are welcomed on whether the proposals in this discussion document should apply to any form of joint ownership which is not a trust or a company for tax purposes. Inserting a definition of “partnership” in the Income Tax Act 4.10 The Valabh Committee was in favour of inserting into the income tax legislation the definition of what constitutes a partnership according to general partnership law. 4.11 Having a definition of “partnership” that applies to the whole of the Income Tax Act would provide certainty and remove the need for users to refer to the Partnership Act. It would also be consistent with other business entities that are currently defined in the Income Tax Act, such as a “company”. 15 4.12 A minimalist approach would be to clarify in the Income Tax Act that the meaning of “partnership” is a partnership as defined in the Partnership Act. This would clarify that the definition in the Partnership Act and relevant interpretation in case law would be conclusive for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Application of new tax rules to limited partnerships 4.13 Currently, New Zealand taxes special partnerships (a form of limited partnerships) as partnerships. This contrasts with Australia, where limited partnerships are taxed as companies – with an exception for venture capital limited partnerships. 4.14 It is proposed to continue to tax the proposed limited partnerships as partnerships. 16 As the liability of limited partners is limited to their capital contribution, however, some special tax rules will be required. 15 The Companies Act 1993 goes into more detail as to what is required to constitute a company under the Companies Act 1993. However, both the Companies Act 1993 and the Income Tax Act 2004, state that a “company” has a separate legal personality. 16 However, if the limited partnership interests are publicly traded the limited partnership would be taxed as a company, as it would be impractical to apply partnership treatment when ownership interests are frequently traded. 16 New limited partnership legislation 4.15 As explained in Chapter 2, the government plans to replace the special partnership regulatory rules with modern limited-partnership rules. Unlike the current special partnership structure, limited partnerships will be separate legal entities. In the absence of changes to tax law, these limited partnerships would be taxed as companies, although international practice is to allow a flow-through tax treatment for limited partnerships. 4.16 This flow-through tax treatment will require a change to the definition of “company” in the Income Tax Act. The definition of “company” will have to expressly exclude New Zealand-registered limited partnerships. A limited partnership and its partners would be taxed subject to the proposals included in this discussion document. Comparison between general partnerships and limited partnerships 4.17 Most New Zealand taxpayers are less familiar with the limited partnership/special partnership form. To date it has been mainly used for speculative investment undertakings because of the ability to flow through tax losses. The proposed new regulatory reforms may make it a more popular business vehicle. 4.18 There are four key characteristics of an ordinary partnership that a limited partnership does not have. These differences are highlighted in the following table: General partnership Limited partnership All partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The liability of limited partners is limited to the amount of their contribution to the partnership. General partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership in the same way as partners in a general partnership would be. There is implied authority for each partner to bind the firm (and the other partners) in all matters within the ordinary course of business. Only general partners have implied authority to bind the firm. Limited partners have no power to bind the firm. Each partner has the right, subject to what the partners have agreed in the partnership agreement, to participate in the management of the firm. Limited partners are specifically prohibited from taking part in the management of the firm, at the risk of losing their limited liability status. However, certain activities (“safe harbours”) are not considered to be activities in the nature of management. A general partnership is formed by the agreement of the partners, which is usually set out in a partnership agreement and in certain circumstances a business arrangement may be deemed a partnership by a court. A limited partnership is formed by statute, upon registration with the appropriate authority. 17 Minimum threshold rules for partnerships and limited partnerships 4.19 Following the recommendations of the Tax Review 2001, outlined in Chapter 3, the government has opted for a uniform flow-through tax treatment for all partnerships and limited partnerships. It is recognised, however, that the new tax rules will cover a variety of business activities operating as partnership structures, including: • small, closely held businesses; • small, medium and large professional practices; • small investment activities; • widely held investment activities; and • all sectors, including agriculture, forestry and manufacturing. 4.20 Although it may be desirable to provide minimum threshold exemptions from all or part of these reforms, or make parts of these reforms elective, it will be important for the integrity of the tax law to ensure that any exceptions are justified. Submitters are encouraged to consider what, if any, minimum threshold rules will be required in relation to the proposals in this discussion document. Application of the new rules to foreign general partnerships and foreign limited partnerships 4.21 The New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign general partnership will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the proposals contained in this discussion document. 4.22 However, the treatment of New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign limited partnership would depend on whether the limited partnership is a separate legal entity. New Zealand-resident partners of foreign limited partnerships – without separate legal personality – will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the proposals contained in this discussion document (provided there is at least one general partner and the partnership is not publicly traded). New Zealand-resident partners of a foreign limited partnership with separate legal personality would be taxed in accordance with the foreign hybrids legislation. The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 introduced new rules to clarify that a foreign hybrid (an entity that has a flow-through tax treatment but is a separate legal entity) will be treated as a company under the Income Tax Act. 18 Chapter 5 PROPOSED “FLOW-THROUGH” OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE Summary of proposals This chapter codifies the tax treatment of apportioning income and deductions to partners by proposing that partners will derive income/expenses from each source, in proportion to their profit share. 5.1 The principal aim of these proposals is to create a set of tax rules that gives clear guidance to taxpayers. At the same time it is important to maintain the integrity of the tax system, and the principle of tax neutrality between different business structures. 5.2 This chapter explains how the proposed framework for taxing income from partnerships (as outlined in Chapter 3) will apply in practice. It outlines the proposed tax rules for flowing through the income and expenditure of a partnership. Apportioning income and deductions 5.3 Section HD 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act contains a general rule requiring partners to “take into account their share of the income that they jointly derive from the firm”. In addition, the Partnership Act 1908 provides that in the absence of an express or implied agreement, the partners share equally in the profits and losses of the partnership. 17 Accordingly, each partner’s “share” of partnership income is the amount apportioned in accordance with the partnership agreement or the Partnership Act 1908. 5.4 The reference to “income” in section HD 1(1)(b) is to a gross amount. Partners can claim allowable deductions against income attributed to them from the partnership for expenses that satisfy the general deductibility rules – that is, when there is sufficient nexus between expenses and income derived through the partnership. This includes: • expenses jointly incurred by the partnership; or • expenses of the partner in relation to his or her investment in the partnership. 17 Partnership Act 1908, s 27(a). 19 5.5 Proportionate allocation of costs is not explicitly required by the current tax rules. However, the practice appears to be that partners apportion expenses and deductions in the same proportion that their gross profits are apportioned. 5.6 The key issue is the extent to which partnerships should be able to apportion income from different sources to different partners. The Valabh Committee 18 noted that: As a general principle, profits cannot be allocated to one partner for tax purposes while allocating losses to another partner. However, where a partnership derives income from different sources and of different kinds, there appear to be no restrictions on the method by which such income is allocated. 5.7 Example 1 illustrates the effect of apportioning different sources of income to different partners. Example 1 Assume there is a partnership consisting of four partners. Partner 1 is a New Zealand charity, partner 2 is non-resident, partner 3 is a New Zealand taxpayer, partner 4 is also a New Zealand taxpayer but is in a loss position. The partnership has assets comprising a building, foreign shares and New Zealand shares. The partners agree to split the items of income in the following way. Partner 1 would receive all the rental income. Partner 2 would receive all the foreign dividends. Partner 3 would receive the capital gain on the sale of the building. Partner 4 would receive the dividends from the New Zealand shares. They agree to share equally the expenses jointly incurred by the partnership. At the end of the year the partnership has income of $NZ440 rent, $NZ360 foreign dividends, and $NZ400 of unimputed dividends. The partnership deductions consist of depreciation of $NZ100 and interest paid on the building mortgage of $100. At the end of the year, one of the buildings is sold for a capital gain of $400. If the partnership is able to apportion the income and the deductions as provided for in the agreement, it will minimise the partners’ tax liability overall. Partner 1 (charity) Partner 2 (non-resident) Partner 3 (NZ taxpayer) Partner 4 (NZ taxpayer in loss) Income Rent $440 Foreign dividends $360 Capital gains $400 Dividends $400 Total $440 $360 $400 $400 Deductions Depreciation $25 $25 $25 $25 Interest on loan $25 $25 $25 $25 18 In the discussion document, Key reforms to the scheme of tax legislation, (1991) p. 94. 20 5.8 The Valabh Committee initially recommended that partners be deemed to derive income from each source in proportion to their profit shares. 5.9 The Valabh Committee also made some critical observations in its final report. 19 First, it noted that the major areas of concern were that: • Taxed and non-taxed income may be allocated between partners with different tax rates (income splitting). • Income from different sources may be allocated to resident and non- resident partners, depending upon the tax treatment afforded to that income. • Tax credits may be streamed to those partners most able to use them. 5.10 Following consultation, the Valabh Committee indicated that there was a mixture of views on whether it was possible to apportion different streams of income or whether it was only possible to allocate different income streams proportionately: There is a degree of uncertainty about the ability of a partnership to allocate income from different sources to different partners (as opposed to allocating profit shares based on the income streams received by the partnership from specific sources). 20 5.11 The Valabh Committee decided not to propose a statutory formula for deeming partners to receive income from differing sources on a pro rata basis at that time – noting that there was uncertainty about whether the manipulation of income was causing a problem in practice. However, it concluded that the entire subject should be given careful attention as part of a comprehensive review of the taxation of partnerships. Proposed approach 5.12 The approach suggested by the Valabh Committee for several reasons will be adopted. First, it is important to have certainty on the allocation of income and expenditure for income tax purposes – particularly given the expected increase in use of partnerships and limited partnerships as a result of the regulatory reform. Second, this approach seems to be most consistent with the notion that a partnership, like a company, is a vehicle whereby investors pool assets and are jointly liable. Third, it prevents the streaming of income and expenditure designed to take advantage of the different tax circumstances of the partners. Fourth, it is broadly in line with international practice. 21 19 Final report of the consultative committee on the taxation of income from capital, The Valabh Committee (October 1992) p.46. 20 Final report of the consultative committee on the taxation of income from capital, The Valabh Committee (October 1992) p.46. 21 Australia and Canada allocate “net income”. An allocation of net income (being a blending of income and deductions from all sources) gives the same result as the proportionate approach to the allocation of income and expenses proposed in this discussion document. The possibility of allocating net income has been considered as an option but there are difficulties reconciling this approach with the core provisions in the Income Tax Act. The United States also allocates net income to partners but allows special allocations of income and expenditure to specific partners. However, those special allocations will not be respected if they do not have “substantial economic effect” and are simply done to achieve a tax benefit. 21 5.13 The current law already contains anti-streaming rules for the allocation of imputation credits among partners to ensure that the imputed dividends are not apportioned to the partner best able to use them. Adoption of this proportionate approach is consistent with this specific anti-streaming rule. Proposed flow-through treatment of partnership income and deductions to partners 5.14 Assessable income derived and expenditure incurred through the partnership will be apportioned by the partnership to an income year in accordance with the existing provisions of the Income Tax Act as though the partnership were itself a taxpayer. Generally, rules relevant to the character of receipts and timing of the apportionment of income to a particular income year will be applied at the partnership level rather than at partner level. For instance, in determining whether the sale of an asset of the partnership business is on capital or revenue account, the tests would be applied as if the partnership were a taxpayer disposing of the asset. This approach accords with the commercial reality of the partnership as a business vehicle and brings the law into line with current practice. 5.15 Under the proposed new rules, assessable income, excluded income, exempt income or a non-resident’s foreign-sourced income in the hands of the partners would be apportioned by the partnership to each partner in accordance with each partner’s profit share (“the proportionate rule”). 22 Each item will retain its character in the hands of the partner. Partners will then individually, include these amounts in the appropriate income year. 5.16 Capital gains or capital losses would also be apportioned by the partnership to each partner in accordance with each partner’s profit share. 5.17 Expenses jointly incurred by the partners in relation to income through the partnership would also be apportioned to the partners in the same proportions. Again, the tax treatment of expenses jointly incurred by the partners will generally be determined at the partnership level, unless the tax status or position of the partner is important for determining deductibility – for example, interest that is subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Accordingly, the partnership will determine whether there is a nexus between the expenditure and assessable income or excluded income, or whether the expense was incurred in deriving an amount even if that item would be exempt income in the hands of the partners. 22 However, if a new partner has made an election to adjust his or her tax book value in the assets (see Chapter 9) this may alter the allocation of certain items (for example, a depreciation allowance) between the partners. 22 5.18 Individual partners will then return these items as part of their own tax return based on the relevant information provided by the partnership. Specifically, amounts that are assessable income will be included and aggregated with a partner’s other income to determine that partner’s annual gross income. Expenses incurred that have a nexus with amounts that are either assessable income or excluded income of the partner will constitute a deduction apportioned to that income year. These deductions will then be aggregated with the partner’s annual allowable deductions although, as discussed in Chapter 8, some amounts may need to be carried forward by limited partners in line with the proposed loss limitation rules. 5.19 The tax treatment of expenses that a partner incurs separately to invest in the partnership will be determined at the partner level. This is because the expenses are incurred by the partner acting in an individual capacity rather than jointly incurred by the partners in the carrying out of the partnership business. 5.20 Any credits attached to an amount that flows through to a partner will be apportioned proportionately with the partner’s profit share. For example, imputation credits attached to a dividend will be apportioned to each of the partners according to their respective partnership profit shares – regardless of which partner is allocated the dividend in the partnership agreement. 23 Similarly, resident withholding tax credits will be apportioned in accordance with the proportionate rule. 24 These credits can then be used to offset a partner’s income tax liability. Example 2: Proposed flow-through approach Under the proposed flow-through approach, the same partnership in Example 1 will have to apportion the income and expenses so that each partner receives a proportionate amount of each item of income as follows: Partner 1 (charity) Partner 2 (non-resident) Partner 3 (NZ taxpayer) Partner 4 (NZ taxpayer in loss) Income Rent $121 $99 $110 $110 Foreign dividends $99 $81 $90 $90 Capital gains $110 $90 $100 $100 Dividends $110 $90 $100 $100 Total $440 $360 $400 $400 Deductions Depreciation $27.50 $22.50 $25 $25 Interest on loan $27.50 $22.50 $25 $25 23 This is consistent with section LB 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 24 This is consistent with section LB 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 23 Partner 1 (the charity) will receive the same amount of income. Partner 1 will also receive $55 of expenses connected with that income which it cannot deduct. Partner 2 (the non-resident partner) will have $189 of New Zealand-sourced income and $45 of deductions which can be used to offset his annual gross income. Partner 3 (the New Zealand partner) will have $300 of income to aggregate with her other assessable income, and $50 of deductions to aggregate with her other allowable deductions. Partner 4 (the New Zealand partner in a loss position) will have $300 of income to aggregate with his other assessable income, and $50 of deductions to aggregate with his other allowable deductions. However, as Partner 4 is in a loss position overall, it is unlikely that he will have an income tax liability. Similarly, each partner will be apportioned a proportionate share of the foreign tax paid. The amount of the credit is the lesser of the amount of foreign tax paid or the New Zealand tax in respect of that income. In accordance with the existing rules, any excess foreign tax credits cannot be carried forward or refunded. 25 As outlined in Example 1, the partnership has $NZ360 of foreign dividends. The partnership has paid $NZ54 26 in foreign tax on these dividends. Therefore, under the proposed approach, the partnership will advise each partner that in relation to the proportion of foreign dividends received, the following amount of foreign tax has been paid: Foreign dividend received (NZ$) Foreign tax paid (NZ$) Partner 1 (charity) $99 $14.85 Partner 2 (non-resident) $81 $12.15 Partner 3 (NZ-resident) $90 $13.50 Partner 4 (NZ-resident in loss) $90 $13.50 Individual partners will then have to calculate the foreign tax credit they are entitled to. As Partner 1 is a charity it cannot use a foreign tax credit. Similarly, as Partner 2 is a non-resident he will not be taxed on the foreign dividend and therefore cannot receive a foreign tax credit. 27 Partner 3 is the only partner who can use the foreign tax credit because Partner 4 is in loss. Non-standard balance dates 5.21 The correct allocation to a partner’s income year of that partner’s share in the income and expenditure of the partnership is a relatively simple exercise when the balance dates of all the partners and the partnership are aligned. However, this process can become more complex in the case of non-standard balance dates – such as when the partnership has a balance date other than 31 March. The Commissioner's balance date policy, as set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 9 (June 1992) and confirmed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994) currently addresses this situation. However, submissions on this issue are welcomed. 25 Except controlled foreign company tax credits which may be carried forward (as happens under current rules). 26 This is assuming that the dividend is received from a treaty country. The country from which the dividend is received also has the same treaty rate with the country the non-resident partner is from. 27 The non-resident may be able to receive a tax credit for the tax paid in their country of residence. 24 Calculation of income and expenditure for new and exiting partners 5.22 Under current tax law, the expenditure incurred by the partners of an existing partnership is generally not deductible to incoming partners. Expenditure incurred from the time of entry will generally be deductible to a new partner if that expenditure meets the deductibility tests under the Income Tax Act. However, a problem arises when trying to determine the amount of expenditure relating to a part-year for tax purposes. Similarly, a problem also arises when determining the amount of taxable income that can be attributed to partners for the part-year before an existing partner exits the partnership, or the part-year from when a new partner joins a partnership. 5.23 Two approaches are proposed to deal with these quantification and apportionment issues and the associated compliance costs: • the close-off approach; and • the simplified apportionment approach. 5.24 It is intended that these approaches would be chosen at the discretion of the partnership through a joint election. Close-off approach 5.25 Under this approach, the income and expenditure attributable to the existing partners would be calculated (and apportioned to them) up to the time a new partner enters the partnership (and/or the time an existing partner exits a partnership). This option would most probably involve the preparation of financial and tax accounts for the appropriate part-year period, but would ensure that all taxable income derived and deductible expenditure incurred by existing partners is factored into their net income/loss allocations for the period before the new partner joined (or the exiting partner left). Under this approach, the apportioned income for that period would not be taxable to the incoming partner, nor would the apportioned deductions be deductible to that partner. Instead, these amounts would be apportioned to the partners that existed at the time of exit or entry for inclusion in their individual income tax returns. 5.26 This option is likely to be accurate in determining the appropriate amount of taxable income and deductible expenditure attributable to existing partners, exiting partners and incoming partners. However, it may be more compliance-intensive as a result of the associated accounting and tax activities required. Accordingly, a less compliance-intensive option could be considered. To this end, an alternative “simplified apportionment approach” is proposed. 25 Simplified apportionment approach 5.27 This option would involve calculating a weighted average of the level of an exiting partner’s partnership interest for the part-year period of which he or she was a partner. A portion of the taxable income and deductible expenditure would then be allocated to the exiting partner on this basis. Example 3 helps illustrate this approach in relation to deductible expenditure. Example 3 Partnership X comprises four partners, each with a 25% interest in the partnership as at 31 March 2009 (the balance date of the partnership and each of the partners). Partner A (a general partner) had an interest of 10% for the period 1 April 2008 until 30 June 2008. From 1 July 2008, the level of Partner A’s interest increased to 25%, and it remained at this level until 31 December 2008, the time of Partner A’s exit from the partnership. Deductible expenditure of $50,000 had been incurred by the partnership in relation to the lease of partnership business premises for the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009. Under this method, Partner A would be entitled to a deduction calculated as follows: days 365 days 91 x 10% x $50,000 = $1,246.58 Plus: 365 184 x 25% x $50,000 = $6,301.37 The total deduction for Partner A would be: $7,547.95. 5.28 While this option would be less accurate than the close-off approach, it could constitute a simplified and less costly alternative, particularly for larger (for example, professional) partnerships. 26 Chapter 6 TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTNERS AND PARTNERSHIPS Summary of proposals • Salary and wages paid to a partner would generally not be deductible to the partnership unless performed as part of a written contract of service. • Rent and interest (on amounts over and above the capital contributed to the partnership) received by a partner from a partnership would be deductible to the partnership provided the payments meet the general test of deductibility. • All transactions between partners and partnerships must occur at market value for tax purposes. Salaries and wages paid to a partner 6.1 Under current tax law, any remuneration paid by a partnership to a partner is generally seen as drawings – not as salary or wages. Therefore a partnership cannot generally claim a deduction for income tax purposes for salary paid to a partner (Case F123 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,157, Case L28 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,172). This follows the principle under general partnership law that a partner cannot employ him or herself. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. 6.2 First, section DC 4 of the Income Tax Act allows the members of a partnership to receive a deduction for their share of any payment made by the partnership to a partner for services performed for the partnership under a written contract of service. The recipient partner must personally and actively perform any duties that are required to be performed in carrying on the partnership business. The contract must also specify the amount payable to the partner for the services he or she performs in carrying out the partnership business. It is implicit that the fee must be at arm’s length. However, no deduction is allowed if the partnership is engaged principally in the investment of money or the holding of or dealing in shares, securities, estates or interests in land. 6.3 Second, section DC 3 of the Income Tax Act allows a tax deduction for pensions (that are of a reasonable amount) paid to a former partner or the surviving spouse or civil union partner, of a former partner. 28 28 However, this section does not apply to partnerships that are principally engaged in the investment of money or the holding of or dealing in shares, securities, estates or interests in land. 27 6.4 Under the proposed rules, this treatment would be maintained as it is consistent with general partnership law and international practices. 29 However, submissions on the matter are welcomed. Rent transactions 6.5 Under the general deductibility provision 30 and section GD 10 of the Income Tax Act, a partnership that leases property from one of its partners is allowed a deduction for the rent payable. The rental income received by the partner is treated as assessable income to that partner. Similarly, if a partnership leases any property to a partner, the rental income received is considered as assessable income to the partnership. It follows that the partner incurring the leasing expenditure is allowed a deduction for the rent paid, provided the requirements of the general deductibility test are met. 6.6 The deduction is subject to an anti-avoidance provision that ensures the amount of rent paid is “adequate rent”. “Adequate rent” is defined as “the amount of rent that the Commissioner determines to be adequate for that property during the period in respect of which the determination is made”. 31 This is generally a market value rent. 6.7 This treatment would be maintained as it is consistent with the general deductibility rule and with international practice. 32 However, submissions on the matter are welcomed. Interest paid to a partner 6.8 Under existing law, a tax deduction is not allowed for interest paid to a partner in respect of his or her capital contribution to the partnership. 33 The interest is treated as a distribution of the partnership profits. 6.9 Nevertheless, if a partner provides a loan to the partnership that is an amount over and above his or her capital contribution, any interest paid by the partnership to the partner in relation to this loan will be deductible to the partners of the partnership under sections DA 1 and DB 6 of the Income Tax Act. The interest paid to the partner constitutes assessable interest income in the hands of the recipient partner. 29 In Australia and the United Kingdom (except Scotland) salaries are not deductible to the partnership. They are seen as a means of distributing partnership income. In the United States, if the partner is acting in his or her capacity as such, the salary is treated as part of the partner’s distributive share and is not deductible to the partnership. However, if the partner is acting at arm’s length with the partnership or receives a fixed or “guaranteed payment” for services, the payment is treated as ordinary income to the partner and is deductible to the partnership. 30 Income Tax Act 2004, s DA 1. 31 Income Tax Act 2004, s GD 10(4). 32 In the United States rent paid by a partnership to a partner is deductible to the partnership and is income to the partner. This is also subject to an anti-avoidance rule – “substantial economic effect”. 33 Section 27 of the Partnership Act 1908 states that a partner is entitled to interest only on any actual payment or advance beyond the capital which he or she has agreed to subscribe. 28 6.10 The Partnership Act 1908 states that a partner is entitled to interest at 5 percent a year on any amount over and above his or her capital contribution. However, the rate is not limited to this amount because it can be modified by a partnership agreement. 6.11 This treatment would be maintained, subject to the market value rule discussed below, as it is consistent with the general deductibility rule and with international practice. 34 However, submissions on the matter are welcomed. Market value rule 6.12 The existing rule on rent transactions requires the transaction to be made at market value for tax purposes. The requirement for arm’s-length transactions is implicit in the requirements of section DC 4, in relation to contracts for services. It will be clarified that, in all cases, transactions between partners and partnerships must be at market value to qualify for the relevant tax treatment of being deductible to the partnership and taxable to the partner. Partnership asset sold to a partner 6.13 When a partnership asset is sold to a partner for that partner’s own private ownership and use, the partnership will be required to recognise any gain or loss on disposition in accordance with general tax principles. 35 For example, in the case of the disposal of depreciable property to a partner, this would involve the calculation of any amount of depreciation recovery or depreciation loss on sale of the asset. The consideration derived for the disposal of the asset will be deemed to be at market value for tax purposes. Introduction of property by a partner 6.14 The introduction of property into a partnership by a partner would constitute a disposal of the property by the partner to the partnership for income tax purposes. The partner disposing of the property would be required to recognise any gain or loss on disposition in accordance with general tax principles. For example, if the partner was disposing of revenue account property to the partnership, the proceeds would constitute assessable income to the partner and the cost of the property would be an allowable deduction to the partner. 34 The United States adopts a similar approach to that of New Zealand. Interest is also deductible in Australia if the money lent to the partnership is used by the partnership in producing income. 35 This is consistent with the approach under existing legislation. 29 Submissions 6.15 Submissions are welcomed on whether and how the approaches discussed in this chapter might give rise to legitimate business concerns. Specific examples illustrating any concerns would be helpful. In addition, submitters should consider whether these concerns arise specifically for general partnerships, limited partnerships, or both. 30 Chapter 7 FLOW-THROUGH TREATMENT: INTERNATIONAL AND CROSS-BORDER ISSUES Summary of proposals • The current approach of applying the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to partnerships would be retained. • The dividend withholding payment and underlying foreign tax credit rules would apply to New Zealand-resident companies that are partners. • Non-resident partners would be subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) – at the domestic rate or the applicable treaty rate – on any New Zealand-sourced dividends, interest or royalties. • A New Zealand-resident company would be eligible for a foreign investor tax credit in relation to a dividend derived by a non-resident partner. • Foreign partners would not be taxed on their proportionate share of foreign- sourced income. Application of controlled foreign company (CFC) rules 7.1 The current CFC rules fit reasonably well with the partnership flow-through treatment discussed in Chapter 5. This is because the rules generally apply at the New Zealand partner level, although the interests of other partners are taken into account through the associated person test for certain purposes. The government proposes to retain the current approach for both partnerships and limited partnerships. 7.2 Under the current rules, when a partnership holds an interest in a foreign company, individual partners are required to take the full partnership interest into account for the purposes of determining their own control interest and whether or not that foreign company is a CFC. (However, an interest may be counted only once in determining whether a foreign company is a CFC.) Specifically, the control interest test for a CFC applies to New Zealand residents (see section EX 1). Section EX 3(b) provides that a New Zealand- resident’s control interest in a foreign company includes: ...any direct control interests in the company held by persons associated with the New Zealand resident. 31 7.3 A partnership and any person who is a partner (or associated with a partner) in the partnership is an associated person (see section OD 8(3)(e) and (f)). This associated person rule is also relevant in the partnership context for the purposes of determining whether the partner has an income interest in the CFC of 10% or more and is therefore required to return the attributed CFC income or loss for the CFC. 7.4 For the purpose of determining the income interest of each partner, each partner is treated as holding a share of anything held by the partnership, according to the partner’s proportionate interest in the partnership. (See section EX 13 of the Income Tax Act.) 7.5 Under the proposed rules, individual partners can claim a foreign tax credit against their attributed CFC income. They will be able to establish their branch equivalent tax account (BETA) to record credits to offset income tax or dividend withholding payment (DWP) liability on foreign dividends. Foreign dividends, interest and royalties 7.6 New Zealand-resident individual partners will be liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any foreign dividends earned by the partnership. They will be entitled to a foreign tax credit (FTC) for any foreign non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) imposed on the dividend. They can also offset their tax liability with BETA credits. 7.7 New Zealand-resident companies that are partners will be liable to make a dividend withholding payment on their proportionate share of foreign dividends. If the corporate partner has the requisite voting interest, market value interest (where relevant) or income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company, it will be eligible for an underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) in accordance with the UFTC rules. If the foreign company is resident in one of the eight “grey list” countries, the corporate partner may be entitled to a deemed UFTC. 7.8 New Zealand-resident partners are taxed on their proportionate shares of foreign interest and royalties at their marginal rates. They will be entitled to a FTC for foreign NRWT imposed on their proportionate share of that income. 7.9 New Zealand-resident partners will be liable for income tax on their proportionate share of the income of the foreign branch. A FTC will be provided for income tax imposed on the branch by the host country. Taxation of non-resident partners on New Zealand income 7.10 The source rules will generally apply to determine whether income derived by the partnership from its activities or investments has a New Zealand source. 32 7.11 A non-resident partner will be taxed on their proportionate share of business income derived by the partnership from a business carried on in New Zealand. This income will continue to be taxable under the treaty if the business carried on by the partnership constitutes a permanent establishment for the purposes of the business profits article in the treaty. Paragraph 19.1 of the Commentary to Article 5 in the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 36 clarifies that the activities of a transparent entity may constitute a permanent establishment for its non-resident members. 7.12 A non-resident partner’s proportionate share of New Zealand-sourced interest derived from the partnership will be subject to NRWT at the relevant domestic or treaty rate. If, however, the partnership includes a New Zealand- resident partner the interest payment is currently subject to withholding tax at resident withholding tax rates (section NG 2(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act). This is because the interest income is derived jointly by residents and non- residents. Partners who are residents of treaty countries are, however, entitled to obtain a refund from the Commissioner for the over-deducted tax. One option would be to enable the partnership to apply for a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax and then require the partnership to withhold at the appropriate NRWT rate. The partnership would also be required to withhold RWT with respect to its resident partners who do not hold certificates of exemption. Changes to existing legislation would be required to achieve this result. 7.13 A non-resident partner’s proportionate share of dividends derived by the New Zealand partnership from shares in a New Zealand company would also be subject to NRWT at the relevant domestic or treaty rate. A New Zealand company is also eligible for a foreign investor tax credit (FITC) in relation to a dividend derived by a non-resident partner. As a practical matter, the partnership would need to provide the company with information about the residence of its members to enable the company to comply with the imputation, FITC and NRWT rules. The government is interested to know whether there are any difficulties in relation to the way these rules operate in practice. 7.14 A non-resident partner’s proportionate share of royalties earned by the partnership would be subject to NRWT at the relevant domestic or treaty rate. Again, the payer of the royalty would need to know the residence of the partner to withhold at the correct rate. 7.15 Non-resident partners would not be taxed in New Zealand on their proportionate share of foreign-sourced income derived by the partnership. 7.16 Neither foreign nor New Zealand partners would be taxed on their proportionate share of capital gains derived by the partnership. The general law that determines whether gains are of a capital nature will apply in this regard (see paragraph 5.14). 36 Paragraph 19.1 states: “... If the period of time spent on the site by the partners and the employees of the partnership exceeds twelve month(s), the enterprise carried on by the partnership will therefore be considered to have a permanent establishment. Each partner will thus be considered to have a permanent establishment for purposes of the taxation of his share of the business profits derived by the partnership regardless of the time spent by himself on the site.” 33 Issue for submissions Nominee companies are known to advise the company/payer of the dividend or royalty with the relevant information concerning the beneficial owners of the nominee company. Submissions are welcomed on whether or not this approach would be suitable for partnerships. Residence of partnerships and source rules 7.17 New Zealand partnerships currently are not “resident” for New Zealand tax purposes. Nor are they generally regarded as resident for the purposes of our tax treaties because: • they are not resident under our domestic law; or • are not “liable to tax” because they are fiscally transparent. 7.18 The result is that treaty benefits should be conferred on partnerships when the partners are resident in New Zealand. 37 The approach adopted for the taxation of partnerships is not expected to affect the application of treaties. 7.19 The Valabh Committee did, however, identify some particular issues arising from the lack of residence status. For example, the source rules in section OE 4 38 deem certain types of income to have a New Zealand source if: • for interest and redemption payments, the money is lent outside New Zealand to a person who is resident in New Zealand; • royalty payments are made by a resident in New Zealand; and • payments for the use of personal property are paid by a resident in New Zealand. 7.20 When the partnership is comprised of New Zealand partners it is clear that payments of interest, royalties and rents have a New Zealand source. The more difficult issue is how to deal with payments by New Zealand partnerships that comprise New Zealand and non-resident partners. As noted by the Valabh Committee, theoretically at least, payments of interest, royalties or rent by a New Zealand partnership made to a non-resident should have a New Zealand source when the partners are New Zealand-resident. Ideally, the payment would be apportioned in some way to determine the amount that has a New Zealand source. One option would be to adopt the Valabh Committee proposal and deem partnerships with 50 percent or more New Zealand-resident partners to be New Zealand-resident for the purposes of the source rules only. Submissions on this issue are welcomed. 37 Although it is important to examine each treaty to determine the application of treaty protection in a given case. 38 Income Tax Act 2004. 34 Chapter 8 LIMITATION OF LIMITED PARTNERS’ TAX LOSSES Summary of proposals The proposed rules in this chapter apply only to limited partners. They include: • the introduction of loss limitation rules to ensure that the net limited partnership loss claimed by a limited partner in relation to a limited partnership interest reflects the actual level of that limited partner’s economic loss; and • the introduction of the “partner’s basis” concept (basis tracking) to determine the extent of the application of the loss limitation rules – limited partners would be required to track the amount of their basis. Limiting tax losses allowed to limited partners 8.1 Limited partnerships are different from general partnerships in one important respect. Partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability with respect to their business dealings through the partnership. When general partners incur a loss through a general partnership, it generally will be an economic loss, as their liability for loss is not restricted to the level of their investment in the general partnership. In contrast, limited partners are not exposed to any risk of loss greater than the amount of their limited partnership investment. This feature of a limited partnership will be even more entrenched with the proposed separate legal personality. 8.2 The rationale behind restricting a limited partner’s net tax losses in any given year is to ensure that the net tax losses claimed by a limited partner reflect the actual level of that partner’s economic loss in relation to the limited partnership interest. It is an appropriate policy result to allow taxpayers to offset, for tax purposes, only those net tax losses they have actually borne. The absence of loss limitation rules is likely to distort efficient risk-bearing decision-making and efficient resource allocation by encouraging investors to enter arrangements or schemes whereby small amounts of capital are invested to get access to larger net tax losses. This could result in abuse of the limited partnership rules and in actions that are contrary to their intent. This may potentially create large fiscal costs to the government. 8.3 The loss limitation rules proposed in this chapter are consistent with the treatment provided by other countries. 39 Introduction by New Zealand of rules consistent with internationally accepted practice should not deter foreign investors. 39 For instance, the United States and Australia (for venture capital limited partnerships) have similar loss limitation rules. 35 Proposed tax loss limitation rules 8.4 Special tax loss limitation rules would prevent the flow-through of losses in excess of the actual investment of the limited partner in any income year. Therefore the rules would limit the loss allowed to be utilised in that year up to the amount of the limited partner’s economic loss. 8.5 To apply these rules, limited partners would be required to calculate their net income or loss from the limited partnership as a separate calculation from their other income. This is referred to as “net limited partnership income” and “net limited partnership loss”. 8.6 A limited partner’s share in the net limited partnership loss disallowed in any year would be allowed to be carried forward to future years. It would effectively flow through only when the limited partner had sufficient taxable income from the limited partnership available to offset the losses, or sufficient equity/investment at risk in the limited partnership. 8.7 The existing deferred deduction rule may potentially apply to limit the loss that flows through to limited (and general) partners. However, the deferred deduction rule does not address the more general issue of limiting the losses available to limited partners to the amount of their economic loss. Therefore, a broader mechanism will be required in the context of limited partnerships. 8.8 Under existing tax legislation, 40 special partners will forfeit any tax losses incurred in an income year if they do not derive any New Zealand assessable income in that income year. Non-residents therefore cannot carry forward any losses that arise from investing in New Zealand special partnerships if they have no other New Zealand-sourced income. Non-residents may then be taxed in a later year when they derive income from the partnership. This rule may arguably overtax non-resident investors in special partnerships and may discourage some non-resident investment into special partnerships. Accordingly, it is proposed to repeal these rules and replace them with tax loss limitation and carry-forward rules for limited partners. Such rules better reflect the economic consequences to the limited partner and are more consistent with international practice. This proposal may make investment by non-residents into New Zealand limited partnerships more attractive than under the current law applying to special partners. Partner’s basis 8.9 A partner’s adjusted investment in a partnership would be referred to as the partner’s “basis”. For limited partnerships, it will be necessary to implement basis rules for the purpose of the proposed loss limitation rules. Basis rules may also be required to ensure income tax is appropriately accounted for on an exit from a partnership. 40 Section IE 1(2B) of the Income Tax Act. 36 8.10 A process of “basis tracking” would allow partners to maintain a running balance of their basis in a partnership, and would determine whether the loss limitation rules apply to a limited partner in an income year. “Basis tracking” would provide limited partners with an amount against which the quantity of losses from a limited partnership (or the amount of losses limited and carried forward) would be measured in any given year. 8.11 The next section explains two potential basis mechanisms and how they would operate to determine whether the tax losses of a limited partner are limited (and carried forward) in any given income year and the extent of any such tax loss limitation. Calculation of a partner’s basis 8.12 A partner’s basis would be calculated in any income year in the following manner: original investment + value of additional contractual guarantees and indemnities provided + share of net limited partnership income previously recognised + prior equity injections – share of net limited partnership loss previously recognised – prior distributions Original investment The original investment would be the partner’s initial investment contribution to the partnership. The original investment would be calculated by reference to the market value of net assets (or services) contributed to the partnership or paid to an existing partner for the partnership interest. The market values would be required to be calculated on an arm’s-length basis. Value of additional contractual guarantees and indemnities provided Should a partner provide any guarantees or indemnities in addition to the amount of original investment, the value of any such guarantees or indemnities would be added to the amount of that partner’s basis. These guarantees or indemnities would have to be contractual in nature and enforceable by non-associated third parties before any adjustment to that partner’s basis would be allowed. The amount of any guarantees or indemnities that expire, or that are cancelled or subsequently rescinded, would be subtracted from this amount. Share of net limited partnership income previously recognised This amount would be the partner’s share of the net limited partnership income (being the excess of the partner’s income over deductions) generated by the partnership (that has been recognised by the partner in earlier periods) as calculated under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act. 37 Prior equity injections This comprises capital injections (new amounts of capital in addition to the original investment capital) provided to the partnership by a partner over the period the partner holds the partnership interest. Share of net limited partnership loss previously recognised This amount would be the partner’s share of the net limited partnership loss (being the excess of the partner’s deductions over income) previously “flowed through” to a partner in a partnership and deducted by the partner. Prior distributions Prior distributions are effectively withdrawals of equity or capital by a partner or distributions of income to a partner over the period the partner holds a partnership interest. Example 1 On 1 April 2008 limited Partner B contributes equity of $100,000 to Partnership X. Partnership X comprises four partners. Each partner shares equally in the net income and loss of the partnership. All partners (including Partner B) have the same March balance date as the partnership. Partnership X derives net income of $40,000 for the income year ended 31 March 2009. The basis calculation for Partner B would be calculated as follows: Original investment $ 100,000 + Prior net income $ 10,000 Partner B’s basis – 31/3/2009 $ 110,000 On 1 June 2009, Partner B receives a distribution from the partnership of $5,000. For the income year ended 31 March 2010, the partnership makes a loss of $460,000. Basis calculation for Partner B: Original investment $ 100,000 Prior net limited partnership income $ 10,000 Additional guarantees/indemnities $ 0 Prior equity injections $ 0 Prior net limited partnership losses $ (0) Prior distributions $ (5,000) Partner B’s basis – 31/3/2010 $ 105,000 Basis of Partner B $ 105,000 Partner B’s share of tax loss $ (115,000) Allowable tax loss to Partner B – 2010 $ (105,000) Apply the loss limitation rule Disallowed tax loss $ (10,000) The disallowed tax loss (from the limited partnership) cannot be included in the limited partner’s annual tax calculation as an annual total deduction. In other words, it cannot be offset against any other income of the limited partner. It can be carried forward by Partner B to a future year if Partner B has sufficient basis in the partnership to offset against the loss. 38 8.13 The loss limitation rules apply only to limited partners. The basis of limited partners would generally not fall below zero, as they could not deduct a net limited partnership tax loss greater than the amount of their basis. 41 8.14 If a limited partner disposes of his or her partnership interest, and at the time of disposal that limited partner has tax losses carried forward, the limited partner’s tax losses would be extinguished because they could not be used. However, they could be used to reduce a revenue account adjustment, if any, as discussed in Chapter 9. Alternative partner’s basis calculation 8.15 A possible alternative calculation mechanism for the determination of a partner’s basis can be illustrated by the following formula: Partner’s basis = OI + AGI + TI + RCG + PEI – TL – RCL – PD Where: OI = original investment AGI = value of any additional guarantees or indemnities provided TI = share of net limited partnership income previously recognised RCG = share of realised capital gains previously recognised (reduced by any amount of taxable income in relation to capital dispositions that are included in TI, such as a depreciation recovery arising from the disposition of a business asset) PEI = prior equity injections TL = share of net limited partnership losses previously recognised RCL = share of realised capital losses previously recognised (reduced by any amount of tax losses in relation to capital dispositions that are included in TL, such as a tax loss arising from the disposition of a business asset) PD = prior distributions 8.16 While similar to the partner’s basis calculation mechanism previously described, this alternative mechanism differs by including adjustments in respect of a partner’s share of realised capital gains derived, and realised capital losses incurred, from the partnership. The reasons for allowing such adjustments include the need to: • accurately reflect a partner’s net investment in the partnership that is at risk; and • decrease the disparity between the tax treatment applying to a partner investing through a partnership vehicle and an individual investing directly. 41 Limited partners’ basis may fall below zero if their distributions exceed their bases. 39 8.17 This is illustrated in simplified form in Example 2. 42 Example 2 Direct investor (and sole proprietor) P purchases an asset for $50,000 and uses the asset in a business for the purposes of producing taxable income. The $50,000 represents the extent of P’s capital investment in the business. P then sells the asset for $70,000, deriving a non-taxable capital gain of $20,000 (assume no tax depreciation recovery). P then uses the $70,000 for other business expenses which are deductible. Assuming that P derives no taxable income during the year, P would be entitled to a tax deduction for the full amount of $70,000 (which could be used to offset against other taxable income sources P has). However, if P was a limited partner in a partnership, under the original partner’s basis calculation mechanism outlined earlier, P would only be entitled to deduct $50,000 for income tax purposes – being the amount of P’s basis in that year. Under the alternative basis calculation mechanism, net limited partnership losses arising from the tax deductions of $70,000 would flow through to P (that is, not be limited to $50,000 in that year). Accordingly, this alternative basis calculation mechanism provides a tax result closer to that of a direct investor. 8.18 The alternative basis calculation mechanism may increase a partner’s basis and therefore may be more advantageous, from a tax perspective, for many taxpayers deriving realised non-taxable capital gains through partnership vehicles. For a limited partner, the increased basis may result in the flow through of net limited partnership losses, in a particular income year, when they would otherwise have been required to be carried forward under the proposed loss limitation rules. However, it would be necessary to include appropriate rules to combat manipulation and avoidance of the proposals through artificial and temporary increases in partners’ bases (for example, by way of transactions with related parties that are not on arm’s-length terms). 8.19 The basis of a limited partner would likely only fall below zero in circumstances where a capital loss is incurred. A negative basis would be allowed in these situations because a capital loss would not be able to flow through to a limited partner to be offset against other sources of income. 8.20 Under this alternative mechanism, if a limited partner incurs a loss and derives a realised capital gain in the same period, a question would arise as to which amount to take into account first. Example 3 illustrates the ordering problem. 42 The following examples assume the partners and the partnership have income years that are aligned for income tax purposes. 40 Example 3 Partner A becomes a limited partner in Partnership Y and enters the partnership at the beginning of year one with an original capital investment of $100. Year one is a bad year in terms of business performance and at the end of that year A’s share of the net limited partnership loss is $120. In addition, the partnership realised a capital gain during year one on the disposal of shares (that were held on capital account). A’s share of this realised capital gain is $50. Capital gain added to basis first Tax loss subtracted from basis first Particulars $ Particulars $ Original investment 100 Original investment 100 Capital gain 50 Tax loss (120) Adjusted basis 150 Adjusted basis 0 43 Tax loss (120) Capital gain 50 Adjusted basis 30 Adjusted basis 50 Losses allowed to flow through (120) Losses allowed to flow through (100) Losses limited and carried forward 0 Losses limited and carried forward (20) 8.21 As the example shows, the ordering in which losses and realised capital gain amounts are taken into account in determining a limited partner’s basis can influence the application of the loss limitation rules. 8.22 Under the proposed rules, the basis adjustments in relation to realised capital gains and realised capital losses would take place on the last day of the partnership’s income year – before the flow-through of any net limited partnership income or net limited partnership losses to the partners. Alternatively, capital gains and losses could be taken into account when the gains and losses are realised, while any income derived by the partnership would be taken into account on the last day of the partnership tax year. Either of these approaches may provide a tax advantage to partners if realised capital gains are derived by allowing each partner’s basis to be increased by the amount of any realised capital gains before the partnership attributes any net limited partnership income or net limited partnership loss to the partners. As seen in Example 3, such an increase to the basis of limited partners could increase the likelihood of net limited partnership losses flowing through to them. 8.23 Under this alternative mechanism, it should be acknowledged that a tax disadvantage could potentially arise in circumstances where a limited partner incurs a net limited partnership loss and a realised capital loss in the same period (if, under this alternative basis calculation mechanism, the realised capital loss amount is taken into account first). This possibility is illustrated in Example 4. 43 The basis would be $0 as under these proposals a limited partner would generally only have a negative basis if the negative amount arises from a capital loss. 41 Example 4 Partner A becomes a limited partner in Partnership Y and enters the partnership at the beginning of year one with an original capital investment of $100. Year one is a bad year in terms of business performance and at the end of that year A’s share of the net limited partnership loss is $40. In addition, the partnership incurred a realised capital loss during year one on the disposal of shares (that were held on capital account). A’s share of this realised capital loss is $100. Tax loss subtracted from basis first Capital loss subtracted from basis first Particulars $ Particulars $ Original investment 100 Original investment 100 Tax loss (40) Capital loss (100) Capital loss (100) Tax loss (40) Adjusted basis (40) Adjusted basis 0 Losses allowed to flow through 40 Losses allowed to flow through 0 Losses limited and carried forward 0 Losses limited and carried forward (40) 8.24 Example 4 highlights that the flow-through of net limited partnership losses to a limited partner may be restricted under the alternative basis calculation mechanism – resulting in the deferral of recognition of these losses. In addition, this alternative basis calculation mechanism would involve more complexity than the first basis calculation mechanism described earlier (as a result of additional adjustments and ordering rules being required). 8.25 Submissions on the appropriate basis calculation mechanism and workable design features are welcomed. Change of partner status 8.26 Under the proposed limited partnership regulatory reforms, general partners would be able to become limited partners and vice versa. When a general partner becomes a limited partner, he or she will need to begin basis tracking. When a general partner changes status to that of a limited partner, the loss limitation rules will apply to that partner from that time. The loss limitation rules would cease to apply when a limited partner changes status to a general partner. 8.27 Anti-avoidance rules would be required to prevent the abuse of status changes to circumvent the loss limitation rules (such as switching from a limited partner to a general partner – and back again – to get access to tax losses in an income year when the limited partner has insufficient basis). 42 Limited liability entities and the flow-through of tax losses 8.28 While the proposed loss limitation rules would restrict tax losses to a limited partner in a partnership (up to the amount of that limited partner’s investment), taxpayers could structure their affairs (through the use of other business and investment vehicles) in such a way that the proposed rules would not apply. For example, using structures involving loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) as general partners in partnerships, net tax losses in excess of the capital invested through the LAQC could conceivably still flow through to shareholder individuals – even though the LAQC vehicle serves to provide limited liability to these shareholders. This is illustrated in Example 5. Example 5 Partnership A has two general partners – both of which are LAQCs, each having one shareholder that is a natural person. This structure is represented below: LAQC (General partner) LAQC (General partner) PARTNERSHIP Individual shareholderIndividual shareholder 8.29 Under this structure, the proposed loss limitation rules would not apply because neither of the LAQCs will be limited partners. However, as each partner is a corporate entity – each partner will have limited liability. In addition, by virtue of its LAQC status for tax purposes, each LAQC general partner will be able to flow through net tax losses to its individual natural person shareholder. 8.30 The government recognises that these structures could be used to circumvent the policy intent behind the proposed loss limitation rules. This issue may be considered further in a future review of the LAQC rules. 43 Chapter 9 ENTRY AND EXIT OF PARTNERS AND CHANGES TO PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS Summary of proposals • An interest in a partnership would be treated as a distinct asset (similar to a share in a company). • The entry and exit of partners would not result in the dissolution of the partnership for income tax purposes. • Exiting partners may be taxed on taxable gains attributable to underlying partnership assets on disposition, subject to a minimum threshold. • The new partner and the partnership may jointly elect, in certain circumstances, to allocate the cost of the new partner’s partnership interest over the new partner’s share of partnership assets and liabilities. • Partnerships with two to five owners (none of whom have limited liability with respect to the business) may elect either to apply the proposed rules outlined in this chapter or to treat each owner as owning an undivided interest in all assets, liabilities and income of the business. Existing law and practice 9.1 Under general partnership law, both the entry and exit of partners results in a technical dissolution of the partnership and the creation of a new partnership. The effect of the change to individual profit/loss shares amongst existing partners is less clear, although it is generally understood that such an alteration in shares does not result in the dissolution of a partnership under general partnership law. 9.2 Technically, a “dissolution” can trigger the operation of tax provisions relating to the disposal of an interest in the property of the partnership for all partners in the partnership. The Valabh Committee noted that it is unclear whether the disposal is in the nature of a transfer of assets from the “old” to the “new” partnership, or a transfer of assets between the existing partners and the partner who is entering or exiting the partnership. Notably, the existing provisions relating to trading stock and depreciation are consistent with the latter approach. 9.3 In any event, a disposal of assets for tax purposes can result in tax liabilities being crystallised on the transfer of assets for all partners, even when only minor changes in partnership interests have occurred. This potentially results in significant compliance costs for the partners, who must make various complex tax adjustments. 44 9.4 In practice, the tax treatment adopted in relation to the entry and exit from partnerships may depart from the technical legal position. Some partnerships treat themselves for tax purposes in a manner similar to companies, in which changes in the interests of partners are treated similarly to changes in the interests of shareholders. As noted by the Valabh Committee, the uncertainty created by this disparity between the technical legal position and common practice is unsatisfactory. Moreover, the problems associated with such uncertainty will only become more pronounced as use of the limited partnership structure increases. Proposals The entity approach 9.5 In relation to the income tax treatment applying on the entry and exit of partners, a move towards an “entity” approach is proposed. Under this proposal, interests in a partnership would be treated as a distinct asset (similar to a share in a company) and, generally, partnership assets would be treated as being held by the partnership and not by the partners. For instance, the entry and exit of partners would not result in the dissolution of the partnership for income tax purposes, and would not generally trigger tax adjustments for the existing partners (for example, in relation to their partnership interest or their interest in the underlying partnership assets). 44 However, exiting partners may sometimes be required to recognise all or part of any gain on disposition for tax purposes. 9.6 The entity approach should clarify and reduce the complexity of the tax rules applying to partnerships and the compliance costs associated with the entry and exit of partners. 9.7 Smaller joint businesses may prefer to account for their tax position under a pure aggregate approach. Therefore partnerships with two to five owners (none of whom have limited liability with respect to the business) would be able to elect either to apply the proposed rules outlined in this chapter or to treat each owner as owning an undivided interest in all assets, liabilities and income of the business. 45 That election would simply be done by filing a tax return prepared under the set of rules chosen by the partnership. 44 However, partnership interests themselves could be held on revenue account (for example, if actively traded), thereby crystallising potential tax liabilities on disposal of these interests. 45 This would essentially mean following existing tax rules modified for the flow-through rules discussed in Chapter 5. 45 Tax implications when a partner exits or disposes of a part-interest General 9.8 Under the entity approach, the exit of a partner from a partnership would be viewed for tax purposes as a sale of the partnership interest itself, as opposed to a sale of the partner’s share of the underlying partnership assets. If a partnership interest is held on revenue account, the entire gain on the interest would be taxable to the exiting partner. 9.9 Disposal of a partnership interest that is a capital asset would result in tax consequences to the exiting partner if the partnership interest is sold for a gain and the partnership has significantly appreciated assets. The partner’s share of the assets may be deemed to be realised at market value for tax purposes, and the resulting assessable income (or allowable deduction) may flow through to the partner (the “revenue account adjustments” amount). 9.10 The revenue account adjustments proposal is the main exception to the entity approach. The reason for it and its proposed operation are discussed in detail later. 9.11 The tax treatment applying on the exit of a partner (or sale of a part-interest in a partnership) will be determined according to the steps illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1 Step 1. Calculate income and deductions up to time of exit Step 2. Calculate any tax adjustments required per existing legislation when the minimum threshold is exceeded Step 3. When the minimum threshold is exceeded, selling partner includes revenue account adjustment amount in individual income tax return Calculation of income and deductions up to the time of exit 9.12 Income and expenditure from the business activity of the partnership would generally be flowed through to the exiting partner before his or her exit, in accordance with the proportionate rule, as outlined in Chapter 5. However, when a partner leaves during an income year, a part-year apportionment of income and expenditure may be performed. Part-year allocation methods for exiting partners have been discussed in Chapter 5. If an exiting limited partner has a suspended loss carry-forward amount, it may be applied against net income which flows through from the partnership. 46 9.13 If the partnership is flowing through a net loss, limited partners must calculate their basis to determine if loss limitation applies. If a basis has increased because of guarantees of partnership debt, and the partner is released from the debt as a consequence of leaving the partnership, the basis must be adjusted down to reflect the fact that the limited partner is no longer liable for the partnership’s debt. Revenue account adjustments where minimum thresholds are exceeded 9.14 Under a purely aggregate approach, an exiting partner would be deemed to have sold his or her share of partnership assets and revenue gains and losses would be recognised. Technically, this is how the law now stands, although the degree to which this law is applied in practice is mixed. 9.15 Under the entity approach, the exit of a partner will be treated as the disposition of his or her interest in the partnership for tax purposes. However, if the interest in the partnership is held on capital account, and the partnership has appreciated assets, the following tax issues arise: • The exiting partner has crystallised his or her share of the appreciated assets through the sale of the partnership interest (which is a capital asset), thereby deferring recognition of the revenue gain until the partnership sells the assets. • The potential gain remains in the partnership to be realised, and the new partner, who has already paid for the appreciation on the assets through the price of the partnership interest, will be taxable on the allocated share of that appreciation (the “last man standing” issue 46 ). 9.16 Revenue account adjustments (as defined in paragraph 9.9) will be required to ensure that the component of the sale price that is referrable to appreciation in assets is taxed to the correct partner – the one who was the partner when those gains accrued to the asset. The minimum threshold 9.17 Implementing this approach may give rise to considerable administrative and compliance costs. For this reason, the rules should not apply when the amount of income tax at stake is insignificant relative to the potential compliance and administration costs of calculating the revenue account adjustment. 9.18 Designing a minimum threshold that makes this “trade-off” is very difficult because every case is unique and facts specific. Also, the more complex the minimum threshold rule, the more difficult it is for taxpayers to determine whether or not it applies, which defeats the rationale for having a minimum threshold rule in the first place. 46 This issue may be dealt with commercially by the new partner reducing the price for the partnership interest to take into account the inherent tax liability. The government welcomes submissions on whether this is, in fact, a problem or not. 47 9.19 At this stage, a monetary threshold is the simplest and least compliance- intensive option. Therefore revenue account adjustments would not be required by a partner on the disposal of his or her partnership interest (or part-interest) if the amount of the disposal proceeds for the interest does not exceed the total of the net tax book values 47 of the partner’s share of partnership property by more than $20,000. 9.20 Specific anti-avoidance rules would be required for partial sale of partnership interests through a series of connected contracts, or by testing the minimum threshold cumulatively with respect to interests in the same partnership sold by a partner. 9.21 The minimum threshold rule will be an important issue for consultation. Submissions on the workability of this rule and any suitable amendments or alternatives are welcomed. 9.22 The calculation would also be allowable by election by both the exiting partner and the partnership. If the gain is below the minimum threshold, the calculations would not be required. However, the exiting partner and the partnership could still elect to perform the calculation and take the consequences into account. An election may be advantageous when purchasing partners want to adjust their cost base in their share of the underlying assets (which is discussed later in this chapter), or when exiting partners would make a loss on the disposal of their share in partnership assets and would like this loss to flow through. Calculating the revenue account adjustment 9.23 The amount realised upon the sale of the partnership assets would be allocated to the exiting partner’s share of partnership assets and liabilities in proportion to their market values, (as if they were sold directly to the new partner. All revenue account assets and liabilities would be deemed disposed of, such as: • financial arrangements; • trading stock; and • depreciable assets. 9.24 The net realised gain or loss would be the revenue account adjustment amount. 47 Net tax book value of assets means the gross tax book value of assets less the gross tax book value of liabilities. 48 Treatment of losses carried forward on disposal of partnership interest 9.25 If an exiting limited partner has an amount of tax loss carry-forward at the time of disposal, it would first be applied to any business income flowing through from the partnership to the partner in that year. If a tax loss was flowed through to the partner in the year of exit, the tax loss carry-forward amount would be increased by the current year’s tax loss. If an amount of tax loss carry-forward remains on exit, any remaining tax loss carry-forward is applied to reduce any income arising from revenue account adjustments. Any residual loss carried forward will be extinguished on exit. Accounting for income tax on revenue account adjustments 9.26 Under Step 3 in figure 1, the selling partner would account for income tax on any amount of income arising under revenue account adjustments if the minimum threshold rule is exceeded or the calculation is performed electively. 9.27 If a deduction arises under revenue account adjustments on disposal of a partnership interest (or part-interest), the selling partner would be entitled to a deduction. This could occur, for example, when the amount of consideration attributable to depreciable property was less than the adjusted tax value of that property. 48 9.28 Examples 6 and 7 illustrate the tax implications of an exit from a partnership or disposal of a part-interest under the proposed rules. 48 However, a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss would not generally be allowed in the event of a loss incurred on disposal of a building. 49 Example 6: No revenue account adjustments Partnership X comprises two general partners, each having a 50 percent share. The partnership has only two partnership assets – a depreciable building (Partner A’s share of the original cost is $500,000) and revenue account property (Partner A’s share of the original cost is $5,000 and the market value at the time of disposal is $10,000). Partner A is allocated a depreciation deduction of $15,000 in year one, based on the 3% straight-line depreciation method. There is no income from business activities in year one. On the first day of year two, Partner A sells her entire partnership interest at her share of market value, which is $507,000. Partner A’s net tax book value calculation is represented below: Share of building – building at cost $500,000 Share of tax depreciation ($15,000) Share of adjusted tax book value of building $485,000 Share of revenue account property $5,000 Net tax book value $490,000 Partnership interest sale proceeds $507,000 Determining the tax treatment for Partner A on exit: Step 1: There is no income to apportion from the partnership’s business activities. Step 2: No revenue account adjustments are required as the minimum threshold is not exceeded. The sale proceeds exceed the total tax book value of Partner A’s share of assets by $17,000, which is less than $20,000. Step 3: As the minimum threshold is not exceeded, there is no revenue account adjustment amount. Accordingly, Partner A is not required to account for income tax in relation to the disposal of her interest in the underlying partnership assets. Example 7: Revenue account adjustments Partnership Z is a professional partnership that has two general partners, each having a 50 percent share. The partnership has only two partnership assets – a depreciable building (Partner A’s share of the original cost is $500,000) and revenue account property (Partner A’s share of the original cost is $50,000; the market value at time of disposal is $100,000). Partner A is allocated a depreciation deduction of $15,000 in the current year, based on the 3% straight- line depreciation method. There is no income from business activities in year one. On the first day of year two, Partner A sells his entire partnership interest at his share of market value, which is $700,000. Partner A’s net tax book value calculation is represented below: Share of building – building at cost $500,000 Share of tax depreciation ($15,000) Share of adjusted tax book value of building $485,000 Share of revenue account property $50,000 Net tax book value $535,000 Partnership interest sale proceeds $700,000 Step 1: There is no income to apportion from the partnership business activities. Step 2: Revenue account adjustments are required as the minimum threshold is exceeded. The sale proceeds exceed the total tax book value of Partner A’s share of assets by $165,000, which is more than $20,000. Revenue account adjustments are: – assessable tax depreciation recovery income: $15,000; and – assessable income on disposal of interest in revenue account property: $50,000. The total revenue account adjustment amount is therefore $65,000. Step 3: Because the minimum threshold has been exceeded, Partner A would include $65,000 as assessable income (in respect of the partnership interest) in the income year of disposition. 50 “In-substance” transfer of partnership assets 9.29 The Valabh Committee noted that, under the entity approach, significant in- substance asset transfers could result through the transfer of partnership interests (or part-interests). This could in turn result in the significant deferral of tax liabilities. The Valabh Committee suggested that this could be addressed by the introduction of special rules that trigger revenue account adjustments (such as deeming a disposal of assets to third parties for tax purposes), in the event of major changes in partnership interests in a single transaction (or a series of transactions having the same effect within a short period of time). While the proposals in relation to the disposal of partnership interests (or part-interests) serve to reduce this risk to the tax base, an additional, broader rule would provide greater protection. Accordingly, it is proposed that when interests in a partnership exceeding 50 percent in aggregate are sold (or altered as between partners) in any 12-month period, a deemed disposal of all partnership property would arise for tax purposes. 49 The rule attempts to balance the need to protect the tax base with the desire for flexibility with respect to changes in the composition of partnerships, and reduce compliance costs. 9.30 Submissions on these proposals are welcomed. Tax implications when a new partner enters an existing partnership 9.31 Consistent with the entity approach, when a new partner joins a partnership, he or she is considered to have acquired a partnership interest in exchange for property or services. The new partner could have either acquired the partnership interest from existing partners through the partial sale of their partnership interests, from an exiting partner, or by contributing new capital to the partnership. Cost base of partnership interest to new partner 9.32 For an incoming partner, the main tax implication of following an entity approach is the need to establish a cost base for the partnership interest. Under the proposed rules, the cost base of an incoming partner’s interest in a partnership would generally be equal to the market value of the consideration provided by that partner for that interest. Accordingly, the cost base for an incoming partner’s interest would be the sum of the market values of assets contributed to the partnership by that partner. This includes the value of any introduction of capital by way of services to the partnership. The partner’s cost base for the contribution of capital by way of services would be equal to the assessable income recognised by the partner for performing the services. 49 The United States has a similar rule. 51 9.33 The sum of these amounts represents the opening value of the incoming partner’s cost base. According to existing tax law, the contribution of business assets to a partnership by a new partner, constitutes a disposal by that partner of those assets. 50 As a consequence, various tax provisions of the Income Tax Act may be triggered in relation to that partner’s entry into the partnership. Existing partners 9.34 Overall, no tax consequences would arise for continuing partners in relation to the entry or exit of other partners, provided the interests of the continuing partners remain unchanged and their partnership cost base remains the same. Depending on what the new partner contributes to the partnership, an existing partner’s share of the underlying partnership assets may change. While under current law this may have been a disposition of assets by the existing partner, under the proposed rules there would be no tax consequences to the remaining partners under the entity approach. If, however, the existing partners are selling part of their partnership interest their cost base would reduce and the revenue account adjustment rules that are relevant to exiting partners would apply accordingly. Cost base of assets to incoming partner 9.35 Consistent with the entity approach, the purchase of partnership interests from existing partners would generally not affect the adjusted tax book value of assets held by the partnership. However, there would sometimes be a mismatch between the cost base of the partnership interest held by the new partner, and the new partner’s share of the net cost base (adjusted tax book value) of the partnership’s assets and liabilities. This is known as a difference between the “outside” cost base (the basis of the partnership interest itself) and the “inside” cost base (the partner’s share of the net adjusted tax book value of the assets and liabilities of the partnership). 9.36 For example, assume three people form a partnership by contributing $100 each and the partnership buys a $300 revenue account asset. A year later, the value of the asset has appreciated to $450. The costs and market values of the partnership’s and the partners’ interests are illustrated below: PartnershipPartner 1Partner 2 Partner 3 Contributed Capital $300$100$100 $100 Asset: Cost $300$100$100 $100 Asset: MV $450$150$150 $150 50 Technically, under current law it may be that a new partner is deemed to sell only a portion of assets contributed to a partnership (in relation to the portion attributable to the other partners’ interests). The government proposes to take a pure entity approach and deem each asset to be sold in its entirety to the partnership as an entity. 52 9.37 At this time, Partner 3 sells her partnership interest to a new partner, Partner 4. Partner 4 pays the market value of the partnership interest, which is $150. 51 The respective interests of the partnership and the partners can be illustrated as follows: PartnershipPartner 1Partner 2 Partner 4 Contributed Capital $300$100$100 $100 Asset: Cost $300$100$100 $100 Asset: MV $450$150$150 $150 9.38 The consequences are that although Partner 4 has paid $150 for his share of the revenue account asset, his share of the asset on the books of the partnership would be $100. If the partnership sold the asset, it would recognise a gain of $150. Partner 4’s share of the $50 of gain would be allocated to him even though, in substance, he has not realised any gain. This is the “last man standing” issue. 9.39 Additionally, if Partner 3 had recognised revenue account adjustments as described earlier, she would have recognised $50 of income from a deemed disposal of the asset. When the asset is sold by the partnership, the same gain would be recognised a second time and be allocated to Partner 4. Cost base allocation election 9.40 To resolve this problem, the new partner and the partnership will be able to elect jointly, in certain circumstances, to allocate the cost of the new partner’s partnership interest over the new partner’s share of partnership assets and liabilities. The election would be allowed only if: • the exiting partner had recognised revenue account adjustments (either mandatory or by election); or • all of the gain on disposal of the partnership interest had been recognised because the interest was held on revenue account. 9.41 In addition, if the exiting partner had elected to recognise revenue account adjustments, and the adjustments resulted in a recognised loss to the exiting partner, the cost base allocation by the new partner would be mandatory. Effectively, three parties would have to agree to an election to recognise a revenue account adjustment loss in conjunction with the new partner allocating cost base – the exiting partner, the new partner, and the partnership. 51 Disregarding potential tax liability adjustments for purposes of the illustration. 53 9.42 If the exiting partner had performed a revenue account adjustment, the allocations used in allocating cost base for the new partner would have to be the same. The effect would be to change the partnership balance sheet. The new partner would have a different underlying balance sheet from the other partners. 9.43 This would complicate calculating partnership income and losses, which is a reason the partnership must be a party to the election. The new partner would have a different depreciation calculation from the other partners, as well as different accrual income and expenditure calculations and different calculations on the disposal of trading stock and other revenue account assets. 9.44 For example, in the preceding illustration, the interests of the partnership and the partners would resemble the following: PartnershipPartner 1Partner 2 Partner 4 Contributed Capital $350$100$100 $150 Asset: Cost $350$100$100 $150 Asset: MV $450$150$150 $150 9.45 When the asset is sold, the partnership would recognise a total gain of $100 ($450 sales price less $350 cost). However, $50 of the gain would be allocated to both Partner 1 and Partner 2. No gain would be allocated to Partner 4. 9.46 The proposal is complex, but it attempts to balance the simplicity of the entity approach with the “last man standing” issue and resulting potential over-taxation if an exiting partner has recognised revenue account adjustments. 9.47 Submissions on all proposals in this chapter are welcomed. 54 Chapter 10 DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISSOLUTION OF A PARTNERSHIP Summary of proposals This chapter provides proposals in relation to the applicable tax treatment on distributions from a partnership and partnership dissolutions. It is proposed that: • Generally, a distribution to a partner would not be deductible to that partner nor assessable income to that partner (as is currently the case). • Dissolutions of partnerships would be subject to the proposals discussed in Chapter 9 for dispositions of partnership interests. Distributions 10.1 A distribution from a partnership to a partner (in contrast to an allocation of income) is typically regarded as a “withdrawal” of capital or income 52 by that partner. Generally, withdrawals of partnership capital or previously taxed retained income amounts are not deductible to the partners or subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient partners. This is the treatment under existing rules and it will not change. 10.2 Under the system of basis tracking discussed in Chapter 8, a distribution to a limited partner would reduce that partner’s basis by the amount of the distribution. For example, a withdrawal (distribution) of $10,000 cash from a limited partner’s partnership capital account would reduce that partner’s basis by the corresponding amount of $10,000. The distribution to a limited partner of an asset that constitutes partnership property would also reduce that recipient partner’s basis. The amount of the basis reduction for tax purposes would be equivalent to the market value of the asset distributed on the day of distribution. 53 10.3 If a limited partner’s basis has been calculated by taking into account limited partner guarantees of partnership debt, and that guarantee is later revoked or the maximum liability is reduced, the reduction of guarantee would be treated as equivalent to a distribution of that amount to the partner. This would, in turn, be reflected as a reduction in that limited partner’s basis. 52 Allocations of income to a partner that are retained in the partnership by that partner. 53 The distribution of an asset in this manner may also trigger tax adjustments on disposal of the asset. 55 Dissolution of partnership 10.4 Under general partnership law, the dissolution of a partnership may occur in a number of ways. These may include bankruptcy or the death of a partner (in the absence of provisions to the contrary in any partnership agreement). Under the proposed entity approach to partnership taxation previously discussed, the death or bankruptcy of a partner would not generally result in the dissolution of a partnership for the purposes of income tax. 54 However, the dissolution of a partnership could occur for income tax purposes (and in general law) in a number of ways. For example, dissolution could occur through an order of a court, or by unanimous agreement between the relevant partners. 10.5 In relation to the dissolution of a partnership, an entity approach is proposed. When the dissolution of a partnership occurs for income tax purposes, each partner’s partnership interest will be deemed to have been disposed of for an amount equal to the market value of the partner’s share in the residual net assets of the partnership at the date of dissolution. As the dissolution of a partnership is conceptually similar to a disposal of a partnership interest, it is proposed that the proposals in relation to disposals of partnership interests would apply. 10.6 If a partnership becomes insolvent and dissolves without making any distribution, each partner is deemed to have disposed of his or her interest in exchange for nil consideration. 10.7 Submissions on these proposals are welcomed. 54 This would generally be the case unless the partners had provided for dissolution in these circumstances in any partnership agreement. 56 Chapter 11 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Summary of proposals • The new tax rules would generally apply to all partnership interests (other than special partnership interests, unless a special partnership elects for the new rules to apply). • Two options would be available for the calculation of the opening basis amount for existing partnership interests – the market value option and the historical method option. • A simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership would not generally result in the triggering of income tax provisions to the partners. 11.1 The proposed new tax rules for partnerships raise a number of issues in relation to transitioning from the current partnerships tax rules. First, in applying the new rules to existing partners, there is a need to establish an opening basis value for those existing partners. Second, under the proposed new rules, special partnerships will continue to exist until their expiry. As a consequence, the tax treatment applying to continuing special partnerships and the newly created limited partnerships will need to be made clear. Third, the transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership can result in the triggering of various tax adjustments that will need to be dealt with. New tax rules apply to all partnership interests from the effective date 11.2 The new tax rules will apply to all partnership interests from the effective date (with the exception of jointly owned businesses with five or fewer owners that elect to remain under the existing tax rules). However, special partnerships could elect to apply either set of tax rules until their cessation. 55 11.3 Partnership interests in existence at the time the new tax rules come into effect will need to calculate an opening basis amount. Opening basis amount 11.4 Partnerships formed after the enactment of the proposals will calculate each limited partner’s basis from the beginning of the partnership, based largely on subsequent events for which information will be readily available. 55 Generally, a special partnership would cease at the earlier of the statutory seven-year period, or such shorter period for which the special partnership was formed. 57 11.5 The identification of an opening basis amount for partnerships that are in existence at the time of the enactment of the new tax rules may be more problematic. Two options are proposed for calculating the opening basis in these circumstances: the “market value option” and the “historical method option”. Market value option 11.6 Under this option, individual partners would calculate their opening basis amount based on their share in the market value of the net partnership assets at the effective date of the new tax rules. If a partner’s share of the value of net assets was a negative amount, the opening basis would be deemed to be zero so that excess tax losses taken before the effective date will not count against the partnership basis. This option would be the least compliance- intensive of the two options for the partners, but may incur valuation costs if a professional valuer is used. Historical method option 11.7 This method involves the calculation of a partner’s basis as if the partnership and the partners had always been subject to the new basis rules. If this calculation resulted in an opening basis of less than zero, the opening basis would be deemed to be zero. This method would rely heavily on the availability of full information to enable basis calculations to be performed and tracked from the time the partnership first began. It is anticipated that this method would be more compliance-intensive – particularly for larger partnerships that have been in existence for a number of years. 11.8 Providing the option for taxpayers to choose between the two methods provides a reasonable balance between policy accuracy and compliance costs for taxpayers. Special partnerships continuing after enactment of the new rules 11.9 Under the proposed rules, special partnerships will continue until their expiry. Accordingly, some special partnerships may continue to exist after the enactment of the proposed new tax rules. 11.10 One option would be for the proposed rules contained in this discussion document to apply to special partnerships that continue to exist. However, this may involve large compliance costs for special partnerships that do not plan to register as limited partnerships in the future. Therefore one option would be to “grand-parent” existing special partnership interests. Under this proposal, only the new income and deduction flow-through tax rules (outlined in Chapters 5, 6 and 7) would apply to existing special partnership interests. The remaining tax proposals in this discussion document would not apply. 58 11.11 Another option is to allow special partnerships to elect which set of tax rules will apply to them until their cessation (with the proviso that the flow- through proposals would be mandatory). This option is preferable as it allows greater flexibility for special partnerships. 11.12 Under the proposed regulatory reforms, a special partnership would have the opportunity to register as a limited partnership. If a special partnership does not register as a limited partnership upon its expiry, it will cease to exist. In the event a cessation occurs, this will constitute a dissolution at law and for tax purposes. This will then trigger the tax rules applying on dissolution as outlined in Chapter 9. Transitioning from special partnership to limited partnership 11.13 When a special partnership transitions to a limited partnership, the special partnership ceases to exist and a new limited partnership person with separate legal personality is created. This event can involve the transfer of assets, rights, and obligations from the special partnership to the newly created limited partnership person. This can, in turn, result in the triggering of various income tax adjustments, such as depreciation recoveries and base price adjustments under the financial arrangements rules and, potentially, the breaching of the shareholder continuity rules. The transitional event may also have other tax implications, such as the triggering of gift duty liabilities and goods and services tax liabilities in respect of the transfer of assets. 11.14 To ensure a smooth transition to the new tax rules, it is proposed to include provisions that would ensure that no undue tax liabilities arose on the transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership. These provisions would follow a “same person” concept, in that a simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership, all other things held equal, would not trigger tax adjustments (and resulting tax liabilities) when these adjustments and liabilities would not have arisen in absence of the transition. For the purposes of the transition of a special partnership to a limited partnership, this outcome would be achieved by deeming the limited partnership always to have been the holder of the relevant assets, rights and obligations for income tax purposes. 11.15 If the special partnership has not been subject to the new rules, the limited partnership would be subject to them. The partners will be considered to contribute their share of the partnership net assets to the limited partnership to determine their opening basis. However, there will be no other tax consequences. 11.16 This treatment would provide certainty and significantly reduce any potential compliance and administrative costs associated with these reforms. 59 Submissions 11.17 Submissions are welcomed on the suitability of these proposals and on any other specific transitional issues that submitters may consider are important for these reforms. Specific examples illustrating any such additional measures and the benefits to be obtained from them would be particularly helpful.

For the system to work, it is vital that those who do not comply with the rules are seen to face the consequences. It is also important that the penalties that result when someone has not complied with the rules are in keeping with the severity of the offence. 1.2 Many taxpayers employ a tax agent to help them in meeting their tax obligations. The services that tax agents provide to their clients have a significant influence on raising voluntary compliance levels and reducing compliance and administrative costs. 1.3 This discussion document examines the current compliance and penalty rules, and identifies several areas where the rules could be clearer, more consistent and better targeted to encourage voluntary compliance. It discusses options for the relaxation of penalties when taxpayers have genuinely and consistently tried to do the right thing. The discussion document also proposes that, in future, in order to recognise a person as a “tax agent” the Commissioner must be satisfied that treating a person as a tax agent is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue’s compliance model 1.4 Figure 1 illustrates the “compliance model” that Inland Revenue uses to determine how to respond to various levels of compliance and non- compliance. 1.5 Inland Revenue applies this model to promote a tailored response to the way taxpayers behave. It takes into account the external factors that influence taxpayers’ attitudes and behaviours, and how these differences direct Inland Revenue’s approach to improving compliance. 1.6 A key concept of the model is that most taxpayers are either willing to “do the right thing”, or try to comply, but do not always succeed. For these taxpayers the appropriate response is to make compliance easier, or to help them comply. At the other end of the compliance spectrum, when people deliberately do not comply, suitable sanctions are needed. Enforcing the law helps maintain overall taxpayer confidence in the tax system and encourages ongoing compliance. When enforcing the law, the approach taken should encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily in the future. 2 Figure 1: The compliance model Source: Our way forward 2006-2011 1.7 When taxpayers do not file their returns on time, late filing penalties of $50 to $500 may apply. When a payment is not made on time, late payment penalties apply. The initial late payment penalty is imposed in two stages – 1 percent the day after the due date and 4 percent six days later. If payment is not made, incremental late payment penalties of 1 percent are imposed each month that the amount remains unpaid. If taxpayers do not accurately calculate their tax liabilities, shortfall penalties of 20 to 150 percent may be imposed. Shortfall penalties are imposed when a required standard of behaviour has been breached. The basic standard required is that taxpayers must take reasonable care. Use-of-money interest, while not a penalty, also applies to under-payments and over-payments. Purpose of this discussion document 1.8 This discussion document reviews some aspects of tax penalties and associated legislation, based on the compliance model and the following principles: • the scope of certain penalties is made clearer, especially those for not taking reasonable care and taking an unacceptable tax position; • the role of tax agents is clarified in relation to compliance and the tax system generally, both now and in the future; • there is better recognition of compliant behaviour, including voluntary disclosures; and • the importance of on-time filing and payment in the compliance model. 3 Summary of proposals Tax agents Currently, anyone can be treated as a tax agent if he or she meets the requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994 of being “a person who prepares the returns of income required to be furnished for 10 or more taxpayers and who – (a) Carries on a professional public practice; or (b) Carries on any business in which returns of income are prepared; or (c) Is the Maori Trustee”. The proposals add a requirement that the Commissioner must be satisfied that treating a person as a tax agent is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system. Tax agents and the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care The legislation will prescribe the circumstances when a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care may be imposed even when taxpayers have used a tax agent. The circumstances will include: • failing to provide adequate information to the agent; • failing to provide adequate instructions to the agent; • unreasonably relying on an agent or advisor; and • having had a tax shortfall previously which concerned the same error or action. Refining the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty GST and withholding-type taxes will be removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will apply only to tax positions taken in respect of income tax. The thresholds for assessment of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will be increased. They will apply when the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both $50,000 and 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. Improving recognition of good compliance Inland Revenue will notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. However, if payment is not made by a certain date the penalty will be imposed. The late payment penalty legislation relating to the employer monthly schedule will be clarified. Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position will not be imposed when a tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed (before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation). This proposal will apply to voluntary disclosures made within two years of the tax position being taken. 4 A new graduated penalty to replace the current shortfall penalty in relation to PAYE will apply when an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the PAYE. Inland Revenue will contact the employer and, if payment or an arrangement for payment is not made, a 20 percent penalty will be imposed, reducing to 10 percent if the employer pays the outstanding PAYE within one month of the penalty being imposed. The penalty will not exceed in total any penalty that could be charged under the current rules. Improving GST filing The late filing penalty will be extended to GST returns that are not filed by the due date. This will: • provide an incentive for returns to be filed by the due date; • reduce the number of default assessments issued to taxpayers and hence reduce potential tax liabilities, which may in some cases bear little resemblance to the amount that should be payable; and • create more fiscal certainty for the government as a result of fewer default assessments. Other changes to the penalties rules The abusive tax position shortfall penalty threshold will be repealed. For temporary shortfalls to which a 75 percent reduction in the shortfall penalty applies, the legislation will clarify that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if it appears from the taxpayer’s actions or through operation of law that the shortfall will be remedied. For a shortfall to be temporary, it must be permanently reversed or corrected within two years of the tax position being taken. The Commissioner will be able to treat return periods that overlap as the same return period for associated taxpayers, allowing a tax refund to be used to reduce an associated person’s tax shortfall. The proposals outlined in the discussion document Options for dealing with industry- wide tax evasion will be dealt with at the same time as the issues in this discussion document. Application dates Resulting changes will apply from the date of their enactment, with the exception of those that will require Inland Revenue to alter its electronic systems, in particular, PAYE penalty and the GST late filing penalty. 5 How to make a submission 1.9 Submissions on the proposed changes close on 30 November 2006. 1.10 Submissions should be sent to: Compliance and penalties project C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand 1.11 Alternatively, submissions can be made in electronic form, in which case “Compliance and penalties project” should appear in the subject line.

The proposals add a requirement that the Commissioner must be satisfied that treating a person as a tax agent is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system. 2.1 Many taxpayers employ a tax agent to help them in meeting their tax obligations. The services that tax agents provide to their clients have a significant influence on raising voluntary compliance levels and reducing compliance and administrative costs. Currently, more than 4,500 tax agents are registered with Inland Revenue, representing more than 1.7 million taxpayers. 2.2 The current legislation recognises the importance of this role by providing tax agents with an extended period of time in which to file their clients’ income tax returns and extending by two months the terminal tax date for taxpayers linked to a tax agent. In addition, Inland Revenue provides a range of services specifically for tax agents and their clients. 2.3 For example, all tax agents have an agent account manager who is responsible for monitoring their performance and who serves as the agent’s primary contact with Inland Revenue. A dedicated telephone service also provides tax agents with a convenient channel for communicating with Inland Revenue, and “The Look at Account Information” service provides tax agents with secure online access to client information such as account balances, transaction details, earnings information and some tax return details. 2.4 As part of a strategy to optimise the relationship between Inland Revenue and tax agents, Inland Revenue is considering a range of initiatives to ensure that its interactions with tax agents are efficient, tailored for individual tax agents and that they positively influence compliance behaviour. 7 2.5 In particular, Inland Revenue is exploring a number of initiatives aimed at simplifying existing services and processes for tax agents through greater use of technology and a greater range of self-service options. The initiatives being considered focus on providing tax agents with greater direct access to client and technical information held by Inland Revenue and on enabling agents to update client records themselves. For example, the options may include changing a client’s address details or transferring credits. While access to the administrative services provided by Inland Revenue is currently available to all tax agents, Inland Revenue may, in the future, look to target particular services towards the needs of particular groups of tax agents. The issue 2.6 In this context, the government believes that the rules relating to tax agents need updating. 2.7 A tax agent is defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 as “a person who prepares the returns of income required to be furnished for 10 or more taxpayers and who – (a) Carries on a professional public practice; or (b) Carries on any business in which returns of income are prepared; or (c) Is the Maori Trustee”. 1 2.8 To be recognised as an agent, a person must apply to Inland Revenue by returning an “Application to be a tax agent or agency”. Provided that an agent meets the very limited criteria required, Inland Revenue cannot refuse to register the entity as a tax agent even if, for example, that person has a long record of non-compliance in their own tax affairs or those of their clients, or they have been convicted of offences involving serious dishonesty. 2.9 As Inland Revenue continues to provide tax agents with a greater range of self-service options and greater online access, the ability to place a high level of trust in tax agents assumes much greater importance. 2.10 The current ability of an individual or an entity to engage with Inland Revenue and taxpayers as a tax agent with very limited restrictions is inconsistent with similar positions of trust which have strict criteria on who can be considered eligible. In tax legislation, for example, the Income Tax Act contains comprehensive rules on who may be accredited as a PAYE intermediary. 1 Section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 8 Proposed reform Integrity of the tax system 2.11 To deal with these concerns, the government is proposing to add a requirement to the definition of “tax agent” that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must be satisfied that listing a person as a tax agent is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system. 2.12 This will provide the Commissioner with the discretion to withhold recognition, or remove a person as a tax agent when the Commissioner thinks the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. 2.13 Operational guidance will be provided on the circumstances in which the Commissioner’s discretion might be exercised. Potential factors that might be taken into account, while not necessarily definitive, might include: • whether a person has been found guilty of an offence or breach by the disciplinary body of a professional organisation of which they are a member – for example, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants; • whether the person is an undischarged bankrupt or an insolvent entity; • whether the person is an individual or a body corporate that has been convicted of a crime involving dishonesty (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Crimes Act 1961) and has been sentenced for that crime within the last seven years; • whether an individual is prohibited from being a director or promoter of, or taken part in the management of a company under section 382, 383 or 385 of the Companies Act 1993; • whether a person has been convicted of an offence under the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • the tax agent’s compliance history – including both their own tax affairs and their level of compliance as an agent. 2.14 It is envisaged that the discretion not to grant, or remove tax agent status would be exercised only in a very small number of cases. In the majority of cases it is not anticipated that this discretion will have any significant impact on the level of information required of applicants seeking tax agent status, or on any compliance costs incurred in applying. 2.15 The proposed solution seeks to strike a balance between the reality that the vast majority of tax agents provide a very valuable service to taxpayers and that their continued ability to do so should not be unduly restricted. 9 Entities other than natural persons 2.16 Currently, tax agent status is not limited to natural persons, and includes individuals, partnerships, companies and other entities. Entities comprise more than half of all agents registered with Inland Revenue. 2.17 However, the proposed test of protecting the integrity of the tax system relates to the behaviour of individuals rather than entities. Under the proposed rules, individuals who were unable to gain tax agent status in their own right could operate as a tax agent under the guise of a company or other entity. 2.18 While the government does not wish to disrupt current practice more than is necessary, enabling only individuals and not entities to list as tax agents could significantly increase the number of tax agents dealing with Inland Revenue. This could, in turn, result in higher administrative and compliance costs. 2.19 Therefore, the government proposes that entities will continue to be recognised as tax agents along with individuals, provided that the entity supplies Inland Revenue with the names of: • each individual acting as a director, secretary or statutory officer if the entity is a body corporate; • all shareholders of closely held companies; • all partners if the entity is a partnership; and • all individuals who are members of the entity, if the entity is an unincorporated body. 2.20 The Commissioner must be satisfied that the involvement of these individuals is consistent with the protection of the integrity of the tax system for the entity to have agency status. 2.21 This information will allow the Commissioner to decide not to grant agency status to a particular entity, or to remove agency status from an entity if, in protecting the integrity of the tax system, the decision was necessary as a result of the involvement of particular individuals in controlling the business or managing clients connected with it. 2.22 If the entity is registered as an agent, the risk is that the whole entity could lose its agency status, although there may be just one individual who is of concern to Inland Revenue. If the entity did not want this risk, the individuals involved in the entity could apply to be listed as agents in their own right. 10 Consequences of not meeting the definition of being a tax agent 2.23 Under the proposed rule, the Commissioner will be required to give a tax agent notice of the intention to revoke the agent’s listing and give reasons for the intended revocation. If the agent does not resolve the matters listed in the notice of intended revocation to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, their agency status will be revoked and the agent and the taxpayers linked to that agent advised accordingly. 2.24 Providing notice is of particular importance to entities, as the removal of agency status will affect the other members of the entity and potentially a much larger group of client taxpayers. 2.25 If, because of a revocation of tax agency status, a taxpayer fails to meet a filing deadline the legislation will provide that penalties are not imposed. Transitional issues 2.26 Individual agents currently registered as tax agents will not be required to reapply for their agency status. 2.27 For entities currently listed as an agent, entities will continue to be listed as tax agents provided they supply Inland Revenue with the names of: • all individuals who are members of the entity, if the entity is an unincorporated body; • each person acting as a director, secretary or statutory officer if the entity is a body corporate; and • all partners if the entity is a partnership. 2.28 This information will be required within 12 months of the enactment of the new rules. The information is necessary to enable the Commissioner to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that, given the involvement of these individuals, it is consistent with protection of the integrity of the tax system for the entity to have agency status. Secrecy 2.29 Professional bodies such as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and others with a significant function of providing tax advice have their own membership criteria based on standards of integrity. The proposals in this chapter will be enhanced if Inland Revenue is able to provide information to these bodies about the agency listings it has revoked. An exception to Inland Revenue’s secrecy obligations, along the lines of the non-disclosure right exception, is proposed as part of the legislation. 11 Other options 2.30 The government has considered whether more regulated tax agent rules such as Australia’s would be beneficial to New Zealand. On balance, it appears that any benefit from such rules would be outweighed by higher compliance and administrative costs. 2.31 Providing the Commissioner with the discretion recommended in this chapter is considered sufficient to ensure that agents who operate outside the principles of the tax system are identified and have their agency status removed. Inland Revenue will, however, monitor this situation and may in the future propose more robust measures for screening tax agents should these be seen to be required . 12 Chapter 3 TAX AGENTS AND THE SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE Summary of proposals The legislation will prescribe the circumstances in which a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be imposed, even when taxpayers have used a tax agent. The circumstances will include: • failing to provide adequate information to the agent; • failing to provide adequate instructions to the agent; • unreasonably relying on an agent or advisor; and • having had a previous tax shortfall penalty imposed for the same error or action. Role of tax agents 3.1 Tax agents 2 are responsible for a large percentage of the tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. The services they provide have a significant influence on voluntary compliance levels and minimise compliance and administrative costs. 3.2 It is important that the penalty rules adequately recognise the important role of agents and, consistent with the compliance model in figure 1, that the rules continue to encourage agents to help their clients to be compliant. Background 3.3 Taxpayers who have relied on the advice of tax agents will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. This principle is not set out in the legislation but has developed over time through practice. 3.4 The legislation does not define what “reasonable care” is. When the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care was introduced, it was considered flexible enough to reflect a wide range of circumstances as well as changes to the tax system over time. The government of the day was concerned that to define it further would have substantially duplicated the common law understanding of the term “reasonable care” and could have unduly constrained the flexibility of the standard. 2 In this chapter reference to tax agent also includes reference to tax advisors. 13 3.5 Currently, taxpayers who use agents may still be exposed to a penalty for not taking reasonable care if they: • fail to provide adequate information when seeking advice; • fail to provide reasonable instructions to a tax agent; or • unreasonably rely on a tax advisor or on advice (when they have reason to believe that the advice is not correct). 3.6 Outside these exceptions, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is generally not incurred if the taxpayer has used a tax agent. This does not apply to the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty, which occurs if the tax position taken does not meet the standard of “being about as likely as not to be correct” and the tax shortfall is greater than the prescribed thresholds. In this case, the penalty may be assessed, irrespective of whether an agent is used. 3.7 This highlights the need to clarify the scope of the penalty for not taking reasonable care. The government has therefore recommended that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty be refocused so that it applies to income tax only, and that the threshold for its application be increased. (See chapter 4.) 3.8 The standard of “reasonable care” is not excessive and does not require perfection. However, many taxpayers use agents because agents have more knowledge about the requirements of the tax system. 3.9 The government wants to ensure that there is a better balance between recognising that tax agents are not infallible, while providing a greater incentive for them to, as far as possible, “get it right”. Proposed reform 3.10 The legislation will prescribe the circumstances when a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care can be applied and taxpayers have used tax agents. The circumstances will include those currently in practice, including: • failing to provide adequate information to the agent; • failing to provide adequate instructions to the agent; and • unreasonably relying on an agent or advisor or on their actions. 3.11 These are all circumstances in which the taxpayer’s actions might be regarded as having contributed to the lack of care. 3.12 The proposed reform will extend these circumstances to include whether the taxpayer has had a tax shortfall previously and whether the same error or action has been repeated. 14 3.13 In this situation the taxpayer should have been aware that there was a known risk associated with a particular action. Depending on the facts, a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would check that the correct tax position had been taken in the second instance. For example, an agent completes a taxpayer’s income tax return. There are losses to carry forward (which are correctly calculated) but, owing to a computer systems error, the amount of the loss carried forward is substantially overstated. The first time this tax shortfall occurs no shortfall penalty is imposed. However, in a subsequent period, for the same taxpayer, the amount of the losses carried forward is again incorrect as a result of the same error. In this second instance a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care should be considered; it would be reasonable to expect that the taxpayer would have checked the amount of the loss carried forward. 3.14 By not checking that the tax position is correct it could be argued that neither the taxpayer nor the agent have taken reasonable care. 3.15 The standard reductions for voluntary disclosure, temporary shortfalls and previous good behaviour would still apply in the example. 3.16 It can be argued that the proposal will treat taxpayers who use a tax agent more leniently, as the taxpayer may not be penalised the first time a tax shortfall occurs. A taxpayer who does not use an agent may, in the same circumstances, be penalised. However, by choosing to use an agent, the first taxpayer has demonstrated a willingness to take reasonable care. 3.17 The proposal will also apply to taxpayers who change agents. If the taxpayer is aware of what is required because the shortfall has occurred before, it is reasonable to expect the taxpayer to check that the correct tax position has been taken. 15 Chapter 4 REFINING THE SCOPE OF THE UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY Summary of proposals • GST and withholding-type taxes will be removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will apply only to tax positions that relate to income tax. • The thresholds for the assessment of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will be increased. They will apply when the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both $50,000 and 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. 4.1 An unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty of 20 percent of the shortfall is assessed if, viewed objectively, a taxpayer’s tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty is applied only in cases where the tax shortfall is significant – a shortfall of more than $20,000 and the lesser of either 1 percent of the total tax figure or $250,000. The penalty does not apply to tax shortfalls that arise from mistakes in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. 4.2 The shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position is intended as a signal to taxpayers who take a particular tax position in which there is a significant amount of tax at stake. It does not require that the treatment a taxpayer gives to a particular matter must be the better view, or must be more likely than not the correct treatment. Rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration, but not necessarily agree with. The taxpayer’s argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court. 4.3 An aim of the shortfall penalty is to encourage taxpayers to get their tax position correct in terms of the law. This can be compared with the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care, which applies to a more general set of actions. When looking at whether a tax position is acceptable or not, the subjective elements, such as the effort the taxpayer went to, are not considered. In relation to the penalty for not taking reasonable care, taxpayers can argue that reasonable care has been taken by simply using a tax agent. This is not the case with the penalty for an unacceptable tax position – the penalty applies if the tax position taken fails to meet the required standard, irrespective of whether the taxpayer has engaged an agent. 16 The issue 4.4 Taxpayers who make and acknowledge errors in taking a particular tax position cannot be regarded as having met the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. If the standard is not met, unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties may apply. The government’s view is that the penalty should be better targeted. 4.5 Current legislation has had an adverse effect on taxpayer behaviour by making them less inclined to disclose errors to Inland Revenue. To counter this problem, a recent amendment, new section 141KB, provides the Commissioner with the discretion either to cancel or not impose the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. The discretion applies in cases when the Commissioner is satisfied that: • the tax position taken is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight; • the shortfall arising from the tax position is or would be subject to a reduced penalty because the shortfall was voluntarily disclosed before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation, or is a temporary shortfall; and • it is appropriate that the taxpayer not be liable to pay an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the tax position taken. 4.6 The new section applies retrospectively from 1 April 2003 and has already been applied in numerous cases. The discretion was, however, signalled as a short-term solution only. The Commissioner’s discretion is not considered to be a long-term solution because: • it increases administrative and compliance costs; • it does not fit well with the self-assessment environment; and • using the words “clear mistake and simple oversight” in the penalties context is inherently uncertain and may create a revenue risk if the term becomes more broadly interpreted over time. 4.7 For these reasons, it is proposed to repeal the discretion and instead refocus and narrow the provisions relating to the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. Better focusing the penalty 4.8 There are three options for better focusing the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty: • returning to the pre-2003 “unacceptable interpretation” wording; 17 • limiting the application of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty to income tax; or • increasing the thresholds at which the shortfall penalty is assessed. 4.9 The three options are discussed below. Return to the “unacceptable interpretation” wording 4.10 In 2003 a change was made from the original and narrowly defined term “unacceptable interpretation” to the currently used “unacceptable tax position”. The change was necessary because under the earlier term taxpayers could, and did argue, that because they had not made an interpretation the shortfall penalty could not be assessed. 4.11 For example – two taxpayers operate in a similar industry; one taxpayer becomes aware that the other taxpayer is claiming deductions for expenses that the first is not currently claiming, talks to their agent and starts claiming deductions for similar expenses. It is strongly arguable, if not clear in law, that these expenses are not deductible under income tax law. No interpretation was made, so an unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty cannot be imposed and, as the taxpayer has used the services of an agent, the penalty for not taking reasonable care does not apply. 4.12 If the “unacceptable interpretation” position were to be reinstated, there would still be cases where no shortfall penalty could be assessed, although a penalty would be appropriate in the circumstances. Limit the application of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty to income tax 4.13 Many of the examples where the assessment of an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty appears overly harsh involve GST. Often GST returns are completed by taxpayers themselves rather than by an agent. This is because GST returns are completed more frequently than income tax returns and tend to involve similar transactions in each period. 4.14 Often an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is assessed when the incorrect tax position relates to a one-off transaction. For example, a taxpayer purchases a major asset and inadvertently claims an input tax credit in an earlier period. In this case, it would be more appropriate to base any consideration on whether the taxpayer had taken reasonable care. 4.15 In general, structures adopted to minimise GST payments are not as elaborate as those developed for income tax purposes. 4.16 In Australia, the “reasonably arguable position” standard on which the New Zealand penalty is based applies only to income tax. 18 Proposed reform 4.17 Under the proposals, GST and withholding-type taxes will be removed from the scope of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty so that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty will apply only to tax positions relating to income tax. 4.18 For other types of tax, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care will apply in appropriate cases. The standard of reasonable care requires that taxpayers exercise the degree of care that a reasonable person would be likely to exercise in the taxpayer’s circumstances. This means that for most taxpayers, following Inland Revenue’s instructions when completing a tax return would be sufficient to meet the “reasonable care” test. 4.19 However, if the tax position involves a significant amount of tax relative to the size of the taxpayer’s business, it may be reasonable to expect the taxpayer to seek the input of a tax professional or enquire about the correct tax treatment. If expert advice was not sought, depending on the facts, the taxpayer may not have taken reasonable care. 4.20 In cases not involving income tax and when taxpayers have taken reasonable care and there are tax shortfalls, penalties for not taking reasonable care would not be imposed. However, Inland Revenue could use this opportunity to inform the taxpayer what is required if a similar situation occurs in the future. 4.21 The proposal does not apply to the abusive tax position shortfall penalty. While an abusive tax position is also an unacceptable tax position, an abusive position is taken with the dominant purpose of reducing or removing a tax liability, or receiving a tax benefit. It is appropriate that this penalty remains in relation to all tax types. Increasing the thresholds 4.22 The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is only assessed when there is a significant amount of tax at stake. 4.23 Currently taxpayers are liable to pay the shortfall penalty if they take an unacceptable tax position and the tax shortfall arising from their tax position is more than both: (a) $20,000; and (b) the lesser of $250,000 and 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. 3 3 Section 141B(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 19 Proposed reform 4.24 The thresholds above which the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty is assessed will be increased. Under the proposed changes, the penalty will apply when the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both: (a) $50,000; and (b) 1 percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. 4.25 As well as increasing the minimum threshold to $50,000, the upper threshold of $250,000 will be removed, thus significantly further increasing the thresholds. Removing the $250,000 limit ensures that the penalty does not apply to what may be regarded as everyday transactions for some large corporations. 4.26 This proposal will remove many cases from the scope of the penalty. It also ensures that the policy underlying the penalty is reinforced so that the penalty applies only when there is a substantial amount of tax at stake. 20 Chapter 5 IMPROVING RECOGNITION OF GOOD COMPLIANCE Summary of proposals • Inland Revenue will notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty. However, if payment is not made by a certain date the penalty will be imposed. • The late payment penalty legislation relating to the employer monthly schedule will be clarified. • Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position will not be imposed when a tax shortfall is voluntarily disclosed (before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation). This proposal will apply to voluntary disclosures made within two years of the tax position being taken. • A new graduated penalty to replace the current shortfall penalty in relation to PAYE will apply when an employer has filed an employer monthly schedule but not paid the PAYE. Inland Revenue will contact the employer and, if payment or an arrangement for payment is not made, a 20 percent penalty will be imposed, reducing to 10 percent if the employer pays the outstanding PAYE within one month of the penalty being imposed. The penalty will not exceed in total any penalty that could be charged under the current rules. Current incentives to comply 5.1 One of the purposes of the compliance and penalties rules is to provide incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. The legislation does this by penalising non-compliance on the one hand, and by recognising taxpayers’ previous good compliance on the other. This is achieved by: • reducing shortfall penalties for voluntary disclosures and previous compliant behaviour; • warning taxpayers who have not filed their tax returns on time that if they do not file by a certain date a late filing penalty will be assessed; and • imposing the initial late payment penalty in two steps – 1 percent the day after the due date and 4 percent six days later. 21 Late payment penalty 5.2 One of the basic obligations for taxpayers is to pay their taxes on time. To encourage taxpayers to do this, those who pay late face late payment penalties. 5.3 The late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the initial late payment penalty and the incremental late payment penalty. 5.4 The initial late payment penalty is applied in two steps – the first being a 1 percent penalty imposed the day after the due date and the second being a 4 percent penalty imposed at the end of the sixth day if the tax owing remains outstanding. 5.5 An incremental late payment penalty of 1 percent is imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. The issue 5.6 The government is concerned that taxpayers who are usually compliant but have inadvertently missed a payment have late payment penalties imposed on them. In some cases, the penalty can be disproportionately high compared with the severity of the breach. There should also be some consideration given to the taxpayer’s previous record of compliance before imposing the late payment penalty. Proposed reform 5.7 Inland Revenue will notify taxpayers the first time their payment is late. 5.8 The notification will explain that if the payment is not made by a certain date, late payment penalties will be imposed. The notification will also state that if taxpayers make late payments in the future, further leniency will not be granted. Inland Revenue will not send the taxpayer any further notifications for two years, and the initial late payment penalty will be imposed in the normal manner. 5.9 If the warning does not result in payment, the late payment penalty will be imposed in the normal manner at 1 percent the day after the initial due date and 4 percent six days later. 5.10 On the date of introduction of this proposal, all taxpayers will start with a clean slate. 5.11 The first time a taxpayer pays late (irrespective of whether he or she has paid late in the previous two years) a warning will be given. This will allow the new provision to apply immediately. It also allows the provision to apply in cases where a new business which does not have a compliance history is starting up. In this case, the added benefit is that the provision will allow Inland Revenue to inform taxpayers of their payment obligations before a more serious level of default occurs. 22 Late filing penalty 5.12 The government has considered whether a similar amendment should be made to the late filing penalty rules to take into account previous good compliance. However, a change is seen as unnecessary for two reasons: the penalty is a fixed amount, and before a late filing penalty is imposed Inland Revenue generally notifies taxpayers that their returns are late and that late filing penalties will be imposed if their returns are not filed immediately. 5.13 The legislation applying to employer monthly schedules will be clarified to reflect the current practice of warning employers when a schedule is filed late, and imposing penalties on subsequent cases. Penalty reductions for voluntary disclosures 5.14 Currently, shortfall penalties reduce if taxpayers voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls. Penalties are reduced by: • 75 percent if the disclosure is made before the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation; or • 40 percent if the disclosure is made after the taxpayer is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation but before the audit or investigation starts. 5.15 The penalty reduction reflects the lower administrative cost of having the tax shortfall identified before resources are committed to an investigation. It also recognises the taxpayer’s intention to comply and co-operate with Inland Revenue. The issue 5.16 The compliance and penalty rules should provide sufficient incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. However, the current rules do not encourage taxpayers to disclose a tax shortfall. 5.17 Imposing shortfall penalties in cases when taxpayers voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls, even though the penalties are reduced, reduces the incentives for taxpayers to make voluntary disclosures. This is because taxpayers know that the consequence of making voluntary disclosures is the assessment of shortfall penalties. Proposed reform 5.18 To increase the incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily, shortfall penalties payable when tax shortfalls are voluntarily disclosed before taxpayers are notified of pending tax audits or investigations will not be imposed. The proposal will be subject to the disclosure being made within two years of the relevant tax position being taken. 23 5.19 The two-year period will allow taxpayers to reconcile their GST returns with their income tax return and/or their annual accounts. It also allows for two income tax returns to be filed, which will give taxpayers sufficient opportunity to identify tax shortfalls in the first return when they complete the second return. 5.20 If taxpayers voluntarily disclose tax shortfalls before Inland Revenue notifies them of a pending tax audit or investigation more than two years after taking the tax position, the existing 75 percent reduction will apply. 5.21 Given the more serious concern with tax shortfalls arising from gross carelessness, abusive tax positions and evasion, the proposal will apply only to the shortfall penalties for “not taking reasonable care” and “unacceptable tax positions”. Voluntary disclosures made before the notification of a pending tax audit or investigation of these more serious actions will still qualify for the reduction of 75 percent. Temporary shortfalls 5.22 Consideration has been given to whether the penalty reduction given for temporary shortfalls should also be increased from 75 percent to 100 percent. 5.23 One of the reasons a reduction is given for voluntary disclosures is because it forestalls the administrative costs of an investigation. Another reason is that, in making a voluntary disclosure, the taxpayer is signalling a wish to comply. These arguments are not so apparent in the case of temporary shortfalls. 5.24 For these reasons the government has decided not to increase the temporary shortfall reduction. Late payment of PAYE 5.25 One of the basic tax obligations for employers is to withhold PAYE tax on behalf of their employees and pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue by specific dates. If the employer fails to pay Inland Revenue on time, penalties will apply. In practice, non-payment of PAYE is treated more seriously than failure to pay other taxes, as PAYE places a special responsibility on the employer to effect payment on behalf of the employee. 5.26 The current penalties that apply in relation to PAYE obligations include: • Late payment penalty: The penalty is applied at the rate of 1 percent on the due date, 4 percent seven days later and 1 percent each month the tax is outstanding. • Late filing penalty: $250 is applied to each employer monthly schedule filed late. 24 • Shortfall penalty for evasion: A shortfall penalty of 150 percent is imposed on taxpayers who knowingly apply or permit the application of PAYE deductions for any purpose other than for payment to the Commissioner. 4 An amount is considered to have been applied for a purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner if the amount is not paid to the Commissioner by the due date. 5 • Prosecution: The extent of the penalty is decided by the courts but can include a monetary penalty, periodic detention, or imprisonment in extreme cases. 6 The issue 5.27 When considering non-compliance in relation to PAYE obligations there are a number of possible scenarios, including: • employers who have some or all of their employees outside the PAYE system; • employers who pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue but do not file the employer monthly schedule; and • employers who file the employer monthly schedule but do not pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue. 5.28 In relation to the first scenario, the government considers that the current penalty rules should continue to apply. In the second scenario, penalties are limited because the tax is paid. In the third situation, where the employer files the schedule but does not pay the PAYE, the government considers that the current rules give rise to a number of concerns: • Distortionary outcomes in different fact situations: A taxpayer with a good record of tax compliance incurs the same (or higher) level of penalty as a taxpayer with a record of non-compliance. An employer who fails to file an employer monthly schedule could be eligible for a 75 percent reduction for voluntary disclosure, while an employer who files an employer monthly schedule, but no payment, is not eligible for any voluntary disclosure penalty reduction. This is effectively providing a disincentive for employers to file. • A lack of opportunity for taxpayers to correct non-compliance: The shortfall penalty for evasion can be imposed the day after PAYE has not been paid to Inland Revenue, leaving taxpayers with little opportunity to address non-payment. • A perception that the current rules may be harsh: In theory, taxpayers could incur shortfall penalties for evasion (150 percent of the unpaid PAYE) plus the initial late payment penalties, even if payments are made only a few days late. 4 Section 141E(1)(b) Tax Administration Act 1994. 5 Section 4A(2)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 6 Section 143A(8)(d) Tax Administration Act 1994. 25 Proposed reform 5.29 To deal with these problems a new penalty will be introduced to replace the current shortfall penalty in relation to PAYE. The new rules will better reflect the degree of seriousness shown by employers in meeting their PAYE obligations, while adopting a more graduated approach to the shortfall penalty will provide better opportunities to correct any non-compliance. 5.30 Under the proposal, shortfall penalties for evasion will not be imposed if the employer files the employer monthly schedule but does not pay the PAYE. Instead, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to establish the reason for the non-payment and offer to liaise with the employer to establish or enhance its systems to ensure future compliance. The legislation will require that the Commissioner warn the employer that a 20 percent PAYE shortfall penalty will be imposed if payment, or an arrangement for payment, is not made. 5.31 If the employer does not make the payment or enter an instalment arrangement the employer will receive instruction requesting payment within 30 days. On the expiry of 30 days, the PAYE shortfall penalty of 20 percent of the unpaid PAYE will be imposed. If the PAYE is paid within 30 days of its imposition, the penalty will be reduced to 10 percent. If the payment is not made, the process will repeat itself – that is, another 20 percent penalty will be imposed, which will reduce to 10 percent if payment is made within 30 days. The penalty will not exceed in total any penalty that could be charged under the current rules. 5.32 This proposal is aimed at encouraging employers to pay the outstanding PAYE and giving them an incentive to comply. Compliance includes entering into an instalment arrangement. If the employer enters an instalment arrangement the new penalty will not apply unless the employer defaults on an instalment arrangement. In this case, the penalty will be imposed at 20 percent, with no reduction to 10 percent. 5.33 The normal late payment penalties, use-of-money interest and ability to prosecute will continue to operate as they do at present. 26 Chapter 6 IMPROVING GST FILING Summary of proposals A late filing penalty will be introduced for GST returns that are not filed by the due date. This will: • provide an incentive for returns to be filed by the due date; • reduce the number of default assessments issued to taxpayers and hence reduce potential tax liabilities, which may in some cases bear little resemblance to the amount that should be payable; and • create more fiscal certainty for the government as a result of fewer default assessments. 6.1 When taxpayers fail to file their GST returns, the principal mechanism available to encourage the filing of the return is for Inland Revenue to issue a default assessment. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability and remains in place until the taxpayer files the return. A default assessment is likely to present a slightly larger debt than a self-assessment, and thereby encourage taxpayers to file returns. 6.2 The default assessment is seen by some taxpayers as an excessive response to non-filing. The government considers that a more appropriate response would be to impose a late filing penalty, with the default assessment reserved for significant or ongoing non-compliance. 6.3 Consistent with the proposals outlined in chapter 5, a late filing penalty would not be imposed the first time a taxpayer fails to furnish a return, but would instead result in a warning. Background Late filing penalties 6.4 Late filing penalties were introduced in 1997 on income tax returns, and on employer monthly schedules in 1999. The purpose of the penalty is to encourage returns to be filed on time. Late filing penalties were not introduced for GST returns because default assessments were considered a sufficient mechanism to encourage compliance with GST filing obligations. 27 Employer monthly schedule 6.5 For the purposes of comparison, Inland Revenue currently uses a two-step process to encourage timely filing of the employer monthly schedule. The first time an employer fails to file employer monthly schedules, Inland Revenue issues warning notices advising that penalties will not be imposed, provided the schedules are filed immediately. If a further default in filing occurs within 12 months of the first default, a late filing penalty of $250 is imposed. 6.6 If taxpayers file their employer monthly schedules on time for 12 months, the process is reset and any future initial default results only in a warning, with no late filing penalty. (As discussed in chapter 5, the legislation will further clarify this process.) GST default assessment 6.7 The default assessment system is very similar to the late filing penalty process for employer monthly schedules. If taxpayers fail to furnish returns they are issued warning letters requesting that the GST returns are filed. 6.8 If the returns are not furnished, default assessments are issued. If the outstanding returns are not furnished by the next filing date the same process is repeated, with the amounts that are default-assessed increasing by a predetermined rate. 6.9 If taxpayers do file the required returns, the amounts owed are reassessed. Current position 6.10 A default assessment can impose unnecessary stress on taxpayers and create a degree of fiscal uncertainty for the government. 6.11 The goal is to increase the number of returns filed on time. The same, or better, taxpayer compliance can be achieved with a late filing penalty, and with lower levels of stress and anxiety for taxpayers than by using default assessments. 6.12 The government is concerned that the number of default assessments is growing. Although the number of GST registrants increased between 2001 and 2005, the relative increase in default assessments has risen from 5.3 percent to 6.2 percent of outstanding returns. 6.13 By comparison, the percentage of employer monthly schedules outstanding has decreased since 2000. While the compliance incentives may differ, evidence would suggest that the imposition of a late filing penalty on GST returns would achieve better results, while also ensuring that government debt figures are not inflated. 28 6.14 Introducing a late filing penalty on late GST returns will also ensure consistency in the tax filing incentives between the two main taxes paid by small to medium–sized enterprises – GST and PAYE. Role of default assessments 6.15 The ability to issue a default assessment in relation to GST will not be removed from the legislation as it is expected that Inland Revenue will continue to use them in cases of ongoing non-compliance. Proposed reforms 6.16 As with the late filing penalty for an annual imputation return, reconciliation statement, employer monthly schedule or an annual tax return with a net income of between $100,000 and $1,000,000, a late filing penalty of $250 will be imposed for failing to file a GST return on time. 6.17 Consistent with the proposals in chapter 5, the legislation will require Inland Revenue first to issue a warning. The warning notification will request that taxpayers file their returns, and that they do so within the time specified. 6.18 If the return is still outstanding, a reminder will be given to taxpayers advising that they have not filed their return. It will also warn them that failure to file any further GST return within 12 months of the date of the reminder will result in the imposition of a late filing penalty. 6.19 If, within this 12-month period taxpayers again fail to furnish another GST return, a combined warning and notification will be issued. This will inform them of the imposition of a $250 late filing penalty, and warn them of the pending imposition of a default assessment. 6.20 If the second return remains outstanding, a default assessment will be issued. 6.21 If taxpayers file their GST returns on time for 12 months or longer and then default, the process starts again and warning notifications will be issued. Further defaults within 12 months of the warning will be penalised. 6.22 Introducing the late filing penalty and using default assessment in cases of continuing non-compliance will: • be a better tool to encourage on-time GST filing; • reduce taxpayer stress by a reminder being initially given instead of a debt figure; and • allow the government to ensure that the GST debt levels are not overstated. 29 Chapter 7 OTHER CHANGES TO THE PENALTIES RULES Summary of proposals • The abusive tax position shortfall penalty threshold will be repealed. • For temporary shortfalls to which a 75 percent reduction in the shortfall penalty applies, the legislation will clarify that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that through operation of law the shortfall will be remedied. For a shortfall to be considered temporary it must be permanently reversed or corrected within two years of the tax position being taken. • The Commissioner will be able to treat return periods that overlap as the same return period for associated taxpayers, allowing a tax refund to be used to reduce an associated person’s tax shortfall. • The proposals outlined in the 2004 discussion document, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion, will be dealt with at the same time as the issues in this discussion document. Abusive tax position shortfall penalty 7.1 An abusive tax position shortfall penalty of 100 percent of the tax shortfall applies when the tax position taken is an unacceptable tax position that has a dominant purpose of reducing or removing a tax liability or giving tax benefits. 7.2 As noted in the Commentary on the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill, September 1995: Indicators of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non-availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. 7.3 For an abusive tax position shortfall penalty to be imposed the tax shortfall must be greater than $20,000. 7 Despite differing slightly from the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty threshold (in that the materiality threshold does not apply), it appears that this threshold has been carried over from the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty. 7 Section 141D(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 30 7.4 While it is appropriate that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty has a threshold, as it would be overly onerous to apply this standard to all tax positions, this does not hold true for abusive tax positions. Although an abusive tax position is an unacceptable tax position, it is also at the more aggressive end of the non-compliance scale. Proposed reform 7.5 The threshold for the imposition of the shortfall penalty for having an abusive tax position will be repealed. Temporary shortfalls 7.6 A shortfall penalty is reduced by 75 percent if the tax shortfall is temporary. 8 The legislation sets out what is meant by “temporary”. 7.7 The reduction recognises that there is a difference in the tax revenue effect between a temporary and permanent shortfall. The amount of the reduction is in line with the penalty rate currently applied to voluntary disclosures before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation (75 percent of the shortfall penalty). This is because a temporary shortfall is very similar to a voluntary disclosure, as the shortfall is rectified after the shortfall is identified by the taxpayer. The issue 7.8 When the compliance and penalty rules were first introduced, there was considerable criticism relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties in cases where there had been little or no fiscal risk. This problem was particularly obvious when a GST refund check was made by Inland Revenue and a timing difference was detected. 7.9 The rules reducing the penalty for temporary shortfalls require the taxpayer to permanently reverse or correct the situation in a subsequent tax-return period. However, in some cases, there is little or no opportunity for this to occur. 7.10 Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statement INV-231, released in May 1998, dealt with this concern. The legislation requires that the temporary shortfall is: ... permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. 9 8 Section 141I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 9 Section 141I(3)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 31 7.11 However, the Standard Practice Statement states that the: .... Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if: • it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall; or • through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. Proposed reform 7.12 The legislation will be amended to better reflect the Standard Practice Statement. This will give taxpayers the opportunity to benefit from the reduction for a temporary shortfall if the taxpayer has taken steps to address the tax shortfall, even though the opportunity has not yet arisen to deal with it in a subsequent return. 7.13 The Standard Practice Statement currently provides no time limit within which the temporary shortfall must be permanently reversed. The proposed legislation will require the temporary shortfall to be permanently reversed or corrected within two years of the tax position being taken. If the temporary shortfall is permanently reversed or corrected outside of the two-year period, any shortfall penalty will not qualify for reduction under the temporary shortfall provision. 7.14 This proposal should further encourage taxpayers who identify tax shortfalls to correct them. Associated persons filing returns with differing balance dates 7.15 Occasionally, taxpayers include transactions in the wrong entity’s return – for example, in an associated person’s return. Because they do not know they have included the transaction in the wrong return, the tax shortfall does not show up when a reconciliation is undertaken. These shortfalls are often not voluntarily disclosed because the taxpayer is unaware they have occurred and, therefore the shortfall cannot be considered “temporary”. 7.16 Currently, if there is a tax shortfall in one taxpayer’s return and, as a result an associated taxpayer’s return is adjusted, resulting in an entitlement to a refund or an increased refund, the refund may be used to reduce the tax shortfall of the associated taxpayer. The returns must, however, be for the same tax type and return period. 7.17 Problems arise when the return periods are not the same – for example, when one associated taxpayer files the GST return on odd months and the other associated taxpayer files on even months. Because the return periods are not the same, the refund cannot be used to reduce the tax shortfall. 32 Proposed reforms 7.18 Under the proposed changes, the Commissioner will be able to treat return periods that overlap as the same return period for the purposes of this provision. This discretion will not apply when the tax shortfall arises as the result of an abusive tax position or evasion – for example, if a taxpayer deliberately claims an input tax credit in the wrong entity in order to claim the refund earlier. 7.19 The current provision also applies only when adjustment results in creating a refund or an increased refund for the second taxpayer. The proposed provision will also apply where the adjustment results in less tax to pay for the second taxpayer. Tax compliance initiative 7.20 The discussion document, Options for dealing with industry-wide tax evasion, was released in August 2004. 7.21 The discussion document noted that New Zealand’s tax laws contain severe penalties for evasion. This can make it difficult for people who have evaded tax in the past and who want to comply with the law to come forward and sort out their tax affairs. The document also noted that existing rules do not deal with the problem of industry-wide tax evasion because the rules are designed to apply to individual businesses. This means that a different approach to promoting compliance is required when evasion becomes commonplace within an industry. 7.22 The discussion document recommended that Inland Revenue be given the power to offer limited amnesties to specific industries in which tax evasion is widespread. Following the amnesty, the targeted industry would be subject to increased audit, and any tax shortfalls detected would face the full range of penalties and other sanctions provided for in the legislation. 7.23 The discussion document also recommended the introduction of a special voluntary disclosure rule. For people who came forward, the core tax amount would be limited, but normal penalties and interest would apply. 7.24 As a result of the submissions received on the options outlined in the discussion document, the limited amnesty proposal has been developed on the basis of a two-year amnesty option. 7.25 Under the proposed rules, a tax evader who comes forward will have to pay tax on previously undisclosed income for two years (covering the current filing year and the year before that). Use-of-money interest, shortfall penalties (currently reduced by 75 percent for voluntary disclosure before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation) and any consequential effects of disclosing two years’ income for family assistance, student loans and child support liabilities will be included in the overall assessment of a person’s liability 33 7.26 The Commissioner will offer a limited amnesty to a specific targeted industry or activity. The terms of the offer will specify the taxes that are included in the amnesty and a period in which the tax evader can come forward under the amnesty. It will also be clearly communicated that after the amnesty offer expires, intensive investigations and audits of the targeted industry will begin. Tax evaders will qualify under an amnesty if they have undisclosed income earned from the targeted industry. Upon qualifying for the amnesty, they must fully disclose their income from all sources for a two-year period. The two-year period will cover the current filing year and the year before that. 7.27 Limited amnesties will not affect existing tax debts or provide immunity from prosecutions under other legislation such as the Crimes Act or the Serious Fraud Act. 7.28 These proposals, which were first outlined in the discussion document, have to date not been included in a tax bill. The government has decided to progress them at the same time as the proposals in this discussion document. 34 Chapter 8 OTHER INITIATIVES CONSIDERED AND REJECTED 8.1 In developing the proposals in this discussion document, a number of issues were considered which will not, at this stage, be progressed. Shortfall penalties 8.2 In 2003 the new section 141FB was inserted into the Income Tax Act. The section takes into account taxpayers’ previous compliance. Under its provisions, taxpayers receive a 50 percent reduction of the shortfall penalty if, within the previous two years, in the case of GST, fringe benefit tax, PAYE and resident withholding tax, or four years in the case of all other taxes, they have not been liable to pay a shortfall penalty on a tax shortfall identified during an audit. The exception to this general rule is the shortfall penalty for tax evasion, where there is no probation period. 8.3 The government has considered increasing the reduction for previous good behaviour from 50 percent to 100 percent but has decided against this change because it could provide an incentive for taxpayers to ensure that their tax positions were correct only after they had been audited, or to breach the required standards of behaviour every now and then but not sufficiently to be seen as a non-compliant taxpayer. Increasing the reduction could reduce the incentives for taxpayers to comply with their obligations. 8.4 The government considers there are more effective ways of promoting voluntary compliance, as outlined in chapter 5. Taxpayers who file early and correct their tax positions before the due date 8.5 Under the current rules, if a taxpayer files a tax return before the due date, discovers an error in the return and tries to correct the error, the correction is treated as a voluntary disclosure. If a tax shortfall penalty applies, the 75 percent reduction for voluntary disclosure applies, provided the error was identified before a pending tax audit or investigation. 8.6 To encourage voluntary compliance, Inland Revenue previously took a liberal approach under the provisions of Standard Practice Statement INV 570, and did not impose shortfall penalties if a taxpayer independently and voluntarily filed an amended return before the due date. 10 However, this Statement has been withdrawn. 10 Standard Practice Statement INV 570 Shortfall penalties – application where returns are amended before due date. This practice did not apply to income tax. 35 8.7 Chapter 5 proposes that when voluntary disclosures of tax shortfalls that arise from the taxpayer not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position are made before the notification of an audit, no shortfall penalty should be imposed. Therefore when the taxpayer files the return early and corrects the tax position before the due date, the penalty will not be imposed. 8.8 There may be a small number of cases when the voluntary disclosure is made after taxpayers are notified of a pending audit and before the due date. However, because many of these tax shortfalls result from innocent mistakes and taxpayers have taken reasonable care, a shortfall penalty would not be assessed. 8.9 There will be other cases when taxpayers have taken abusive tax positions. In these circumstances it would be inappropriate for a shortfall penalty not to be assessed merely because the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation before the due date. 8.10 For these reasons, no amendments to prescribe that taxpayers may correct their returns before the due date for filing without facing a shortfall penalty are proposed. The time at which taxpayers take their tax positions 8.11 Several commentators have recommended that if taxpayers correct their return and pay the correct amount of tax on time, no shortfall penalty should be assessed. They argue that because there is no loss of revenue there should be no penalty. Alternatively, they suggest that the tax position is taken when the tax is payable not when the return is filed. 8.12 Shortfall penalties are intended to encourage taxpayers to take correct tax positions. There is a range of instances when a tax shortfall may occur without loss of revenue – for example, where the taxpayer has losses carried forward and there is a tax shortfall in the calculation of the loss. Not assessing a shortfall penalty because there is no loss of revenue reduces the incentives on taxpayers to ensure that their tax positions are correct. 8.13 It is appropriate to consider the tax position at the time the return is filed because the position is based on the law as it stands at that time. If the tax position was taken when the tax was paid there could be amendments or cases overturned that affect the tax positions taken and which could not be reflected in the return filed. 8.14 For these reasons no changes are proposed. 36 Capping penalties and interest 8.15 Currently, there is no cap on the amount of late payment penalties or use-of- money interest that can accumulate on an outstanding tax debt. 8.16 While the government would prefer taxpayers to pay their debts on time, it appreciates that some circumstances may prevent a taxpayer from doing so. In such cases a taxpayer’s best option is to contact Inland Revenue and enter into instalment arrangements. 8.17 There will, however, always be taxpayers who disagree with paying tax. It is important that these taxpayers see the consequences of their non-compliance through the appropriate imposition of penalties. 8.18 The government has considered whether there should be a cap on the amount of late payment penalty that accumulates. For example, a cap could be set at three times the amount of the core tax debt. 8.19 However, capping tax debts could result in taxpayers no longer paying small to medium-sized debts. For example, if a cap of three times the core tax was set, a $100 debt would grow to $300. The probability of Inland Revenue prosecuting the taxpayer because of non-payment of the debt would be low and the incentive to pay would therefore be reduced. 8.20 There is also a risk that once the cap had been reached, taxpayers would pay creditors who charge ongoing interest or penalties for late payment in preference to Inland Revenue. 8.21 The proposals in this document are aimed at encouraging taxpayers to come forward and pay their debts as early as possible – for example, the new PAYE penalty outlined in chapter 5. The government considers that proposals aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily comply is a better option than capping penalties once they have reached a certain level. 37 Appendix OUTLINE OF THE CURRENT PENALTIES AND USE-OF- MONEY INTEREST STRUCTURE Shortfall penalties There are five shortfall penalties. The penalties (only one of which will apply to a tax shortfall) are applied as a percentage of the tax shortfall: • Evasion (150%) • Abusive tax position (100%) • Gross carelessness (40%) • Unacceptable tax position (20%) • Not taking reasonable care (20%) For an unacceptable tax position or abusive tax position shortfall penalty to be imposed the tax shortfall must be in excess of both: • $20,000; and • the lesser of either 1% of the total tax figure and $250,000. Shortfall penalties imposed The extent of each penalty imposed by Inland Revenue is shown in the following table: 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Shortfall category Number $000 Number$000 Number$000 Number$000 Number $000 Lack of reasonable care 5,164 3,689 2,935 8,548 1,422 4,229 1,385 3,721 1,002 2,624 Gross carelessness 2,343 3,134 927 9,328 148 1,192 471 3,089 691 4,645 Unacceptable tax position 125 695 232 1,208 438 4,380 311 1607 410 3,930 Abusive tax position 22 1,156 155 8,757 45 4,909 73 2,515 86 7,200 Evasion 1,081 4,482 402 19,297 222 14,136 282 18,061 304 10,480 8,735 13,156 4,651 47,138 2,275 28,846 2,522 28,993 2,493 28,879 Penalty reductions The legislation provides for the following reductions in shortfall penalties: • Good previous behaviour (50%) 11 • Voluntary disclosure – Prior to notification of a pending tax audit or investigation (75%) – After notification and before the beginning of audit (40%) • Disclosure of an unacceptable tax position (75%) • Temporary shortfall (75%) 11 This reduction may be given on its own, or in addition to any of the other reductions listed. 38 Limit on the amount of the penalty A cap of $50,000 applies on shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care and taking an unacceptable tax position, in cases where the shortfall is identified either by the taxpayer or Inland Revenue within a certain period from the due date of the return, being the later of: • the date that is three months after the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates; and • the date that follows the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates by the lesser of – – 1 return period; and – 6 months. Increased penalty A shortfall penalty may be increased by 25 percent if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner. Late filing penalties If taxpayers do not file their returns on time, late filing penalties apply. The amount of the penalty depends of the type of return not filed and in some cases the net income of the taxpayer. The late filing penalty for an annual tax return for a taxpayer with net income: • below $100,000 – $50; • between $100,000 and $1,000,000 (both figures inclusive) – $250; and • above $1,000,000 – $500. For annual imputation returns or reconciliation statements or employer monthly schedules the penalty rate is $250. Late payment penalties If a payment is not made on time late, payment penalties apply. The initial late payment penalty is imposed in two stages, 1 percent the day after the due date and 4 percent six days later. If payment is not made incremental late payment penalties of 1 percent are imposed each month the amount remains unpaid. Use-of-money interest Use-of-money interest, while not a penalty, also applies to under payments and overpayments.
Rewriting the Income Tax Act Exposure Draft Part M Rewrite Project Team First published in March 2006 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft – Part M ISBN 0-478-27134-4 1 Introduction This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Part M of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to the recording of credits and debits in various imputation and similar accounts. The key objective of rewriting this Part is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, and ultimately save them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor changes in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. Cross-references to sections outside Part M are to provisions within the Income Tax Act 2004.

These memorandum accounts, together with the tax credit rules in Part L, provide the legislative mechanism for transferring to shareholders in a company the benefit of tax paid at corporate level under the imputation system. The rewritten Part M contains only the rules relating to the various memorandum accounts. All of the rules relating to tax payments and refunds from subparts MB to MD of the 2004 Act are to be rewritten in Part N. The drafting changes relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into three main types: • modernising the style and language; • improving the clarity of the law; and • removing redundant material and moving some provisions to other parts of the Act. Policy clarification Two minor policy clarifications are proposed as a result of a newly defined term “memorandum account” to allow the drafting of some general rules in the rewritten subpart MA. In the definition of “tax position” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), it is proposed to include in paragraph (j) the new term “memorandum account”. At present, paragraph (j) of this definition refers to an undefined phrase “tax account”. The phrase “tax account” does not appear elsewhere in the TAA and is used only once in the 2004 Act, in section MBB 2. It is clear from the language of the defined term “tax position” that the phrase “tax account” is intended to refer to the various memorandum accounts in Part M of the 2004 Act. 3 In section 22(2) of the TAA, it is proposed to rationalise paragraphs (k) and (kb) and have them refer only to memorandum accounts. This change will mean that section 22(2) will then apply to supplementary available subscribed capital accounts. As a consequence, section 22(2)(f) will need to be amended to include a unit trust or a group investment fund that maintains a supplementary available subscribed capital account. Drafting improvements Major improvements in the clarity of the legislation will arise from: • having separate tables for credits and debits that summarise the rules for credits and debits for each type of memorandum account; • rationalising common rules into a new subpart MA; and • drawing together common rules that apply to all or most memorandum accounts, such as consolidated group rules and qualifying amalgamation rules. Tables of credits and debits Tables have been used in each subpart to provide quick access to the credits and debits that arise within each type of memorandum account. A separate table has been set out for all credits and debits with a brief description of the nature of the credit or debit, the date of the credit or debit and a link to the provision that defines that particular credit or debit. Tables are also used to summarise the credits and debits for each type of memorandum account as they apply to consolidated groups in new subpart MP. Rationalisation of provisions In the 2004 Act, a separate rule creates the opening balance for each type of memorandum account in each subpart. A similar situation arises for the rules relating to qualifying amalgamations, as these rules apply to most memorandum accounts. These rules are repetitive and have been rationalised and placed in a new subpart MA. Redundant material Some provisions in subpart ME of the 2004 Act that apply to Maori authorities are now redundant. Following the enactment of section ME 1(2)(j) in the 2004 Act by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, a Maori authority may not maintain an imputation credit account. Instead, a Maori authority may attach a Maori authority credit to a taxable Maori authority distribution. 4 Some rules in subpart ME relating to cooperative companies continue to indicate that imputation credits may be attached to a taxable Maori authority distribution. These references have been omitted from the rewritten provisions as they are redundant. Benefits of the proposed structure Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts contained in Part M, the rewrite of this Part must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers will come to the legislation without knowledge of how the various rules in Part M interact with other Parts of the Act, particularly Part L. In identifying these interrelationships, the draft legislation helps readers understand the relationship between provisions in other Parts of the Act and the transactions and situations dealt with in Part M. The ordering of the subparts and provisions in the subparts reflects the drafting policy that more generally applicable provisions should appear earliest in each Part. Cross-references in this exposure draft to Parts outside Part M relate to the 2004 Act, not to the recently released exposure drafts of other rewritten Parts. This is because further intensive specialist reviews of these exposure drafts are planned and may lead to changes to these draft provisions. Specific feedback We invite comment on the proposed amendment to the definition of “tax position” and section 22(2) (both being in the TAA) as a consequence of introducing the new term “memorandum account” in Part M. Comment on any of the drafting clarifications is welcomed. Relationship of Part M to other Parts The main relationship between Part M and the rest of the Act is to provide a way of tracking payments of tax at a corporate level and the subsequent use of that tax as a credit of tax under Part L. As a result there is no direct link with the core provisions from Part M. Moving 2004 Act Part M provisions to Part N Subparts MB, MBA, MBB, MBC, MC and MD are to be rewritten and relocated within Part N. Comment is invited on the proposed relocation of these subparts, which deal with tax payments and refunds. 5 Moving 2004 Act provisions to subpart MZ Section MJ 4 has been moved to draft section MZ 5. Section MJ 7 has been moved to draft section MZ 6.
