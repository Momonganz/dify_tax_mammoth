The Court based its decision on special circumstances relating to this particular case, as the presiding Judge emphasised. The vehicles were also a specific model of station wagon, which is no longer in production. This is a one-off situation, and does not set a precedent. Conclusion Inland Revenue’s policy is to define station wagons as motor cars for FBT purposes unless the necessary alterations are made to convert them to work related vehicles. This policy is not changed by the Tisco decision. Ref: HO TA P 007 F Valuation of Buildings Occupied as Dwellings for GST Purposes Background In Public Information Bulletin 171 of March 1988, we discussed the valuation of residential dwellings for GST purposes where the dwelling is part of the business premises. The dwelling is treated as either a private asset or as having been acquired for an exempt activity when used as a place of residence or abode. In the article we gave the example of a farm dwelling and showed how the value of the land on which it stands is apportioned on an area basis. In these situations that method of appor- tioning the value of the total farm land is gener- ally the most appropriate. We have recently been asked if we would ac- cept valuations of residential land on farm properties based on normal sales evidence of residential sections in nearby rural townships. It was suggested that this would give a more realistic value than the arithmetical calculations given in our example. Ruling Inland Revenue will accept valuations of resi- dential land on farm or other properties based on sales evidence where it is clear that a straight mathematical apportionment is inappropriate. Any valuation other than an arithmetical calcu- lation should be made by a registered valuer. The valuation should be supported by a state- ment from the valuer setting out the method and reasons for the valuation. Reference GST V.1.4 Fringe Benefit Tax - Prescribed Rate of Interest for Quarter Commencing 1 April 1991 The Minister of Revenue has confirmed that the prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit of low interest employment related loans will be 13.75 percent for the quarter commencing 1 April 1991. 3 GST - Contingency Debt, Consumer Credit and Payment Protection Insurance Introduction Public Information Bulletin No. 175 of July 1988 described the GST consequences of Contin- gency Debt (CDI) and Consumer Credit (CCI) insurance policies. Since that statement there has been some confusion with these definitions, so we are providing this explanation of the dif- ferences between these policies. This item confirms the views in PIB 175. Contingency Debt Insurance (CDI) A Contingency Debt Insurance is an indemnity policy to cover a creditor against the risk of debtor’s default under the credit contract; usu- ally the debtor’s failure to make repayment. These factors are evident in such policies: • such a contract is entered into by the pro- vider of the credit (eg. dealer in a hire pur- chase, finance company in a mortgage) with the insurance company. • the contract is entered into to indemnify the “creditor” against the loss arising in the event that the “debtor” fails to perform the obligation in terms of the credit contract. • the insurer’s liability arises only upon fail- ure by the debtor to perform the obligation in terms of the credit contract. Contingency Debt policies are financial services within section 3(1)(h) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. They are therefore deemed ex- empt supplies in terms of section 14 of the Act. Consumer Credit and Payment Protection Insurance (CCI) A Consumer Credit and Payment Protection In- surance is a policy in which the insurer will pay the policy owner (the creditor) upon the hap- pening of the insured events as set out in the re- spective policies. Note: in these policies, it is not necessary for the debtor to fail to make repayment. Further, the policy owner need not be in a position of loss before payment is made by the insurers. It is sufficient that the insured event occurs and the terms and conditions of the contract are met (eg. an illness which results in the insured be- ing totally disabled from engaging in or attend- ing to usual business or occupation prior to such person’s 65th birthday). The mere fact that the quantum of the insurer’s liability under contract is determined partly by reference to the credit contract between the in- sured and policy owner does not make the pol- icy in itself an indemnity in respect of the per- formance of the obligations under a credit con- tract. Consumer Credit and Payment Protection poli- cies are consideration for a supply of services on which GST is payable. However, any por- tion of a premium which is paid for life cover included in such a contract continues to be ex- empt as consideration for a financial service.

He also indi- cated that an international tax policy review would be undertaken, after which new FIF rules would ap- ply from 1 April 1991. He made this announcement in a Ministerial press release on 6 March 1991. Following the Minister’s announcement, the Com- missioner released a media statement commenting on implications for taxpayers. A copy of this media statement is on page 7. Effect of Announcement The Minister’s announcement indicates that once passed, the amending legislation to delay the FIF regime will remove the obligation for taxpayers to disclose their interest in any FIF and to account for any FIF income in their tax returns for the period prior to 1 April 1991. An exception to this is where a taxpayer makes an investment in a FIF on or after 6 March 1991 (the date of the Minister’s announce- ment), in which case the new FIF rules will apply to that investment from that date. Current Position As the Commissioner pointed out in his media state- ment, at the moment an IR4H Disclosure Schedule is still required to be filed for any interest held in a FIF at any time since 1 April 1988. Taxpayers must also include FIF income in their income tax returns for the period up to 31 March 1991. This require- ment remains until the current legislation is amended, which is expected to be by 31 March 1991. If taxpayers choose to comply with their obligations under the current law, Inland Revenue will hold their Disclosures, but will not make an assessment in relation to them until the amending legislation is passed and the position is clear. If the amending legislation is passed as proposed, no assessment of FIF income would then be required. If taxpayers choose to “wait and see” the Commis- sioner has stated that Inland Revenue will not take action against taxpayers who have yet to file their Disclosure Schedule, in the light of the proposed delay in application of the FIF regime. However, in the event that the current legislation is not amended as proposed and the current obligations remain, In- land Revenue will then seek outstanding Disclosure Schedules and tax payments in accordance with the existing law. Implications for IEP Shareholders Inland Revenue’s stance will have particular signifi- cance for shareholders in Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd (“IEP”), who may still be endeavouring to meet the 31 March 1991 deadline for filing their IR 4H Disclosure Schedules, so as to avoid any tax penal- ties that would otherwise arise. Inland Revenue’s stance set out above applies equally to those share- holders. In the IEP case, if the current legislation is not amended as proposed and the current obliga- tions remain, the Commissioner has indicated that he would set a new deadline for the Disclosures at that stage. Reassessment and Refund Action Inland Revenue will initiate any reassessment and refund action that is required once the amending legislation is passed. This will be done for all tax- payers who have already filed an IR4H Disclosure Schedule and been assessed on that FIF income. Those who have already paid the tax will have it re- funded. Refunds will be issued as soon as possible once the legislation is passed. Taxpayers do not need to make a special application for a refund. Information to be made Available Once Parliament passes the amending legislation, Inland Revenue will send a letter to all taxpayers who have either; • already filed an IR4H Disclosure Schedule, or • responded to the recent IEP advertisement by sending in a coupon for the information pack, or • made application for a FIF Determination. This letter will explain the effect of the amended leg- islation and set out the position for them in the light of the change to the law. A copy of this letter will also be available to any other interested taxpayers from Inland Revenue District Offices. A letter will be issued at that time to all Tax Practi- tioners and Members of the New Zealand Stock Ex- change. Enquiries If you have any queries about this item, please con- tact the International Tax Liaison Officer in your lo- cal Inland Revenue Office. Alternatively, you can contact the International Tax Central Unit at P.O. Box 895 Wellington, Ph (04) 859-809, Fax (04) 852-306. 5 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, today explained how the Govern- ment’s announcement to delay the Foreign Investment Fund (“FIF”) legislation to 1 April 1991 would affect taxpayers. He added that the Minister of Revenue had indicated that the legislative amendments were expected to be passed by 31 March 1991. Up to now Inland Revenue has designated nine organisations as FIFs for tax purposes. This included Industrial Equity (Pa- cific) Limited, a subsidiary of Brierley Investments Limited. At the moment a Disclosure Return must be filed by any- body having an interest in a FIF after 1 April 1988. If the legis- lation is passed by 31 March as the Government’s announce- ment indicates there will be no obligation at that stage for peo- ple to disclose their interest in any FIF or to account for any FIF income prior to 1 April 1991. The Commissioner said that once the legislation was passed those people who had already filed Disclosure Returns and paid tax, would have that tax refunded. “In the meantime, in the light of the Government’s statement I have instructed my officers not to take action against those taxpayers who have yet to file Disclosure Returns. Should Parliament not ratify the Gov- ernment’s proposal I would at that stage be seeking Disclosure Returns and tax payments in accordance with the existing law,” Mr Henry said. Mr Henry said that once the legislation was passed Inland Revenue would write to all tax- payers who have filed a Disclo- sure Return, to advise them about their position. Mr Henry said that the Depart- ment was in the process of briefing its International Tax liaison officers in District Of- fices. Anyone wanting to dis- cuss their individual position should contact the Interna- tional Tax liaison officer in their local Inland Revenue of- fice from Friday (8 March) on- wards. A freephone service will also be available from 8 March, the number is 0800- 808-010.

Neville Whitlock Communications Unit, Taxpayer Services Head Office Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Introduction The Acts covered in this TIB came from the Taxation Reform Bill (No.2) (introduced on 24 July 1990) and the Taxation Reform Bill 1990 (introduced on 19 December 1990). The Acts resulting from the Taxation Reform Bill (No.2) 1990 are the: • Income Tax Amendment Act 1991 • Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1991 • Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1991 • Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1991 The Acts resulting from the Taxation Reform Bill 1990 are the: • Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 • Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 • Accident Compensation Amendment Act 1991 Some provisions from the Taxation Reform Bill 1990 have been held over and are now contained in the Taxation Reform Bill (No.3) (currently before the Finance Expenditure Select Committee). 3 Income Tax Amendment Act 1991 Accruals Sections 2 and 3 Attributed Foreign Income and Losses Section 6 Introduction This item explains the legislative changes intro- duced to the Income Tax Act to clarify and ex- pand the interpretation of attributed foreign in- come. There are two changes. The first one clarifies the definition of the term “income interest of 10 percent or greater”. The second one clarifies the provisions relating to elections to determine control and income interests on a daily meas- urement basis instead of a measurement day basis. Background (1) Definition of the term “income interest of 10 percent or greater” A legislative formula reduces aggregate income interests in a controlled foreign company to 100 percent. The application of this formula may also reduce a person’s income interest in that controlled foreign company to below 10 per- cent. The legislation currently used to ensure that persons holding income interests of less than 10 percent, where those interests have been re- duced through the operation of the above for- mula, is not consistent in its application with other provisions contained in Part IVA of the Act. (2) Election not to use measurement day basis The proviso to section 245A(2)(e) currently re- fers to “such income interest or control interest” and “that income interest or control interest”. The words “such” and “that” provide inad- equate identification of control and income in- terests. Consequently, the proviso does not sufficiently detail the treatment of variations of There are two minor changes to the accruals re- gime. Exemption for Issuers Section 2 amends section 64C of the Act to al- low the Commissioner to exempt from the re- quirement to make returns on an accruals basis, certain issuers who derive income in respect of a financial arrangement. The present power of exemption relates only to expenditure incurred by issuers. Application Date The amendment applies with respect to tax on income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1990 and every subsequent year. Suspensory Loans Section 3 amends the base price adjustment cal- culation in the accruals legislation (section 64F of the Act). One of the effects of the base price adjustment is to bring to account as income of the debtor any forgiveness of debt in relation to a financial ar- rangement. The income is derived in the year the debt is forgiven. Where the financial arrangement is a specified suspensory loan in terms of section 172 of the Act, and that loan is remitted, section 172(2) provides that the amount remitted is assessable income, spread over three income yuears. There is therefore conflict between sections 64F and 172. It is appropriate that the specific pro- visions in section 172 should apply. According- ly, amounts remitted in these circumstances have been removed from the base price adjust- ment calculation. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent of the Act - 31 March 1991. 4 interests in a foreign company subsequent to an election to use the daily measurement basis. Further, the current wording of the proviso makes it unclear as to whether the election must be made in relation to both income and control interests, or whether a person can make an election in relation to one of the types of interest to the exclusion of the other. Key Issues (1) Definition of income interest of 10 percent or greater The amendment to section 245A(1) modifies the definition of the term “Income interest of 10 percent or greater”. The amendment was made to specifically include in that definition income interests reduced below 10 percent through the operation of the formula contained in section 245H(1). Before this amendment, a separate subsection provided that where an income in- terest was reduced to less than 10 percent through the application of section 245H(1), the exclusion from the requirement to calculate at- tributed foreign income will not apply. The amendment simplifies the legislation and clearly defines the term “income interest of 10 percent or greater” as including interests that have been reduced by section 245H(1). (2) Election not to use measurement day basis The amendments to the proviso to section 245A(2)(e) make it clear that where an election is made to determine control and income inter- ests on a daily measurement basis instead of a measurement day basis, the election will apply to both control and income interests. Separate elections cannot be made in respect to each of the interests in isolation. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Definition of Term ìAssociated Personsî Section 7 Introduction This item explains the legislative changes made to the Income Tax Act to restrict the operation of the associated persons provisions and correct minor drafting oversights. Background Under the current legislation, the scope of the associated persons provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Act is inconceivably broad. If no restriction was made to the operation of the provisions, the paragraphs would, in effect, operate ad infinitum. In addition, a few legislative anomalies exist with the provisions as they were drafted. Key Issue The intention of the associated persons provi- sions is to associate any person and any com- pany or partnership where that person is asso- ciated with a person who is associated with the company or partnership. For example, where A is married to B who holds an income interest of 50% in company 1, the associated persons provisions operate to associate A and company 1. The same scenario applies to partnerships. The scope of the provisions is not limited at that stage. Subsequent application of these provi- sions would deem any person who is associated with A via any of the provisions of section 245B to be associated with company 1. For example, C is associated with A as he is her father, thereby becoming associated with company 1 as A is associated with the company. Any per- son who is associated with C is then deemed to be associated with company 1. It can be seen that a continuous chain of associations can oc- cur through continual application of sections 245B(c) or (f). Clearly this was not intended. The amendment ensures that paragraphs (c) and (f) of section 245B only apply where per- sons are associated under the other paragraphs of section 245B, and not to persons associated by virtue of paragraphs (c) and (f). This pro- vides a restriction to the operation of the associ- ated persons provisions. The other items are of a minor corrective nature ensuring completeness and accuracy. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. 5 Calculation of Control Interest Section 8 Introduction This item explains the legislative changes intro- duced to remove an unintended effect of the as- sociated persons provisions contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. Background As the legislation currently stands, where a non-resident interest holder is related to a per- son resident in New Zealand, and that New Zealand resident relative holds no interest in the foreign company, a foreign company may be deemed to be a controlled foreign company although in fact less than 50% of the interests in the company may be held by New Zealand resi- dents. This is an unintended result and the amend- ment seeks to rectify this anomaly. Key Issue The amendment inserts a new subsection in section 245C, (which applies to determine a person’s control interest), to ensure that the as- sociated persons test, as it applies to natural persons, only applies to New Zealand interest holders. As a result only interests held by New Zealand residents and their relatives would be used when determining whether or not a for- eign company is a controlled foreign company. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Calculation of Income Interest Section 9 Introduction This item explains the legislative changes intro- duced to the Income Tax Act to clarify the pro- visions on the calculation of income interests. Background Currently the section 245D contains terminol- ogy which is inconsistent with the rest of Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. In addition the proration formula, used to determine the in- come interest over the accounting period where the income interests vary over that period, is susceptible to incorrect interpretation. The present wording of section 245D(6) only applies in relation to persons who utilise the “measurement day” basis to determine their income interests in a controlled foreign com- pany. This unintentionally ignores persons who have elected to use a daily basis for the purposes of determining their income interests. Key Issues (1) New Zealand resident income interest Throughout Part IVA of the Income Tax Act an income interest which is less than 10 percent is referred to as an income interest which is “not an income interest of 10 percent or greater”. Section 245D(4) uses the term “less than 10 per- cent”. The amendment to this section rectifies this in- consistency. (2) Variation of income interest during ac- counting year Item “b” of the proration formula contained in section 245D(5)refers to an “income year”. The objective of the formula in section 245D(5) is to calculate the income interest of the tax- payer in relation to the accounting period of the controlled foreign company. The calculation re- lates to the instances where interests vary dur- ing an accounting period. The insertion of the term “accounting period” in substitution for “income year” will permit the application of the proration formula to the whole of the accounting period of the controlled foreign company irrespective of the dates of the taxpayers income year. (3) Holder of income interest ceases to be resi- dent The amendment inserts a new subsection in place of subsection (6) of section 245D. The ef- fect is to remove inconsistent use of terminol- 6 Cases where Aggregate Income Interests are Greater than 100 percent Section 11 ogy by deleting the reference to a person being “a resident in New Zealand” and replacing it with the phrase “resident in New Zealand”. In addition the deletion of the word “measure- ment” ensures that a person shall not be treated as holding an income interest on any day on which that person was not resident in New Zea- land. The subsection is expressly subject to the provisions of the measurement day basis con- tained in section 245A(2)(e), thereby providing that section 245D(6) applies to all persons in- come interests irrespective of the measurement basis used. However, if the measurement day basis is used, the provisions of section 245A(2)(e) continue to apply. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Introduction This item explains the legislative changes made to the Income Tax Act to remove drafting anomalies. Background A person’s income interest is determined by ref- erence to the highest percentage of interests held by each person in the five different catego- ries of income interest. Through the use of this provision, it is possible for income interests held by New Zealand resident persons in a con- trolled foreign company to exceed 100 percent in aggregate. Where aggregate income interests exceed 100 percent a proration formula contained in section 245H(1) reduces the income interests to 100 per- cent. Currently the formula incorrectly uses the term attributable foreign income. As a result of the amendment to section 245A(1), section 245H(2) is now redundant. Key Issue Other parts of Part IVA of the Income Tax Act refer to the term “attributed foreign income”. Thus the amendment removes an incorrect ref- erence to “attributable foreign income” and sub- stitutes the correct term “attributed foreign in- come”. Attribution of Income and Losses using Branch Equivalent Method Section 10 Introduction This item explains the legislative change made to the Income Tax Act to maintain consistency in Part IVA of the Act. Background The attribution of income or losses using the branch equivalent method applies only where a person who holds an income interest in a con- trolled foreign company is resident in New Zea- land. A person will be treated as not holding an income interest on any measurement day on which that person was not resident in New Zea- land. As with section 245D(6), section 245G(7) only operated where a person measured their in- come interest on a “measurement day” basis to the exclusion of interests measured on a “daily basis”. Key Issue A consequential amendment has been made to section 245G(7) as a result of the modification to section 245D(6). The word “measurement” has been deleted to ensure consistency between the sections. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. 7 Section 245H(2) operated to remove the exclu- sion from the requirement to calculate foreign income where an income interest was reduced through the operation of the proration formula. This section is no longer necessary as the amendment to section 245A(1) makes specific reference to the operation of the proration for- mula, by providing that an income interest of 10 percent or greater will include an income interest equal to or greater than 10 percent be- fore the application of the proration formula. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Foreign Tax Credits Section 12 This section makes a number of amendments to the foreign tax credit provisions contained in the CFC regime. Subsection (1) amends section 245K(1) of the Principal Act. Under the foreign tax credit pro- visions contained in the CFC regime credit is al- lowed for any withholding taxes paid on in- come derived by the CFC. The legislation spe- cifically excludes credit for withholding tax that is actually deducted and accounted for by the CFC on amounts paid by the CFC to other per- sons, i.e. withholding taxes deducted from dividends paid by the CFC. An amendment has been made to remove the words “..but does not include withholding tax paid or payable by that CFC on amounts that are not income derived by that controlled for- eign company”. The words were removed because it could be inferred that, in their absence, credit should be allowed for those withholding taxes and also because they stated the obvious. Subsection 2 amends section 245K(2) of the principal Act to remove the proviso to section 245F(2). The intention of the proviso was to at- tack the practice of foreign tax credit averaging, whereby a CFC could, by diverting income flows from a high tax jurisdiction to a low tax jurisdiction, lower their rate of tax paid to en- sure a full tax credit for all taxes paid was avail- able in New Zealand. If for example the CFC derived all its income from a high tax jurisdiction the tax paid may not have been all fully credited in New Zealand to the extent that the foreign tax paid exceeded the New Zealand tax payable on the attributed foreign income. The proviso attempted to restrict the CFC’s tax credit available in this instance by apportioning the tax credit to the income in respect of which tax has been paid. The problem with the method in which the leg- islation achieved this was that the legislation operated incorrectly to deny the amount of for- eign tax credit available to the CFC in instances when it shouldn’t. For example, if a CFC de- rived income from Hong Kong of $100 and paid tax on that income of $18; and also derived $100 from a jurisdiction that levied no taxes, the formula in the legislation would operate to restrict the foreign tax credit available to $9. This is unduly harsh as clearly foreign tax credit averaging would not have been contemplated or entered into, as the full credit would have been allowable in New Zealand. Also, the provision only focused on foreign tax credit averaging where income was diverted through jurisdictions which impose no tax. Clearly the provision should apply where in- come is diverted through low income tax juris- dictions as well. To remove the anomalies created by the pro- viso, the proviso has been repealed. Subsection 3 amends section 245K(6) of the Principal Act to bring the formula contained in that section into line with an equivalent formula contained in section 293 of the Act. The formula contained in section 245K(6) oper- ates to restrict the credit for withholding taxes to the portion of the distribution which is tax- able. Subsection 4 amends section 245K(10). Section 245K(10) deals with the situation where a per- son, with an interest in a CFC, has been allowed a tax credit against the income tax payable on the attributed foreign income arising in respect of that interest, and the CFC subsequently re- ceives a refund of income tax paid. The amendment ensures both refunds of for- eign and New Zealand taxes paid by the CFC give rise to a reduction of tax credits allowed to be carried forward under the CFC regime or an 8 income tax liability if the refund exceeds the tax credits available to be carried forward or there are no tax credits available. Currently the section only refers to “foreign” in- come tax. The amendment removes the word foreign. Controlled Foreign Companies in Certain Countries Section 13 Introduction This item explains the legislative change made to the Income Tax Act to remove minor drafting errors. Background Section 245P(2) currently refers incorrectly to the “income year” of a “foreign company”. Key Issue A company does not measure its income or loss in relation to an “income year”, but does so in relation to its “accounting period”. Section 245P is concerned specifically with the exemption from the requirement to attribute foreign income or loss where the controlled for- eign company is at all times resident in a coun- try or territory specified in the Fifteenth Sched- ule of the Act. Application Date This Amendment applies from the date of As- sent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Introduction Section 16(1) of the Amendment Act amends section 336N of the principal Act to ensure that this section applies where an employer calculates the FBT on an income year basis. Section 16(2) inserts a definition of the term “shareholder-employee” to ensure that this class of employee can be correctly identified and the correct basis of furnishing an FBT re- turn and paying the tax is applied. Employers of shareholder-employees may elect to pay FBT on an income year basis in relation to those employees. In relation to ordinary em- ployees an employer may elect to furnish a re- turn on an annual basis (1 April to 31 March). A shareholder-employee is defined as a per- son who, in relation to a private company (as defined in section 2 of the Companies Act), is- (a) A shareholder in and an employee of the private company, and includes a share- holder who is deemed to be an employee under section 336N(8)(c). (Section 336N(8) provides for the FBT treat- ment of non-cash dividends. Under that subsection a shareholder is deemed to be an employee for the purposes of subjecting that shareholder to the fringe benefit tax provisions); or (b) Anyone to whom section 6(2) of this Act applies. While not strictly necessary, it makes it clear which employees comprise shareholder-employees. Section 16(3) amends section 336N by adding a new subsection (9). The new subsection 336N(9) covers an employer who- (a) Elects under 336TB to pay FBT on an in- come year basis in respect of shareholder- employees; and (b) Furnishes a return of income for an ac- counting year other than 31 March (i.e., ei- ther an early or a late balance date tax- payer) under section 15 of the Act- any reference to an income year shall, unless Payment of Fringe Benefit Tax on Annual Basis Sections 16 to 25 Application Date Subsection (2) applies with respect to the tax on income derived during the income year com- mencing 1 April 1990, and every subsequent income year. The othar subsections apply from the date of Assent of the Act - 31 March 1991. 9 the context otherwise requires, be a reference to an accounting year. This effectively ensures that references in the legislation to an income year are also references to a person’s account- ing year. It should be noted that this results in 2 sections 336N(9). This will be corrected in a subsequent Act. Section 16(3) also inserts a new subsection 10 which provides a definition of “early balance date” and “late balance date”. An early bal- ance date is any balance date from 1 October to 30 March inclusive. A late balance date is any balance date from 1 April to 30 September inclusive. Application Date Section 16(4) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Value of Fringe Benefit Section 17(1) of the Act amends section 336O(1) to set out 3 methods of determining the fringe benefit value of a motor vehicle un- der the options an employer has for paying FBT. These options are quarterly, annually for employees, and for an income year in the case of shareholder-employees. When paying FBT on a quarterly basis section 336O(1)(a) applies. This is simply the old sec- tion 336O(1) carried forward. When paying FBT on an annual basis accord- ing to section 336TA, or in other words for a year which commences 1 April and ends 31 March, section 336O(1)(b) applies. In this case the employer simply determines the an- nual value of the fringe benefit by applying the quarterly formula provided in paragraph (a) to each of the 4 quarters. When paying FBT on an income year basis ac- cording to section 336TB, i.e. for shareholder- employees and for a year which may be an ac- counting year, section 336O(1)(c) applies. In that case the fringe benefit is calculated over the entire year rather than as a total of 4 quar- ters. This is done through the application of the following formula - Y x Z 365 where - Y is the number of days in the income year reduced by the number of days the motor vehicle is a work related vehicle; and Z is the amount calculated in accordance with the Tenth Schedule that is the value of the benefit to the employee of having the use, or the availability for use, of the mo- tor vehicle for the year. Section 17(2) of the amendment Act amends section 336O of the Act to include income year references as appropriate. Application Date Section 17(3) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Taxable Value of Fringe Benefit Section 18(1) of the amendment Act amends section 336P of the Income Tax Act to insert income year references as appropriate. Section 18(2) proceeds to amend section 336P(1). The original subsection provided that the taxable value of a fringe benefit shall be - (a) The amount of the fringe benefit provided by the employer reduced by any amount paid by the employee for that fringe ben- efit (excluding low interest loans); and (b) In relation to motor vehicles, reduced by 2.5 percent of that amount of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the employee. Section 18(2) replaces the existing subsection (b) with a new paragraph which simply con- tinues the existing legislative policy but adapts it to take into account the introduction of the annual and income year basis for pay- ment of FBT. The new paragraph states that where a motor vehicle is partially owned by both the employer and the employee the tax- able value of the fringe benefit received by the employee is reduced by- (a) Where the employer pays on a quarterly basis, 2.5% of so much of the costs price of the vehicle as is the cost price of the motor vehicle to the employee. 10 (b) Where the employer pays FBT on an an- nual basis, 2.5% of so much of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the employee. This is calculated for each quarter during the year in which the employee owns part of the vehicle. (c) Where the employer pays FBT on an in- come year basis according to section 336TB, 10% of so much of the cost price of the vehicle to the employee. This is subject to newly inserted sections 336P(1A) and 336P(1B), which are explained later. Section 18(3) of the amendment Act inserts new sections 336P(1A) and 336P(1B). Section 336P(1A) provides for the correct cal- culation of the amount of taxable fringe benefit where a employer to whom section 336TB ap- plies accounts for FBT for a period which is shorter than or longer than a normal income year. This subsection applies where the em- ployer is ceasing or commencing business or where the employer is changing balance date (with the Commissioner’s permission). In these cases the taxable value of the fringe benefit of a motor vehicle is reduced by - a x 10 percent 365 where (a) is the number of days in the period that is less or more than a normal income year. This provision simply ensures that an em- ployer is not penalised or rewarded by the ap- plication of section 336P(1) when changing a balance date. It must be noted that this sub- section ties in with subsection 336P(1B), which also may apply. Section 336P(1B) provides for the case where an employee only owns part of the motor ve- hicle for part of an income year or a period. The term “period” has the same meaning as in subsection (1A) of this section. The amount of the reduction of the taxable value of a motor vehicle is reduced by the proportion of the days in the year or the period the employee was not a part owner of the motor vehicle. It is important to note that this provision actu- ally increases the amount of the taxable fringe benefit. It is arguable that this provision should be ex- tended to annual s.336TB and quarterly FBT payers to cover circumstances where a motor vehicle is owned by an employee for only part of a quarter. As the intention of these provi- sions is to simplify the legislation this was not done. Application Date Section 18(4) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Fringe Benefit Tax Imposed Section 19 amends section 336S to provide that the standard quarterly reduction in value for fringe benefits coming within paragraph (e) of the definition of “fringe benefit” applies ap- propriately for an income year basis. The benefits in paragraph (e) are known as “other” fringe benefits. The first change is that the ex- emption for other fringe benefits has been raised from $50 to $75 per quarter, or on an annual basis $300 per year. Subsection (2) repeals the proviso to section 336S(2) and inserts new subsections 336S(3) to 336S(7). The new subsection 336S(3) provides that where an employer provides other fringe benefits to an employee, and the employer is required to pay tax on a quarterly basis, the aggregate value of those other fringe benefits paid to that employee in that quarter shall be reduced by $75. The new subsection 336S(4) provides for simi- lar treatment as subsection (3) for employers who have opted to pay on an annual basis in relation to their employees under section 336TA. Where the employer provides other fringe benefits to an employee, the aggregate amount of other fringe benefits provided is re- duced by $75 for each quarter in the year the employee was provided an other benefit. For example, where an employer provides an other benefit of $50 a quarter for the first 2 quarters of the year, then $500 of other bene- fits in the 3rd quarter, and no other benefits in the final quarter, the following amount of FBT is payable - 11 The new subsection 336S(5) provides for em- ployees who have elected to pay fringe benefit tax on an income year basis in relation to shareholder-employees. Where these employ- ers are provided other benefits the taxable value of other fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees is reduced by $300 ($75 x 4) for the year. Section 336S(6) provides for a correct calcula- tion of the amount of taxable fringe benefit provided where a employer to whom section 336TB applies is required to account for FBT in relation to a period shorter or longer than a complete income year. This can occur where the employer ceases or commences business or where the taxpayer changes balance date. The $300 deduction provided by subsection (5) of this section is replaced by a deduction cal- culated in accordance with the following for- mula: a x $300 365 where (a) is the number of days in the period that is less or more than a normal income year. The new subsection 336S(7) clarifies the legis- lation in relation to two issues. The first is that when the legislation refers to “aggregate tax- able value” it means before the deduction of any exemption provided under this section. The second provides that where the amount of any aggregate taxable value of fringe benefits is less than the reduction available under this section, the fringe benefits provided shall be reduced to nil. Application Date Section 19(3) provides that this section shall apply from 1 April 1992 in the case of employ- ers who pay on the quarterly basis or the an- nual basis in relation to employees under sec- tion 336TA of the Act. It also applies from 1 October 1991 in the case of employers who have elected to pay on an income year basis in relation to shareholder-employees and whose income year commences on or after 1 October 1991. Payment of Fringe Benefit Tax Every Quarter Section 336T of the Income Tax Act provides that 20 days after the expiry of a quarter, an employer shall furnish a fringe benefit tax re- turn for that quarter in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. Section 20 of the amendment Act provides that section 336T does not apply where an em- ployer has elected to pay FBT on an annual basis in respect of employees (section 336TA) or an income year basis for shareholder-em- ployees (section 336TB). Instead, sections 336TA and TB apply. Application Date Section 20(4) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Payment of FBT on Annual Basis in Re- spect of Employees, Shareholder-Em- ployees, and the Imposition of Interest Payment of Fringe Benefit on Annual Basis in Respect of Employees: Section 336TA(1) to (7) sets out the qualifying requirements for an annual basis of payment in relation to employ- ees. It also sets out when returns must be fur- nished and what is required in those returns. Subsection (2) sets out the 2 criteria under which an employer may pay FBT in respect of ordinary employees on an annual basis. These criteria are - (a) Where the employer’s “gross tax deduc- tions” and specified superannuation con- tribution withholding tax deductions in the preceding year did not exceed $100,000. “Gross tax deductions” is defined in sec- tion 353(6) of the Act to be tax deductions payable by the employer under Part XI (ef- fectively the PAYE system) before deduct- ing any Family Support tax credits; or Total BenefitsNumber of QuartersExemptionTaxable Value Provided in Year Benefit Provided $600-(3x$75)=$375 12 (b) The employer was not an employer in the preceding year. Subsection (6) requires that where an em- ployer ceases business and begins a new busi- ness, or operates two or more businesses, the gross tax deduction and specified superannua- tion contribution withholding tax shall be ag- gregated for the purposes of subsection (1), and effectively (2), of this section. Once an employer has determined that he or she is eligible to account for FBT on an annual basis he or she must provide a notice to the Commissioner. Subsection (3) provides that the notice of election must be in writing and state the first year (being a year commencing on the 1st day of April) to which that election applies. It must be furnished to the Commis- sioner not later than - (a) In the case of an employer who was an em- ployer in the preceding year (being from 1 April to 31 March), 30 June in that year in which the election is to first apply; and (b) In the case of an employer who was not an employer in the preceding year (being from 1 April to 31 March), the last day of the quarter that first ends after the day the employer first becomes an employer of employees (other than shareholder-em- ployees). (For example, a sole proprietor who has not employed any person in the last 12 months employs 3 persons on 15 May. The notice of election must be furnished by 30 June.) Section 336TA(4) provides that once a valid election is made, an employer pays FBT on an annual basis in respect of his or her employ- ees. The amount of fringe benefit that must be paid is calculated in relation to the 4 quarters that comprise that year. In effect the employer does not pay FBT in respect of a year, but for the 4 quarters that comprise a year. Section 33TA(5) provides that an employer who has made an election to account for FBT on an annual basis in accordance with this sec- tion is required to furnish a return by 31 May following the end of the year. The employer must set out the fringe benefits received or en- joyed and also the interest imposed under sec- tion 336TC by way of time value of money. The FBT liability and interest is also due on 31 May following the end of the income year. Payment of Fringe Benefit on Annual Basis in Respect of Shareholder-Employees: Sec- tion 336TB(1) to (7) sets out the qualifying re- quirements for an income year basis of pay- ment in relation to shareholder-employees. It also sets out when returns must be furnished and what is required in those returns. A private company (as defined in section 2 of the Companies Act 1955) that is an employer may elect to pay fringe benefit tax on share- holder/employee benefits on an income year basis in respect of the income year in which they first qualify and subsequent income years. Section 336TB(2) sets out 2 criteria un- der which an employer may qualify as an em- ployer who may quantify and pay their fringe benefit tax liability in relation to shareholder employees on an income year basis - (a) Where the employer’s “gross tax deduc- tions” and specified superannuation con- tribution withholding tax deductions in the preceding year did not exceed $100,000. Gross tax deductions is defined in section 353(6) of the Act to be tax deductions pay- able by the employer until Part XI (effec- tively the PAYE system) before deducting any Family Support tax credits; or (b) The employer was not an employer in the preceding year. In effect these criteria are the same as those applying to an employer wishing to qualify as an annual payer under section 3336TA. The real difference arises in that for the purposes of the eligibility test the term “preceding year” has a different meaning. Subsection (7) pro- vides that the term “preceding year” means - (a) In the case of an employer with a standard balance date, the year that ended on 31 March; and (b) In the case of an employer with a late bal- ance date, the year ending 31 March that last ends before the beginning of the em- ployer’s current income year. (For example, an employer has a 30 June balance date. The preceding year would 13 be the year from 1 April to 31 March pre- ceding the 30 June.) (c) In the case of an employer who has an early balance date the term “preceding year” can have two meanings- (i) Where the employer has been an em- ployer in prior years, it is the year commencing on 1 April which occurs before the beginning of the employer’s income year; or (ii)For the purposes of determining whether an early balance date em- ployer meets the new employer test, it is that part of the year which com- mences on 1 April which occurs before the beginning of the employer’s income year and which ends on the day before the commencement of the employer’s income year. Once an employer has determined that he or she is eligible to account for FBT on an income year basis, the employer must provide a no- tice in accordance with section 336TB(3) of the Act. The notice of election must be in writing and state the first income year to which that election applies. It must be furnished to the Commissioner not later than - (a) In the case of an employer who was an em- ployer in the preceding year, the last day of the quarter that first ends after the com- mencement of the income year to which that election applies; or (b) In the case of an employer who was not an employer in the preceding year, the last day of the quarter that first ends after the day the employer first becomes an em- ployer of employees. Section 33TB(5) provides that an employer who has made an election to account for FBT on an income year basis in accordance with this section is required to furnish a return by the terminal tax date for that year. The em- ployer must set out the fringe benefits re- ceived or enjoyed and also the interest im- posed under section 336TC by way of time value of money. The FBT liability and interest is also due on the same terminal tax date. Section 336TB(6) requires that where an em- ployer ceases business and begins a new busi- ness or operates two or more businesses, the gross tax deduction and specified superannua- tion contribution withholding tax shall be ag- gregated for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section. Time Value of Money Interest: The new sec- tion 336TC provides for the payment of inter- est where an employer pays fringe benefit tax on an annual (section 336TA) or income year basis (section 336TB). The section provides for regulations to charge interest. Subsection (2) provides that any interest pay- able shall be - (a) Calculated in accordance to regulations is- sued by the Governor-General by Order in Council; and (b) Be payable at the same time as the FBT to which it relates; and (c) Shall be of the same nature as FBT. Subsection (3) provides for the Governor-Gen- eral to issue an order in council from time to time specifying how the interest may be calcu- lated. Subsection (4) provides that in specifying a method to be used to calculate interest, the regulations shall have regard to - (i)Any period or average period for which the payment of FBT has been deferred when compared with the quarterly basis of paying FBT; and (ii)The annual rate of interest specified un- der section 398A of the Act (provisional tax “use of money” interest provisions); and (iii)The fact that any amount of interest calcu- lated is deductible to the employer. Subsection (4) goes on to provide that the regulations may specify different methods of calculation and the use of different variables if appropriate. Application Date Section 21(2) provides that this section shall apply from 1 April 1992 in the case of employ- 14 ers who pay on the quarterly basis or the an- nual basis under section 336TA of the Act. It also applies from 1 October 1991 in the case of employers to whom section 336TB applies and whose income commences on or after 1 Octo- ber 1991. Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of fringe benefit tax Subsection (1) of this section amends section 336U to ensure that the charging of additional tax commences on the appropriate due dates if payment is not made. Additional tax shall be charged at the expiry of the day specified in - (a) Section 336T(1), where the employer pays fringe benefit tax on a quarterly basis (20 days after the expiry of the quarter); or (b) On the expiry of the relevant 31 May (the due date for furnishing the PAYE reconcili- ation form), where the employer pays on an annual basis; or (c) At the expiry of the relevant terminal tax date in relation to that employer, where the employer pays FBT on an income year basis. Subsection (2) inserts a new subsection 336U(3) which provides that the term “fringe benefit tax” also includes any interest im- posed under section 336TC of the Act. Application Date Section 22(3) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Assessment of fringe benefit tax This section makes two amendments to sec- tion 336V. The first adds the words “or any income year” after the words “quarter” and the second is to add a subsection (4) which provides that the term “fringe benefit tax” in- cludes any interest imposed under section 336TC of this Act. Application Date Section 23(3) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Changes in period for which fringe bene- fit tax payable This section introduces a new section 336VA- Section 336VA(1) provides that where an em- ployer has been paying FBT on an annual ba- sis in accordance with section 336TA of the Act, and the employer no longer meets the criteria of - (a) Gross tax deductions and specified super- annuation contribution withholding tax does not exceed $100,000 in the preceding year; or (b) The employer was not an employer in the preceding year, then the employer is required to furnish and pay FBT on a quarterly basis from the com- mencement of the 1st day of the year. Section 336VA(2) is a similar provision to sub- section (1) to cover shareholder-employees. In this case the employer is required to furnish and pay FBT on a quarterly basis in respect of fringe benefits provided to shareholder em- ployees on of after the first day of the income year of the employer. Section 336VA(3) provides that an employer paying on an income year basis or an annual year basis may at any time elect, by notice in writing to the Commissioner, to pay FBT on a quarterly basis. Where an employer so elects the employer shall furnish returns and pay fringe benefit tax on a quarterly basis. The employer commences to furnish and pay FBT quarterly on or after - (a) In relation to an employer who pays annu- ally, 1 April following the date of election to cease paying annually; or (b) In relation to an employer who pays on an income year basis, the first day of the in- come year which follows the date of the election; or (c) Such other date as may be agreed between the employer and the Commissioner. Subsection (4) of section 336VA covers the po- sition where - 15 (a) An employer transfers from paying FBT on an income year basis to a quarterly basis; and - (b) The date determined in the earlier provi- sions of this section as the date on which the employer should start paying quarterly is not the same day as the first day of a quarter. In that event the employer is required to fur- nish and pay FBT, in accordance with section 336T, as if the period between the date speci- fied in the earlier section and the commence- ment of the next quarter was in fact a quarter. (For example, An employer with a 31 May balance date elects, in accordance with section 336TB, to pay FBT in respect of shareholder- employees on an annual basis. After 2 years the employer elects, on 3 September, to pay FBT on a quarterly basis again. This election will, under paragraph (b) of subsection 3), apply from the following 31 May. As 31 May is not the commencement of a quarter the pe- riod from 1 June to 30 June is required to be treated as a quarter.) Section 14 changes the due date for the pay- ment of non-resident withholding tax deduc- tions from the 14th day of the month following the month of deduction to the 20th day of the month following the month of deduction. Application Date This change applies to non-resident withhold- ing tax payable on or after 1 July 1992. Non- resident withholding tax deductions made dur- ing June 1992 must now be accounted for on the 20th day of July 1992 instead of the 14th. Section 15 amends section 327E of the principal Act, which establishes the due dates for the payment of resident withholding tax, by re- placing all references in that section to the 14th day with references to the 20th day. Application Date The section applies to all deductions of resident withholding tax made on or after 1 July 1992. People who account for resident withholding tax deductions on a monthly basis will now be required to account for resident withholding tax deductions made during July 1992 by 20 Au- gust 1992, instead of 14 August. For people who are required to account for resi- dent withholding tax deductions in two instal- ments, the change will first apply to the Octo- ber instalment. Section 29 changes the due date for furnishing company dividend statements from 31 May fol- lowing the end of the company’s imputation year to the due date for furnishing the com- pany’s income tax return. Application Date This amendment applies to company dividend statements which must be furnished for divi- dends declared in the imputation year com- Various Due Date Changes Sections 14, 15, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 Subsection (5) is similar to subsection (4) but applies to employers of shareholder employ- ees. Where the employer has elected, in ac- cordance with section 336TB, to pay FBT on an annual basis but the first day of the first in- come year to which that election applies is not the first day of a quarter. The employer is re- quired to furnish a return in relation to the quarter as if it where a complete quarter, rather than on ending with the first day of the employer’s income year. Application Date Section 24(2) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. Application of other provisions to fringe benefit tax Section 25(1) simply amends section 336Y to insert the appropriate income year references. Application Date Section 25(2) provides that this section shall come into force on 1 October 1991. 16 mencing 1 April 1991. Company dividend statements that would (apart from this amend- ment) have been required to be furnished by 31 May 1992 must now be furnished by the due date applicable to the company’s 1992 return of income. Section 30 changes the due date for furnishing annual imputation returns from 31 May follow- ing the end of the company’s imputation year to the due date for furnishing the company’s in- come tax return. Application Date This amendment applies to annual imputation returns which must be furnished for the impu- tation year commencing 1 April 1991. The an- nual imputation return for this year that would (apart from this amendment) have been re- quired to be furnished by 31 May 1992 must now be furnished by the due date for the com- pany’s 1992 return of income. Section 31 changes the due date for the pay- ment of further income tax from 31 May follow- ing the end of the company’s imputation year to 20 June following the end of the company’s imputation year. Application Date This amendment applies to payments of further income tax made for the company’s imputation year commencing on 1 April 1991. Section 32 changes the due date for the pay- ment of imputation penalty tax from 31 May following the end of the company’s imputation year to 20 June following the end of the compa- ny’s imputation year. Application Date This amendment applies to payments of impu- tation penalty tax made for company’s imputa- tion year commencing on 1 April 1991. Section 33 changes the due date for accounting for dividend withholding payment deductions to the Department from 14 days following the end of the quarter to 20 days after the end of the quarter. The section also changes the date dividend withholding payments are deemed to have be- come payable to the Department in cases of de- fault; from 14 days after the end of the quarter in which the liability to deduct arose to 20 days after the end of the relevant quarter. Application Date The section applies to all deductions and amounts of dividend withholding payments payable on or after 1 April 1992. For people who are required to account for dividend with- holding payments, the changes will first apply to the dividend withholding payment deduc- tions made during the quarter ended March 1992. These deductions must now be accounted for by 20 April 1992 instead of 14 April. Section 34 changes the due date for furnishing an annual dividend withholding payment ac- count return from 31 May following the end of the company’s imputation year to the due date for furnishing the company’s income tax return. Application Date This amendment applies to annual dividend withholding payment account returns required to be furnished for the imputation year com- mencing 1 April 1991. The annual imputation return for this year that would (apart from this amendment) have been required to be fur- nished by 31 May 1992 will now be furnished on the due date applicable to the company’s 1992 return of income. Section 35 changes the due date for the pay- ment of further dividend withholding payment from 31 May following the end of the com- pany’s imputation year to 20 June following the end of the company’s imputation year. Application Date This amendment applies to further dividend withholding payments made for the company’s imputation year commencing on 1 April 1991. Section 36 changes the due date for the pay- ment of dividend withholding payment penalty tax from 31 May following the end of the com- pany’s imputation year to 20 June following the end of the company’s imputation year. Application Date This amendment applies to payments of divi- dend withholding payments penalty tax made for the company’s imputation year commenc- ing on 1 April 1991. 17 Application Date The amendment applies to tax on income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1990, and in every subsequent year. General Section 28(2) amends paragraph (c) of section 394E(1) of the Act. It ensures that refunds of excess retention tax paid by a company before it becomes an imputation credit account company do not give rise to a debit in the imputation credit account. Section 28(3) amends paragraph (j) of section 394E(1) of the Act to ensure that refunds of any credit under section 156F(4) of the Act in relation to export mar- ket development expenditure or tourist-promotion expenditure incurred by a company during an in- come year prior to the year the company became an imputation credit account company do not give rise to a debit to the imputation credit account. Subsection (5) inserts a paragraph in section 394E(2) of the Act. It provides that the debit arising in the imputation credit account of a company as a result of the refund of any credit under section 156F(4) of the Act shall arise on the date the credit is refunded. Application Date The amendment effected by subsection (2) will ap- ply to a refund of excess retention tax made on or after 1 April 1990. The amendment effected by subsections (3) and (5) are deemed to have come into force on 1 April 1989. Imputation Sections 26 - 28 Group Companies Section 26 amends section 383 of the Income Tax Act, to make section 383 apply for the purposes of the imputation regime. Where a company included in a group of companies allocates provisional tax to another company in the group (as that section al- lows) both companies must adjust their imputation credit accounts. A credit will arise to the ICA of the underpaid company (as that term is defined in sec- tion 383) and a debit will arise to the ICA of the ex- cess company (see sections 27(2) and 28(1) of the Amendment Act). The adjustments are made on the date on which no- tice in writing of the allocation of the tax is given to the Commissioner in accordance with section 383(4). Application Date These amendments apply to tax on income derived in the 1991 and subsequent income years. Section 27 amends section 394D(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act. It makes it clear that where the Commis- sioner issues a joint assessment of income tax under section 191(8) of the Act, the imputation credits that arise from the payment of that tax are to be allocated to the ICA of each company in the group in propor- tion to the amount of tax that would have been as- sessed to each company had separate assessments been made. This is achieved by ensuring an imputation credit arises to the ICA of a company only for tax paid on income derived by that company. Imputation and Refunds of Tax paid on FIF Income Because the introduction of the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime has been deferred, Inland Reve- nue will be reassessing all taxpayers’ returns that include FIF income or losses for the 1988 to 1991 in- come years. A full discussion of the FIF regime deferral is on page 25 of this bulletin. Inland Revenue has recently discovered problems for companies that have paid tax on FIF income and subsequently allocated that tax as imputation credits attached to dividends. The problem is caused by the operation of section 394M(l) of the Act, which will not allow a refund of tax paid by an Imputation Credit Account (ICA) company to exceed the credit balance in the com- pany’s ICA (This is to prevent an ICA company from receiving a refund of tax that has been allo- cated as imputation credits attached to dividends that it has paid). ICA companies may therefore not receive a full refund of tax paid on FIF income.

This accounting basis is called the hybrid basis and is a combination of the invoice and payments bases. Output tax will be accounted for on an invoice basis and input tax on a payments basis. Background The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended in its report that the GST Act should be amended to allow registered persons to adopt the hybrid basis of calculating their GST liability. This basis of accounting will as- sist registered persons who currently do not meet the payments basis criteria but incur sig- nificant compliance costs in accounting for GST on the invoice basis. A registered person who accounts for GST on the invoice basis must maintain a creditors ledger in order to calculate that person’s input tax. The hybrid basis will alleviate the need for a creditors ledger to be maintained. This method of accounting for GST has been adopted by many registered persons without any legal authority. The amendment regulates this practice. Key Issues Accounting basis The amendment repeals the current section which deals with basis of accounting for GST and substitutes four new sections which operate as follows: • Section 19 provides that a registered person must account for GST on the invoice basis unless application in writing is made to ac- count for GST on either the payments or hybrid basis. This provision also sets out when the new basis of accounting is to take effect from. • Section 19A sets out the criteria for the adoption of the payments basis of account- ing. The criteria have not changed. • Section 19B deals with changes in account- ing bases. In particular it provides for cer- tain information to be furnished in calculat- ing the tax payable in respect of the change in the accounting basis. The provision also sets out when a list of creditors and/or debt- ors must be prepared. • Section 19C sets out the adjustments that must be made when a registered person changes accounting bases. The effect of the adjustment is to ensure that all output and input tax in previous taxable periods is ac- counted for on the basis of the new account- ing basis as at the date of the changeover. This adjustment may result in either further GST being payable or a refund. Appendix B outlines the adjustments that must be made when a registered person changes to or from the hybrid basis. The adjustments made in respect of changes between the in- voice and payments basis have not changed. Application must be made to adopt Hybrid Basis All registered persons who wish to adopt the hybrid basis of accounting must make written application to Inland Revenue. Persons using hybrid basis prior to enactment If a registered person has been operating the hybrid basis of accounting prior to the enact- ment of this amendment, that person must make application in writing to the Commis- sioner to adopt that basis. In addition, that per- son will need to exercise care in making the ad- justment required on the changeover, if an ad- justment needs to be made. The adjustment will only reflect taxable supplies received (input tax) that have been accounted for on the invoice basis for which payment is still outstanding at the date of the formal changeover. See Appen- dix B for details as to which particular supplies are subject to the adjustment. Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1991 Hybrid Basis of Accounting for GST Sections 2(1), (4) and (5), 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 19 Calculation of tax payable Section 20 of the GST Act (which deals with the calculation of tax payable) is also amended to reflect the hybrid basis of accounting. This is a key provision as it provides the mechanism for the hybrid basis to work. The mechanism is that output tax is accounted for on the invoice basis while input tax is accounted for on the payment basis. Appendix B illustrates the cal- culation of tax payable under the hybrid ac- counting basis. Consequential amendments to the rate change provisions A number of consequential amendments have been made to section 78B and section 78C of the GST Act, which deal with a GST rate change. Section 78B, which requires an adjustment to be made by a registered person who accounts for GST on a payments basis following a rate change, has been amended. The provision has been expanded to include persons who account for GST on the hybrid basis. The adjustment re- quired under this provision will only apply in respect of taxable supplies received (input tax). The amendments to this section will only apply in the event of a further rate change. Section 78C deals with changes in the account- ing basis coinciding with or occurring after a change in the rate of tax. The amendment en- sures that a direction to change accounting basis which coincides with a rate change applies in respect of the hybrid basis of accounting. This amendment will only apply in the event of a further rate change. Where a registered person changes their ac- counting basis subsequent to a rate change, sec- tion 78C also imposes a number of rules for any adjustment made in terms of the new section 19C and the calculation of input and output tax. The amendment ensures that these rules apply to the hybrid basis of accounting. This provi- sion will apply in respect of any change in ac- counting basis where pre GST rate change sup- plies are included in any adjustment made un- der section 19C. Other consequential amendments A number of other consequential amendments are made to the GST Act. These amendments correct cross-references as a result of the repeal of section 19 and substitution of section 19 to 19C. Application date These amendments to implement the hybrid basis of accounting came into force on 1 April 1991. Accordingly, registered persons are en- titled to make application to the Commissioner from that date to adopt the hybrid basis of ac- counting. Office of Parliament Section 2(2), (3) and (6) Introduction This amendment ensures that an Office of Par- liament such as the Ombudsman is treated in the same manner for GST purposes as a public authority. It has always been the intention that such instruments of Parliament should be sub- ject to GST. Background A public authority (such as a government de- partment) is deemed to supply goods and serv- ices in relation to an appropriation of public money by the Crown. The previous definition of a public authority did not include an Office of Parliament. An Office of Parliament is not an instrument of the Government, but an instru- ment of Parliament. Key Issues The amendment defines what an Office of Par- liament is for the purposes of the GST Act. This new term is in turn included in the definition of public authority. This ensures that Offices of Parliament are subject to GST in the same way as public authorities. An Office of Parliament is defined as being the administrative and support services and staff of: • The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment; • The Wanganui Computer Centre Privacy Commissioner; • The Ombudsman; and 20 • The Controller and Auditor-General. The administrative function of an Office of Par- liament is a public authority and therefore is carrying on a taxable activity. The appropria- tion of public money for that function is deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services. As a result of this interac- tion, the amendment ensures appropriations of public money in respect of the administrative and support services and staff of the above mentioned offices are subject to GST. An appropriation of public money in respect of the employment or engagement of (say) the Controller and Auditor-General is not subject to GST under this amendment. The GST Act ex- plicitly excludes the Controller and Auditor- General, the Ombudsman, Commissioner for the Environment, and Privacy Commissioner from carrying on a taxable activity. Application date This amendment applies from 1 July 1991, be- ing the commencement of the new fiscal year. Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1991 Power of Taxation Review Authority to Award Costs Section 3 On a number of occasions The Taxation Review Authority has expressed the wish that it should have power to award costs in its own favour in appropriate circumstances. Circumstances such as the failure to appear at fixtures allocated for the hearing of objections, the giving of inadequate notice of the abandon- ment or settlement of objections, and the mak- ing of frivolous or vexatious objections have been of particular concern to The Authority. Primarily this concern arises because such abuses operate to deny The Authority the abil- ity to deal expeditiously with other matters. The abuses also result in significant and largely avoidable costs to The Authority. Section 3 of The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1991 inserts a section 39A in the Principal Act. The amendment permits the Authority, if it considers it proper to do so, to order either the Commissioner or the Objector to pay to the Crown such sum in respect of the costs of the Authority as it considers reasonable. A right of appeal against an order of costs is provided. An order of costs made under this provision is enforceable and recoverable as a fi- nal judgement in the District Court. This provision applies from the date of assent of the Act - 31 March 1991. Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1991 Definition of Term ìPublic Authorityî Section 2 The definition of the term “public authority” in section 2 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 is amended to correct a drafting error in a consequential amendment made in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No.2) 1988. The amendment ensures that the stamp duty exemption enjoyed by public authorities (e.g. State Owned Enterprises) is confined to prop- erty held by public authorities on behalf of the Crown. This provision applies from the date of assent of the Act - 31 March 1991. 21 Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 Amendments Resulting from the Abolition of Family Benefit Sections 2(1) and (3), 3, 4, and 5 Introduction The abolition of family benefit has necessitated a number of consequential changes to the In- come Tax Act 1976 in relation to: • the definition of “income-tested benefit” to remove the reference to family benefit; and • the rebates where eligibility depends upon the payment of family benefit in respect of a child. The changes to the family support and guaran- teed family minimum income tax credit regimes as a result of the abolition of family benefit are discussed on pages 27 - 30 of this TIB. Background A number of provisions in the Income Tax Act make reference to the payment of family benefit in respect of a child as criteria for determining whether a taxpayer is eligible to a rebate. With the abolition of family benefit is necessary to remove such references and provide an alterna- tive criteria where necessary. Key issues Definition of “income-tested benefit” The definition of the term “income-tested bene- fit” has been amended to remove reference to an emergency benefit similar to family benefit. This amendment also removes the reference to grants payable under the Tertiary Assistance Grants Regulations 1982, which was repealed in 1988. Rebate in certain cases for children Section 50A entitled a child to whom family benefit was payable a rebate in respect of cer- tain income derived. The reference to family benefit has been removed from the criteria for determining the eligibility of the rebate. To ensure that eligibility for the rebate is consis- tent with previous basis, the criteria for the re- bate has been changed. Family benefit was payable in respect of a child to the end of the calender year in which that child turned 18 where the child was still attending school. Ac- cordingly, the criteria has amended to reflect this. Transitional tax allowance Section 50C provides a rebate to a full-time earner whose assessable income is below a cer- tain threshold. The provision has amended to remove the references to family benefit where appropriate. In particular, the following changes have been made: • the definition of family benefit has been re- pealed; • the definition of qualifying person has been amended to exclude from that definition a child under the age of 18 who is still attend- ing school; • item “z” of the formula for calculating the amount of allowance has been amended by removing the reference to weeks in which neither the taxpayer nor the taxpayer’s spouse (if any) where receiving family bene- fit; and • the repeal of the proviso which dealt with cessation of family benefit. A taxpayer’s entitlement to this rebate will not change as a result of these amendments. Rebate in certain cases for housekeeper Section 54 allows a taxpayer to claim a rebate in respect of certain payments made to a “house- keeper”. The definition of child has been amended to remove the reference to whom 22 family benefit is payable. The rebate will now be allowed in respect of a child under the age of 18 or who is suffering from any mental or physical infirmity or disability. Living Alone Payments Section 2(2) And (4) Introduction This amendment corrects a drafting oversight in respect of the definition of the term “salary and wages”. Background A living alone payment is an additional amount paid to unmarried person who either receives guaranteed retirement income (GRI) or a vet- eran’s pension. This amount is a supplemen- tary payment to GRI which is treated as being salary and wages for PAYE purposes. Due to a drafting oversight, living alone payments were not included in the definition of “salary and wages”. Key Issues This amendment corrects this drafting oversight to ensure that living alone payment are treated as being salary and wages and therefore subject to PAYE deductions. Application date This amendment applies with respect to the in- come year commencing on 1 April 1990 to coin- cide with the income year in which living alone payments first become payable. Introduction The amendment to the Guaranteed Retirement Income Earners’ Surcharge regime corrects a drafting oversight to ensure that the taxpayer does not pay surcharge in excess of their net guaranteed retirement income. Background With the advent of the new superannuation and life insurance tax regimes, the determination of “other income” for the purposes of the GRI sur- charge regime was amended. “Other income” was amended to include one-half of any pen- sion or annuity received from a superannuation fund or a life insurance fund where that pen- sion or annuity is exempt for tax purposes. However, the definition of “net guaranteed re- tirement income” was not consequentially amended to ensure that this income was ex- cluded from the calculation of this amount. Guaranteed Retirement Income Earner Surcharge Section 12 Key issues The definition of “net guaranteed retirement in- come” has been amended to exclude such pen- sions or annuities from the calculation of this amount. A person’s “net guaranteed retirement income” is the gross GRI less the tax applicable to that income as if it were the last income earned and taxed accordingly. This amend- ment ensures GRI earners who receive such pensions or annuities do not pay surcharge in excess of their “net guaranteed retirement in- come”. Application date This amendment applies with respect to the in- come year commencing on 1 April 1990, to co- incide with the application date of the amend- ment to include such pensions and annuities in the determination of “other income”. Application date These amendments apply with respect to the income year commencing on 1 April 1991. 23 Basic Tax Deductions Section 29 Introduction This amendment replaces the weekly PAYE ta- bles in the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act. Background The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended that the steps in the PAYE tax tables be amended from 20 cents to $1 steps. The purpose of this was to reduce the size of the tax tables and make them easier to use. Key issues The basic weekly tax deductions table specified in Appendix A of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act has been amended by remov- ing the 20 cent steps and replacing them with $1 steps. Application date The new PAYE tables apply with respect to tax deductions made from payments of salary and wages paid on or after 1 April 1991. Life Insurance Taxation Regime Sections 7, 8, 26 and 30 Introduction A number of provisions which amend the Life Insurance taxation regime contained in the In- come Tax Act 1976 (“the Principal Act”) are in- corporated into the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 (“the Amendment Act”). For a full explanation of the Life Insurance taxation regime itself, please refer to Appendix C of TIB Volume Two, Number 3 issued in October 1990. Non Resident Life Insurers issuing policies in New Zealand Section 7 of the Amendment Act amends sec- tion 204L of the Principal Act. This section deals with non resident life insurers who issue policies in New Zealand. The amendment rede- fines a nonresident life insurer’s New Zealand policy income to ensure that it includes both in- vestment income and underwriting income de- rived from policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. This income will be subject to the life insurance taxation regime, whilst any other income de- rived by the life insurer’s overseas business will be taxed under the “ordinary” provisions of the Principal Act. Separation of Superannuation Business Section 8 of the Amendment Act amends sec- tion 206 of the Principal Act, which relates to the separation of a life insurer’s superannuation business from its other activities. Extension of due date for 1991 tax year applica- tions Firstly, in consideration of the timing of the amendments, section 8(1) of the Amendment Act allows the separation to be backdated to the beginning of the life insurer’s 1991 income year if the life insurer makes application to the Gov- ernment Actuary for approval of the arrange- ments on or before the later of 30 June 1991 or the life insurer’s balance date. This represents an extension from the original deadline of the later of 31 March 1991 or balance date. Should the life insurer wish to delay the appli- cation for approval of the transfer arrange- ments, the final date for applications remains unchanged at 1January 1992, and the effective date of the transfer is also unchanged as the first day of the income year in which the trans- fer actually takes place. Transfer of financial arrangements Section 8(2) of the Amendment Act substitutes a new section 206(3) into the Principal Act. This provision deals with the transfer of financial ar- rangements from a life insurer to the trustee of a superannuation fund pursuant to an arrange- 24 ment approved by the Government Actuary. It should be noted that this provision deals only with financial arrangements which are subject to the “accruals rules” contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Principal Act. The new section 206(3) of the Principal Act pro- vides that the effective date for the transfer of financial arrangements will be the same as for other assets, namely the beginning of an in- come year. The value at which the transfer takes place is (at the option of the life insurer) either the market value as at the beginning of the income year or an adjusted base price as at that date. The only exception to this is for financial ar- rangements which were acquired by the life in- surer after the beginning of that income year, and the effective date for the transfer of these arrangements is the date upon which the life in- surer acquired them, and they are deemed to be transferred at the acquisition price incurred by the life insurer. All income derived and expenditure incurred during the period from the effective date of the transfer to the actual date of the transfer is deemed to be derived or incurred by the life in- surer as agent for the trustee of the superannua- tion scheme. Transfer of superannuation liabilities A new section 206(6A) is inserted into the Prin- cipal Act by section 8(3) of the Amendment Act. This provides the rules for the transfer of the superannuation liabilities from the life insurer to the trustee of the superannuation scheme pursuant to a transfer arrangement approved by the Government Actuary. Subsection 6A deems the trustee of the superan- nuation scheme to be liable to provide the su- perannuation benefits rather than the life in- surer, and all amounts relating to the liabilites are transferred to the trustee of the superannua- tion scheme as from the beginning of an income year. In addition, there are provisions to en- sure that the actuarial reserves of the life insurer do not include any amounts relating to the superannuation liabilities, even if the liabilities at the end of the previous year did include amounts relating to the superannuation poli- cies. For the period from the effective date of transfer until the actual date of transfer, there is a deemed life reinsurance policy between the life insurer and the trustee of the superannuation scheme to ensure that the underwriting income relating to the life insurance element inherent in the superannuation policies is taken into ac- count. This contract is treated as if a premium has been paid by the trustee of the superannua- tion scheme and received by the life insurer and as if it were entered into on an arm’s length ba- sis by the life insurer and trustee of the super- annuation scheme. The life insurer’s actuarial reserves are deemed to include amounts relat- ing to this reinsurance policy. Tax rate for superannuation business Section 8(4) of the Amendment Act inserts a provision to clarify the taxation rate applying to superannuation schemes which receive super- annuation assets and liabilities from a life in- surer pursuant to an arrangement approved by the Government Actuary. This provision con- firms that, for the period before 1 April 1990, the income relating to the transferred assets is taxed at the same rate as would have applied to the life insurer in respect of that income. As at 1 April 1990 the tax rate for all superannuation business was set at 33 cents. Non-standard balance dates In addition, section 8(4) of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 206(10) which is a stan- dard provision ensuring that section 206 of the Principal Act applies with appropriate modifi- cations to allow for taxpayers with nonstandard balance dates. Credits arising to policyholder credit ac- count of other person Section 26 of the Amendment Act amends sec- tion 394ZZZG(6) of the Principal Act. This amendment makes it clear that a life insurer which is not a New Zealand resident company obtains a credit to its policyholder credit ac- count for tax paid on its net underwriting in- come as well as its net investment income. Transitional provision Section 30 of the Amendment Act makes a mi- nor amendment to correct a drafting error and ensures that an election by a life insurer to be- come a policyholder credit account person is retrospective to the life insurer’s early 1991 in- come year in line with the implementation of the life insurance tax regime itself. 25 Transitional Provisions - Attributed Foreign Income and Losses and Foreign Investment Fund Income and Losses Section 9 Introduction This item explains the legislative changes made to the Income Tax Act to extend the transitional provisions relating to the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime, and defer the applica- tion of the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) re- gime. Background Section 245Y of the Income Tax Act provided that if a controlled foreign company was resi- dent at all times during the period commencing 1 April 1988, (or the date of the acquisition of the interest if the interest was acquired after 1 April 1988), and ending on 31 March 1990 (or the date of disposition of the interest if the inter- est was disposed of before 31 March 1990), in a country or territory not listed on the Seven- teenth Schedule to the Act, any person who holds an income interest in that CFC is not re- quired to calculate attributed foreign income or attributed foreign loss until 1 April 1990. The application date of the FIF regime was 1 April 1988 unless a fund is resident in a country or territory not listed on the Seventeenth Sched- ule to the Act. Any person with a interest in a fund resident in a non-seventeenth schedule country was not required to calculate any FIF income or loss until 1 April 1989. Key Issues An amendment is made to section 245Y of the Act to extend the period to which the transi- tional provisions, in relation to the CFC regime, will apply. Prior to this amendment these pro- visions were due to expire on 31 March 1990. They will now apply until 31 March 1991. In effect, this amendment defers the applica- tion date of the regime in relation to persons holding income interests in CFCs resident in non-seventeenth schedule countries. Note that the application date has not changed in relation to interests held in CFCs resident in a country listed on the seventeenth schedule. In comparison, application of the FIF regime has been deferred until 1 April 1991. However where a person acquired an interest in a FIF on or after 6 March 1991 (the date of the announce- ment of the deferral of the regime), special pro- vision has been made to ensure that the FIF re- gime has application, in relation to that interest only, from the date of acquisition. The inten- tion of the inclusion of this provision is to en- sure that persons who acquire an interest in a FIF after 6 March 1991 and subsequently dis- pose of that interest before 31 March 1991 will be subject to the FIF regime; thus it is anti- avoidance in nature. This provision does not apply to any interest ac- quired by virtue of any rights attached to an in- terest held in a FIF before 6 March 1991. For example, any bonus issues received after 6 March 1991 in respect of an interest acquired before 6 March 1991 will not be subject to the special provision. This situation also applies where the receipt of an interest in a FIF is in re- spect of the exercising of an option. In addition, the provision does not apply where the relevant interest was acquired through the operation of law. This will include instances where an interest has been be- queathed to a person by way of a will, and where mortgagees in possession or receivers obtain an FIF interest. Section 245Y(4) is amended, with the effect that companies with late balance dates will be able to return the attributed foreign income derived from 1 April 1991 to their 1991 balance date, in the 1992 return of income. An amendment with similar effect has been made with respect to the FIF regime. In estimating provisional tax for the income year commencing on 1 April 1991, a person is not required to take into account any FIF in- come for that year. Persons may however take anticipated FIF losses into account if they wish. Tax payable in relation to any FIF income will not be taken into account when calculating any underestimation penalty charged under section 384, additional tax charged under section 398, and any interest payable in terms of section 398A. Refunds of tax arising as a result of the new ap- plication date of the FIF regime will not gener- ally qualify for interest on tax overpaid. How- ever, where a person who is entitled to receive interest on tax overpaid under section 413A, receives a refund of tax previously paid on FIF income, that person will be entitled to receive interest in relation to the amount of tax re- funded. 26 International Tax Regime Recent Disclosure Exemptions Issued by the Commissioner (This is not part of the No. 2 Amendment Act, but it relates directly to the previous article.) Introduction Under the International Tax regime, taxpayers must disclose interests held at any time during an income year (e.g. by way of shares or units) in a foreign company or foreign investment fund. S.245W requires this disclosure, which must be made by completing Part A of the form IR 4G or form IR 4H, as appropriate. Three disclosure exemptions have recently been made under s.245W(2), resulting from the amendments outlined in page 25 of this TIB. The exemptions relate to each of the income years commencing 1 April 1988, 1 April 1989 and 1 April 1990 and are reproduced in Appen- dix A to this TIB. They have the effect of cancel- ling and replacing the two exemptions made on 8 February 1989 and 26 November 1990. Scope of Exemptions Broadly, all three exemptions remove the re- quirement to disclose the following categories of interests, for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 income years: 1. an interest held in a foreign investment fund; 2. an interest held in a foreign company which is not an “income interest of 10% or greater”; 3. an interest held in a foreign company resi- dent at all times, in a country or territory not listed in the schedule of Low Tax Juris- dictions contained in the Seventeenth Sched- ule to the Act, provided that: (i) an election has not been made under s.245Y(2); and (ii)(for the 1990 and 1991 income years only) an “income interest of 10% or greater” is not held in any underlying foreign company to which the exemp- tion does not otherwise apply. Explanation & Examples Income Interest of 10% or Greater (Categories 2 & 3(ii)) When determining whether or not an interest in a foreign company is an “income interest of 10% or greater”, the following interests must be taken into account: • income interests held directly in that foreign company and indirectly through any inter- posed foreign company; • income interests held by associated persons (not being CFCs), as defined by s.245B. Example The disclosure exemptions would not apply to an income interest held in a Cayman Islands company by a husband and wife (associated under s.245B(d)) of 5% each as: (i) their combined income interest is 10%, be- ing an “income interest of 10% or greater”; and (ii) Cayman Islands is listed on the Seventeenth Schedule. Categories 1 & 2 Mr. A held 1,000 shares in Hong Kong based Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd during the years ended 31 March 1989, 1990 and 1991. This interest would not be required to be dis- closed as an interest in a foreign investment fund (on Part A of form IR 4H), as category 1 (outlined above) applies to each of those years. This interest would also not be required to be disclosed as an interest in a foreign company (on Part A of form IR 4G), as category 2 (out- lined above) applies to each of those years. Category 3(i) NZ Ltd held a 30% shareholding in K Ltd, a Dutch company. NZ Ltd also held a 15% share 27 holding in S Ltd, a Spanish CFC in relation to which an election has been made under section 245Y(2) (to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1988). The interests held by NZ Ltd in both K Ltd and S Ltd are precluded from the scope of the dis- closure exemptions by category 3(i) (outlined above). The interests in both companies are therefore required to be disclosed on Part A of separate IR 4G forms. (Part B of the IR 4G form must also be com- pleted by NZ Ltd to attribute income in relation to the interest held in S Ltd. This would also apply to the interest held in K Ltd if that com- pany is a CFC, as an income interest of 10% or greater was held). Category 3(ii) This category applies for the 1990 and 1991 in- come years only, in instances where there is a chain of foreign companies. It ensures that the disclosure exemption will not apply to an inter- est held in any foreign company interposed be- tween the taxpayer and any underlying foreign company which is not exempted from the re- quirement to disclose. Example NZ Ltd held at all times during the 1990 income year a 50% income interest in B Ltd, resident in Australia. At all times B Ltd held a 50% income interest in HK Ltd (resident in Hong Kong). NZ Ltd has not made an election under s.245Y(2). The exemption does not apply to the interest held by NZ Ltd in HK Ltd, as: (i) the interest is an income interest of 25% (50% x 50%), being an “income interest of 10% or greater”; and (ii)Hong Kong is listed on the Seventeenth Schedule. Therefore NZ Ltd would have to complete Part A of the form IR 4G in relation to its 25% inter- est in HK Ltd. (NZ Ltd would also have to com- plete Part B of that form to attribute income from HK Ltd, as that interest is an income in- terest of 10% or greater.) As the exemption does not apply to the interest held by NZ Ltd in the underlying company HK Ltd, the exemption would not operate to pre- clude disclosure of the interest held by NZ Ltd in B Ltd. Therefore, NZ Ltd would also have to complete Part A of a separate form IR 4G in relation to its 50% interest held in B Ltd. Summary For the 1989, 1990 and 1991 income years, an interest held in a foreign investment fund will not be required to be disclosed. An interest held in a foreign company will not generally be required to be disclosed for those years, where that interest is not an “income in- terest of 10% or greater”, or where there is no requirement to attribute foreign income or loss under the CFC regime in relation to that and any underlying foreign company. Amendments to the Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Tax Credits Schemes Sections 13 to 20 Introduction These amendments make further changes to the family support and guaranteed minimum fam- ily (GMFI) tax credits schemes following the abolition of family benefit. Further, these amendments also streamline the methods of delivery of interim payments of family support and GMFI tax credits. Background The family support and GMFI tax credits schemes were dependent upon the payment of family benefit in respect of a child to determine whether a family was eligible to such tax cred- its. With the abolition of family benefit it is nec- essary to devise new rules for determining whether or not a family is entitled to receive family support and GMFI tax credits. 28 In its 1990 Budget, the Government announced that from 1 April 1990 the family support and GMFI schemes would be no longer admini- stered by the Inland Revenue Department. However, the new Government decided that the Department should continue to administer these schemes for the 1992 income year. As a result of this decision, it was further decided that the delivery methods should be stream- lined. The streamlining of the delivery method reflects the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommendation that family sup- port and GMFI tax credits should be paid by one agency. Key issues Family support tax credits increased: Section 14(3) The maximum amount of family support tax credit payable in respect of a child has been in- creased by $6 a week. This increase ensures that the level of assistance to low income earn- ers is maintained following the abolition of fam- ily benefit. The maximum annual entitlements of family support are increased to $2184 ($42 per week) for first the first child and those children aged 16, 17, or 18. For each subsequent child the maximum annual entitlement is increased to $1144 ($22 per week). The maximum amount of the GMFI tax credit has not been increased. Criteria for determining eligibility: Section 13(2), (3), & (4), Section 15(1) With the abolition of family benefit as the crite- ria for determining the eligibility of family sup- port and GMFI tax credits, it has been neces- sary to devise a new criteria. The new criteria is based on the concept of a person having the pri- mary responsibility for the day to day care of a child who is financially dependent upon that person. To reflect this concept, the following amend- ments have been made: • A “qualifying person” for the purposes of both tax credit schemes is a person who: (a) Is aged 16 years or over; and (b) Is a principal caregiver of one or more dependent children; and (c) Either has been both resident and pres- ent in New Zealand for a continuous pe- riod of 12 months at any time, or each dependent child is both resident and present in New Zealand. • A “qualifying person” does not include a person who receives: (a) War widows mother’s allowance for family support purposes; and (b) An income-tested benefit, a specified war pension, or a war widows mother’s pension for GMFI purposes. • A “principal caregiver” is the person who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, has the primary responsibility for the day to day care of a dependent child other than on a temporary basis. The “principal caregiver” need not be a parent of the dependent child. Explicitly excluded from being a “principal caregiver” is: (a) Any unincorporated or corporate body of persons; (b) Any person who is a proprietor of or an employee in a home, institution or resi- dence in which the child is cared for. For example, the proprietor of a residence established under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 is not a “principal caregiver” for the pur- poses of these tax credit schemes. • A “child” is any unmarried person under the age of 18. A person aged 16 or 17 years who is financially independent is excluded from being a “child”. See also Key Issue - 18 year old attending school. • A “dependent child” is one: (a) Who is being cared for by the person claiming the credit (qualifying person); and (b) Who is being maintained as a member of the person’s family; and (c) Who is financially dependent on the per- son; and 29 (d) Who is not in receipt of payments under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989. • A “financially independent” person is one: (a) Who is in “full employment”. A person is in “full employment” if that person is employed under a contract of service or an apprenticeship for at least 30 hours a week on average, self-employed in a business for at least 30 hours a week on average, or is employed under a con- tract or award which is regarded as full- time employment; or (b) Who receives a grant under the Student Allowances Regulations 1988; or (c) Who receives payments under a Gov- ernment-assisted scheme which the De- partment of Social Welfare consider analogous to a social security benefit; or (d) Who receives a social security benefit. • A “resident” is a person who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand. A person who is unlawfully resident in New Zealand or law- fully resident by virtue of (say) a visitor’s permit is excluded as being a resident. The interaction of these terms ensures that fam- ily support and GMFI tax credits are paid to the principal caregiver in respect of a dependent child. Commencement and cessation of tax credits: Section 14(2) & (4), Section 15(3) & (4), Sec- tion 16(3) & (4) Eligibility to receive family support and GMFI tax credits commences or ceases when a person either commences or ceases to be the principal caregiver of a dependent child. Alternatively, a person ceases to be eligible for such credits where the child ceases to be a dependent child. A person who has been issued a certificate of entitlement is required to notify the Commis- sioner on ceasing to be the principal caregiver. This applies where a person or their spouse ceases to be the principal caregiver of a depend- ent child and does not expect to resume that role of principal caregiver for a period of more than 56 consecutive days. Shared custody: Section 14(5) Where the parents of a dependent child are liv- ing apart, the eligibility for each parent to re- ceive family support tax credits is dependent upon each parent having exclusive care of the child for at least 4 weeks out of every 12 weeks. Where a parent has at least 4 weeks exclusive care of the child, the tax credit is apportioned on the basis of the time that the child spends with that parent over the eligible period. As this provision provides that both parents are qualifying persons, each parent is eligible for GMFI tax credits over the eligible period. Both spouses principal caregivers: Section 14(5), Section 15(5) Where both spouses are principal caregivers in respect of different dependent children, the Commissioner has the power to determine which spouse is the principal caregiver of all the children. 18 year olds attending school: Section 14(1), section 15(2) Family benefit continued to be paid in respect of child who had attained the age of 18 years and continued to attend school or a tertiary educational establishment. Family benefit was paid to the end of the calendar year in which the child attained 18 years. The family support and GMFI tax credits re- gimes have been amended to allow tax credits to be paid in respect of such dependent chil- dren. The payment of such tax credits is left to the discretion of the Commissioner. The eligi- bility to such tax credits ceases no later that the pay day after 31 December of the year in which the child attains 18 years. The eligibility may cease earlier if the child leaves school part way through the academic year. Streamlining the delivery of credits: Section 16(1), (2), & (5), Section 17, Section 18, Sec- tion 19, Section 20 From 1 April 1991 the interim methods of deliv- ery of family support and GMFI tax credits have been rationalised. Employers have been relieved of the burden of paying these credits through the PAYE system. Further, family support and GMFI tax credits will not be able to 30 be credited as a provisional tax payment. The legislation that provided for the delivery of fam- ily support and GMFI tax credits through the PAYE and provisional tax systems has been re- pealed. A number of provisions which have application in the current income year in re- spect of those methods of delivery have not been repealed. Interim payments by Social Welfare If a family wishes to receive family support and GMFI tax credits by way of interim instalments, that family will need to apply for entitlement to the Inland Revenue Department. Once the enti- tlement has been determined, the information is transferred to the Department of Social Wel- fare for payment to commence. The Commis- sioner still has the ability to make payment where the Department of Social Welfare fails to make payment. Such families will still be required to furnish a return of income at the end of the income year, to enable their actual entitlement to be deter- mined. Beneficiaries will continue to deal direct with the Department of Social Welfare in respect of their entitlements to family support. End of year payment If a family wishes to receive family support and GMFI tax credits as an end-of-year payment, there is no need to furnish an application for entitlement. A claim for family support and GMFI tax credits is made with the annual re- turn of income. Consequential amendment: Section 13(1) The definition of Director-General has also be amended to reflect that the Director-General is the chief executive of the Department of Social Welfare appointed under the State Sector Act 1988. Application date: Sections 13(5), 14(7), 15(7), 16(7), (3), 18(3), 19(2) and 20(3) These amendments apply with respect to the income year commencing 1 April 1991. Provisional Tax Non-Charging of Small Penalties - Section 27 Section 27 inserts a new section 411A into the Act, which will require the Commissioner not to charge small amounts of additional tax where the amount calculated is $5 or less. At present there is no threshold for charging addi- tional tax which results in very small amounts being charged. This amendment will ensure a more cost effective regime by not charging pen- alties on small overdue amounts below the $5 threshold. The amendment also makes provi- sion for future adjustments to the non-charging threshold by way of Order in Council. Interest on Provisional Tax Overpaid - Section 28 Section 28 amends section 413A of the Act to cater for the position of persons who, having paid tax in the belief that they were provisional taxpayers, subsequently turn out not to be pro- visional taxpayers. The amendment allows in- terest to be paid on amounts paid by such per- Provisional Tax Uplifts - Sections 21, 22, 23 and 24 These sections amend Part XII of the Act. Pro- visional taxpayers who have furnished a return of income for an income year can now base their provisional tax payments on 105% of the residual income tax for the previous year, in- stead of 110% as presently provided. This amendment applies to provisional tax pay- ments due on or after 7 July 1991 in relation to provisional tax payable for the 1992 and subse- quent income years. Where a taxpayer has not furnished a return of income for the previous year, provisional tax payments are now to be based on 110% of the residual income tax for the year before that pre- vious year. Any underestimation penalty in- curred by a taxpayer who has made a high vol- untary estimate will not be charged a penalty greater than one based on the new uplift factor. 31 sons as if it were in fact provisional tax. Tax- payers will need to have paid provisional tax with the expectation of being a provisional tax- payer in order to qualify for an interest pay- ment. Subclause (4) effectively applies the amendment (which relates to the 1991/92 and subsequent income years) to the income years commencing on 1 April 1988, 1989 and 1990. Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 Zero-Rating of Intellectual Property Rights Section 2 Introduction This amendment ensures that services sup- plied, in respect of intellectual property rights, for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time services are performed, are zero-rated. Zero-rating applies regardless of whether or not the rights are for use in New Zealand. Background The GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 amended the zero-rating provisions to reflect the Department’s policy that services supplied to a non-resident directly in connection with choses in action situated in New Zealand were zero-rated. However, the 1990 amendment went further to exclude services supplied to non-residents in respect of intellectual property rights for use in New Zealand from being zero- rated. This amendment conflicted with the practice adopted since 1 October 1986 to zero- rate such services. Further, the 1990 amend- ment had the effect of invalidating some rights conferred as the prescribed fee (including GST) was not paid as required by statute. Key issues The amendment ensures that certain services supplied for and to non-residents in respect of intellectual property rights are zero-rated. For zero-rating to apply the non-resident must be outside New Zealand at the time that the serv- ices are performed. The services zero-rated are the filing, prosecu- tion, granting, maintenance, transfer, assign- ment, licensing, or enforcement of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights in- clude patents, trade marks, designs, copy- rights and other similar rights. Drafting Corrections: Sections 6, 10 and 25 These clauses make a number of minor drafting corrections to the Act. Section 6 corrects a minor drafting error by re- numbering as section 106F the former section 106C of the Act that relates to persons associ- ated with petroleum miners. Section 10 corrects a wrong cross-reference in the definition of the term “exempt interest” in section 327A(1) of the Act by changing the refer- ence to “section 61(14)” to read “section 61(4)”. Section 25 corrects a minor drafting error in sec- tion 394D(2) by renumbering as paragraph (i) that one of the 2 paragraph (h)s currently in that provision that relates to policy holder credit accounts. Resident Withholding Tax - Section 11 Section 11 amends section 327H of the Act to provide that payers of interest will not need to issue resident withholding tax deduction certifi- cates to recipients of interest in respect of par- ticular accounts where recipients have received $20 or less of interest in a year. Other Amendments 32 Refund of GST paid Where a registered person has imposed GST on services supplied to a non-resident in respect of intellectual property rights which are zero-rated in terms of this amendment, that person is en- titled to a refund of the GST paid. GST should have been charged on services supplied to non- residents in respect of intellectual property rights for use in New Zealand. GST was chargeable on such services from 1 August 1990 to 31 March 1991 (date of assent). A credit note will have to be issued if a tax in- voice has been issued to the recipient of the supply. The previously agreed consideration for the supply has been altered due the impost of tax being zero-rated. Validating provision The amendment also contains a validating pro- vision. This is to ensure that intellectual prop- erty rights conferred under the Designs Act 1953, the Patents Act 1953, the Trade Marks Act 1953, the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 and any regulation made under those Acts are not invalidated as a result of the 1990 amendment to the GST Act. Application date This amendment applies in respect of supplies made on or after 1 October 1986. Non-Charging of Small Penalties Section 3 Section 3 amends section 41 of the Act to pro- vide that additional tax for late payment will not be charged where it would amount to $5 or less. Accident Compensation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 Abolition of ACC 506 Return Section 3 Introduction For many years tax practitioners have used the ACC 506 return to declare ACC leviable earn- ings allocated to shareholder-employees after 31 May each year, where that income relates to the year ending on 31 March of the same year. This return will be dispensed with from the in- come year beginning 1 April 1991. This is part of the Department’s FIRST Systems, and will also implement the Consultative Committee on Tax Simplification’s recommendation to reduce the number of returns that small business groups must file. Background Section 43(1) of the Accident Compensation Act has been amended by the insertion of a new subsection (1A). This subsection provides that where an employer pays, credits, or allocates to an employee any amount as earnings after 31 May in any year, those earnings are now to be included in the Statement of Earnings which must be delivered by 31 May in the next suc- ceeding year. The levy payable on those earn- ings and calculated in terms of section 43 (3) of the Principal Act is to be paid at the same time. The amendment applies from 1 April 1991. Key Issues From 1 April 1991, leviable earnings paid, credited, or otherwise applied on behalf on a shareholder-employee after the return date of 31 May provided for in section 43(1) may be re- turned by 31 May in the following year. Where those leviable earnings are paid or deter- mined before 31 May but after the balance date, then those earnings are to be returned and the levy paid by that date. Non-Charging of Small Penalties Section 2 Section 2 amends section 42 of the Act to pro- vide that a penalty for late payment will not be charged where it would amount to $5 or less. 33 Yes, I would like \_\_\_\_\_ (quantity) of the TIB Video at $20.

Robin Adair, Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 5 APPENDIX B TO TIB VOLUME TWO, NO. 9, APRIL 1991 Hybrid Accounting Basis for GST Adjustments The adjustments that are required when a registered person changes to or from the hybrid basis are as follows: Hybrid/Invoice Invoice to Hybrid Where the change is from an invoice basis to a hybrid basis, input tax will be claimed on a payments basis, while output tax continues to be accounted for on an invoice basis. An adjustment is required to avoid input tax being claimed twice in respect of supplies received while on the invoice basis. The registered person may have claimed an input tax credit for a supply received whilst on the invoice basis for which payment (in full or in part) will be made after the changeover. The registered person is required to: 1. Identify all creditors (from whom a tax in- voice has been received for the supply and in respect of which an input tax credit has been claimed) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. 2. Identify those creditors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined un- der section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agree- ment to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consid- eration is not determined at the time goods taken\] to the extent that payment has not been made. No adjustment is required for supplies which have any other time of sup- ply rules. 3. Apply the tax fraction to the amount deter- mined under step 2. 4. Include the amount calculated under step 3 as an adjustment to output tax. Hybrid to Invoice Where the change is from a hybrid basis to an invoice basis, input tax will change from the payments basis to the invoice basis. Output tax will continue to be accounted for on the invoice basis. An adjustment is required to ensure that input tax is claimed for supplies received while on the hybrid basis and for which payment has not been made at the time of changeover. Without this adjustment a registered person would be denied an input credit for any amount where an invoice had been received before the changeover but where full or part payment is made after the change in accounting basis. The registered person is required to: 1. Identify all creditors (from whom a tax in- voice has been received for the supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. 2. Identify those creditors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined un- der section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agree- ment to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consid- eration is not determined at the time goods taken\] to the extent that payment has not been made. No adjustment is required in respect of supplies which have any other time of supply rules. 3. Apply the tax fraction to the amount deter- mined under step 2. 4. Include the amount calculated under step 3 as an adjustment to input tax. 6 Hybrid/Payments Hybrid to Payments Where the change is from a hybrid basis to a payments basis, output tax will change from the invoice basis to the payments basis and input tax will continue to be claimed on the payments basis. The output tax brought into account on all debtors at the time invoices were issued must be reversed. Output tax will be brought into account in subsequent peri- ods as payment is received for the supply. 1. Identify all debtors (to whom an invoice has been issued for a taxable supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. This also includes debtors to whom no invoice has been issued but part payment has been received. 2. Identify those debtors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined un- der section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agree- ment to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consid- eration is not determined at the time goods taken\] to the extent that payment has not been received. No adjustment is required in respect of supplies which have any other time of supply rules. 3. Apply the tax fraction to the amount deter- mined under step 2. 4. Include the amount calculated under step 3 as an adjustment to input tax. Payments to Hybrid Where the change is from a payments to a hybrid basis, output tax will change from the payments basis to the invoice basis and input tax will continue to be claimed on the pay- ments basis. An adjustment is required to bring into account the registered person’s debtors at the time of the change that have not otherwise been brought into account as payment has not been made in full. The registered person is required to: 1. Identify all debtors (to whom an invoice has been issued for the supply) of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting basis is used. This also includes debtors to whom no invoice has been issued but part payment has been received. 2. Identify those debtors relating to supplies that have a time of supply determined un- der section 9(1), \[“ordinary” supplies\]; 9(3)(a), \[goods supplied under an agree- ment to hire or services supplied under an agreement or enactment which provides for periodic payments\]; 9(3)(aa), \[progressive supplies and buildings and engineering works\]; or 9(6), \[supplies where the consid- eration is not determined at the time goods taken\] to the extent that payment has not been received. No adjustment is required in respect of supplies which have any other time of supply rules. 3. Apply the tax fraction to the amount deter- mined under number 2. 4. Include the amount calculated under number 3 as an adjustment to output tax. 7 Example to Illustrate the Calculation of GST Payable using the Hybrid Basis of Accounting (All figures are GST inclusive.)

Legislation and determinations Determination CFC 2011/03: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (Cigna ApAC Holdings Limited) This determination applies to Cigna APAC Holdings Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFCs resident in Hong Kong for the 2010–11 and 2011–12 income years. 2 4 Legal decisions – case notes Commissioner granted leave to appeal trustee company liquidation case The Commissioner successfully applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal a decision by the High Court not to liquidate Newmarket Trustees Limited, a trustee company. Application for recall of TrA decision The disputant was not successful in the recall application. Due to an appeal having being lodged by the disputant, the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) is functus officio. Further, the decision relied upon by the disputant to justify the recall application was irrelevant. Court declines to use the “slip rule” Justice Courtney considered the purpose of the “slip rule” was to correct errors but that it was not to be lightly invoked as it would weaken the finality of a judgment and was not used in this instance. Court declines leave to amend claim after judgment delivered An applicant unsuccessfully applied for leave to amend his claim after the judgment granting judicial review had been delivered and after the applicant and the Commissioner had settled all matters in relation to the proceeding. A buy-back of part of a property is not “acquisition” under section CD 1(2)(a) The Court held that a sale arrangement of the property which included a buy-back of part of it for resale was not “acquisition” for purposes of section CD 1(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Wide-ranging discovery ordered The Commissioner was unsuccessful in opposing an application for discovery where he maintained that tax secrecy, public interest immunity or administrative difficulty would arise if the orders were granted. The Court held that these were matters for the Court, not the Commissioner, to decide. 5 6 7 8 9 9 2 inland revenue Department RA 11/01: DONATIONS TAX CREDIT – ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO TO GET A TAX CREDIT WHERE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TRUE GIFT OF MONEY Explanation A revenue alert is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and provides information about a significant and/or emerging tax planning issue of concern to Inland Revenue. At the time an alert is issued risk assessments will already be underway to determine the level of risk and to consider appropriate responses. A revenue alert will identify: • the issue (which may be a scheme, arrangement, or particular transaction) that the Commissioner believes may be contrary to the law or is inconsistent with policy • the common features of the issue • our current view • our current approach. An alert should not be interpreted as being Inland Revenue’s final position. Rather, an alert outlines the Commissioner’s current view on how the law should be applied. For any alert we issue it is likely that some investigatory work has already been carried out. If people have entered into an arrangement similar to the one described or are thinking about it, they should talk to their tax advisor and/or to Inland Revenue for advice about tax implications Issue Many people make charitable donations each year and receive tax credits accordingly. However, increasingly Inland Revenue is seeing situations where people are claiming tax credits for “donations” in situations where they have not made a true gift of their own money. Any payment of over $5 to a charity (or some similar public entities) can potentially qualify for a donations tax credit if it is a gift. To be a gift it must: • be made voluntarily • provide a material benefit to the recipient without imposing a countervailing detriment • be for no consideration • provide no material benefit or advantage to the giver in return. Features Inland Revenue has been investigating arrangements where tax credits for donations have been claimed in circumstances where a true gift of money has not been made. These arrangements involve recharacterising (as a gift of money) actions which would have not ordinarily been a donation, in order to receive the donations tax credit from Inland Revenue. A common feature of these arrangements is that the payment of money is made on the understanding that the donor will receive something in return for the payment of money, eg, the purchase of property. In many such cases the money is paid back to the donor or an associate within a short period of time (often a matter of days). We consider that a payment in those circumstances is not a gift. We are also seeing cases where donations tax credits are being claimed where the money being donated does not even belong to the donor. Current view Payments made under these arrangements are not a charitable or other public benefit gift, and do not qualify for a tax credit. These payments of money are made in circumstances where the person (or an associate) expects to receive a material benefit or advantage in return. rEVENuE ALErT Revenue alerts inform taxpayers and tax agents about significant and/or emerging tax planning issues or arrangements where Inland Revenue has concerns and is undertaking further risk assessment and investigative activities. 3 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23 No 7 August/September 2011 REVENUE ALERT Examples The following are some of the arrangements we have identified so far. There will be similar arrangements where the payment would not be a gift of money. Example 1 A person has a loan outstanding to a charitable organisation which that organisation is unable to repay. Instead of forgiving the loan the person pays the organisation an amount of money equal to the debt in the form of a “donation”, on the understanding that the money will, in turn, be used to repay the debt. The organisation repays the debt and the person claims a donations tax credit for the amount given to the charitable organisation. A variation of this example involves the person first purchasing a debt owed by a charitable organisation so that this kind of arrangement can be put in place. The payment to the charitable organisation is not considered to be a valid gift as the money was only paid to the charitable organisation on the understanding that it would be used to repay the debt. Example 2 Another example we have seen involves situations where a person intended to make a gift of property (eg, a motor vehicle) to a charitable organisation. Instead of gifting the property to that organisation (which would not qualify for the tax credit) the person makes a gift of money to the organisation which the charitable organisation then uses to purchase the property from them. The person claims a donations tax credit for the amount of money given to the charitable organisation. In some cases the arrangement also enables the charitable organisation to claim a second hand goods input tax credit for GST purposes on the purchase of the property. It is not considered that this example involves a valid gift as the person only paid the money to the charitable organisation on the understanding that the property would be purchased from them. That is, the money is returned so that under this arrangement there is no gift of money. It is also considered that the claiming of a second-hand goods input tax credit by the charitable organisation could be tax avoidance. Example 3 We are also seeing examples where charitable entities are avoiding their GST liability as well as helping to generate donation tax credits for individuals in circumstances where the money being donated really comes from a fundraising event and may not even belong to the donor. Under this arrangement fundraising is done on behalf of the charitable organisation. The money raised is then passed to an individual (generally closely associated with the charitable organisation) under the understanding that the person will then “donate” that money to the charitable organisation. The charitable organisation will not have to account for any GST on the fundraising event, and the donor will claim a donations tax credit in respect of that money and typically this will also be given by the person to the charitable organisation. In this example it is considered that taking into account the whole arrangement, there is not a valid gift for the purposes of claiming the donations tax credit as the money paid to the charitable organisation was not the donor’s. Current status Where Inland Revenue considers that donations tax credits have been claimed in situations where a true gift of money has not been made we will recover the excess tax credit from the person making the claim and will also consider the imposition of monetary penalties. It is our view that some of these arrangements may in extreme cases amount to fraud and we will consider prosecution where appropriate. If you consider that our concerns may apply to your situation, we recommend you discuss the matter with your tax advisor or with us, and consider making a voluntary disclosure Guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure are given in our guide Putting your tax returns right (IR 280) and Standard Practice Statement SPS 09/02: Voluntary disclosures (May 2009). Sections LD 1 and LD 3 of the Income Tax 2007 This revenue alert is issued on 2 August 2011. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel, Legal & Technical Services 4 inland revenue Department DETERMINATION CFC 2011/03: NON-ATTRIBUTING ACTIVE INSURANCE CFC STATUS (CIGNA APAC HOLDINGS LIMITED) Reference This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 91AAQ(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of the members of a group of CFCs, if the members satisfy subsection (3). Cigna APAC Holdings Limited has made application in respect of the members of the group of CFCs set out below. It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the members of the group of CFCs satisfy the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and are accordingly non-attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Scope of determination The CFCs to which this determination applies are: NameJurisdiction Cigna Hong Kong Holdings Company Limited Hong Kong Cigna Worldwide Life Insurance Company Limited Hong Kong Cigna Worldwide General Insurance Company Limited Hong Kong Interpretation In this document, unless the context otherwise requires: “Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. “CFC” means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. “Non-attributing active CFC” means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Determination Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I hereby determine that the above CFCs are non- attributing active CFCs for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date This determination applies for the 2010–11 and 2011–12 income years. This determination is signed by me this 10th day of August 2011.

Impact of decision The Commissioner can now proceed with his substantive appeal of CIR v Newmarket Trustees Ltd. Facts The present case stems from an application by the Commissioner to have Newmarket Trustees Limited (“Newmarket”), as trustee of the Southern Lights Trust, placed into liquidation following the expiry of a statutory demand for unpaid taxes. Following the Newmarket liquidation hearing, the High Court declined to liquidate the company on the basis that, among other things: a) no b enefit would arise from liquidation because Newmarket had no assets b) th e Commissioner did not press for investigation as a ground for a liquidation order c) liq uidation would be costly for Newmarket, as it was a trustee for numerous other trusts d) Newmarket should have the opportunity to seek adjustments of the Commissioner’s assessments. The Commissioner decided to appeal the High Court’s decision (CIR v Newmarket Trustees Ltd HC Auckland CIV-2010-404-003913, 22 February 2011) not to liquidate Newmarket, and a notice of appeal was filed with the Court of Appeal within the required timeframe. However, the notice of appeal was served on Newmarket approximately a day and a half late, although attempts were made to serve Newmarket at its registered office during that time. On the last day for filing, Newmarket’s solicitor was advised that an appeal had been filed. The Commissioner filed an application for an extension of time to appeal, which was subsequently opposed by Newmarket on the basis that the Commissioner’s substantive appeal was hopeless. Decision The Court of Appeal considered that because: a) the delay in service was minimal b) the problem with service arose as a result of a genuine mistake, and c) th ere was no suggestion that the delay in service caused Newmarket any prejudice the only reason for not granting an extension of time would be if the Commissioner’s substantive appeal was “hopeless”. Although the Court of Appeal noted that it was not in a position to examine the merits of the substantive appeal in any detail, based on the material before it, the Court of Appeal decided that “it is plain that this is not one of those cases where the appeal is so hopeless that an extension of time should be declined”. As a further reason for allowing an extension of time in this case, the Court of Appeal noted that it might also be useful for it to consider the Chester Trustee Services Ltd v CIR \[2003\] 1 NZLR 395 (CA) decision in applying a court’s discretion to make an order for liquidation. LEGAL DECiSiONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, Court of Appeal, Privy Council and the Supreme Court. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 6 inland revenue Department In respect of costs, the Court of Appeal followed the case of My Noodle Ltd v Queenstown Lakes District Council \[2009\] NZCA 224 (CA) and awarded costs to the Commissioner given that it should have been clear to Newmarket that in the circumstances an extension of time would be granted. APPLICATION FOR RECALL OF TRA DECISION CaseTRA 42/03, 105/04, 23/05, 54/05 and 38/07 \[2011\] NZTRA 6 Decision date16 June 2011 Act(s)Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994 KeywordsRecall, appeal Summary The disputant was not successful in the recall application. Due to an appeal having being lodged by the disputant, the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) is functus officio. Further, the decision relied upon by the disputant to justify the recall application was irrelevant. Impact of decision This decision confirms the limited grounds upon which a decision may be recalled and that it is not appropriate to recall a decision that is also under appeal. Facts On 25 February 2011 the disputant applied to the TRA to recall Judge Barber’s decision dated 1 February 2011 reported as \[2011\] TRA 2 (“the Decision”) and, on the same date, appealed the Decision to the High Court. The Decision struck out the disputant’s challenges against assessments of income tax for the 1997 to 2005 income tax years. The proceedings related to the Trinity scheme. The disputant applied to recall the Decision based on the following: 1. The case of Telstra New Zealand Holdings Ltd v CIR (2011) 25 NZTC 25,068 (HC) (“Te l s t r a”); a purported new judicial decision of relevance, had not been drawn to Judge Barber’s attention. 2. Th ere was an alleged abuse of process and the TRA was bound by previous Trinity decisions to accept his right to recall. The disputant submitted that his right to recall was directly covered by the High Court and Court of Appeal in the substantive Trinity proceedings (who purportedly refused to accept the Commissioner’s submissions that they had no jurisdiction to hear a recall application filed nine months after the substantive challenge appeal was lodged). 3. His Honour did not have jurisdiction to strike out challenges on the merits. The Commissioner’s position in respect of this application was that: a) the disputant’s decision to appeal had taken the matter out of the TRA’s hands as it was functus officio and was unable to take further action in respect of this matter b) the recall application was, in any event, unfounded and was a further demonstration of the disputant’s refusal to accept any adverse judgment, and of his apparent determination to take any opportunity to indefinitely continue litigating Trinity issues. Decision Judge Barber dismissed the disputant’s application with reference to the disputant’s appeal. Specifically His Honour found that: As Venning J recognised in Russell v Klinac \[HC Whangarei AP 18/01, 11 December 2001\] at \[27\], it cannot be appropriate for a trial court to revisit an apparently final decision after that decision has been submitted to the “processes of superior courts”. That would give rise to the “plainly ... unacceptable” prospect of “the same matter being litigated twice in two Courts at the same time”, refer Redcliffe Forestry Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC) at \[12\] (“Redcliffe”) \[8\]. In this case, the “same matter” is the sustainability of the disputant’s challenges in light of the previous Trinity judgments. I have found that the challenges are unsustainable. The disputant must overcome that on appeal. It is “plainly unacceptable”, in the words of the current President of the Court of Appeal, for that finding to be revisited before this Authority while the appeal is pending \[9\]. St rictly, that view disposes of the disputant’s application to recall which I therefore dismiss \[10\] ... His Honour addressed some of the other matters raised in the application. Judge Barber rejected the disputant’s “right to recall” argument finding that: The disputant acknowledges, the very late recall application in the Trinity challenge proceeding was only possible because the appellants failed to comply with their obligation to seal the High Court judgment promptly after lodging an appeal. The Commissioner (rightly) objected to this conduct but, nevertheless, decided to oppose the application on its merits. The application was heard and dismissed by Venning J on that basis in Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC) at \[48\], \[52\]– \[53\] and \[88\]. The Court of Appeal expressed doubt about 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23 No 7 August/September 2011 its own jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a refusal to recall, but was not asked to, and did not, express any view on the jurisdiction of the High Court \[12\]. Judge Barber reiterated that the grounds for recall are “strictly limited” and are “to be exercised only in the most limited of circumstances” referring to the recent decisions of Erwood v Maxted \[2010\] NZCA 93 and Case Z26 (2010) 24 NZTC 14,380 respectively. For recall to be available on the basis of a new judicial decision, that new decision must either directly or indirectly overrule the decision subject to the recall application by making it “clear” that the decision was “wrong”; Child Poverty Action Group Inc (CPAG) v Attorney-General HC Wellington CIV-2009-404-273, (at \[13\] to \[15\]). Amongst other findings, it was held that Te l s t r a (which concerned an application by the Commissioner to have a notice of discontinuance set aside on the basis that there was an abuse of process): 1. was not a Trinity scheme judgment; was not about striking out challenge proceedings; was, so far as relevant, consistent with the authorities cited in the Decision and did not, even according to the disputant, compel a different (or any particular) decision on the merits of the case 2. did not indicate that the Decision was wrong or bring this case within the limited circumstances where recall was warranted 3. was no basis for criticising the decision-making process in the Decision, nor any basis for criticising the outcome of that process. Judge Barber held that the disputant’s complaints about the merits of the Decision went to the correctness of that decision and should be pursued by way of appeal. COURT DECLINES TO USE THE “SLIP RULE” CaseNTH Douglas and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date8 July 2011 Act(s)High Court Rules KeywordsSlip rule, Russell, tax avoidance Summary Justice Courtney considered the purpose of the “slip rule” was to correct errors but that it was not to be lightly invoked as it would weaken the finality of a judgment and was not used in this instance. Impact of decision Although this was a judgment (in the Commissioner’s favour) in the ongoing Russell template litigation, it is a useful precedent on the application of the “slip rule” under the High Court Rules. Facts The taxpayers were involved in the Russell template avoidance scheme. They were considered by the Commissioner to be engaged in tax avoidance and assessed accordingly. The taxpayers challenged the assessments by tax objections and judicial review but the various reviews and appeals to and from the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) did nothing to alter the conclusion of tax avoidance. Due to the prolonged period of the litigation, when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court, the Judge ordered the Commissioner to file and serve affidavits annexing the original cases stated for the various individual taxpayers involved at the same time as he sought to seal the final judgments (see Douglas v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,331). The Commissioner filed the required affidavits when seeking to seal his judgments but, due to an error, did not serve the affidavits on the taxpayers’ agent (Mr Russell) until the same time as he served the sealed judgments. The taxpayers made an application that the judgments had been sealed in error and could not be relied upon by any person. The application was made relying upon the “slip rule” of the High Court Rule: Correction of accidental slip or omission (1) A jud gment or order may be corrected by the court or the Registrar who made it, if it— (a) co ntains a clerical mistake or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission, whether or not made by an officer of the court; or LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 8 inland revenue Department (b) is drawn up so that it does not express what was decided and intended. (2) Th e correction may be made by the court or the Registrar, as the case may be,— (a) on its or his or her own initiative; or (b) on an interlocutory application. Decision Justice Courtney considered the purpose of the “slip rule” was to correct errors but that it was not to be lightly invoked as it would weaken the finality of a judgment. While acknowledging the Commissioner had acted in error, Her Honour was not satisfied the “slip rule” should be invoked. She concluded that while there was a requirement to serve the affidavits, it was not intended to give the taxpayers further rights of challenge. Although unfortunate that the affidavits were not served prior to sealing of the judgments, it would make no difference to the taxpayers’ position and the sealed orders were not contrary to the judgment reached. Thus the Court declined to invalidate the sealed orders. COURT DECLINES LEAVE TO AMEND CLAIM AFTER JUDGMENT DELIVERED CaseDunphy & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date11 July 2011 Act(s)Income Tax Act 1976 KeywordsJudicial review, leave to amend statement of claim, settlement, costs Summary An applicant unsuccessfully applied for leave to amend his claim after the judgment granting judicial review had been delivered and after the applicant and the Commissioner had settled all matters in relation to the proceeding. Impact of decision Beyond the specific circumstances of the case, this judgment confirms the conclusive nature of a settlement entered into by parties that settles all matters in a proceeding. Facts On 28 April 2010, Chisholm J granted three taxpayers applications for judicial review, directing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) to reconsider those taxpayers’ claims for tax refunds on the strength of the Privy Council’s decision in Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2006\] 3 NZLR 433. The claims for refunds related to those taxpayers investments in the film Utu. It was anticipated that the claims for refunds by the other applicants in the proceedings would be resolved in accordance with that judgment. However, in his judgment, Chisholm J reserved leave to any party to apply further “should clarification of any of these orders be required”. In a memorandum dated 18 May 2011, counsel for the applicants advised that all the applicants’ claims had been resolved save for the claim of the fourth applicant, Mr Robert Maxwell. In respect of Mr Maxwell, counsel sought an order amending the statement of claim and, if that amendment was permitted, an order directing the Commissioner to reconsider Mr Maxwell’s claim in light of it. Specifically, counsel for the applicants sought to amend Appendix 4 of the amended statement of claim, changing the amount Mr Maxwell had invested in Utu from $20,000 (as currently pleaded) to $40,000 (the purported actual amount). It was noted that the $40,000 amount had been included in the initial statement of claim filed. In a memorandum dated 27 May 2011, counsel for the Commissioner strongly opposed the application on the basis that, amongst other things, a settlement deed had been entered into which settles all matters between Mr Maxwell and the Commissioner in relation to the proceeding. Counsel further queried whether the application came within the reserved leave to apply for clarification of any of the orders in Chisholm J’s substantive judgment of 28 April 2011. Decision Chisholm J dismissed the application finding that: Assuming for the moment that there is jurisdiction to grant leave for the fourth applicant’s \[Mr Maxwell’s\] pleading to be amended at this late stage, I am not prepared to grant leave. The proposed amendment is not within the scope of the “clarification” leave reserved to the parties in the substantive judgment. More importantly, the parties appear to have settled all matters in relation to this proceeding. The application is dismissed. There will be an order for costs on the 2B scale against the fourth applicant in favour of the respondent \[7\]. His Honour assumed that the applicant did not intend to file any further documentation given the time that had passed since counsel for the Commissioner’s memorandum had been filed. 9 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23 No 7 August/September 2011 A BUY-BACK OF PART OF A PROPERTY IS NOT “ACQUISITION” UNDER SECTION CD 1(2)(A) CaseJunior Farms Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date22 July 2011 Act(s)Income Tax Act 1994 KeywordsAcquisition, disposed legal and equitable interests Summary The Court held that a sale arrangement of the property which included a buy-back of part of it for resale was not an “acquisition” for purposes of section CD 1(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Impact of decision There are no precedential implications as the case turns largely on its facts. The Court took a “plain language” approach to statutory interpretation and construed contractual agreements together rather than separately. Facts On or about 21 July 1964, Junior Farms Ltd (“Junior Farms”) purchased a property of approximately 92 acres of land on the northern side of Ormiston Road, East Tamaki (“the property”). In about 1988, Manukau City Council (“MCC”) notified Junior Farms that a portion of the property was required for flood protection purposes. In about November 1994, Junior Farms entered into two sale agreements (“the agreements”) in respect of the property. Under the first sale agreement (“the first agreement”), Junior Farms sold the property for $2,681,000.00. In the second sale agreement (“the second agreement”), Hampton sold back part of the property (approximately 14 hectares) which was designated for flood protection purposes (“the floodplain area”) to Junior Farms for $100. Junior Farms claimed that the floodplain area was not disposed under the first agreement. It claimed that under the agreements its interest in the floodplain area was held under trust or as equitable ownership. Decision The main issue turns on the interpretation of the agreements as to whether they should be construed as one transaction (as contended by Junior Farms) or the two separate transactions (as contended by the Commissioner). Justice Brewer held that the agreements together with a side letter executed at that time constituted one transaction and concluded that the agreement was a device to give effect to the sale of the industrial part of the property only, with Junior Farms retaining its interests in the floodplain area. There was therefore no disposal of the legal and beneficial interest to the floodplain area of the property by Junior Farms under the first agreement and hence, no acquisition of the same under the second agreement. WIDE-RANGING DISCOVERY ORDERED CaseCommissioner of Inland Revenue v Giovanni Holdings Ltd and Ors Decision date28 July 2011 Act(s)Companies Act 1993, High Court Rules KeywordsDiscovery, public interest immunity, electronic database Summary The Commissioner was unsuccessful in opposing an application for discovery where he maintained that tax secrecy, public interest immunity or administrative difficulty would arise if the orders were granted. The Court held that these were matters for the Court, not the Commissioner, to decide. Impact of decision This decision may have implications for the discovery of information exchanged under the double tax agreements. From a practical perspective, the extent of possible discovery as a consequence of this decision is very broad. Facts On 6 September 2010, the Commissioner sought and obtained a freezing order without notice over a property owned by Giovanni Holdings Ltd (“Giovanni”). The freezing order was obtained on the basis that a Mr Petroulias and another were/are the beneficial owners of the property. Proceedings Giovanni filed an application in October 2010 seeking an order discharging or varying the freezing order. In the course of case management of that application, the Commissioner objected to representation of Giovanni by Ms Hancock (the director of Giovanni). The High Court (in a decision dated 22 December 2010) decided in favour of Giovanni and allowed Ms Hancock to represent the company. LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 10 inland revenue Department Giovanni also filed an application seeking an order that general discovery be made by the Commissioner. The Commissioner opposed the application. This hearing was to consider the discovery issue. Decision Giovanni sought an order for general discovery of: a) all transcripts of recorded phone calls held between Mr Petroulias and others and provided to the Commissioner by the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) b) all electronic databases containing relevant information, including the “Z:drive” which was seized in the Commissioner’s access operations in 2006 c) all probative communication between the Commissioner and the ATO d) all other probative documents, correspondence and records of interviews with any party. McKenzie J firstly granted the leave sought by Mr Petroulias to be heard in the discovery proceedings (the application had only been filed by Giovanni) as it was necessary in the interests of justice. With regard to the general discovery sought, McKenzie J noted that the Commissioner’s actions were being challenged (an application to strike out the proceedings had been filed on the basis of abuse of process) and acknowledged what while these were better addressed in the substantive proceedings, it was relevant in considering the extent of appropriate discovery. McKenzie J agreed that, as a matter of general principle, the Peruvian Guano test was not appropriate in cases where, as a matter of policy, they should be dealt with swiftly (such as freezing orders). His Honour acknowledged that discovery was not usually appropriate in freezing order applications as they are usually dealt with on an urgent basis and confirmed that the onus is usually on the applicant for the freezing order to show it has a good arguable case and to disclose all material facts and possible defences. However, McKenzie J considered that this case was different as the application for discharge of the freezing order would require an inquiry wider than whether the Commissioner had an arguable case regarding beneficial ownership of the relevant property. Further, any delay in the proceedings (despite the urgency of a freezing order application) did not weigh against discovery, particularly when the Commissioner’s position is protected by the freezing order. The Commissioner had argued that all relevant material had been produced pursuant to section 81(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. McKenzie J rejected that submission stating that not all discoverable documents will usually be produced in evidence and should be verified by a discovery affidavit. McKenzie J confirmed the position in Knight v CIR and BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR that the conduct of litigation (and specifically discovery) is a purpose of carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts for the purposes of section 81. However, his Honour recognised that production of discovered documents can be withheld where a claim of privilege is available. In that regard, McKenzie J referred to the Commissioners submission that the documents were subject to public interest immunity and confirmed the principle in BNZ Investments \[2008\] 2 NZLR 709 that section 81 addresses the reconciliation of the principles of taxpayer discovery and the interests of justice. While the respondents submitted that no public interest immunity issues arise as discussed in CIR v ER Squibb (1992) 14 NZTC 9146, McKenzie J stated it need not be addressed at this point in the proceedings (noting that the ultimate decision on a claim of public interest immunity is for the Court to decide, not the Commissioner and if necessary the Court will inspect the documents to determine the question). With regard to the first category of documents, his Honour disagreed that the respondents had failed to establish relevance and held that the Commissioner’s reliance on some of this material provided a sufficient basis for discovery of all transcripts. As for the second category, McKenzie J noted that the “Z:drive” had been subject to previous litigation (Venning J had decided that the Commissioner was not required to make available a cloned copy of the hard drive). However, McKenzie J stated that the question before his Honour was different to that before Venning J and held that discovery should be required of relevant documents contained on that hard drive. McKenzie J rejected the Commissioner’s submission that discovery would be unduly burdensome due to the volume of information on the hard drive. His Honour stated that there are two ways to avoid such a burden: the Commissioner can either make a copy of the “Z:drive” available to the respondents or carry out keyword searching to locate relevant documents. McKenzie J considered it was inappropriate for the Court to fix a list of words and stated that it will be for the Commissioner to decide the relevant search terms (noting that the Commissioner will need to set out the basis for the relevance testing in an affidavit to ensure adequacy of the search can be examined should it be challenged). His Honour rejected the Commissioner’s submission that as the documents in the third category were the subject of incomplete investigations in both New Zealand and 11 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23 No 7 August/September 2011 Australia, the disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law. McKenzie J held that section 81 was also relevant to this category of evidence and again stated that any decision on public interest immunity was for the Court not the Commissioner. As for the fourth category, being all other relevant documents, correspondence and records of interviews, McKenzie J also ordered that these should be discovered. In summary, the Commissioner was ordered to produce a discovery affidavit listing all relevant information from all four categories (which are or have been in the Commissioner’s control) within 20 working days.

Claim simply untenable The Court had no jurisdiction to consider the Harsono Family Trust’s (“HFT”) claim nor was it tenable. Furthermore, the claim brought by HFT against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue was found to be an abuse of process because HFT deliberately attempted to misconstrue the true nature of the payment. Abuse of court process to re-litigate misconceived cases Since the taxpayer’s proceeding was of the same nature as others that have been unsuccessful it was found to be abuse of court process. Judicial review of Commissioner’s refusal to accept amended GST returns The Court ordered the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to reconsider his decision to not allow the taxpayers to amend their GST returns to exclude previously returned output tax and therefore obtain a GST refund. Optional convertible notes can be tax avoidance arrangements The Court held that the use of particular optional convertible notes was a tax avoidance arrangement because the arrangement was an artificial device and it was not within Parliamentary contemplation. Appropriate course for dealing with an allegation that the High Court was functus officio This decision concerned the appropriate course to take when the High Court is confronted with an allegation that the High Court was functus officio and thus lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings. Freezing orders against third party The Court considered that the freezing order could not be upheld without more evidence and an undertaking by the Commissioner. Judicial review struck out The Supreme Court held that only in exceptional cases can a judicial review be permitted to reverse tax assessments. 16 16 18 18 19 20 21 21 2 inland revenue Department TIB reader survey This survey is to gauge how well the TIB meets your needs as a source of tax technical information.

STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS This statement may be cited as “Standard Practice Statement 11/07: Application of discretion in section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – the secrecy provisions”. All statutory references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless otherwise specified. Introduction 1. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the “TAA”) protects from disclosure by Inland Revenue (“IR”) by requiring that all matters which come to the knowledge of any Inland Revenue officer are to be kept secret. The section has recently been amended to provide IR with a broader discretion to communicate information relating to the Commissioner’s various duties and functions, after a number of factors have been considered. This Statement outlines the factors that IR must take into account and the process it will follow to ensure there is a consistent approach taken by IR staff when exercising the discretion and before making those disclosures. 2. Section 6 of the TAA confirms that all IR employees have an on-going duty to protect the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. An important way in which the tax system’s integrity is protected is by IR not disclosing tax secret information it has received about a taxpayer to someone else. There are criminal sanctions that can be imposed if an IR employee fails to comply with those secrecy obligations. 1 The TAA goes so far as to protect all information, including that which does not identify specific taxpayer affairs, unless the disclosure is for reasons clearly relating to administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. 3. It is also recognised that in order to protect the integrity of the tax system IR will in some circumstances be required to disclose tax secret information to third parties such as the courts, other government agencies and other third parties (sometimes including the general public). The TAA has always contained a number of exceptions that specifically allowed IR to disclose certain information. Those exceptions are mainly contained in section 81(4) of the TAA. 4. Those provisions remain in force. However, recent amendments to section 81 2 have expanded the circumstances in which IR can disclose tax secret information. The new provision, section 81(1B), is intended to give IR more flexibility to make disclosures when administering the tax system. Broadly, it is a discretionary power which allows for disclosure where that communication: a) is for executing or performing a duty of the Commissioner or supporting the execution or performance of such a duty; and b) is reasonable, having regard to five specific factors contained in section 81(1B)(b). 5. This Statement will provide guidance to IR staff as to when this new provision might result in IR disclosing such information, and outline the steps IR will take before making that disclosure to ensure maximum consistency. Before that it briefly examines how the new exception interacts with the other exceptions to the secrecy provisions. The contents are as follows: • Paragraphs 6 and 7 outline the relevant statutory provisions; • Paragraphs 8 to 14 note the general structure and exceptions to the secrecy rules that still apply and how they interact with the new rules; • Paragraphs 15 to 18 provide guidance on the new definition of “duty of the Commissioner”; • Paragraphs 19 to 33 discuss the five factors that must be weighed up in determining whether a disclosure is reasonable; • Paragraphs 34 to 36 summarise how IR sees the application of section 81(1B) operating in practice; and • An appendix contains a number of examples that may assist in understanding the secrecy provisions. 1 See section 143C of the TAA. 2 Introduced in the Taxation (Tax Administration Remedial Matters) Act 2011. A further provision allows for certain information to be shared with other government agencies. We do not deal with those provisions here. 4 inland revenue Department The legislative provisions 6. The revised framework governing tax secrecy and enabling IR to disclose taxpayer specific information is contained in subsections 81(1), (1B), (1C) and (8) which respectively state: 81 Officers to maintain secrecy (1) An Inland Revenue officer must maintain, and must assist in maintaining, the secrecy of all matters relating to the legislation described in subsection (1C), and the officer must not communicate any such matter, except for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation or under subsection (1B). (1B) Despite subsection (1), an Inland Revenue officer may communicate a matter if— (a) the communication is for the purpose of executing or performing a duty of the Commissioner, or for the purpose of supporting the execution or performance of such a duty; and (b) the Commissioner considers that such communication is reasonable with regard to the relevant purpose described in paragraph (a), and with regard to the following: (i) the Commissioner’s obligation at all times to use best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system; and (ii) the importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; and (iii) any personal or commercial impact of the communication; and (iv) the resources available to the Commissioner; and (v) the public availability of the information. (1C) For the purposes of subsection (1), the legislation is— (a) the Inland Revenue Acts, or another Act that is or was administered by or in Inland Revenue: (b) the Accident Compensation Act 2001, the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, the Accident Insurance Act 1998, the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, or the Accident Compensation Act 1982: (c) the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974: (d) any Act that imposes taxes or duties payable to the Crown. ... (8) In this section,— (a) Inland Revenue officer,— (i) means a person who is employed in the service of Inland Revenue; and (ii) includes— (A) a person employed in the service of the Government of an overseas country or territory who is for the time being attached or seconded to Inland Revenue: (B) a person formerly employed in the service of Inland Revenue: (b) duty of the Commissioner includes a power of the Commissioner and also a function of the Commissioner, as well as anything done within the law to— (i) administer the tax system: (ii) implement the tax system: (iii) improve, research, or reform the tax system. 7. As noted below, nothing in the operation of section 81(1B) impacts on other secrecy exceptions contained in the TAA. Accordingly, the particular exceptions contained in sections 81(3) and (4) and 81BA remain relevant and applicable whether or not section 81(1B) is engaged. Sometimes a disclosure might be made under either subsections (1B) or (4), for example. The general secrecy rule and its exceptions 8. Section 81(1) still provides the important general rule that IR employees must maintain the secrecy of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts obtained from customers or any other sources. However, as with its prior version, section 81(1) also contains a general exception to that secrecy requirement. This allows disclosure where it is for the purpose of “carrying into effect” the revenue Acts. Case law on the earlier version is likely to remain relevant. 9. In this regard, the Supreme Court considered the former version of section 81(1) in Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,896. There the Supreme Court noted at paragraph \[69\] that: Disclosure is not permitted unless, and to the extent that, it is reasonably necessary for the performance of the Commissioner’s statutory functions. 10. Although the case itself dealt with a relatively unusual situation involving disclosure of third-party tax secret information in a complex litigation, the Supreme Court noted that this test was a straightforward legal standard. The test of “reasonable necessity” does however create a measure of uncertainty. 11. The general rule in section 81(1) is now however also subject to the new discretion contained in section 81(1B), which takes on a central role. It is intended to enable disclosures which are reasonable (as opposed to reasonably necessary) in terms of the discretion enacted. 5 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 12. This raises the issue of the relationship between the exception contained in section 81(1B) and the exception contained in section 81(1)—or indeed the exceptions specified in 81(3) or (4). IR considers that while some disclosure may only be made on the authority of subsection (1B), there will be many circumstances where a disclosure that falls within the new provision would equally be authorised under the other exceptions allowing disclosure. In those circumstances, IR might rely on another applicable exception without regard to the balancing act required by section 81(1B). 13. Similarly, the fact that a general subject area might be dealt with in subsection (4) will not affect or constrain the use of subsection (1B). If a closely related communication was not specifically covered by subsection (4), it might still be reasonably made if it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1B). In this regard, subsection (4) cannot be read as an exhaustive code. 14. One purpose behind the introduction of section 81(1B) was to expand the circumstances in which IR can disclose information (whether of a taxpayer specific or of a general nature) where disclosure is not necessarily linked to the direct administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. A decision to disclose under section 81(1B) may be made in response to a request from a third party for information, but it also enables IR to proactively disclose information to third parties (including the media) where it considers that the exception applies. STANDArD prACTiCE AND ANALYSiS The discretion – a duty of the Commissioner 15. As noted above, in order to exercise the discretion contained in section 81(1B), IR must be satisfied that the proposed disclosure or communication will comply with two statutory tests. The first is (subsection (1B)(a)) that the communication’s purpose is either to execute or perform “a duty of the Commissioner”, or it is to support such an act— whether or not it provides a benefit to the recipient. IR considers this means that the communication will be authorised for instance where it assists an IR employee perform the duties and functions described in section 81(8). 16. The new definition of “duty of the Commissioner” is inclusive and also extends the concept to “anything done within the law to”: “administer”, “implement”, “improve, research or reform” the tax system. In relation to this extended definition, the duty (eg, researching or reforming the tax system) must be itself “within the law”. This merely means that the Commissioner must act within his own powers, and consistently with any constraints or prohibitions imposed by law (other than under section 81(1)) when undertaking any of the actions listed. 17. Subsection (1B) not only applies in relation to such actions but it also extends to anything done to “support” the carrying out of any such actions. This allows disclosure where there is not a direct execution or performance of a duty as such but the disclosure is supporting the execution or performance. For instance, supporting work being conducted by third parties to research aspects of the tax system might in some cases warrant the disclosure of otherwise tax secret information. 18. There must be a nexus between the communication and the Commissioner’s duties. So, where the communication will only serve the purpose of assisting another party perform its functions and cannot reasonably be linked to performing or supporting the performance of any of the Commissioner’s duties (as defined), the test in subsection (1B)(a) will not be met. In those circumstances, the communication cannot be supported by subsection (1B). However, where the communication will assist a third party and at the same time support, perform or execute a relevant duty of the Commissioner, the communication may potentially be made, after consideration of the relevant discretionary criteria in subsection (1B)(b). The discretion – the factors which must be balanced 19. Once the first test is satisfied, IR still needs to objectively satisfy itself that the proposed disclosure is “reasonable” (in performing or supporting the execution or performance of a Commissioner’s duty) having regard to five listed factors. Those factors are: i) the Commissioner’s “best endeavours” obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system; ii) the importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; iii) any personal or commercial impact of the communication; iv) the resources available to the Commissioner; and v) the public availability of the information. 20. Before considering each factor a number of general preliminary comments can be made: STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 6 inland revenue Department a) The test for determining whether the communication can be made is one of reasonableness. This is an objective standard. The threshold is less onerous than the “reasonably necessary” test stated in Westpac above, meaning that greater disclosure is potentially permissible. b) The test requires that all five of the specified factors are taken into account in any decision to disclose. There may be circumstances where one or two of the factors appear immaterial but they still need to be taken into account and given appropriate weight. c) Often, there will be tension between (and within) the various factors with some factors favouring disclosure while others suggesting non-disclosure. IR cannot pre-determine particular weightings for each of the factors. d) That said, there will be circumstances where a particular factor is so relevant that it effectively determines whether the communication should be made or not. An example is where the information is already publicly available elsewhere. In most of these instances (even if it was secret when it came into IR’s hands) there would be little risk in releasing it (refer to the fifth factor above) to the recipient particularly if it is of a general and non- taxpayer-specific nature. However, that factor still needs to be weighed in each decision. For example IR will not be likely to confirm or deny the tax status of a particular person about whom public statements have been made by others. For another example, where there is a public debate about an industry’s entitlement to deduct say research and development costs, and IR is asked to assist in the debate by providing to the industry details of a particular taxpayer’s research and development approach (which was deductible). Such a step, which might slightly assist the promotion of voluntary compliance by the taxpayer’s competitors, could well prejudice the taxpayer’s business. The adverse commercial impact of the communication far outweighs its benefits, and this factor would preclude disclosure, notwithstanding the other factors. Factor 1 – Protecting the tax system’s integrity 21. The first matter considered is whether the disclosure is consistent with the Commissioner’s obligation to use best endeavours at all times to protect the “integrity of the tax system”. That term is defined in section 6(2) of the TAA to include: (a) taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 22. It is clear that, particularly in relation to IR’s secrecy requirements, there are different drivers that impact on the integrity of the tax system. The right of the taxpayer and the responsibility of IR to keep information confidential are only two of the factors mentioned in section 6. These may clash with the obligation of a taxpayer to comply with the law and IR’s obligation to administer the law fairly. Other taxpayers’ perceptions of the tax system’s integrity are also relevant. 23. For example, misleading public statements made by a taxpayer that he or she has been trying to settle a tax dispute with the Department for years to no avail, or making untrue statements of fact about the conduct of an investigation. The general body of taxpayers may think negatively of IR and the tax system if they assumed that IR was acting improperly. Therefore, IR may potentially issue a statement that the taxpayer had not provided all relevant facts, and that had contributed materially to IR’s not having concluded the dispute, which would allow taxpayers to take a more informed view of the situation. Factor 2 – Promoting voluntary compliance 24. The second factor considered is promoting voluntary compliance in New Zealand. This factor is referred to in the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities contained in section 6A of the TAA (in general, refer to Interpretation Statement IS 10/07). This includes collecting the highest net revenue having regard to: 3 the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts ... 3 See section 6A(3)(b). 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 25. The promotion of voluntary compliance is a cornerstone of the New Zealand tax system. As such, it will be an important factor to consider in any decision as to the reasonableness of disclosure as opposed to non-disclosure. However, as with protecting the tax system’s integrity, tensions may arise in considering the voluntary compliance of the individual taxpayer as against taxpayers more generally. Communicating information about a specific taxpayer may adversely affect that taxpayer’s commitment to voluntary compliance, but it may enhance the compliance behaviour of others. In this regard, it is important to note that IR’s responsibility is to promote compliance amongst all taxpayers. As such, an adverse impact on an individual taxpayer may still be justifiable in some cases, if IR considers the disclosure will promote voluntary compliance more generally. For example, IR already makes media statements about taxpayers convicted in the courts for serious tax offending. Factor 3 – The communication’s personal or commercial impact 26. The third factor to be considered in determining whether a communication is reasonable is the potential impact that communication may have personally or commercially. This requires looking at the communication more specifically from the perspective of an affected taxpayer or potentially a group of taxpayers. This may in some cases justify discussion with the taxpayers potentially affected. For example, a statement by IR that a particular taxpayer is the subject of an IR investigation or dispute may negatively impact on that taxpayer’s reputation or business, or share price perhaps. In such circumstances, the question becomes whether the other factors reasonably favour disclosing the information notwithstanding that consequence. 27. However, it is not necessarily the case that all IR communications under section 81(1B) will have an adverse commercial impact on a taxpayer. There may be circumstances where the affected taxpayer would like the tax secret information to be disclosed. So where a taxpayer has requested that IR make the disclosure, this factor will carry significant weight in assessing the personal or commercial impact of the disclosure. Consent is therefore a significant factor, but not necessarily an overriding one. IR may, for instance, consider on balance that public comment on a taxpayer’s personal affairs could have an adverse effect on voluntary compliance in the circumstances. IR would normally release information directly to the taxpayer concerned rather than to a third party on their behalf. 28. This factor may carry much less weight where the communication deals with anonymous, aggregated data, perhaps relating to a large industry or area. In those circumstances, where the potential commercial impact on a particular member of the industry is much less, it is unlikely that this factor would be given much weight. On the other hand, this factor would be more significant if the taxpayer is more readily identifiable and the information relates to a smaller industry or locality. Factor 4 – IR’s resources 29. The use of IR’s resources is another factor also referred to in the care and management responsibilities of the Commissioner in section 6A of the TAA. In terms of section 81(1B), this factor enables IR to have proper regard to the impact that a communication may have on its own resources. Such an impact could be either positive or negative. 30. For example, a communication may be an effective way to improve the compliance behaviour of a group of taxpayers. The communication may reduce the need for audit, amendment of assessments and possible penalties. Further, IR’s investigative resources may be freed up in the future to do other work. 31. The use of resources factor may also be relevant in terms of determining the level of internal (and sometimes external) resource required to obtain the information requested. This can be extremely expensive, and the resources may well be better used elsewhere. Factor 5 – The information is otherwise publicly available 32. This factor may be given a significant weighting in favour of disclosure if the information is publicly available. However, there may be circumstances where the information is theoretically publicly available but would involve the use of considerable cost or time to obtain. In such cases, the public availability factor may carry less weight in favour of disclosure. Arguably, the publication of industry income benchmarks, or other aggregated statistical data, sourced from public sources, could still be otherwise restricted by the normal secrecy requirements. However, subsection (1B) allows for such disclosure provided that the disclosure is reasonable having regard to all five factors in section 81(1B)(b). 33. It may also be the case that the tax secret information has been made available to the public by someone other than IR in circumstances where the information has been improperly obtained. In those circumstances, STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 8 inland revenue Department IR may decide not to disclose the tax secret information even though it is otherwise publicly available, when it considers the other four factors above. How the provisions will work in practice 34. The expanded secrecy rules are intended to allow IR a greater ability to disclose tax secret information in appropriate circumstances, broadly where disclosure will assist the integrity of the tax system. With the greater flexibility of the secrecy rules, IR recognises that the decision to make disclosures under section 81(1B) needs to be made by senior staff. The process will be as follows: a) The decision-maker must be satisfied that the communication satisfies the criteria; b) The decision to communicate tax secret information should be the subject of legal advice. 35. Although a proposed communication is related to the duty of the Commissioner within the new discretion, IR can still decide not to make the communication after balancing the various factors. For example, IR may decline to use its discretion where it was thought that making a public statement about inaccurate information made public by a taxpayer would merely lead to a public debate about that taxpayer’s tax affairs, without leading to any material benefit to the tax system. As such, the more sensitive or wide- reaching any potential communication from IR is, the more likely more senior management will be involved in the decision to communicate—particularly if the disclosure would tend to identify a taxpayer or small group of taxpayers. 36. A decision-maker required to determine whether a communication can or should be made must note the following: a) The general rule and starting point is that an officer must maintain secrecy in all tax secret matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts unless an exception is identified. b) Is there a specific exception in section 81(4) that may apply? If there is, disclosure may occur. c) Does the exception relating to courts or tribunals in section 81(3) or that in the new section 81BA (relating to inter-governmental disclosures) apply? If either applies, the disclosure may occur. d) If there is no specific exception, does the general exception of “carrying into effect that legislation” in section 81(1) apply? e) The final step is to consider if section 81(1B) applies. This requires a conclusion that both statutory tests are satisfied in relation to the relevant communication. In this regard, the above commentary will be required to be considered in accordance with the policies outlined here before concluding that the disclosure is: i) for the purpose of executing or performing a duty of the Commissioner or supporting the execution or performance of such a duty; ii) reasonable in relation to that duty; iii) reasonable having taken into account each of the five relevant factors. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 23 December 2011. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel – Assurance 9 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 AppENDiX – EXAmpLES The Appendix contains examples that are intended to assist IR employees and taxpayers understand how the new secrecy exception might operate in practice. They are not intended to provide general statements as to when IR will and will not disclose taxpayer information under section 81(1B). The circumstances and content of each potential disclosure will dictate whether IR can and will rely on section 81(1B) to communicate. Therefore, IR employees should still consider the guidance discussed above before deciding whether section 81(1B) applies even where they consider the communication is consistent with one of these examples. Example 1: Disclosure to the New Zealand Police IR is approached by New Zealand Police with a request for information on an individual who is suspected of dealing in drugs. The information sought is specific in terms of income returned by the individual for tax purposes. The Police intend to use this information to conduct further investigations to determine if the individual has sufficient income to support his standard of living and advise that they will report the results of their investigation to IR to enable it to assess the correct amount of tax. Does the request satisfy the provisions of section 81 to release the information to the Police? Section 81(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect legislation described in subsection (1C) Does the disclosure meet the criteria in relation to subsection (1) legislation? No, it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the tax legislation. Section 81(4): Information may be released in specific cases Does the disclosure fall within one of the exceptions in paragraphs (a)–(u)? No, none of the specific exceptions apply in this case. Section 81(1B): Information may be released if it relates to a duty of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 81(1B)(a) – Step One Whether the communication is for the purpose of: • executing or performing a duty (defined in section 81(8)(b)) of the Commissioner, or • the supporting of such a duty? Is it for the purpose of executing or performing a duty, power or function of the Commissioner? No. The duty, power or function in question is that of the Police, not IR. • Administer the tax system: No. While the Police may eventually provide IR with information that impacts on the taxpayer’s tax obligations, the primary purpose is to enable the Police to investigate the taxpayer’s affairs. • Implement the tax system: No—as above. • Improve, research, or reform the tax system: No Does it support the execution or performance of any of the above? No. It does not seem to “support” any of those matters—again the nexus between the communication and IR’s duties appears too tenuous to justify the conclusion that it would “support” those duties. Accordingly, the inquiry would stop here—the information cannot be disclosed. The same conclusion is likely to be reached where requests for information are received from other government agencies or third parties in circumstances where the information would not be covered by a specific exception and does not also assist IR in administering or implementing the tax system (see example 3 below). Because subsection (1B)(a) will never be satisfied, there is no need to consider Step Two of the section 81(1B) test, ie, the balancing exercise in paragraph (b). Example 2: Media statements A promoter of an innovative financial product has made statements in the product’s prospectus and other promotional material that suggests the product is the subject of a binding ruling from IR. However, while the promoter applied for a binding ruling, this was not granted by IR as it did not comply with the relevant tax law. IR is considering issuing a statement to the media that it has not issued a binding ruling on the financial product. Can that information be released under section 81? STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 10 inland revenue Department Section 81(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect legislation described in subsection (1C) Does the disclosure meet the criteria in relation to subsection (1) legislation? This is uncertain. It is arguably not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect any of the legislation. Section 81(4): Information may be released in specific cases Does the disclosure fall within one of the exceptions in paragraphs (a)–(u)? No, none of the specific exceptions apply in this case. Section 81(1B): Information may be released if it relates to a duty of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 81(1B)(a) – Step One Whether the communication is for the purpose of: • executing or performing of a duty (defined in section 81(8)(b)) of the Commissioner, or • supporting of such a duty? Is it for the purpose of executing or performing a duty, power or function of the Commissioner? No. Confirming that a ruling has not been issued is arguably a step removed from the ruling process, which might be considered part of administering the tax system. • Administer the tax system: No—for the same reason above. • Implement the tax system: No—for the same reason above. • Improve, research, or reform the tax system: No. Does it support the execution or performance of the above? Yes. The administration and implementation of the tax system requires a robust binding ruling system. If IR does not correct the misinformation currently in the public domain, the binding ruling regime’s reputation may be diminished. Section 81(1B)(b) – Step Two The Commissioner considers that such communication is reasonable with regard to the relevant purpose described in subsection (a) and with regard to the following factors. Is the request reasonable when considered on balance under the factors under section 81(1B)(b)? The integrity of the tax system; and Yes. The integrity of the tax system requires a robust binding ruling system. This will be undermined if IR does not challenge a statement about obtaining a ruling that is untrue. The importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; and Yes for taxpayers more generally. The communication will protect the reputation of the ruling system—so encourages more taxpayers to use it. The communication may adversely impact on the promoter’s voluntary compliance. Any personal or commercial impact of the communication; and The product is likely to be adversely affected by the communication. Conversely, each potential investor may be better off by not investing in the product as a result of IR’s intervention. The resources available to the Commissioner; and Minimal resource will be required to make the disclosure. The public availability of the information. The information is not currently publicly available. The communication would seem reasonable in relation to supporting administration of the tax system—it is merely stating that as a matter of fact there is no binding ruling on the product. The proposed communication does not, for example, outline why IR thinks the tax laws relied on by the promoter do not apply to the financial product. The communication by IR to the media is reasonable having regard to the factors set out in section 81(1B) and the information should be released. 11 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 Example 3: Sharing data with Treasury Treasury is working jointly with IR on tax policy development. It is considered that it would be worthwhile to share with Treasury tax information for such purposes in the GST area. Specifically, they have asked for information on the number of GST investigations relating to the sale of real property. Can that information be released under section 81? Section 81(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect legislation described in subsection (1C) Does the disclosure meet the criteria under subsection (1) legislation? No, it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the GST Act. The information relates to the future amendments of the Act rather than the present carrying into effect of the Act. Section 81(4): Information may be released in specific cases Does the disclosure fall within one of the exceptions in paragraphs (a)–(u) No. Section 81(4)(e) only allows the release of information to Treasury for revenue forecasting but not for developing tax policy. Section 81(1B): Information may be released if it relates to a duty of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 81(1B)(a) – Step One Whether the communication is for the purpose of: • executing or performing a duty (defined in section 81(8)(b)) of the Commissioner, or • the supporting of such a duty? Is it for the purpose of executing or performing a duty, power or function of the Commissioner? No. The duty, power or function in question is arguably that of the Treasury, not IR. • Administer the tax system: No. It might impact on the future administration of the tax system but not the current tax system. • Implement the tax system: No—as above. • Improve, research, or reform the tax system: Yes. The development of tax policy by IR jointly with Treasury is done to improve research and reform the tax system. Does it support the execution or performance of any of the above? To the extent there was any doubt, the disclosure to Treasury could also be seen as “supporting” IR’s duty to improve, research or reform the tax system. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 12 inland revenue Department Section 81(1B)(b) – Step Two The Commissioner considers that such communication is reasonable with regard to the relevant purpose described in subsection (a) and with regard to the following factors. Is the request reasonable when considered on balance under the factors under section 81(1B)(b)? The integrity of the tax system; and Yes. In order to maintain the integrity of the tax system, it is necessary to review current tax policy and research and develop new policy on an ongoing basis to keep up with best practices in tax administration. The importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; and Yes. The information will lead to more robust GST legislation in the area of land transactions and encourage greater compliance. Any personal or commercial impact of the communication; and This is likely to be a neutral factor as Treasury is only at the stage of developing tax policy and the impact may not necessarily be adverse. The resources available to the Commissioner; and Minimal resource will be required to make the disclosure. The public availability of the information. The information may not be publicly available. The request by Treasury is reasonable having regard to the factors set out in section 81(1B) and the information should be released. Example 4: Discussions with tax pooling intermediary There are a number of criteria that must be satisfied before IR can accept a transfer of funds from a tax pooling intermediary on behalf of a tax agent or its advisor. Where IR considers that one or more of the criteria are not satisfied, can IR communicate the reasons for rejecting the transfer with the tax pooling intermediary? What if during the course of that conversation, the tax pooling intermediary asked for details of the taxpayer’s tax payments over the course of a year? Section 81(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect legislation described in subsection (1C) Does the disclosure meet the criteria in relation to subsection (1) legislation? No, it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the Income Tax Act. The communication could be made with either the taxpayer or tax agent directly, so it is not reasonably necessary. Section 81(4): Information may be released in specific cases Does the disclosure fall within one of the exceptions in paragraphs (a)–(u)? No. Section 81(4)(lb) allows for communication regarding the details of a deposit but does not extend further. In addition, it is generally unlikely, that any other specific exception will apply. 13 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 Section 81(1B): Information may be released if it relates to a duty of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 81(1B)(a) – Step One Whether the communication is for the purpose of: • executing or performing of a duty (defined in section 81(8)(b)) of the Commissioner, or • the supporting of such a duty? Is it for the purpose of executing or performing a duty, power or function of the Commissioner? Possibly. It has some connection with the Commissioner’s duty in the collection of taxes. • Administer the tax system: Possibly for communicating the reason for rejecting a transfer. Not for providing taxpayer tax payment details more generally. • Implement the tax system: As above. • Improve, research, or reform the tax system: No. Does it support the execution or performance of any of the above? To the extent that there is an argument that the communications do not enable IR to perform or execute its duty to collect tax payments via the tax pooling arrangement, the communication regarding the reasons for rejection would “support” that duty. However, the same conclusion would not be drawn for communicating any more general details about the taxpayer’s tax payment history. The latter communication would not fall within section 81(1B)(a). Section 81(1B)(b) – Step Two The Commissioner considers that such communication is reasonable with regard to the relevant purpose described in subsection (a) and with regard to the following factors. Is the request reasonable when considered on balance under the factors under section 81(1B)(b)? The integrity of the tax system; and The tax pooling system is an important way in which tax payments are made. Any communication that makes that process run efficiently bolsters the tax system’s integrity. The importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; and Similar to the above— voluntary compliance involves ensuring tax is paid on time. The tax pooling system supports this and the communication enables those transfers to occur more efficiently. Any personal or commercial impact of the communication; and This is likely to be a neutral factor as both parties are already aware of what the taxpayer wants to achieve (ie, a transfer). The communication is essentially trying to ascertain whether this can occur. The resources available to the Commissioner; and Minimal resource will be required to make the disclosure. The public availability of the information. The information will not be publicly available. The communication of the reasons for rejecting the transfer is reasonable having regard to the factors set out in section 81(1B)(b) and can therefore occur. However, as previously noted, the exception would not extend to the disclosure of the taxpayer’s history of tax payments. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 14 inland revenue Department Example 5: Disclosing competitor’s information IR is investigating an industry to determine whether participants in the industry are properly returning all of their income. A number of taxpayers are arguing that IR has no basis for determining what amount of income their business is generating and what their net profits are. It is proposed to disclose the tax return and accounts of a fully compliant competitor to those taxpayers. Is IR entitled to disclose that information? Section 81(1): Information may be released for the purpose of carrying into effect legislation described in subsection (1C) Does the disclosure meet the criteria in relation to subsection (1) legislation? No. While there may be circumstances where third- party information will be disclosed it is not reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the Income Tax Act. The non-compliant taxpayer’s position can be determined through investigating its affairs and through the use of general industry information in any case. Section 81(4): Information may be released in specific cases Does the disclosure fall within one of the exceptions in paragraphs (a)–(u)? No, none of the specific exceptions apply in this case. Section 81(1B): Information may be released if it relates to a duty of the Commissioner having regard to five factors Section 81(1B)(a) – Step One Whether the communication is for the purpose of: • executing or performing a duty (defined in section 81(8)(b)) of the Commissioner, or • the supporting of such a duty? Is it for the purpose of executing or performing a duty, power or function of the Commissioner? Possibly. It has some connection with the collection of the correct amount of taxes. Administer the tax system:Arguably. IR is more likely to get a non-compliant taxpayer to agree to return the proper tax if it can show actual evidence of a compliant taxpayer’s tax affairs. Implement the tax system:No. Improve, research, or reform the tax system: No. Does it support the execution or performance of any of the above? To the extent that there is an argument that the communications do not allow IR to perform or execute its duty to collect tax, the communication would seem to “support” that duty. 15 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 Section 81(1B)(b) – Step Two The Commissioner considers that such communication is reasonable with regard to the relevant purpose described in subsection (a) and with regard to the following factors. Is the request reasonable after having considered on balance the factors under section 81(1B)(b)? The integrity of the tax system; and It could be argued that the tax system’s integrity is improved by attempting to bring non-compliant taxpayers within the tax system. However, it is harmed by disclosing information about a taxpayer’s tax affairs to a direct competitor. The importance of promoting compliance by taxpayers, especially voluntary compliance; and As above—compliance might be improved in relation to the non- compliant taxpayers. However, it will not be improved in relation to the taxpayer whose information is disclosed—nor will the general body of taxpayers be encouraged to comply if the information is going to end up in the hands of their competitors. Any personal or commercial impact of the communication; and The taxpayer whose information is disclosed is likely to be adversely affected by the disclosure. The resources available to the Commissioner; and Minimal resource will be required to make the disclosure. The public availability of the information. The information will not be publicly available. After balancing the above factors, it is concluded that the communication is not reasonable having regard to the factors set out in section 81(1B)(b). In particular, a disclosure of such specific information about a taxpayer’s tax affairs will have an adverse commercial impact on it. Competitors will discover sensitive information about them and there is no guarantee it will influence those competitors’ attitude to compliance or not. In addition, the possible negative impact this will have on how taxpayers generally feel about the confidentiality of the information held by IR bolsters the conclusion that the communication should not occur. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 16 inland revenue Department APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL TO SUPREME COURT BY ADMINISTRATOR DISMISSED CaseDamien Grant & Steven Khov v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date30 November 2011 Act(s)Companies Act 1993 KeywordsVoluntary administration, insolvency, casting vote Summary The Supreme Court confirmed that a casting vote in voluntary administrations can only be used to break a deadlock in number. Impact of decision The ruling confirms the Commissioner’s interpretation of when a casting vote can be used in a watershed meeting. Facts On 5 December 2008, the appellants were appointed voluntary administrators for three publishing companies. There was common ownership and directorship of the three companies (with a minor exception). The one of particular relevance to this matter is Jones Publishing. Jones Publishing went into voluntary administration. At the watershed meeting, a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) was proposed. The Commissioner voted against and the seven other creditors voted for the resolution. The Commissioner was owed roughly 30% of the total debt and therefore the seven other creditors did not get the required 75% super-majority. The appellants argued at the watershed meeting, and continued to argue in the Courts, that they were entitled to exercise a casting vote in this situation. The Commissioner argued at the watershed meeting, and subsequently through the Courts, that the casting vote can only be exercised when there is a requirement to break a deadlock in number (for example, five creditors for and five votes against) but not use the casting vote to break a deadlock between the number of creditors and the required super-majority of 75% of the total debt. The High Court agreed with the Commissioner’s view and this was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. Decision The application for leave to appeal was dismissed with costs. The Supreme Court found that the Commissioner’s interpretation of the casting vote issue is correct: While the second issue may be arguable, we are not persuaded that the applicant has any prospect of succeeding on the casting vote issue. We are in full agreement with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that the chairman was not empowered to exercise a casting vote in the circumstances. CLAIM SIMPLY UNTENABLE CaseThe Harsono Family Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date10 November 2011 Act(s)Goods and Services Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994, Judicature Act 1908 KeywordsStrike-out, abuse of court process, discretion Summary The Court had no jurisdiction to consider the Harsono Family Trust’s (“HFT”) claim, nor was it tenable. Furthermore, the claim brought by HFT against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue was found to be an abuse of process because HFT deliberately attempted to misconstrue the true nature of the payment. Impact of decision This decision confirms the well-settled principles relating to strike-out and abuse of process. LEGAL DECiSiONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, Court of Appeal, Privy Council and the Supreme Court. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. 17 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES Facts Company F acquired a property at 45 Anzac Ave, Auckland, on 17 January 2001. On 15 July 2002 HFT purported to enter into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase the property for $1,100,000 plus goods and services tax (GST) ($137,500) while the property was already the subject of an existing sale and purchase agreement to another potential purchaser. On 2 August 2002, HFT paid $137,500 to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“Commissioner”) as output tax on the sale. The Commissioner paid a GST input credit of $137,500 to HFT on 28 January 2004. On 27 October 2005 the High Court found, inter alia, that the purported sale of the property to HFT was invalid. The Court also found that HFT had wrongly induced and procured the vendor to breach its previous sale contract with the potential purchaser and HFT was involved in an unlawful means conspiracy causing loss to that earlier potential purchaser. On 19 July 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed HFT’s appeal against these findings. Because the initial sale was invalid and was overturned, on 5 March 2007 the Commissioner issued a GST assessment which reversed the input tax credit issued in 2004. HFT then entered into the disputes and challenge proceedings as provided by Parts 4A and 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) to contest the reversal of the GST input tax credit. On 14 May 2009, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) confirmed the correctness of the assessment and found in favour of the Commissioner (case Z16). HFT then applied to have the TRA judgment recalled. On 5 August 2009 the TRA dismissed HFT’s application for recall. The TRA held, inter alia, that HFT’s recall application was “inconsistent with the objective of finality and certainty in litigation and is an abuse of process”. HFT then appealed the TRA’s dismissal of the recall application in the High Court. On 15 September 2009, Venning J dismissed the appeal on the basis that there was no jurisdiction. HFT persisted in its dissatisfaction with the Commissioner’s assessment which reversed the $137,500 of input tax paid. On 16 March 2010, HFT issued civil proceedings against the Commissioner based on unjust enrichment, relief under section 94A of the Judicature Act 1908, money had and received, and restitution. The Commissioner applied to strike out HFT’s claim. The application was granted and HFT’s claim was struck out on 21 March 2011 by virtue of the non-appearance of HFT or its legal representatives. HFT made an application to set aside that decision on the basis that the non-appearance was inadvertent. The Commissioner by consent agreed to set aside that decision. The strike-out application was then reheard by the District Court on 26 October 2011. Decision Whether HFT’s claim should be struck out Judge Wiltens first canvassed the requirements in the District Court Rules relating to strike-out, particularly Rule 2.50. A claim may be struck out if the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action; or is likely to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay; or is otherwise an abuse of process of the Court. Judge Wiltens also noted the well-settled criteria to be applied when deciding to strike out a cause of action, from A-G v Prince and Gardner \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA). The Commissioner submitted that by virtue of section 109 of the TAA, the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the assessments being challenged by HFT. The Commissioner also submitted that the claim was untenable and could not succeed as there were no valid grounds for HFT to dispute the assessment. Whether the claim was tenable Judge Wiltens noted that section 165 of the TAA provides that any person who pays tax for, or on behalf of, any other person is entitled to recover that amount from that other person as a debt. HFT paid the output tax on 2 August 2002 on behalf of the then-registered proprietor. Therefore, HFT could claim this amount against the then-registered proprietor, not against the Commissioner. Judge Wiltens concluded that HFT’s claim was simply untenable. Whether the claim was an abuse of process Judge Wiltens considered the law relating to abuse of process, particularly the decision of the Court of Appeal in Felton v Johnson \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA). The Court considered carefully the submissions by HFT. HFT had tried to re-characterise its payment of GST output tax as “money” rather than “tax”. Judge Wiltens found that this was “simplistic” and deliberately attempted to misconstrue the true nature of the payment. 18 inland revenue Department ABUSE OF COURT PROCESS TO RE- LITIGATE MISCONCEIVED CASES CaseClarence John Faloon v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date8 November 2011 Act(s)Tax Administration Act 1994 KeywordsMischievous, frivolous, vexatious, strike- out Summary Since the taxpayer’s proceeding was of the same nature as others that have been unsuccessful it was found to be abuse of court process. Impact of decision The fact pattern involved in this case is fairly unique. Nevertheless it does re-affirm the fact that the Courts are reluctant to allow the re-litigation of misconceived cases. Facts By the Commissioner’s counsel’s submission this is the twenty-eighth proceeding filed in connection with events which first occurred over 40 years ago regarding land owned by the taxpayer’s family company (then controlled by his father). Mr Faloon previously endeavoured to return income which he considered was compensation for land compulsorily acquired. While the reason for this was unclear, the Judge surmised that his purpose seemed to be that if this was accepted by the Commissioner then this may form the basis upon which Mr Falloon can pursue a new claim for further compensation. The claim in this proceeding concerns a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) filed by Mr Faloon, which was rejected by a Notice of Response (NOR). In 2009 Mr Faloon filed proceedings challenging the NOR, which were struck out. After this previous unsuccessful proceeding, Mr Faloon wrote to the Commissioner inquiring whether he would be issuing a disclosure notice related to the same taxpayer’s NOPA that gave rise to the earlier strike-out proceedings. The Commissioner responded in the negative in a letter (“the letter”). Decision Mr Faloon’s claim was struck out and generally dismissed on the basis that the proceeding prosecuted by Mr Faloon was mischievous, frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of Court process. Furthermore, the letter was not a disputable decision and could not be used by Mr Falloon as an attempt at re-litigation of earlier decisions. Associate Judge Christiansen states \[35\]: ... Mr Faloon is conscientiously rejecting each and every decision which is not in his favour by steadfastly clinging to the slightest glimmer of hope which might be in his favour. He continued \[at 36\]: Mr Faloon is confused in his belief that he or the trusts he represents are related parties or retain a right of suit in connection with any right of claim his family companies may have had in the outcome of the taking of certain land in which process compensation was ordered to be paid. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF COMMISSIONER’S REFUSAL TO ACCEPT AMENDED GST RETURNS CaseFB Duvall Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date15 December 2011 Act(s)Goods and Services Act 1985, Income Tax Act 1976 KeywordsJudicial review, JG Russell Summary The Court ordered the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to reconsider his decision to not allow the taxpayers to amend their GST returns to exclude previously returned output tax and therefore obtain a GST refund. Impact of decision The Court indicated that the Commissioner was entitled to address both sides of the GST position (both inputs and outputs) when considering objections. Facts This is a JG Russell-related matter. FB Duvall Limited (“FBD”) and others made late objections to their GST treatment. These objections were based upon the outcome in the Miller & O’Neil income tax litigation. In the Miller litigation, the Courts found that no actual services were being supplied by any Russell entities involved in his template. In response, FBD sought to amend its GST returns to exclude output tax but to continue to claim input taxes. This had the effect of creating refunds for the company. 19 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 This was allowed by the Court of Appeal (FB Duval v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,658). The Commissioner took the view this case was decided on procedural grounds and not on its merits. FBD and other companies then filed more GST returns on a similar basis—seeking to exclude outputs but to continue to claim inputs. However, these were never accepted by the Commissioner and the judicial review was about this failure to accept (or reject) the amended returns. It was not about the correctness or otherwise of those amended returns. Decision The High Court allowed the judicial review regarding the GST issue and ordered the Commissioner to accept or reject the late returns (and if accepting them to make a decision on their merits). The High Court considered the Commissioner had erred in not determining these objections, which had been unaddressed since the 1990s. The distinction drawn between GST and income tax was correct but on the facts of the Russell template, not supported. The template litigation had determined that no services had been supplied under the template. The earlier FBD decision was confined to a procedural point. OPTIONAL CONVERTIBLE NOTES CAN BE TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENTS CaseAlesco New Zealand Ltd and Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date12 December 2011 Act(s)Tax Administration Act 1994 KeywordsOptional convertible notes, determination G22, tax avoidance, reconstruction, abusive tax position Summary The Court held that the use of particular optional convertible notes (OCNs) was a tax avoidance arrangement because the arrangement was an artificial device and it was not within Parliamentary contemplation. Impact of decision This is an important judgment for the Commissioner. The final result of this case will most probably influence the outcome of other, similar cases. The total amount of tax across all similar OCN cases is approximately $226 million plus use-of-money interest. Facts Alesco New Zealand Ltd (“Alesco NZ”) and certain subsidiaries challenged the Commissioner’s assessments were made as a result of him declaring an arrangement void as a tax avoidance arrangement. The assessments disallowed interest deductions and loss offset elections and imposed abusive tax position shortfall penalties. Alesco NZ is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alesco Corporation (“Corporation”), an Australian company. The arrangement involved the use of OCNs in an intra-group situation to finance the acquisition of two businesses in New Zealand. Alesco NZ issued OCNs to Corporation in return for advances totalling $78 million for a term of 10 years. At maturity, Corporation had the option of being repaid the $78 million or converting the OCNs into shares in Alesco NZ. No interest was payable on the OCNs. At the relevant times the Commissioner’s Determination G22 was applicable. The application of Determination G22 to the terms of the OCN resulted in deemed interest expenses for Alesco NZ in the 2003 to 2008 years. Decision Following Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115, Heath J held that the test of whether the tax advantages obtained were permissible is whether Parliament could have contemplated that the financial arrangement rules would be used to obtain the interest deductions claimed. The High Court held that the OCNs were tax avoidance arrangements. There were three reasons for this. First, the OCNs were designed to enable Alesco NZ to claim interest deductions without any corresponding return of taxable income. Secondly, the arrangement was an artificial device designed only to secure a tax advantage in New Zealand that could not otherwise have been obtained. Thirdly, the Court found that the deductions claimed were not within Parliamentary contemplation because no real interest expense was incurred and the notional interest claimed did not represent a real economic cost. On the issue of reconstruction, the Court accepted the Commissioner’s contention that he had the discretion to counteract the tax advantage as he thought fit. He was not obliged to apply what Alesco NZ said would have occurred if the avoidance arrangement had not been entered into. On the issue of shortfall penalties, the Court found that Alesco NZ entered into the arrangement with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. It was therefore liable for an abusive tax position shortfall penalty. LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 20 inland revenue Department APPROPRIATE COURSE FOR DEALING WITH AN ALLEGATION THAT THE HIGH COURT WAS FUNCTUS OFFICIO CaseRedcliffe Forestry Venture Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date14 December 2011 Act(s)High Court Rules KeywordsProtest to jurisdiction, strike-out Summary This decision concerned the appropriate course to take when the High Court is confronted with an allegation that the High Court was functus officio and thus lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings. Impact of decision Although this is a procedural decision it concerns the Trinity scheme. The Commissioner is yet to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court or continue with the setting aside application in the High Court, following repleading by the taxpayers. Facts In September 2009 the taxpayers filed a proceeding in the High Court seeking an order to set aside a December 2004 High Court judgment Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2004) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC). This was the original High Court judgment (upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court) finding that the Trinity scheme was a tax avoidance arrangement. The Commissioner responded to this setting-aside proceeding by filing a protest to jurisdiction and an application under rule 5.49 of the High Court Rules (“HCRs”) for an order dismissing the proceeding. The Commissioner asserted that the High Court was functus officio and thus lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings and that any application to set aside the 2004 judgment must be made to the Supreme Court. The taxpayers conversely asserted that the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain their setting-aside proceeding and that there was no restraint on their bringing that proceeding to the High Court. The setting-aside proceeding pleaded that the Commissioner presented a false case to the High Court in 2004 which resulted in the High Court making an order which it could not legally make and would not otherwise have made. The High Court (Venning J) concluded that fraud had not been alleged which is a requirement for the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction to set aside the 2004 judgment. The Commissioner’s assessments and the High Court’s findings of tax avoidance, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, remained valid. The High Court was functus officio and the setting-aside proceeding was dismissed (Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] 1 NZLR 336 (HC)). The taxpayers submitted in the Court of Appeal that arguments as to the meaning and scope of the pleadings are to be decided in a strike-out application should the Commissioner make such an application under rule 15.1 of the HCRs. In the High Court, the taxpayers were deprived of any opportunity to re-plead and or present evidence of their claim of fraud. The Commissioner responded by submitting that (inter alia) the Commissioner was correct to use a protest to jurisdiction as the means of bringing the setting-aside proceeding to an end. The taxpayers had abandoned three Trinity scheme appeals which rendered this setting-aside proceeding moot and an abuse of process which should be struck out. The taxpayers were wrong to submit that the High Court had general jurisdiction to set aside one of its own judgments that had been confirmed on appeal. The High Court did have jurisdiction to entertain an application to set aside the 2004 judgment that it had been obtained by fraud but the taxpayers were alleging error of law on the part of the Supreme Court and not fraud by the Commissioner. Decision The Court stated that had the Commissioner applied to strike out the proceeding it would have been made under rule 15.1 of the HCRs. Such an application proceeds on the assumption that the facts pleaded in the claim are true except where a proceeding alleges fraud. In that case there is an obligation on the plaintiff to produce probative evidence to support the claim of fraud. The protest to jurisdiction application was made under rule 5.49 of the HCRs. The Court stated that this procedure only concerns the Court’s jurisdiction to hear and determine the application or proceeding, not the Court’s jurisdiction to grant relief in a proceeding within its jurisdiction. The Court held that rule 5.49 of the HCRs was not the appropriate vehicle for the Commissioner’s challenge to the setting-aside proceeding \[58\]. The Court went on to state that: The question whether the High Court’s jurisdiction to set aside its own judgments that have been appealed is limited 21 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24 No 1 February 2012 to cases where fraud is alleged and proved, or is wider in scope, goes to the High Court’s jurisdiction to grant the remedy sought by the appellants. But, as we have said, that is not what the rule 5.49 procedure is designed to address \[65\]. Having found for the taxpayers, the Court affirmed that the taxpayers should now be able to amend their pleadings, put forward what they allege as probative evidence of fraud and argue their repleaded case contending that the evidence brings the case within the fraud exception or that the fraud exception should be broadened to encompass their case. FREEZING ORDERS AGAINST THIRD PARTY CaseCommissioner of Inland Revenue v Giovanni Holdings Ltd and Ors Decision date16 November 2011 Act(s)Public Finance Act 1989, High Court Rules, Land Transfer Act 2007 KeywordsUndertaking, freezing orders Summary The Court considered that the freezing order could not be upheld without more evidence and an undertaking by the Commissioner. Impact of decision Where the Commissioner has issued assessments and an enforcement action to freeze assets to assist in the collection of the debt from a property owned by a third party, the Commissioner should indicate that relief sought against the third party in his statement of claim. Facts Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark have been assessed by the Commissioner for promoter penalties amounting to over $6 million. Ms Clark has also been assessed for income tax. On 6 September 2010 the Commissioner sought and obtained a freezing order without notice over a property owned by Giovanni Holdings Ltd (“Giovanni”). The freezing order was obtained on the basis that Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark were/are the beneficial owners of the property. Proceedings On 18 August 2011 the Commissioner applied for a recall of a discovery order made on 28 July 2011. McKenzie J convened a telephone conference for 5 October 2011 and during that conference ordered a hearing to determine whether the freezing order should continue. Decision The Court noted that the freezing order applies to land of which Giovanni is the registered proprietor and the Commissioner’s claim is that Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark are/were the beneficial owners of the property. McKenzie J stated that the statement of claim filed by the Commissioner does not seek relief against Giovanni. His Honour acknowledged, however, that this fact does not bar the Commissioner from seeking a freezing order against Giovanni, on the basis the assets are in truth the assets of Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark. The Court considered that while the Commissioner could establish he had a good arguable case for a freezing order on the basis of the assessments against Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark, the Commissioner is required to show the property is that of Mr Petroulias and Ms Clark to establish a case for a freezing order. The Court considered that an undertaking as to damages is a pre-requisite for the grant of a freezing order. Accordingly, the Commissioner was ordered to file an undertaking as to damages to compensate all or any damage sustained as a consequence of the freezing order. JUDICIAL REVIEW STRUCK OUT CaseTannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date20 December 2011 Act(s)Tax Administration Act 1994, Inland Revenue Act 1974, Income Tax Act 1976 KeywordsJudicial review, section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Summary The Supreme Court held that only in exceptional cases can a judicial review be permitted to reverse tax assessments. Impact of decision This is an important judgment for the Commissioner. It defines and narrows the circumstances in which judicial review of disputable decisions may be available to taxpayers. Facts Tannadyce Investments Limited (“T”) appealed against a Court of Appeal judgment striking out, as an abuse of process, its judicial review proceeding seeking review of certain of its income tax assessments. T alleged that it could not file various returns (and follow the disputes procedure) because the Commissioner was LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 22 inland revenue Department in possession of, and withheld from it, the documents necessary for it to do so. T alleged that as a result of the aforesaid, the Commissioner’s assessments were invalid. At issue was whether the Court of Appeal was correct to strike out T’s application for judicial review as an abuse of process. Decision 1. The Court was unanimous in concluding that the Court of Appeal had been correct to strike out T’s judicial review proceeding. T was obliged to establish a sufficient factual foundation for its contention that it was practically not possible to follow the statutory procedures. It failed to do that. 2. However, the Court was split (3:2) on the issue of when a taxpayer may use judicial review to challenge assessments and other disputable decisions. 3. For the majority, the crucial question was whether, and if so how, the remedy of judicial review can stand with section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The majority held that disputable decisions may not be challenged by judicial review unless the taxpayer cannot practically invoke the relevant statutory procedure. Cases of that kind are likely to be extremely rare. 4. The majority narrowed the circumstances in which judicial review of disputable decisions may be available and in doing so overruled the Court of Appeal in Westpac Banking Corp v CIR \[2009\] NZCA 24. It held that assessments that are challenged as legal nullities fall within section 109 and therefore cannot be subject to judicial review. Section 109 clearly states that, except in a challenge proceeding, “no disputable decision may be disputed in a court or in any proceedings on any ground whatsoever”. It should not be construed so as to create an exception for where the circumstances are “exceptional”. 5. The minority preferred not to frame a definitive rule as to when judicial review is available. It preferred to recognise that in general the right to challenge a disputable decision in a court or Review Authority (ie, the TRA), that is required to act judicially, is able to provide superior remedies to judicial review, while also recognising that there will be exceptional cases where judicial review should be permitted.

The statement advises taxpayers (and their advisers) about what to expect when the Commissioner uses these powers, and the Commissioner’s expectations of taxpayers. Operational Statement OS 13/02: Section 17 Notices This statement outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing notices, including third party requests, under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The section, which relates to requisitions for information, is one of Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers. Other information-gathering powers (such as section 16) can be and are used by the Commissioner in conjunction with section 17 but they are not discussed in this statement. 2 18 Legislation and determinations Determination CFC 2013/01: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWEr insurance Limited) This determination applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in the Kingdom of Tonga for the 2012–13 income year. 28 Legal decisions – case notes interest deductibility and nexus TrA 03/11 The disputant did not incur the interest payments and no direct nexus existed between the payments made by the disputant and the disputant’s income-earning process. interest deductibility and nexus TrA 02/11 No direct nexus existed between the payments made by the disputant and the disputant’s income-earning process. Existing breeding business required before deductions allowable The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in their challenge to the Commissioner’s disallowance of deductions claimed for the cost of the colt by the plaintiffs as members of the syndicate. The High Court found a breeding business must be in existence before a deduction is allowable pursuant to section EC 39 of the Income Tax Act. An intention to have a breeding business at some time in the future did not meet the requirements of the section. Eligibility of goods to be zero-rated for GST purposes The taxpayer entered into an agreement to export goods to an overseas-based purchaser. After entering the agreement there was a change of approach by the purchaser who arranged for the goods to be used in New Zealand in order to manufacture different goods. The taxpayer argued that its goods were still ultimately exported and therefore that supply could be zero-rated for goods and services tax (“GST”) purposes. The Court found that the underlying goods had been consumed in New Zealand and therefore were not eligible to be zero-rated. 29 30 31 33 2 inland revenue Department OPERATIONAL STATEMENT OS 13/01: THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE’S SEARCH POWERS OpErATiONAL STATEmENTS Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed. They are intended to be a preliminary view in the absence of a public binding ruling or an interpretation statement on the subject. Introduction 1. This statement outlines how Inland Revenue will exercise one of the Commissioner’s information gathering powers: the search powers under sections 16, 16B and 16C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. The statement aims to provide taxpayers and their advisers with information about what to expect when the Commissioner uses these powers, and the Commissioner’s expectations of taxpayers. 2. This O perational Statement is supplemented by the Standard Practice Statement 10/02 Imaging of electronic storage media (or any subsequent replacements of this SPS) and is to be read in conjunction with that SPS. 3. Legislative references within this Operational Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Application 4. This Operational Statement applies from 1 September 2013. Summary 5. Under section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and Part Four of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (SSA) the Commissioner, or any authorised Inland Revenue officer, has powers to fully and freely access places and documents for the purpose of inspecting any documents, property, process or matter which are considered necessary or relevant for the purpose of collecting any tax or carrying out any function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. 6. These powers are granted to the Commissioner to enable her to carry out her statutory duties. These duties include those set out in sections 6 and 6A, to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect over time the highest net revenue practicable within the law, having regard to the Commissioner’s resources, the importance of promoting compliance and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 7. Sect ions 16B and 16C support these powers of access by enabling the Commissioner to remove documents for copying and/or full and complete inspection. 8. Section 16(1) is a warrantless power of entry. This means that, except for private dwellings, the Commissioner does not need to obtain a warrant to access all lands, buildings and places and to all documents. 9. In ord er to access a private dwelling, the Commissioner must obtain either: (a) a warrant under section 16(4); or (b) the consent of an occupier. 10. The Commissioner can remove documents, including electronically stored information, and retain them for copying or inspection or both. In order to remove documents from any place, for inspection, the Commissioner must obtain either: (a) a warrant under section 16C(2); or (b) the co nsent of an occupier. 11. Warrants can only be obtained from District Court Judges, Judges of the High Court, or from other issuing officers that have been authorised by the Attorney- General (refer to the definition of “issuing officer” in the SSA and to section 108 of the SSA: other issuing officers can include Registrars, Deputy Registrars, Community Magistrates and Justices of the Peace when authorised by the Attorney-General). 12. Information used for warrant applications will be confidential until, in most cases, the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation. 13. Inlan d Revenue officers will apply best practice in using these search powers, including following these guidelines, to ensure compliance with sections 4, 5, 6, 21 and 22 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (Bill of Rights Act). 14. The SSA provides a number of clarifications to the Commissioner’s powers, as well as setting out requirements for Inland Revenue officers and taxpayers to follow. The SSA also sets out the process by which warrants are obtained. 15. This O perational Statement (OS) provides taxpayers and their advisers with information about what to expect when the Commissioner exercises her search powers, including information on the protocols the Commissioner will follow in relation to legal privilege 3 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 OpErATiONAL STATEmENTS Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed. They are intended to be a preliminary view in the absence of a public binding ruling or an interpretation statement on the subject. OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS and the non-disclosure right under sections 20 and 20B to 20G of the TAA. This OS also provides information on the Commissioner’s expectations of taxpayers and their advisers, and what the legislation requires them to do. 16. The Co mmissioner’s search powers will generally be exercised when, in the Commissioner’s opinion, other means of obtaining information are inappropriate or inadequate. Other information gathering powers do not have to be used before the Commissioner exercises the section 16 search powers, but these search powers could be exercised in conjunction with those other information-gathering powers. 17. Occupiers of places accessed by the Commissioner under section 16 are required by section 16(2) to assist the Commissioner by providing all reasonable facilities and assistance for the effective exercise of section 16, and to answer all proper questions relating to that exercise. Inland Revenue officers can use reasonable force, including the services of a locksmith, where necessary to open property, such as locked doors and cabinets. 18. When d ocuments are removed, owners will be provided with the opportunity to inspect and copy documents at the Inland Revenue office to which the documents are taken. And where practicable, Inland Revenue officers will follow a standard process in relation to the protections in section 20 (legal privilege) and sections 20B to 20G (non-disclosure right). 19. Occupiers and other taxpayers who take steps to destroy documents or who fail to assist as required under section 16, or otherwise obstruct the Commissioner, could be liable to prosecution under the TAA and SSA. The penalties for such offences range from fines to sentences of imprisonment. 20. The Commissioner considers the powers provided in sections 16, 16B and 16C to be essential to Inland Revenue’s compliance functions and duties under the Revenue Acts. These powers will be exercised responsibly, preserving legal privilege and non- disclosure rights of taxpayers (and others), and in compliance with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act where applicable. Legislation 21. The following legislative provisions are relevant to this OS: (a) Sections 6, 21, 22, 23 and 28 of the Bill of Rights Act. (b) Sect ions 16, 16B and 16C of the TAA. (c) Section 20 of the TAA (the legal privilege applying to information subject to the information- gathering powers in sections 16, 17, 17A, 18 and 19). (d) Sections 20B to 20G of the TAA (the non- disclosure right for tax advice documents subject to the information-gathering powers in sections 16, 17, 17A, 18 and 19). (e) Section 3, subparts 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10 of Part 4 (except sections 102, 103(3)(b)(ii), 103(7), 115(1) (b), 118, 119 and 130(4)), and the Schedule of the SSA. (f) Section 60 of the Evidence Act 2006 (EA 2006). Search and Surveillance Act 2012 22. The SSA aims to ensure search and surveillance powers are exercised consistently and in ways which balance law enforcement priorities with civil rights. 23. The powers in the TAA are supplemented by various provisions of the SSA. These include clarifications to the Commissioner’s powers, requirements for Inland Revenue officers and taxpayers to follow, and the process by which warrants are obtained. 24. Not all of the provisions in the SSA apply to the Commissioner. Refer to Appendix I for a table summarising the parts of the SSA that apply (including an explanation of how only those parts of the SSA that are listed in the SSA Schedule apply). 25. The SSA takes effect on the TAA from the earlier of the date of effect given by any Order in Council for the application of the SSA to the TAA, or 1 April 2014. 26. Refer to Appendix I for an explanation of how the SSA applies to the TAA. Definitions 27. The following terms are used in this OS: Computer system Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows: computer system (a) Means— (i) a computer; or (ii) 2 or mor e interconnected computers; (iii) any communication links between computers or to remote terminals or another device; or (iv) 2 or mor e interconnected computers combined with any communication links between computers to remote terminals or any other device; and (b) includ es any part of the items described in paragraph (a) and all related input, output, processing, storage, software or communication facilities, and stored data. 4 inland revenue Department Document Section 3 of the TAA defines this as follows: “document” means— (a) a thing that is used to hold, in or on the thing and in any form, items of information: (b) an item of information held in or on a thing referred to in paragraph (a): (c) a device associated with a thing referred to in paragraph (a) and required for the expression, in any form, of an item of information held in or on the thing Enforcement officer Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows: enforcement officer means— (a) a constable; or (b) any person authorised by an enactment specified in column 2 of the Schedule, or by any other enactment that expressly applies any provision in Part 4, to exercise a power of entry, search, inspection, examination, or seizure. Inland Revenue officers to whom the Commissioner has delegated the authority to exercise section 16 fall within this definition of “enforcement officer.” Full and complete inspection Section 3 of the TAA defines this as follows: “full and complete inspection”— (a) includes use as evidence in court proceedings: (b) does not include removal to make copies under section 16B Inland Revenue officer in charge This term is not defined in the TAA. This is the Inland Revenue officer who has charge of the search. They will identify themselves to the occupier and will be the primary contact point for the occupier and their adviser. This means that all communication between the occupier and Inland Revenue officers will be made through the officer in charge. This person has delegated authority from the Commissioner to exercise sections 16, 16B and 16C of the TAA and the ancillary provisions of the SSA. They will hold a delegation of authority card which can be shown to occupiers and their advisers as confirmation of the delegation. Necessary or relevant This term is not defined in the TAA. It is what is necessary or relevant in the Commissioner’s opinion that is pertinent. “Necessary or relevant” for the purposes of section 16 means that the documents are necessary or relevant for any of the following purposes: • Collecting any tax or duty under any of the Inland Revenue Acts; • Carrying out any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner; • Likely to provide any information required for the purposes of any of the Inland Revenue Acts or the Commissioner’s functions. Occupier The term occupier is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of sections 16 and 16C, the term is given a wide meaning. It includes all persons entitled to be on the premises, including employees, tenants and family members, and is not restricted to the owner or lease holder. This may or may not include the taxpayer under investigation. In this OS, the term “occupier” is used interchangeably with “taxpayer.” The Inland Revenue officer in charge will take reasonable measures to satisfy themselves that the occupier they are dealing with has lawful occupation of the place and is the appropriate person to deal with, and may also require other occupiers to provide assistance or answer proper questions. See also paragraphs 53(a) and 112. Private dwelling Section 16(7) of the TAA defines this as follows: “private dwelling” means any building or part of a building occupied as residential accommodation (including any garage, shed, and other building used in connection therewith); and includes any business premises that are or are within a private dwelling. Proper questions This term is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of section 16(2)(b), proper questions are those relating to the effective exercise of powers under section 16. This does not include investigative questions, but can include dual purpose questions (where discussion about documents, property, processes or other matters contained on the premises can overlap with the substantive investigation). See paragraphs 78 to 94 below for a discussion of how these will be managed. Reasonable facilities and assistance This term is not defined in the TAA. For the purposes of section 16(2)(a), the provision of reasonable facilities and assistance means such assistance as the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search considers necessary for the effective exercise of the search powers. This is reinforced by the SSA, and examples include unlocking cabinets, providing access to bathroom and kitchen facilities, the provision of electricity, and remaining outside specified areas when required to do so (see paragraphs 97 to 99 below). 5 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 Remote access search Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows: remote access search means a search of a thing such as an Internet data storage facility that does not have a physical address that a person can enter and search Search power Section 3 of the SSA defines this as follows: search power, in relation to any provision in this Act, means— (a) ever y search warrant issued under this Act or an enactment set out in column 2 of the Schedule to which that provision is applied; and (b) every power conferred under this Act or an enactment set out in column 2 of the Schedule to which that provision is applied, to enter and search, or enter and inspect or examine (without warrant) any place, vehicle, or other thing, or to search a person The power in section 16, including the power to access private dwellings under warrant, is a search power for the purposes of the SSA. Operational Practice Overview 28. This section sets out the operational practice authorised Inland Revenue officers will follow when exercising search powers, the Commissioner’s expectations of taxpayer and their advisers, and their statutory obligations. 29. This section covers the following matters: (a) When I nland Revenue will use section 16. (b) Warrants. (c) Entry, Identification and Advice of Rights. (d) Exer cising search powers (including taxpayers’ obligations): (i) Access; (ii) Search; (iii) Assist ants; (iv) Reasonable facilities and assistance; (v) Proper questions; (vi) Power to exclude; (vii) Othe r activities; (viii) Elec tronically stored information; (ix) Remo val of documents. (e) Legal advisers, tax agents and support persons. (f) Lega l privilege and the non-disclosure right. (g) Afte r the search: (i) Access to documents; (ii) Retur n of documents. (h) Offences. When Inland Revenue will use section 16 30. The efficient and effective use of information gathering powers such as those provided in sections 16, 16B and 16C are necessary for the Commissioner to obtain information to verify various tax liabilities, to deter and detect offending, and to assist in tax collection. 31. The Commissioner will use section 16 where it is considered appropriate in the context of the particular investigation, and where it is reasonable. This includes cases where, in the Commissioner’s opinion, there is a risk or history of non-compliance and/or a lack of co- operation, where it is likely that documents may be at risk, or likely that the case involves revenue offending (tax crimes, including fraud and evasion). Section 16 can also be used to address problems of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance. 32. It is no t necessary for the Commissioner to use other avenues to obtain the information or other powers, such as section 17, before exercising section 16. 33. The power under section 16B will be exercised in situations where it is considered reasonable to do so in order to prevent the Commissioner’s investigations being hindered or where copying of the documents on the premises is not practicable. 34. The powers under section 16C will be exercised when it is reasonable to do so to retain documents for full and complete inspection, including the use of those original documents in court proceedings. 35. The Commissioner recognises the intrusive nature of the exercise of section 16, and the need to use section 16 in a way that recognises the importance of the rights and entitlements affirmed in other enactments, including the Bill of Rights Act, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Evidence Act 2006, while ensuring the effectiveness of the Commissioner’s investigative tools. The Inland Revenue officer in charge will explain clearly to occupiers what their rights and obligations are (see paragraphs 49 and 57 to 59). Warrants 36. Section 16(1) is a warrantless power of entry. This means the Commissioner does not need to obtain a warrant to access all lands, buildings (except for private dwellings) and places, and all documents. 37. In ord er to access a private dwelling, the Commissioner must obtain either: (a) a warr ant under section 16(4); or (b) the co nsent of an occupier. OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 6 inland revenue Department 38. It is the Commissioner’s practice to apply for warrants in relation to accessing private dwellings. This provides occupiers with judicial oversight, helping balance their privacy rights against law enforcement needs. If part of a search area is found to contain a private dwelling, and if a private dwelling warrant is not already held, the officer in charge will seek either the occupier’s consent, or a warrant before searching that area. 39. The Co mmissioner can remove documents, including electronically stored information, and retain them for copying or inspection or both. In order to remove documents from any place, for inspection, the Commissioner must obtain either: (a) a warrant under section 16C(2); or (b) the consent of an occupier. Note: The Commissioner does not require a warrant, or the consent of an occupier, to remove documents for copying (under section 16B). Copying of documents, including the imaging of electronically stored information, can occur either on-site or elsewhere. 40. The Commissioner will obtain warrants under section 16C to remove and retain documents in most cases where section 16 is being used. Although section 16C states that documents can be removed and retained with the occupier’s consent, the Commissioner will generally obtain warrants for the removal of documents under section 16C. In most cases, having a warrant to remove the documents will reduce the amount of time Inland Revenue staff will be present at taxpayers’ premises and will provide a clearer framework for claiming and protecting legal privilege and the non-disclosure right. 41. Subpa rt 3 of Part 4 of the SSA sets out the process by which warrants are to be obtained. One of those requirements is for the warrant application to contain a description of the items believed to be in the place, vehicle or other thing sought by the Commissioner (section 98(1)(e) of the SSA). Section 103(4)(g) of the SSA requires the warrant itself to contain a description of what may be seized. The Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 2003 reflects this requirement, which satisfies the SSA requirements. A more detailed description of the documents to be seized is not required, and in addition, section 123 of the SSA allows Inland Revenue officers to seize other documents that are in plain view during the section 16 search. Section 123 authorises Inland Revenue officers to do this where they have reasonable grounds to believe they could have seized the items under a private dwelling search warrant, a section 16C(2) warrant, or under section 16(1). 42. Wher e the Commissioner intends to use section 16 to inspect any property, process or matter (other than documents), then the requirements of sections 98(1) and 103(4)(g) of the SSA to describe the item to be seized do not apply. This is because the requirement to describe items to be seized cannot apply to items that are going to be inspected, not seized. 43. Thes e warrant applications are made without notice to the occupier, and can include confidential information. Where the relevant secrecy or confidentiality rules apply the Commissioner will generally seek to keep the information confidential. Other information may be disclosed either in whole or part at the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation resulting from that investigation. In some cases, this information may still be protected after the investigation or litigation has ended. 44. While section 100(3) of the SSA provides for oral applications for warrants, the Commissioner will generally seek warrants by written application. Entry, Identification and Advice of Rights Entry 45. Section 16(1) provides the Commissioner with wide powers of access to all lands, buildings and places, and documents. This includes motor vehicles, business premises, warehouses, and private dwellings under a court warrant. This is reflected in section 110 of the SSA. 46. Inlan d Revenue officers exercising search or seizure powers are able to use reasonable force in respect of any property (for example, to open doors and access cabinets). This is specifically provided for in sections 110(c), 113(2)(b) and 131(3) of the SSA. Those powers do not authorise the use of force against persons. 47. One exa mple of reasonable force is the use of a locksmith to gain entry if no one is present or if the occupier refuses entry. The use of non-Inland Revenue personnel, such as locksmiths, is also authorised by provisions in the TAA and SSA which permit Inland Revenue officers to bring along such assistants as they consider necessary (see paragraphs 67 to 71 for further discussion). Where locksmiths or other means of reasonable force are used to gain entry, and new locks and/or keys are required, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will attempt to contact the property owner and provide them with the new keys. 48. The Inland Revenue officer in charge will accompany all assistants when they first enter the place to be searched, and will supervise any assistant that is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable as the 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 Inland Revenue officer in charge considers reasonable in the circumstances. Identification and notices 49. When entering premises under section 16, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will: (a) Announ ce their intention to enter under section 16. (b) Identify him/herself by name or by unique identifier. (c) Produc e evidence of their identity. (d) Provi de the occupier with a copy of the search warrant, if any. (e) Where the search is not being carried out under a warrant, provide the occupier with a written notice setting out: (i) That t he search is taking place under section 16; and (ii) The re ason for the search. This will be in general terms describing the nature of the investigation, but not setting out specific detail. For searches being carried out under warrants, the reason for the search is set out in the warrant. (f) Acco mpany any assistant that is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable when that assistant first enters the place. 50. The Inl and Revenue officer in charge will also identify themself to the occupier as the main contact person for the occupier and their adviser during the search of the premises. 51. If the o ccupier is not present during the search, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the access will leave the following in a prominent position at the place (or in the vehicle): (a) A copy o f the search warrant (where the search was carried out under a search warrant); (b) A noti ce setting out: (i) The da te and time of the start and finish of the search; (ii) The na me or unique identifier of the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search; (iii) Wher e the search was exercised without a warrant, that it took place under section 16, and the reason for the search; (iv) The ad dress and contact details of the Inland Revenue officer to whom enquiries should be made; (v) If not hing was seized, the fact that nothing was seized; (vi) If documents were seized, the fact that documents were seized; (vii) If doc uments were seized, and where an inventory is not provided at this time, a statement that an inventory will be provided within seven days after the seizure; (viii) If documents were seized, the information set out in paragraph 112 to the extent applicable. 52. Wher e it is not reasonably practicable to take the steps set out in paragraph 49, section 131(4)(b) of the SSA enables the Commissioner to provide this information to the occupier or owner within seven days after the search. 53. By tak ing the above steps, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will have met the identification and notice requirements of sections 16(6) and 16C(4) and section 131 of the SSA. However, in the following circumstances, sections 131(1)(b)(ii), 131(2) and 131(6) of the SSA permit the Inland Revenue officer in charge to elect not to carry out some of these requirements: (a) Wher e the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reasonable grounds to believe the person present during the search is not the occupier of the place or is not the person in charge of the vehicle or other thing being searched, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will not provide that occupier with the information in paragraphs 49 and 51; (b) Wher e it is impracticable to do so, the Inland Revenue officer in charge can elect not to carry out paragraphs 49(d) and (e); (c) Wher e there are operational reasons (such as safety or prejudice to the investigation or the access), the Inland Revenue officer in charge can elect not to carry out paragraph 49; and (d) Wher e the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reasonable grounds to believe that no person is lawfully present, then they can elect not to carry out paragraph 49. 54. In the f ollowing circumstances, section 134 of the SSA enables Inland Revenue to apply to a Judge for a postponement of the requirements in paragraph 51: (a) Where compliance would endanger the safety of a person; or (b) Wher e compliance would prejudice on-going investigations. 55. Sect ion 132 of the SSA sets out identification and notice requirements for remote access searches. In addition to remote access searching, the OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 8 inland revenue Department Commissioner is also able to access computer systems under section 16(1) because of the broad nature of the language used in that section. 56. To ens ure the Commissioner’s powers in this regard are exercised in a reasonable manner, and consistently with the Bill of Rights Act, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will, if possible, do the following upon completion of a computer system search: (a) send an electronic message to the email address of the thing searched setting out: (i) The date and time of the start and finish of the search; (ii) The na me or unique identifier of the Inland revenue officer in charge of the search; (iii) The address of the Inland Revenue office to which inquiries should be made. (b) Where it is not possible to deliver this electronic message, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will take reasonable steps to identify the user of the thing searched and send the above information to them. Advice of rights 57. The Commissioner’s use of section 16 is subject to the reasonableness requirement of section 21 of the Bill of Rights Act. 58. To ensure the search powers in the TAA and the SSA are exercised consistently with the protections in the Bill of Rights Act, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will provide the occupier with the following: (a) Advice of the occupier’s ability to consult and instruct a lawyer. (b) An expl anation of the occupier’s obligation to provide reasonable facilities and assistance and to answer proper questions. (c) An expl anation of the privilege against self- incrimination under section 60 of the Evidence Act, where proper questions are being asked that may also constitute investigative questions (refer to paragraphs 78 to 94 for more information on proper questions). (d) A gene ral explanation of the processes that will be undertaken on-site. 59. The Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search will provide the occupier with a written copy of the above information. Exercising search powers (including taxpayers’ obligations) Access 60. Access will be undertaken at a time the Commissioner considers will balance causing minimal disruption to the occupier with the purpose of the search and the operational needs of the investigation. 61. Wher e no-one is present at the premises being searched, Inland Revenue officers are able to use reasonable force to gain access. This includes forced entry or engaging the services of a locksmith to enter the premises, and disarming alarms. Search 62. The power of access in section 16 includes the power to search for items covered by that section. 63. Notin g the restrictions set out in the SSA, the Commissioner’s view is that officers are not empowered to directly search persons. However, occupiers are required to provide Inland Revenue staff with reasonable facilities and assistance in carrying out the search. This includes emptying their pockets if asked to do so, handing over documents and devices such as cellphones or USB drives, and allowing the Inland Revenue officer to search inside items such as handbags, briefcases and backpacks. 64. Where Inland Revenue officers have reasonable grounds to believe that documents, including electronically stored information, are on an occupier’s person, Inland Revenue officers may request the assistance of Police to search that person where the Police powers to do so apply. Where Police are called on to assist IR officers, any constable is able to exercise any power ordinarily exercisable by them (section 113(3) of the SSA). 65. Any su ch search of a person will be conducted with decency and sensitivity and in a manner that affords to the person being searched, the degree of privacy and dignity that is consistent with achieving the purpose of the search (as set out in the SSA). 66. The se arch may extend to any item the person is carrying or that is in the person’s physical possession or immediate control (including briefcases, handbags and backpacks). Assistants 67. Section 16(2A) authorises Inland Revenue to bring such assistants as the Commissioner may consider necessary, and section 113(4) of the SSA sets out the Commissioner’s obligations in relation to those assistants. Examples of assistants include other Inland Revenue staff, digital or other computer forensic 9 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 experts, locksmiths, Police officers, dog control officers, interpreters, landlords and local council staff. 68. Wher e an assistant is not an Inland Revenue employee or a Police constable, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will accompany that assistant when they first enter the place to be searched, and provide such supervision as is reasonably necessary. Where the assistant is a constable, section 113(5) of the SSA makes it clear that these requirements do not apply. 69. Assistants have all of the powers given to them under section 113 of the SSA that the Inland Revenue officer in charge authorises them to use. This includes authorising an assistant to use reasonable measures to access computer systems, and authorising locksmiths to use reasonable force in respect of any property. 70. Assistants can also be used where occupiers are obstructing entry or the search and seizure. Inland Revenue can call on the assistance of Police or other security specialists. 71. Where the Commissioner has engaged the services of non-Inland Revenue staff to assist in the exercise of section 16, they will be required to have first signed a declaration of secrecy under section 87. Reasonable facilities and assistance 72. The Commissioner’s search of premises requires some degree of assistance from those in normal possession of those premises, including unlocking doors and providing electricity. Section 16(2) requires occupiers to provide reasonable facilities and assistance to Inland Revenue officers. 73. Refer to paragraph 58 for further information as to what occupiers will be told. 74. The obligations to answer proper questions and provide assistance under section 16(2) do not amount to a detention within the meaning of section 23 of the Bill of Rights Act. However, occupiers will be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the person, as set out in section 23(5) of the Bill of Rights Act. 75. Wher e occupiers are required to provide assistance, they will be asked to do so at an early stage. Wherever possible, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will avoid keeping occupiers longer than is necessary for them to assist during the course of the search. 76. When requiring assistance from occupiers, Inland Revenue will take into account the following factors: (a) The co mpliance cost to the occupier; (b) The ne ed for occupiers to also meet the needs of their business during the search (where the search occurs during that business’ working hours); and (c) The purpose for which the search powers are being exercised. 77. Where the occupier is required to provide assistance, the Inland Revenue officer in charge will inform them of the reason for this, and that they have the right to refrain from making any incriminating statement (unless it is a proper question within the parameters discussed in paragraphs 78 to 94). Proper questions 78. When the search power in section 16 is being exercised Inland Revenue staff are statutorily empowered under section 16(2)(b) to ask questions which occupiers must answer. 79. The SSA also imposes additional obligations on occupiers to provide access or other information that is reasonable and necessary to allow Inland Revenue to access data in computer systems or other data storage devices or internet sites (section 130 of the SSA). 80. The an swers to questions asked under section 16(2) (b) can be required in writing or under statutory declaration. Generally, it is the Commissioner’s practice to require oral answers to these questions during the search, although the occupier can be asked to provide answers in writing or under a statutory declaration. 81. Any questions asked under section 16(2)(b) must be “proper” questions. Proper questions are those relating to the effective exercise of powers under section 16: (a) This in cludes basic questions such as name, address and occupation. (b) It doe s not include investigative questions, which are questions directed at obtaining evidence of offending or of the taking of the underlying tax position. Questions of this kind will be put to the occupier separately under a voluntary interview or an inquiry under sections 18 or 19. 82. Howe ver, the Commissioner recognises that discussion about the material contained on the premises can overlap with the substantive investigation. So when asking questions of this dual nature, Inland Revenue officers will ensure occupiers understand that questions relating to investigative aspects form part of a voluntary interview and they may leave after the “proper question” has been answered (see the discussion at paragraphs 88 to 94 about the privilege against self-incrimination). 83. If an int erview is considered necessary, then this will generally be arranged for a date after the search has been completed. Ensuring that any investigative interview is conducted separately from the search will OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 10 inland revenue Department allow the taxpayer time to discuss their circumstances with an advisor and to appropriately obtain advice. Doing so may also allow time for the taxpayer to make a post-notification voluntary disclosure under section 141G(1)(b). 84. This m eans that, unless the taxpayer has previously been advised of this, the exercise of section 16 will qualify as notification of a pending or started tax audit or investigation under section 141G(4). Any questions asked during the search under section 16(2)(b) will be confined as much as possible to “proper questions” so that the search does not constitute an interview for the purposes of section 141G(5)(a) or (b). Inland Revenue’s view is that any dual purpose questions do not by themselves constitute an “interview” for the purposes of section 141G(5)(a) or (b), providing that the principal purpose of asking that dual purpose question is to ask a proper question. 85. Although a search will qualify as notification (for the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime), it will depend on the facts of each case as to whether or not the Commissioner has started the audit or investigation (per the criteria in section 141G). The Commissioner’s view is that inspections conducted in the course of the search for the purposes of determining relevance will generally not trigger the criterion in section 141G(5)(b) (unless purely investigative questions arise during the search) . 86. This m eans that generally a voluntary disclosure made following the exercise of section 16 (and until the conclusion of the first interview) will be a post- notification disclosure in terms of section 141G(3) (b). Where possible, the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the access will provide the occupier with a letter recording the notification of the start of an audit or investigation. Refer to SPS 09/02 Voluntary disclosures and SPS 07/02 Notification of a pending audit or investigation for more information. The forms for making voluntary disclosures can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (IR 281 Voluntary disclosure). 87. If an oc cupier refuses to answer a proper question, or leaves without answering it, this could give rise to a prosecution for obstruction (see paragraphs 97 to 99). 88. Howe ver, section 60 of the Evidence Act provides a privilege against self-incrimination where a natural person is required to provide specific information by a person exercising a statutory power or duty. This privilege is reflected in section 130(2) of the SSA, when a person is required to provide access or other information for computer systems. 89. The privilege only relates to information that would be likely to incriminate the person under New Zealand law for an offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment. It does not relate to liability for shortfall or other civil penalties under the TAA. 90. Sect ion 60(3) of the Evidence Act restricts this privilege when an enactment removes it either expressly or by necessary implication. Section 16(2) (b) does remove the privilege in relation to “proper questions.” 91. What this means in practice is that Inland Revenue officers may ask questions relevant to the inspection of documents, property, processes or matters and the occupier is compelled to answer them, but these questions will not extend to investigative ones. This practice applies to sections 6 and 28 of the Bill of Rights Act, by giving section 16(2) a meaning consistent with the rights and freedoms in that Act and with the common law right to silence. 92. Wher e such questions fall into both categories (dual purpose questions), the Inland Revenue officer will explain that the occupier has a right under section 60 of the Evidence Act not to answer the question if it would be likely to incriminate them. The privilege only relates to information asked of the person; it does not extend to documents. Providing passwords and other computer system and internet access information is not information that is likely to incriminate a person. 93. Wher e occupiers are required to answer proper questions, they will be asked to do so during the course of the search, and the Inland Revenue officer in charge will inform them of the reason for this, and that they have the right to refrain from making any statement that may incriminate them. 94. If an occupier is unsure as to which questions are proper, having a professional tax adviser or lawyer present can assist. However, Inland Revenue does not consider that it is necessary to await the arrival of any adviser before asking any proper question. Power to exclude 95. Under section 116 of the SSA, the Inland Revenue officer in charge can secure the place or thing being searched, and where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe any person will obstruct or hinder the search (or any other power being exercised during the search), can exclude any person from the place, vehicle or thing. 96. In pra ctice, this means that occupiers may be asked to remain outside a specified area, to keep away from other occupiers or Inland Revenue officers, or to leave the premises. Failing to do any of these things could 11 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 result in the occupier being liable to prosecution for obstruction. Obstruction and other offending 97. Failing to keep away from other occupiers or Inland Revenue officers, or failing to remain outside an area specified by the officer in charge, may constitute an offence under section 143H (obstruction) leading to possible prosecution. 98. Obst ruction also includes failure to provide reasonable facilities and assistance, failure to answer proper questions, hiding or destroying documents (including electronically stored information). 99. Such activities may also result in the taxpayer having to pay an increased shortfall penalty under section 141K. Other Inland Revenue activities 100. Inland Revenue officers may also do the following in the course of exercising the Commissioner’s search powers under the TAA and SSA: (a) Take photographs, sound, or video recordings. (b) Reco rd discussions with occupiers. Because these discussions are not an interview (refer to the discussion on “proper questions” at paragraphs 78 to 94), they are not subject to the guidelines in SPS 12/01 Tape recording Inland Revenue interviews; and where an interpreter is being used, the discussion will generally be audio-recorded as normal practice to provide an accurate record for both the occupier and the Commissioner. Where taxpayers are being interviewed, this will be conducted separately and is subject to the guidelines in that SPS. (c) Question other occupiers who are present (for example, employees, tenants, family members, but not children under 14 years of age). (d) Re-ent er the premises after the search has been completed, but where this is a private dwelling, only if all items described in the warrant have not been seized or the search was completed within the last four hours or less. 101. Inlan d Revenue officers will also take a record of any cash or other valuables found during the search. This includes counting and photographing the items, because such assets could be representative of undeclared income. The items will generally not be seized by Inland Revenue. Electronically stored information 102. Refer to the following Standard Practice Statements for information on: (a) SPS 13/01 R etention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore, and application to keep records in Māori (or any subsequent replacement SPS) for guidelines on retaining business records in electronic format. (b) SPS 10/02 Imaging of electronic storage media (or any subsequent replacement SPS) for Inland Revenue’s practice when taking an image of electronic storage media. 103. The SSA confirms the Commissioner’s approach to imaging of electronically stored information as set out in SPS 10/02. 104. Sections 110(h) and (i) and sections 113(h) and (i) of the SSA confirm, as did Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd & Ors v District Court at North Shore & Anor \[2010\] NZCA 183, that the Commissioner can access, preview and image (clone) electronically stored information. These sections specifically authorise the Commissioner to do the following: (a) Use rea sonable measures to access computer systems or other data storage devices, whether located in whole or in part at the place being searched; (b) To copy any intangible material accessed, including previewing, cloning or other forensic methods; (c) To cop y material either before or after removal from the premises. 105. In addition, section 130 of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to require a person with knowledge of a computer system to provide access information and other assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow Inland Revenue to access data. 106. Refer to the following paragraphs in this OS for discussion of these relevant aspects: (a) Paragraphs 88 to 94 for a discussion of the privilege against self-incrimination. (b) Paragraphs 112(d) and 127 to 139 for information on the privileges and confidentialities that apply. (c) Paragraphs 55 to 56 above for an explanation of how the notice requirements in the SSA apply to Inland Revenue accessing electronically stored information. 107. Inland Revenue’s Digital Forensics Unit (DFU) is a unit of specialist computer forensic staff that is independent from the Investigations unit. Wherever possible, the Commissioner will use staff from DFU to carry out the access, searching and copying of electronically stored information. 108. Examples of situations where it might not be possible to use DFU include where the size of the operation OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 12 inland revenue Department means there are not enough DFU staff to attend at every site, and the Commissioner could either contract in external specialists, or require Investigations staff to remove electronic storage devices and deliver them to DFU for imaging. In all of these cases, a clear chain of custody over the electronic storage device will be maintained, and claims of legal privilege and the non- disclosure right (under sections 20 and 20B to 20G) can be made as described in this OS (see paragraphs 136 to 139). DFU will generally take custody and control of electronic storage media removed under either section 16B or 16C. Removal of documents 109. Inland Revenue officers can remove documents that are necessary or relevant to the investigation. They can be removed for copying under section 16B or for inspection under section 16C. Inland Revenue officers can also remove other documents under section 123 of the SSA, which relates to the seizure of items in plain view. 110. The po wer in section 16B to remove documents accessed under section 16 in order to make copies was provided to the Commissioner to address the risk of documents being destroyed, removed or tampered with in certain cases. Section 110(d) of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to seize anything that is the subject of the search, and under section 110(g), to copy any document that may lawfully be seized. Under section 110(i), the Commissioner can copy electronically stored material (this subsection reflects the case law). These sections also provide the Commissioner with an alternative to copying on-site where it is not possible or practicable to do so. 111. In order to remove documents under section 16C, the Commissioner requires either a warrant or the consent of the occupier. Neither a warrant nor consent is required in order to remove the documents for copying under section 16B. 112. When documents are seized, and the Inland Revenue officer in charge is satisfied that the documents are owned by the occupier, they will provide the occupier with a notice (or provide one within seven days after the seizure), setting out: (a) A gene ral description of what has been seized (the inventory). For example, the number of folders or boxes of documents removed, and the number of hard drives imaged. (b) Info rmation about the occupier or owner’s right to access the seized documents under sections 16B(4) and 16C(5). (c) Info rmation about the occupier or owner’s right to apply for access to any document relating to the search warrant application or the exercise of the search power that led to the seizure, as provided for in section 133(2)(a)(ii) of the SSA. Generally, information used in warrant applications will be confidential until the conclusion of the investigation and any litigation. (d) Information about the legal privilege and non- disclosure right in sections 20 and 20B to 20G. Note that other categories of privilege in the SSA do not apply to tax matters (refer to the Schedule to the SSA and Appendix I of this OS for an explanation of which parts of the SSA apply to the TAA). 113. By pro viding the notice referred to in paragraph 1120, Inland Revenue will have complied with the requirement in section 133 of the SSA to provide an inventory. 114. If the I nland Revenue officer in charge of the search is satisfied that none of the items seized are owned by the occupier, then this notice will not be provided to the occupier. Where the Inland Revenue officer in charge has reason to believe someone else is the owner of the documents, they will provide a notice to that person within seven days after the seizure. When documents are removed from, for example, a tax agent’s office, the notice will be provided to the tax agent, not to each individual client whose records may have been uplifted. 115. In the f ollowing circumstances, section 134 of the SSA enables Inland Revenue to apply to a Judge for a postponement of the requirements in paragraph 112: (a) Wher e compliance would endanger the safety of any person; or (b) Wher e compliance would prejudice on-going investigations. 116. When t he Inland Revenue officer in charge is uncertain of the status of items, they will be removed under section 112 of the SSA. For the purposes of the inventory and notice requirements, the time of seizure will start from when a decision is made as to whether or not the documents are necessary or relevant. If they are not relevant, they have not been seized, and will be returned to the owner or occupier. 117. In addi tion, documents or electronic storage devices that relate to other matters the Commissioner needs to investigate can also be removed under section 123 of the SSA (seizure of items in plain view) during the exercise of section 16. Such items will also be subject 13 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 to the notice and inventory requirements described above. 118. Docum ents removed for copying under section 16B will be returned as soon as practicable. Refer to paragraphs 142 to 145 for further information on the return of documents. 119. Documents removed under section 16C will be retained for as long as necessary for a full and complete inspection. This includes use in court proceedings. If the Commissioner determines that documents removed under section 16B for copying will be required for a full and complete inspection, the Commissioner will either: (a) Seek the consent of the occupier; or (b) Obta in a warrant under section 16C(2). Legal advisers, tax agents and support persons 120. The Commissioner considers it preferable to have legal advisers or tax agents present during a search. This assists the occupier, as well as the Commissioner, in several ways. Having advisers present can reduce the amount of time Inland Revenue is present at the premises, reducing business interruption and our presence in the home. It can facilitate the answering of proper questions, assist with the resolution of issues regarding legal privilege and non-disclosure, and may reduce the stress for the occupier. 121. Inland Revenue encourages occupiers to have a professional adviser present, such as a lawyer, accountant or other tax adviser, and to consult with their advisers in private. 122. Wait ing for legal advisers to arrive can delay the search, and result in Inland Revenue staff being present on the site for longer than necessary. It is the Commissioner’s practice to be present on a site for the minimum amount of time necessary to conduct the access, including copying and removal of documents, so as to cause the least disruption to occupiers and businesses that is consistent with achieving the purpose of the search. 123. Ther efore, occupiers will be provided with a reasonable opportunity to contact a legal adviser, and a decision as to when the search will commence will be made by the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search. Inland Revenue officers do not have to wait until advisers arrive before commencing the search, imaging of electronically stored material, or removal of documents (see paragraphs 127 to 139 for the legal privilege and non-disclosure right process). 124. Where proceedings have been commenced (for example, an injunction) in relation to the exercise of section 16, section 180(2)(a) of the SSA authorises the Commissioner to continue with the search. 125. Occupiers may also prefer to have a tax agent or other support person present; however that person’s presence must not interfere with the search. 126. The presence of other support persons will also be at the discretion of the Inland Revenue officer in charge of the search, and will take into account the occupier’s particular circumstances, as well as those of the premises and the search (see to paragraphs 95 and 96). Legal privilege and the non-disclosure right 127. For the purposes of the Commissioner’s search powers, the only privileges or confidentialities that apply to Inland Revenue’s ability to access and seize documents are those provided for in sections 20 to 20G. The privileges and rights to confidentiality in section 102 and in subpart 5 of Part 4 do not apply to the Commissioner’s search powers because they have been specifically excluded by the Schedule to the SSA and by sections 20 and 20B. In practice, however, Inland Revenue regards the section 20 privilege as extending to litigation privilege where New Zealand lawyers (as defined by the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) are involved. For this purpose, litigation privilege is regarded as covering documents created for the dominant purpose of advising or assisting on reasonably apprehended litigation. 128. Conf idential communications between legal practitioners and their clients that meet the criteria under section 20 are privileged from disclosure under section 16. This does not apply to documents made or brought into existence for the purpose of committing or furthering the commission of some illegal or wrongful act (section 20(1)(c)). 129. Sect ions 20B to 20G set out the criteria for claiming a non-disclosure right over tax advice documents subject to the information gathering power in section 16. A document is not a tax advice document if it was created for purposes that include committing, or promoting or assisting the committing of, an illegal or wrongful act (section 20B(2)(c)). 130. But fo r these limited exceptions, an information holder has the right to not disclose a document that is eligible to be a tax advice document. See Standard Practice Statement 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents (or any subsequent replacements of the SPS) for more information. 131. The Co mmissioner will adhere to the provisions of sections 20 to 20G regarding legal privilege and the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents when OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 14 inland revenue Department exercising sections 16, 16B and 16C including when imaging electronic storage media. 132. See St andard Practice Statement 10/02 Imaging of electronic storage media (or any subsequent replacements of the SPS) for more information on the Commissioner’s practices when imaging electronic storage media. 133. As decided in A Firm of Solicitors v District Court at Auckland \[2006\] 1 NZLR 586, the mere removal and imaging of documents that may be legally privileged or subject to the non-disclosure right, does not breach that right or privilege, because there is no disclosure of those documents. This is confirmed by sections 110(h) and (i) and sections 113(2)(h) and (i) of the SSA which specifically authorise the accessing, previewing and cloning of intangible material in computer systems or other data storage devices. 134. The Co mmissioner is not responsible for asserting privilege or the non-disclosure right for taxpayers, but will advise occupiers of these rights where documents potentially subject to privilege or the non-disclosure right under sections 20 and 20B to 20G are anticipated. 135. A blanket claim of legal privilege or of the non- disclosure right across all documents is not a valid claim. As set out in the process below (paragraph 136), the Commissioner will provide an adequate opportunity for the owner of hard copy documents to review the documents to enable particularised claims to be made within a reasonable timeframe. 136. Where practical, Inland Revenue officers will use the following process in relation to section 20 (legal privilege) and sections 20B to 20G (the non-disclosure right): (a) Provide the occupier with the opportunity to seek advice and make particularised claims under section 20 and sections 20B to 20G. (b) In rel ation to electronically stored documents that are potentially subject to legal privilege or non- disclosure right claims, to copy or image, seal and remove them, or to remove the electronic storage device containing those documents for imaging off-site. Wher e electronically stored documents have been imaged: (i) The ima ged copy will remain in the custody of DFU, and will not be released to Inland Revenue investigators until after this process is complete; and (ii) The ow ner can provide a list of keywords to DFU to be used to identify documents to which section 20 or sections 20B to 20G apply. (c) In relation to hard copy documents that are potentially subject to legal privilege or non- disclosure right claims, to seal and remove them. (d) Work with the owner of the documents to agree a process for: (i) Storage of the documents; (ii) Making particularised claims of legal privilege or non-disclosure within a reasonable timeframe; and (iii) Reviewing and resolving disputed privilege and non-disclosure right claims within a reasonable timeframe. Where particularised claims are not made, and disputed claims are not resolved, within the agreed timeframe, the Commissioner will then continue to use the documents for investigative purposes. 137. While the Commissioner might agree to documents potentially subject to claims of legal privilege or the non-disclosure right remaining sealed for a reasonable period until the owner has the opportunity to review them, make particularised claims, and resolve any disputed claims, where the owner has neglected or chosen not to do so, the Commissioner can take any steps necessary to enable the investigation to continue. 138. In addi tion, section 180(2)(b) of the SSA specifically authorises the Commissioner to continue with the investigation when proceedings have been commenced in relation to the exercise of section 16 or the use of any evidential material obtained from the search. Taxpayers can apply to the High Court under section 180(3) of the SSA for interim orders overriding section 180(2). 139. If the c laim of legal privilege or the non-disclosure right cannot be resolved between the Commissioner and the person making the claim, either party can apply to a District Court Judge for orders under section 20(5) as to whether the claim for legal privilege is valid, or under section 20G as to whether the document is a tax advice document (or for related orders regarding tax contextual information). After the search Access to documents 140. Where the Commissioner removes a document under section 16B, the owner is entitled under section 16B(4) to inspect and obtain a copy of the document that is removed: (a) At the time of removal; or (b) At rea sonable times subsequent to the removal. 15 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 141. Where the Commissioner removes and retains a document under section 16C, the owner is entitled under section 16C(5) to obtain a copy of the document either at the time of removal or at reasonable times thereafter. Return of documents 142. The Commissioner will return original documents as soon as practicable, as required by section 16B(2). This includes electronic storage media removed for imaging. 143. Wher e documents have been removed for retention and inspection under section 16C, the originals will not be returned until the Commissioner has completed a full and complete inspection of those documents. A full and complete inspection includes the use of the documents in court proceedings, therefore the Commissioner may not be able to provide a timeframe by which documents are likely to be returned. 144. However, under section 16C(7), the Commissioner can make certified copies of documents retained under section 16C, and those copies are admissible as evidence in court as if they were the original documents. Therefore, unless there are good reasons to retain the originals, the Commissioner will generally copy and return original documents retained under section 16C. 145. Examp les of good reasons to retain the original documents are: (a) Wher e the Commissioner intends to undertake forensic examination of the documents. (b) Wher e the documents are unable to be quickly organised and analysed (this could be due to the poor state of the documents or poor recordkeeping by the owner). (c) Where a certified copy will not provide the best evidence in court proceedings (for example, marks on the original document may be illegible on the copy). Offences 146. The importance of the Commissioner being able to obtain information under sections 16, 16B and 16C means that it is an offence to obstruct the Commissioner or an authorised officer in carrying out those powers, and it is an offence to provide the Commissioner with false information in relation to the exercise of section 16. 147. There are a number of specific offences in the TAA and the SSA relating to search powers, as well as offences under the Crimes Act 1961. The TAA and SSA offences are: (a) Obst ruction under section 143H. (b) Not pr oviding information when required to do so by a tax law, under section 143(1)(b). (c) Knowingly not providing information under section 143A(1)(b). (d) Know ingly not providing information with intent to evade tax or obtain a refund or payment of tax, under section 143B(1)(b) and any of (f), (g) or (h). (e) Knowingly providing false, incomplete or misleading information under section 143A(1)(c). (f) Knowingly providing false, incomplete or misleading information intending to evade tax or obtain a refund or payment of tax, under section 143B(1)(c) and any of (f), (g) or (h). (g) Aiding , abetting, inciting or conspiring with another person to commit an offence against the TAA, under section 148. (h) Failing to comply with a direction under section 117(1) of the SSA when a search warrant is pending, being an offence under section 176 of the SSA. (i) Failing to stop a vehicle as soon as practicable when required to do so, under section 177 of the SSA. (j) Failing to carry out obligations in relation to computer systems when required to do so by section 130(1) of the SSA, which is an offence under section 178 of the SSA. (k) Disclosing information acquired through the exercise of a search power, under section 179 of the SSA. (l) Knowingly failing to comply with section 87(1) (a)before accessing restricted information, under section 143E(1)(a). (m) Knowingly communicating any restricted information in contravention of section 87(1)(b) after having certified in the manner prescribed by section 87(3), under section 143E(1)(b). 148. If convicted of an offence under section 143H, a taxpayer will be liable for a fine of up to $25,000 for the first offence, and up to $50,000 for each subsequent offence. 149. Where the failure to provide information (for example, answers to proper questions, or reasonable facilities and assistance) is done knowingly and with the intention to commit evasion or a similar offence, a taxpayer could be liable for a fine of up to $50,000, or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 16 inland revenue Department 150. Failing to assist with a search when required to do so under section 130(1) of the SSA carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment of three months. 151. And und er section 179 of the SSA, disclosing information acquired through the exercise of a search power carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment of six months (and a fine for body corporates of up to $100,000). 152. Decisions to prosecute will be made in accordance with the Solicitor-General’s Prosecution Guidelines and Inland Revenue’s Prosecution Framework. Summary 153. The powers in sections 16, 16B and 16C of the Tax Administration Act are essential to the compliance functions and duties of the Commissioner. They will be exercised along with the powers in the Search and Surveillance Act, preserving legal privilege and non- disclosure rights, and in compliance with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act where applicable. This Operational Statement is signed on 26 July 2013. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel Legal & Technical Services – Investigations & Advice AppENDiX i: SummArY OF THE AppLiCATiON OF THE SSA TO THE TAA Section 89 of the SSA sets out the extent and manner in which the general provisions in Part 4 of the SSA apply to: (a) powe rs conferred by other Parts of the SSA; and (b) other enactments. In relation to other enactments, this is done by enlisting the assistance of a schedule to the SSA: section 89(2) states that Part 4 applies in respect of powers conferred by the enactments listed in column 2 of the Schedule to the SSA. The use of a schedule in this way makes it clear that the only provisions which apply to the TAA are those listed in the Schedule. The Schedule itself consists of four columns, listing as follows: (a) Column 1 st ates the Act; (b) Column 2 sp ecifies a section of that Act (the specific search powers); (c) Column 3 co ntains a brief description of the power in that section; and (d) Column 4 se ts out which provisions in Part 4 of the SSA apply. The TAA is listed in column 1 of the Schedule, and the Commissioner’s search power (section 16) and power to remove and retain documents under warrant (section 16C(2)) are listed in column 2. Column 4 states that only subparts 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10 (except sections 102, 103(3)(b)(ii), 103(4)(g), 103(7), 115(1) (b), 118, 119 and 130(4)) of Part 4 apply to these powers (subpart 2 contains the warrant application rules). 17 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 Act ContentApplies to TAA Part 1General provisions – interpretation Yes – Inland Revenue officers fall within the definition of “enforcement officers”.

OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 18 inland revenue Department OPERATIONAL STATEMENT OS 13/02: SECTION 17 NOTICES All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) unless otherwise stated. Introduction 1. This Operational Statement (“OS”) outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing notices, including third party requests, under section 17. The section, which relates to requisitions for information, is one of Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers. Other information-gathering powers (such as section 16) can be and are used by the Commissioner in conjunction with section 17 but they are not discussed in this OS. 2. The OS has been updated to incorporate amendments to the legislation concerning these powers, to incorporate principles, particularly in respect of non-disclosure rights, established in cases that have been decided since Standard Practice Statement 05/08 Section 17 Notices was published in 2005. It also outlines the impact of the recently enacted Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (the SSA) on the Commissioner’s power to obtain information under production orders. Application 3. The OS applies from 14 August 2013 and replaces Standard Practice Statement 05/08 Section 17 Notices, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 17, No 6 (August 2005). Background 4. Before the Commissioner can verify or make an assessment of a person’s tax liability, information (including non-documentary information which is within a person’s knowledge) is needed. The legislation provides the Commissioner with the necessary powers, including section 17, to collect information. Section 17 empowers the Commissioner to require any person to furnish in writing any information and to produce for inspection any documents that are considered “necessary or relevant” to exercise the Commissioner’s statutory functions. 5. Inlan d Revenue staff will usually request information and documents without expressly relying on section 17. This practice fosters a spirit of reasonableness and mutual cooperation. 6. If, however, information is not provided voluntarily or in a timely manner the Commissioner is able to use section 17 to demand the information by issuing a notice under the section. In some cases the information gathering process may be commenced by issuing a section 17 notice. For example, this may occur where there have been prior instances of non- cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers. Non-compliance with the section 17 notice will result in the Commissioner invoking the statutory remedies. 7. Any re quest for information with express reference to section 17 will generally contain reference to taxpayers’ right to make a claim for non-disclosure to ensure that the recipient of the notice is aware of this statutory right belonging to the taxpayer. However in some cases the nature of a request may not warrant a reference to the right to claim non-disclosure, such as where the request is for information that relates purely to information which is not contained in tax advice documents. 8. SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents provides information on what constitutes a tax advice document, and sets out the process for making a claim of non-disclosure. Legislation Tax Administration Act 1994 9. The relevant sections are as follows: 3 Interpretation (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— document means— (a) a thing that is used to hold, in or on the thing and in any form, items of information: (b) an item of information held in or on a thing referred to in paragraph (a): (c) a device associated with a thing referred to in paragraph (a) and required for the expression, in any form, of an item of information held in or on the thing 17 Infor mation to be furnished on request of Commissioner (1) Ever y person (including any officer employed in or in connection with any Department of the Government or by any public authority, and any other public officer) shall, when required by the Commissioner, furnish in writing any information and produce for inspection any documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of any of the Inland Revenue Acts or for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of any matter arising from or connected with any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. (1B) For th e purpose of subsection (1), information or a document is treated as being in the 19 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 knowledge, possession or control of a New Zealand resident if— (a) The New Zealand resident controls, directly or indirectly, a non-resident; and (b) The inf ormation or document is in the knowledge, possession or control of the non-resident. (1C) For th e purpose of subsection (1B) and sections 143(2) and 143A(2)— (a) in determining whether a non-resident is controlled by a New Zealand resident, the New Zealand resident is treated as holding anything held by a person who is resident in New Zealand, or is a controlled foreign company, and is associated with the New Zealand resident; and (b) A law of a foreign country that relates to the secrecy of information must be ignored. (1D) If info rmation in writing is required, or documents must be produced, the Commissioner may require that the information be furnished, or the documents be produced, to a particular office of the Department. (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the information in writing which may be required under this section shall include lists of shareholders of companies, with the amount of capital contributed by and dividends paid to each shareholder, copies of balance sheets and of profit and loss accounts and other accounts, and statements of assets and liabilities. (3) The Co mmissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it reasonable to do so, remove and retain any documents produced for inspection under this section for so long as is necessary for a full and complete inspection of those documents. (4) Any pe rson producing any documents which are retained by the Commissioner under subsection (3) shall, at all reasonable times and subject to such reasonable conditions as may be determined by the Commissioner, be entitled to inspect the retained documents and to obtain copies of them at the person's own expense. (5) The Co mmissioner may require that any written information or particulars furnished under this section shall be verified by statutory declaration or otherwise. (6) The Commissioner may, without fee or reward, make extracts from or copies of any documents produced for inspection in accordance with this section. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 10. The SSA came into effect on 1 October 2012, although for Inland Revenue it will take effect from 1 April 2014, or an earlier of the date if given effect by an Order in Council. The relevant sections are sections 3 and 123, and Schedule to the SSA. 11. The SSA contains a detailed list of basic powers that a person exercising search powers can make use of. Refer to Operational Statement 13/01 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s search powers, published in relation to section 16 concerning these powers. Analysis of key changes The new definition of “document” 12. The definition of “book and document” and “book or document” in section 3(1) was repealed and replaced with “document” effective from 29 August 2011. The words “book and document” throughout the TAA were replaced with the new term “document”. The reason for the update is to remove references to redundant technology and to future proof the definition as some of the old terminology refers to out of date technology such as computer reels and perforated reels. 13. The de finition of “document” is much wider than the repealed definition of “book and document” as it clearly includes all forms of information storage. It does not, however, extend the old definition. Rather it updates it by removing references to redundant technology. The definition of “document” should not, therefore, affect departmental practice as the repealed definition of “book and document” included any records in electronic form. This view was confirmed by the High Court in Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd v District Court at North Shore (2009) 24 NZTC 23,252 where Venning J rejected the appellant’s argument that a computer hard drive did not come within the old definition of “book and document”. The Court of Appeal \[2010\] 3 NZLR 661 confirmed the position taken by Venning J that the definition of “book and document” included “any other type of record” which was wide enough to encompass computer hard drives. Non-disclosure right 14. The Commissioner’s wide information gathering powers under section 17 are subject to legal professional privilege (section 20) and to non- disclosure right for a tax advice document (sections 20B to 20G). The High Court in Blakeley v C of IR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,865 considered the scope of protection against disclosure of a tax advice document provided by sections 20B to 20G. The case concerned a section 17 notice issued to the appellant requiring him to provide a list of names and IRD numbers of clients to whom he had provided tax advice in respect OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 20 inland revenue Department of certain transactions. The appellant declined to provide the information on the basis that it would involve the disclosure of a tax advice document which was protected by section 20B. The High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the finding of the District Court that the right to non-disclosure of a tax advice document in respect of the information required is not available to the appellant. The following observations made by the Court indicate the scope of non-disclosure right: • The protection afforded by section 20B is more confined than legal professional privilege. It is not a new substantive right of equivalent utility to legal professional privilege. It was a creature of statute and protected defined parts of a limited category of written communications. • The plain words of the legislation gave no protection to the information from disclosure sought by the Commissioner. • Tax contextual information contained in the opinions would not be protected from disclosure even if the tax advice itself was. • Waiver did not arise under sections 20B to 20G. The protection against disclosure provided by the legislation was not susceptible to waiver. The right to disclosure must be claimed by following the detailed procedure set out in section 20D. If the procedure set out in the legislation was not followed, there would be no right to non-disclosure. Litigation on an even basis 15. In a number of cases it has been argued that section 17 is subject to the principle that litigation should be conducted on an even basis and therefore the Commissioner should not be allowed to seek information once the proceedings have been issued. In Vinelight Nominees Ltd v C of IR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,298 the Commissioner viewed the taxpayer’s returns as being fraudulent and misleading and sought to reissue assessments. After the taxpayer filed proceedings to challenge the Commissioner’s decision, the Commissioner issued section 17 notices to seek information relating a statement made in the taxpayer’s notice of response. The High Court declined to make a declaration, as sought by the taxpayer, that the Commissioner could not use section 17 to obtain information once the court proceedings had commenced. The Court considered that the Commissioner’s dominant motivation was not to gain advantage as a litigant, but rather to assist the making of the revised assessments. The Court however concluded that the principle of litigation on an even basis limits the scope of section 17 and that a section 17 notice could not be issued for the sole purpose of extracting information to use in the legal proceedings; the principle to be applied on a case by case basis. 16. Ches terfield Preschool Ltd v C of IR (No 2) (2005) 22 NZTC 19,500 was another High Court case concerning the scope of section 17. Fogarty J’s views on section 17 differed from those of Simon France J in Vinelight. Fogarty J considered that the principle of litigation on an even basis did not apply in the context of disputes concerning the recovery of unpaid tax. He said that section 17 was intended by Parliament to be an effective instrument for obtaining information, particularly documents, and that was its purpose. There was no basis of suspending the Commissioner’s powers under section 17 even though some aspects of the proceedings have become subject to the High Court rules. 17. The Hi gh Court in Next Generation Investments Ltd (in liq) v C of IR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,775 noted the conflicting views in Vinelight and Chesterfield as to the scope of section 17 but did not endorse either of them. Priestley J preferred the balanced use of section 17 adopted by France J in Vinelight. He said that the Commissioner’s powers could not be exercised in an unfettered way. As a statutory power, it would be subject to an application for a judicial review should it be used ultra vires or in some other improper manner. 18. In Foxley v C of IR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,813 the Court said that the Vinelight, Chesterfield and Next Generation cases established that the Commissioner may use section 17 to request information, at least until challenge proceedings are on foot, and potentially beyond, provided that the powers are exercised for a proper purpose. 19. The Commissioner’s search and seizure powers were challenged in Tauber v C of IR (2011) 25 NZTC 20,071 by way of a judicial review. The applicants claimed that the conduct of the search by the Commissioner was a breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA). Venning J referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Commerce Commission v Air New Zealand \[2011\] 2 NZLR 194 which involved the consideration of a non-disclosure order and the impact of section 27(3) of the NZBORA on the information gathering powers of the Commerce Commission. In that case the Court of Appeal approved the approach of Simon France J in Vinelight where he said that the principle of litigation on an even basis limits the scope of section 17, and it could not be used for the sole purpose of extracting information to use in the legal proceedings. 21 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 20. These cases confirm that Inland Revenue’s information gathering powers may be exercised up until the time challenge proceedings are commenced. They may, on occasion, be exercised after the legal proceedings are commenced provided they are used for a proper purpose, not to gain an otherwise unachievable advantage, and not used for the purpose of extracting information for use in the proceedings. Use of section 17 notice post liquidation/bankruptcy 21. The Commissioner may use her section 17 powers to obtain documents/information from a liquidator without first obtaining an order under section 256(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 for the purpose of giving effect to her statutory duties such as to ascertain a correct tax liability, for prosecution and other related matters: Next Generation Investment Ltd (in liq) &Ors v C of IR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,775. Access to audit work papers 22. Since the publication of SPS 05/08 the Commissioner’s policy on access to audit working papers has been updated to provide guidelines effective from 29 April 2008. The Protocol on Access to Audit Working Papers (Protocol) was signed between the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) and Inland Revenue on 29 April 2008. Requests to access to audit working papers will be made on the basis of the policy outlined in the Protocol. A copy of the document can be found at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/ technical-tax/general-articles/ga-access-to-audit- working-papers.html 23. Documents that are prepared solely for audit purposes in relation to a client’s accounting or tax positions and exposures constitute “audit working papers”. They are the property of the auditor and not of the client. Working papers in relation to other work undertaken by an external auditor are referred to as “other working papers”. They may include tax work papers, such as papers compiled in order to complete the tax return or to provide tax advice. Other working papers form part of the taxpayer’s records, whether they are held by the auditor, the taxpayer or a third party. Relationship between SSA production orders and TAA production orders 24. Section 71 of the SSA contains a production order power that is similar to the Commissioner’s power under section 17A of the TAA. 25. The SSA production order can only be used where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the documents sought constitute evidential material in respect of an offence, and that the documents are or will be in the possession or control of the person to whom the production order is used. Failure to comply with a production order under section 71 of the SSA carries with it a one year sentence of imprisonment. 26. However, because sections 16 and 17 provide very broad powers of obtaining information, Inland Revenue will generally use section 17 and not rely on a production order under the SSA, unless there are circumstances that may warrant the use of an SSA production order instead of one under the TAA. A production order power under the SSA will only be used with the approval of the Group Tax Counsel or Group Manager, Investigation and Advice. Operational Practice Section 17 Notices 27. Section 17 gives the Commissioner the power to require persons to produce for inspection documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. It is most often used in the context of the investigation of a taxpayer’s correct tax position, but can also be used, for example, in liquidation/insolvency situations to obtain information/documents, provided it is not used for improper purposes. However a section 17 power cannot be invoked for questionable or improper purpose, such as to gain advantage over other creditors or for debt recovery. 28. We woul d generally not use the section 17 powers for the sole purpose of requiring taxpayers to provide outstanding returns as the Commissioner can, under section 17A(3), apply for a court order requiring the taxpayer to provide the tax return if a taxpayer does not provide a tax return on time. 29. The new definition of “document”, although broad, does not extend the old definition of “book or document” but instead updates it by removing references to redundant technology. The new definition does not, therefore, affect Inland Revenue’s current practice as it is considered that the repealed definition included any records in electronic form. 30. Case law confirms that the Commissioner may exercise the information gathering powers pursuant to section 17 up until the time challenge proceedings are commenced. They may, on occasion, be exercised after the legal proceedings are commenced provided they are used for a proper purpose, not to gain an otherwise unachievable advantage, and not used for the purpose of extracting information for use in the proceedings. 31. Sect ion 17 authorises Inland Revenue to require written answers to questions relating to the OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 22 inland revenue Department documents requisitioned under the section, and also written answers relating to other information. Such answers, if self-incriminatory, are nevertheless admissible against the person who made them: Singh v C of IR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,471; R v Sew, Hoy, CA 315/91 & CA 316/91, 6 December 1991. However section 17 does not authorise questions unrelated to the documents, such as questions that directly seek to compel confession to elements of offending that may have been committed by, e.g. using the documents 32. Wher e information is to be demanded under section 17, a notice will be issued in writing. Prior to issuing a section 17 notice, Inland Revenue will consider a number of factors that are outlined below: The reason for requiring the information 33. The Commissioner will only require disclosure of information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. The impact of the demand on the suppliers of information 34. The Commissioner will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Reasonable time will be allowed where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing the information requested. Reasons an informal request is not appropriate 35. Generally a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested or where specific issues have been identified and attempts to resolve these issues have failed. However, there will be occasions where a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior informal request. For instance where: • there have been prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer. A refusal or failure to comply with an informal request or more formal request (that is one mentioning section 17) may be regarded as non-co-operation; or • the Commissioner considers that a delay, or a less informal approach may unreasonably increase the risk of non-compliance; or • the taxpayer’s adviser has been uncooperative in the past (including in respect of matters unrelated to the taxpayer) may be a relevant factor in deciding whether a section notice should be issued without a prior informal request. Whether information is available publicly 36. Inland Revenue will generally not use section 17 where information held by public bodies such as Land Information New Zealand, the Companies Office and Quotable Value New Zealand is available publicly. Public availability of information does not, however, prevent Inland Revenue from requiring information to be provided under section 17. Whether the disclosure of tax contextual information is required 37. Where a section 17 notice contains a reference to the non-disclosure right for tax advice documents, the notice will also refer to when the tax contextual information (as defined in section 20F(3)) is required to be disclosed. If the Commissioner does require such a disclosure, that requirement will generally be the subject of a subsequent notice. However, in rare cases the notice will contain a requirement to disclose the tax contextual information as part of the disclosure requirement for the section 17 notice. For further information on the operation of the right to claim non-disclosure and the definition of key terms refer to the SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents and to the discussion below. 38. Wher e the disclosure of the tax contextual information is required as part of the disclosure requirements in the section 17 notice, the tax contextual information must be provided on the form Tax contextual information disclosure (IR 520) which contains a statutory declaration. The effect on the dispute resolution process 39. The dispute resolution process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant. Inland Revenue will use a section 17 notice where previous requests for information have not been complied with. The use of a section 17 notice prior to commencement of the dispute resolution process may mean that the number of matters entering the process will be reduced. 40. The dis putes resolution process may be truncated and an amended assessment issued where a taxpayer has failed to comply with a section 17 notice during the dispute process: section 89N(1)(c)(vi). Inland Revenue’s intention to ensure compliance with the notice 41. Generally, Inland Revenue will use a section 17 notice only where it is prepared to invoke statutory remedies in the event of non-compliance. The use of section 16 powers 42. In some cases, rather than demanding information under section 17 Inland Revenue will access the documents under section 16, which gives the Commissioner the power to enter all places (in the case of a private dwelling, either the consent of an 23 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 occupier or a warrant is required) for the purposes of inspecting documents. For further information on the Commissioner’s policies in respect of section 16 please refer to OS 13/01. Multiple sources 43. Nothing in section 17 precludes Inland Revenue from seeking information from multiple sources and from sources other than the affected taxpayer, whether before or after seeking the information directly from the relevant taxpayer. Multiple notices 44. Separate section 17 notices may be issued for different information and documents. If the Commissioner requires the information to be delivered to Inland Revenue, the notice will state that the information is to be delivered, or the documents to be produced, to a particular office of the Inland Revenue. Request for significant amount of documentation 45. Where a significant amount of documentation is required, the person providing the information will be permitted to send documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office. That office will arrange for the documents to be forwarded to the office conducting the investigation. Where the delivery cost would be reduced by $20 or more by sending documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office then it is considered that the amount of documentation is significant. In this circumstance Inland Revenue would generally accept the request to send the documents to the nearest office. Delegation 46. The decision whether or not to issue a section 17 notice has been delegated to various responsible officers. A decision to issue a section 17 notice will generally be peer reviewed by the delegated officer’s team leader. The exercise of the discretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information is limited to officers at appropriately high level of delegated authority and any decision to require tax contextual information is signed off by Manager, Investigations or by Team Leader, Legal and Technical Services. Legal professional privilege 47. A taxpayer is entitled, and should have sufficient time, to seek legal advice in respect of whether any information or documents are subject to legal professional privilege. Section 20 covers the solicitor-client privilege. It provides that information is privileged from disclosure if it is a confidential communication passing between a legal practitioner and another legal practitioner (acting in their professional capacities) or a legal practitioner and a client, and it is brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice or assistance. There are, however, exceptions to the privilege. Privilege does not apply when the communication was brought into existence for the purpose of committing some illegal or wrongful act. Also financial information and investment records kept in connection with solicitors’ trust accounts are not privileged. 48. The pr ivilege recognised by section 20 is not a complete code as it does not cover litigation privilege and other communications protected from disclosure at common law. Inland Revenue considers that the Commissioner’s powers under section 17 are subject to legal professional privilege contained in section 20 and litigation privilege at common law. In practice, however, Inland Revenue regards the section 20 privilege as extending to litigation privilege where New Zealand lawyers (as defined by the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) are involved. For this purpose, litigation privilege is regarded as covering documents created for the dominant purpose of advising or assisting on reasonably apprehended litigation. Right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents 49. The Commissioner’s information gathering powers (including section 17) are subject to the statutory right to claim non-disclosure for tax advice documents. The right to claim non-disclosure relates to tax advice documents that are required to be disclosed under a section 17 notice. The right to claim non-disclosure belongs to the taxpayer. The statutory provisions contain time periods in which the taxpayer (or their authorised advisor) is required to make the necessary claim for non-disclosure. The taxpayer (or their authorised tax advisor) will be given at least 28 days to claim the non-disclosure right for those documents eligible to be tax advice documents, and required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice. This time period will be specified in the notice. The taxpayer or their authorised advisor can make the claim for non-disclosure by completing the form Tax advice document claim (IR 519). 50. The Commissioner will review the documents and information received in terms of the section 17 notice, and the information provided on the form IR 519. It will then be decided whether disclosure of the tax contextual information from the documents eligible to be tax advice documents is required. If the tax contextual information is required, a subsequent section 17 notice will be issued for the tax contextual OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 24 inland revenue Department information allowing at least another 28 days to provide the information. 51. The ta x contextual information must be provided in the prescribed form, Tax contextual information disclosure (IR 520). The form IR 520 contains a statutory declaration which needs to be completed by a tax advisor. For further information on tax contextual information and the necessary disclosure requirements, refer to the SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents or consult your tax advisor. A copy of the SPS can be found on Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz. 52. In rare cases the Commissioner may require both the claim for the non-disclosure right and the disclosure of the tax contextual information from those documents that may be eligible to be tax advice documents in the one section 17 notice. In such cases, a taxpayer (and/ or their authorised tax advisor) will be given at least 28 days to comply with all the disclosure requirements of the section 17 notice. 53. The dis cretion to require disclosure of the tax contextual information from documents eligible to be tax advice documents will be exercised sparingly in order to minimise compliance costs, and so as not to undermine the spirit of the non-disclosure right rules. Accordingly, an exercise of this discretion will be limited to officers of Inland Revenue at an appropriately high level of delegated authority. 54. Ther e is no requirement for a person to disclose tax advice documents under a discovery obligation in challenge proceedings. The disclosure of tax contextual information may still be required. Advice and other work papers prepared by accountants 55. SPS 05/07 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents outlines the Commissioner’s policy on Access to Advice and other Workpapers Prepared by Accountants in respect of section 17 notices with effect from 22 June 2005. Access to audit work papers 56. Requests for access to audit working papers will arise only in the course of enquiries conducted by investigators or in other special cases, although a request for audit working papers will not be a routine part of Inland Revenue’s investigations. In the first instance the information will be requested from the taxpayer, and requests to a taxpayer’s auditor for access will only be made in exceptional circumstances. 57. This approach does not imply that audit working papers enjoy any privilege from disclosure unless they are tax advice documents to which section 20B to 20G apply. A request by an Investigator for access to audit papers will be made only after obtaining the authorisation of the appropriate manager who will need to consider whether the information requested is “necessary or relevant” for the administration of the Tax Acts. 58. Requests for audit working papers and other papers made pursuant to section 17 will be “formal requests”. They will include details such as when and where the records are to be made available. Correction of information 59. Where a taxpayer has complied with an information requisition then, in accordance with section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 (Information Privacy Principle No. 3), the taxpayer will be allowed to seek access to and correction of that information where Inland Revenue has incorrectly recorded the information. Changes to Section 17 Notices 60. In following the process concerning section 17 every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised. Inland Revenue expects information holders to contact Inland Revenue where there is genuine difficulty in complying with the demand at the earliest possible time and not when the time for compliance has passed. 61. Any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before the expiration of the original date. Beyond this, the offence for non-compliance has already occurred and an extension of time will not be given. 62. Where modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing. 63. Any change to the date for compliance set out in the section 17 notice should also consider the impact the change of date may have on the time periods allowed for claiming the right of non-disclosure. Requests to persons other than the taxpayer 64. Some holders of information, such as banks, are willing to provide information but require Inland Revenue to state its legal authority before they will release the information. Generally, where information is required from persons other than the taxpayer and cooperation is likely, Inland Revenue will initially seek the information by a letter, although the letter may follow a discussion and may contain reference to section 17. 65. That l etter is not a formal section 17 demand. However, generally where the letter is not complied with, a section 17 notice will be issued so that the third 25 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 party recipient is informed of the consequences of their non-compliance before further action is taken. 66. Any se ction 17 notice issued to a third party such as a bank should refer to the non-disclosure right. The recipient of the notice may then choose to contact the taxpayer to confirm whether the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor wish to claim the non- disclosure right or legal professional privilege over documents required to be disclosed under the section 17 notice issued to the third party. 67. Where a formal section 17 notice is issued to a third party such as a bank it will be subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services before its issue. Controlled non-residents 68. Under section 17(1) Inland Revenue may require a New Zealand resident to provide information in circumstances where the resident’s non-resident employees or agents hold the information/documents for the resident. Section 17(1B) gives Inland Revenue the power to require a New Zealand resident to provide information held by a non-resident entity controlled directly or indirectly by the New Zealand resident. For example, if a husband and wife have 51% of the shares in a foreign company, Inland Revenue can issue a section 17 notice requiring them to furnish information held by the foreign company. Section 17(1C) sets out further rules for determining whether a non-resident is controlled. In particular it provides that foreign secrecy laws are to be ignored. 69. If obtaining of the information would be a costly or difficult exercise then generally it would not be required where the tax at stake is immaterial, or when Inland Revenue has access to this information through other sources. Medical information 70. In rare instances Inland Revenue may seek access to an individual’s medical records. For example, there may be medical reasons given by the taxpayer for the failure to provide information or documents, or for not meeting tax obligations. In some case Inland Revenue may consider it necessary to verify the medical reasons for such failures. Such requests will only be made after careful consideration and will be made by an appropriate delegated officer. Requests for certain information from tax agents 71. Inland Revenue may seek certain information from tax agents under section 17 where it becomes aware of particular transactions or arrangements entered into by taxpayers in order to identify other taxpayers who may have entered into similar transactions or arrangements. 72. In the first instance, Inland Revenue will attempt to identify those taxpayers without recourse to requesting information from tax agents. However Inland Revenue may ask tax agents likely to have involvement with the arrangements in question to provide a list of clients who may have entered into a particular (or similar) arrangement. 73. Thes e requests will only be made in limited circumstances and only where it is considered the transactions or arrangements are likely to involve tax avoidance or evasion, or other offences leading to prosecution for offences. Before making such requests to tax agents, investigators must first take all reasonable steps to obtain the necessary or relevant information from the taxpayer(s) or other third parties. 74. Befo re making a request for information, staff will take into account a range of factors including: • the impact of the request on taxpayers’ perception of the integrity of the tax system; • the size of client bases involved, and the practicalities and the relative cost of compliance with the section 17 request; • the level of perceived risk of taxpayers seeking to remove assets or leave the jurisdiction; • the complexity of the arrangement, and the reasonableness of the expectation that the advisor will be able to identify the taxpayers in question; • the level of revenue considered to be at risk; • Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain the information from other sources. 75. An Inland Revenue officer will then arrange to meet with the particular tax agent to advise that a formal section 17 notice is to be made, to provide a draft copy of the notice, explain the scope and matters to be covered in the notice and whether a formal notice is in fact the best way of achieving Inland Revenue’s objectives. Subject to any changes made to the draft notice the final notice will be sent to the tax agent. Any changes to the draft notice will be approved by an appropriate delegated officer. 76. The tax agent will have the option to provide the information without a formal demand. 77. Before any request for information is made, an independent review of the proposed request will be carried out by appropriately delegated officers to ensure the necessary criteria have been applied. OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 26 inland revenue Department This will include determining that the arrangement in question is clearly described and the parameters of the request are clear (for example, the scope of the request, the time period covered, the form of the response and the level of the detail required). Reference to this approval will be stipulated in the notice to the particular firm. 78. The no tice will offer where practicable Inland Revenue assistance to extract the information, and will also allow a reasonable time (to be specified) to provide the information. 79. The tax agent can either contact the Manager, Investigations and Advice or the Group Manager, Investigations and Advice if he/she wishes to query the scope or authority of the investigator to request the information in the notice. Non-compliance with a section 17 notice 80. It is an offence not to comply with a section 17 notice. An offence has occurred where a person does not provide, or knowingly does not provide, information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law: sections 143 and 143A. Furthermore it is an offence for a person knowingly not to provide information to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so, with the intention of evading the assessment or payment of tax: section 143B. However, a person cannot be convicted of an offence for not providing information or knowingly not providing information (other than tax returns and tax forms) if the person proves that they did not have that information in their knowledge, possession or control: sections 143(2)(a) and (b) and 143A(2)(a) and (b). Control here is used in its wider sense and includes information held by others on one’s behalf. 81. If the non-compliance with a section 17 notice relates to a requirement to disclose tax contextual information from tax advice documents, as required by section 20F, a number of offences may have occurred, including: (a) Offe nces under sections 143 to 143B; or (b) An offence under section 143H (obstruction); or (c) An off ence under the Crimes Act 1961 (false statements or declarations). 82. Wher e non-compliance occurs, Inland Revenue will not reissue a section 17 notice in a different format. However, those receiving section 17 notices will have the ability to request a new due date for compliance with the notice so long as the request is made before the expiration of the original due date. 83. In the event of non-compliance, a request for an explanation of why prosecution action should not be taken will generally be issued before further action is taken. A request for an explanation will state that as the section 17 notice has not been complied with an application for a court order under section 17A is being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered. A request for an explanation will not be issued in all cases, for example, where there have been delays in supplying information previously. 84. A request for an explanation does not entitle the taxpayer or their authorised tax advisor to claim (for the first time or to make a subsequent claim) the non- disclosure right for tax advice documents that were required to be disclosed under the original section 17 notice. 85. Befo re an application for a court order under section 17A can be made there is a requirement for the Commissioner to use section 17, and the person to whom the notice has been issued must have failed to provide the information requested under that section 17 notice. 86. If the Commissioner chooses to prosecute a person for not complying with a section 17 notice, then depending on the elements of the particular offence, there are different time limits within which the Commissioner must file charging documents to begin prosecution action: • the time limit is 6 months for the offence of not knowingly providing information when required to do so; • the time limit is 10 years for the absolute liability offence of not providing information when required to do so; and • there is no time limit for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required and the offender does so with the intention to evade the assessment or payment of tax. 87. Once t he offence is committed prosecution action will be commenced within a reasonable time of the date of non-compliance. In general, prosecution would not be commenced where a person complies with the requirement to provide information after the stipulated time but prior to issue of a summons by the Court. 27 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 Relevance of Search and Surveillance legislation to the information gathering powers 88. The rules in in the newly enacted SSA affect the TAA. For instance, the production order regime (Part 3, Subpart 2) and the power to seize items in plain view (section 123) in the SSA may be relevant to the Commissioner’s information gathering powers. However Inland Revenue will generally use section 17 and not rely on the production order under the SSA. This Operational Statement is signed on 14 August 2013.

DETERMINATION CFC 2013/01: NON-ATTRIBUTING ACTIVE INSURANCE CFC STATUS (TOWER INSURANCE LIMITED) Reference This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Investigations Manager under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) Under sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 2007, subject to sections CQ 2(2B) and DN 2(2), no attributed CFC income or loss arises from a CFC that is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC that is an insurer meeting the requirements of a determination made by the Commissioner under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is a non-attributing active CFC. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because insurance income is otherwise treated as passive income and an attributable CFC amount by section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2). TOWER Insurance Limited has made application in respect of the CFC set out below. It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non- attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Scope of determination The CFC to which this determination applies is: NameJurisdiction National Pacific Insurance (Tonga) Limited Kingdom of Tonga Interpretation In this document, unless the context otherwise requires: “Attributed CFC income or loss” means attributed CFC income under section CQ 2 or attributed CFC loss under section DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. “CFC” means a CFC as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. “Non-attributing active CFC” means a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Determination Pursuant to section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I hereby determine that the above CFC is a non- attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date This determination applies for the 2012–13 income year. This determination is signed by me this 14th day of August 2013.

Impact of decision This decision confirms that interest can only be deducted where it is incurred by the person and that there must be a direct link between the expense and the income-earning process for nexus to be met. Facts The disputant practices as a chartered accountant through his company Accounting Limited. In 2005, 2006 and 2007, the disputant claimed deductions for interest on amounts paid to the bank on behalf of the WY Trust (“the Trust”). The disputant, his wife and business partner are directors of Accounting Limited and trustees of the Trust. The disputant and his wife are also shareholders of another related loss attributing qualifying company Farm Limited. The sole director of Farm Limited is the disputant’s wife. In the 2005 to 2007 income years, a portion of Farm Limited’s losses were attributed to its shareholders and were subsequently offset against the disputant’s personal income. On 6 June 2000, Accounting Limited agreed to guarantee the Trust’s indebtedness to the bank. On the same date the disputant and others guaranteed Accounting Limited’s indebtedness to the bank. On 30 June 2000, the Trust borrowed $420,000 from the bank and advanced this sum to Accounting Limited by way of loan. On 1 February 2002, the Trust assigned the loan balance to Farm Limited. The Trust advanced a further $250,000 it had borrowed from the bank to Accounting Limited on 14 April 2004. This was recorded in Farm Limited’s accounts as a loan from the Trust to Farm Limited. In the 2005 to 2007 income years, the bank charged the Trust interest on the borrowed funds. Farm Limited received interest from Accounting Limited on the outstanding loan balance but Farm Limited did not pay interest on the amount owed to the Trust. In the 2005 to 2007 income years, the disputant personally paid the interest charged by the bank to the Trust. The disputant claimed deductions for the interest payments. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions and imposed shortfall penalties. Decision Was interest incurred? The Commissioner asserted that it was the Trust that incurred the interest as opposed to the disputant. The disputant submitted that he had entered into an oral agreement with the bank and the Trust to pay the interest directly. While there was no written documentation evidencing this agreement, the disputant stated that the agreement was recorded in a Trust Minute. The disputant also stated that he understood that his liability under his guarantee for Accounting Limited’s obligations included its obligations under the guarantee of the Trust’s indebtedness. The disputant considered the Trust to be under a “moral obligation” to repay the interest. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found that there was no evidence of a written agreement and the Trust Minute recorded no enforceable agreement. Further, there was no obligation on the disputant under his guarantee of Accounting Limited’s indebtedness to pay the interest payments on the Trust’s behalf. At most the disputant had an indirect contingent liability which would only be triggered upon default by the Trust. LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 30 inland revenue Department The Authority concluded that there was no “definitive commitment” on the disputant to make interest payments. Was there sufficient nexus between the payments and the disputant’s income-earning activities? The disputant submitted that as guarantor in respect to the interest owing by the Trust, and as a result of the disputant repaying the interest, the Trust in turn became obliged under the contractual doctrine of indemnity and/or the restitutionary doctrines of contribution and reimbursement, to repay the disputant an equivalent amount. The Authority found that there was no right to indemnity as there was no default and the disputant was not liable as guarantor to make payment. Likewise, there was no right to claim contribution because the disputant and the Trust were not co-sureties and the disputant had no obligation to contribute to the payment of the interest. Further, there was no right to claim reimbursement as the disputant had not been compelled by law to make interest payments. In the alternative, the disputant argued there was nexus because the borrowed funds assisted in maintaining the Trust capital (and therefore its ability to support the advances to Farm Limited). This in turn enabled Farm Limited to derive assessable income, with the resulting tax consequences assessable to the disputant. The Authority referred to Case S5 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,056 (TRA), which confirms that there must be a direct link between the payments and the income-earning process and indirect “side benefits” are insufficient. Although the Authority accepted the payment of interest may have indirectly increased the disputant’s income, that benefit was not sufficiently direct. Shortfall penalties The Authority considered that in these circumstances reasonable care would include exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return and keeping adequate books and records amongst other considerations. The Authority found that the disputant, in his capacity as an accountant, was in a position to research the law on interest deductibility and to take legal advice if necessary. In addition, as the disputant was a businessman with extensive farming interests, he could be expected to have a high level of knowledge and experience regarding business transactions and tax legislation. Accordingly, the Authority considered the disputant had shown a lack of reasonable care and was therefore liable under section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Further, the Authority considered that the disputant was not entitled to a 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall under section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY AND NEXUS TRA 02/11 CaseTRA 02/11 Decision date9 July 2013 Act(s)Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994 KeywordsInterest deductibility, nexus Summary No direct nexus existed between the payments made by the disputant and the disputant’s income-earning process. Impact of decision The decision confirms that there must be a direct link between the expense and the income-earning process for nexus to be met. Facts The disputant (“X Limited”) is a loss attributing qualifying company that is in the business of beef and dairy farming. In the 2006 to 2007 income years, the disputant borrowed money from the bank which it advanced to two related companies, on land which it owns and on land that it leases from two related companies (“Y Limited” and “Z Limited”). These companies used the funds to purchase three farms and to repay/refinance an existing loan on another farm. X Limited operated its beef and dairy farming operations from the land purchased by Y Limited and Z Limited (and from land owned by the disputant). X Limited paid the interest owed on the amounts borrowed from the bank. However, no interest was demanded or paid by Y Limited or Z Limited on the advances made by X Limited. X Limited ultimately claimed deductions for the interest paid to the bank. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions. Decision Were the funds used directly in the disputant’s income- earning process? The disputant submitted that the borrowed funds were used to acquire land on which the disputant carried on its farming business and, in respect of Y Limited, the borrowed funds were used to acquire farms with associated Fonterra shares. The disputant acquired the benefit of those shares in the form of Fonterra dividends. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) determined there was no evidence supporting the disputant’s assertion that an agreement existed between the disputant, Y Limited and Z Limited, that provided for the acquisition of land and a subsequent lease back to the disputant in exchange for the loans. 31 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 The Authority stated that the decision in Case S5 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,036 (TRA) was “directly on point”, confirming that the disputant was not in the business of lending money and any benefits to the disputant were derived in its capacity as a lessee of land. Accordingly, the derivation of income by the disputant was an “indirect” consequence of the funds. The Authority agreed with the Commissioner that the provision of loans by the disputant was one step removed from the income-earning process of the disputant. In addition, the Authority determined that no evidence of any agreement to assign the Fonterra dividends to the disputant was produced but that in any event, even if an agreement had existed, again that income was not derived from the use of the loaned funds. The Authority also confirmed that assets were owned by Y Limited and Z Limited not the disputant and therefore the advances did not result in the acquisition by the disputant of an income-earning asset. Barter transaction The disputant asserted that it obtained a reduction in lease costs as a result of the interest-free loans and therefore a barter transaction existed. The Authority was not satisfied, on the evidence, that there was any barter arrangement. The Authority determined that in any event, even if an agreement did exist, the interest expense wouldn’t have had the necessary nexus to any barter income. EXISTING BREEDING BUSINESS REQUIRED BEFORE DEDUCTIONS ALLOWABLE CaseD and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date15 July 2013 Act(s)Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords2008 and 2009 income tax years, commencement of business, intention, business of breeding bloodstock, deduction for cost of colt Summary The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in their challenge to the Commissioner’s disallowance of deductions claimed for the cost of the colt by the plaintiffs as members of the syndicate. The High Court found a breeding business must be in existence before a deduction is allowable pursuant to section EC 39 of the Income Tax Act. An intention to have a breeding business at some time in the future did not meet the requirements of the section. Impact of decision The judgment establishes that an existing breeding business is required before a taxpayer can claim deductions of bloodstock for breeding under section EC 39(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The judgment clarifies that carrying on a breeding business requires more than a hope or desire to use bloodstock for breeding in the future. In the absence of a commitment to a plan and a structure to establish a business, a speculative venture with a contingent intention to establish a breeding business will not be sufficient. Facts The Te Akau Stallion Syndicate No 1 (“the syndicate”) was formed in 2008 and its objectives were recorded in a syndicate agreement. It purchased a thoroughbred colt at the 2008 Karaka sale for $550,000. The stud was to be trained and raced to earn money for the syndicate members and to increase its worth as a stud stallion. It did not trial in 2008 but trialled three times in 2009, making no income in either year. The temperament of the colt deteriorated, and in 2009 it was gelded. In the tax years 2008 and 2009, each member of the syndicate claimed a deduction for their respective share of the syndicate loss, which was made up of expenditure incurred in relation to the colt and a 75% diminishing value write-down of the purchase price. LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 32 inland revenue Department The Adjudication Unit allowed deductions for expenses incurred in relation to the colt. However, deductions for the cost of the colt were denied on the basis the syndicate was not in the business of breeding bloodstock pursuant to section EC 39(1). Five syndicate members (“the plaintiffs”) challenged the Commissioner’s finding in relation to the deduction for the cost of the colt. They contended the syndicate bought the colt for use as a stud stallion, with the intention of using it in their breeding business and so were entitled to deductions under section EC 39(1)(c). Decision Was an existing breeding business a prerequisite for section EC 39(1)? To ascertain the meaning of section EC 39(1)(c), Judge Brewer canvassed the legislative history of the provision in accordance with section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999. His Honour first considered the predecessor to section EC 39, section 86H of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 86H allowed deductions for bloodstock “used for breeding in the course of the conduct of any business of the taxpayer”. He agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that the application of section 86H required the taxpayer to first use the bloodstock for breeding “in the conduct of any business of the taxpayer”. A taxpayer could not claim the value of bloodstock under section 89H if they were currently in the business of racing the bloodstock, with only an intention the bloodstock would be used for breeding in the future. Judge Brewer then went on to consider the amendments to section 89H implemented by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1990 (No 3), the substantial re-enactment of the section in section EM 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and current form in the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007. His Honour noted there were no apparent changes in meaning between the 1994 and 2004 sections, and the 2004 and 2007 sections as supported by section YA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which confirmed the intention that the provisions would not change in effect between the earlier and later Acts. His Honour agreed with the Commissioner’s claim that the 1990 amendments to section 86H had extended the circumstances in which a taxpayer was entitled to make deductions for change in valuation of the bloodstock, but had not removed the requirement for a taxpayer to carry on a bloodstock breeding business. This was because the section expressly allowed deductions to be made in the business of breeding bloodstock in the 1994 Act and in the taxpayer’s breeding business in the 2004 and current Acts. If the sections were intended to extend eligibility beyond breeding businesses, these words would be redundant. Lastly, Judge Brewer looked at section EC 39(1)(a) and (b) to interpret subparagraph (c). All three subparagraphs allowed taxpayers to take the value of bloodstock into account in various circumstances, but in every instance this had to be “in their breeding business”. This supported the conclusion that section EC 39(1)(c) allowed a taxpayer to write down the cost of bloodstock only when they had an existing breeding business. The taxpayers alternatively argued that the scheme of the provisions focused on the identity of the taxpayer using the bloodstock, and so “their” in section EC 39(1) should be interpreted to draw a distinction between intended use of the bloodstock in the taxpayer’s own business or in another taxpayer’s breeding business. They claimed that because they had the intention of using the bloodstock in their breeding business, the requirements were met. His Honour dismissed this interpretation because it was incompatible with the legislative history of EC 39 and would significantly widen the application of EC 39. Was the syndicate carrying on a breeding business? While the finding for the Commissioner on the first issue was fatal to the plaintiff ’s case, Judge Brewer considered it would be of assistance to consider the second issue, particularly in light of the probability of an appeal by the unsuccessful party. The taxpayers claimed that everything that was done to acquire the colt and train it was not exceptional in terms of breeding business models and consistent with it being part of a breeding business. They accepted the speculative nature of the venture, but argued this should not frustrate the intention of the taxpayers. They argued the legislative history showed a discernible move from a “use test” to an “intention to use test”, and the “intention to use test” was for assessing when bloodstock became part of a breeding business, rather than when a breeding business commenced. The Commissioner submitted that the activities carried on by the syndicate did not show an intention to engage in a business of breeding. While the colt was acquired as a potential stud stallion, this outcome was dependent on events. The activities that did occur were instead consistent with the raising and development of a racehorse. The future prospect of breeding the colt was a contingency plan, not an intention. The point at which the business would become a breeding business was when the stallion was standing at stud or at least marketed as a stud for breeding purposes. Because the colt was never advertised, marketed for present or future services or bred, no breeding business ever began. 33 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 His Honour accepted it was the intention of the syndicate to stand the colt at stud if it was feasible, but found it was an ideal outcome for the syndicate rather than a fixed intention. The acquisition and racing of the colt was preparatory to a breeding business, not the establishment of a breeding business. Buying bloodstock with an intention to stand it at stud in the future does not establish a breeding business. A speculative venture could be a breeding business, but it would require a commitment to a plan and structure to establish the business, rather than an objective that the bloodstock be developed so that a breeding business could come into fruition in the future. ELIGIBILITY OF GOODS TO BE ZERO-RATED FOR GST PURPOSES Case\[2013\] NZTRA 04 TRA 31/11 Decision date24 July 2013 Act(s)Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 KeywordsExported goods, incorporated in to other goods Summary The taxpayer entered into an agreement to export goods to an overseas-based purchaser. After entering the agreement there was a change of approach by the purchaser who arranged for the goods to be used in New Zealand to manufacture different goods. The taxpayer argued that its goods were still ultimately exported and therefore that supply could be zero-rated for goods and services tax (“GST”) purposes. The Court found that the underlying goods had been consumed in New Zealand and therefore were not eligible to be zero-rated. Impact of decision This decision confirms that where there is manufacture, the old goods lose their identity and are consumed within the new goods. Facts The dispute involves a challenge to the Commissioner’s assessment disallowing the zero-rating for GST purposes of supplies of stainless steel spheres, made by the disputant, to a company based in the United Kingdom. The disputant submits that it supplied and exported the spheres to the United Kingdom, and that those supplies accordingly qualified for zero-rating under section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”). The Commissioner believed that the disputant did not export the goods as required under the GST Act, and therefore incorrectly returned the supplies in the relevant GST period as being zero-rated. The Commissioner contends the spheres were used in New Zealand in the manufacture of a sculpture, which was subsequently exported to the United Kingdom by another party. Accordingly, the Commissioner made an adjustment to the GST period ending 31 July 2009 to increase the GST payable by the disputant. Decision In regards to the first issue, the disputant argued that the goods exported were the spheres, not the sculpture. The Commissioner contended that the spheres were incorporated into the sculpture here in New Zealand, and LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES 34 inland revenue Department it was the sculpture that was exported. Once incorporated in the sculpture the spheres no longer possessed an independent identity and could not constitute “goods” for GST purposes in their own right. The Commissioner referred to a number of decisions from different jurisdictions and submitted that where there is manufacture, the Courts have held that old goods lose their identity and are consumed within the new goods. Judge Sinclair accepted the Commissioner’s submissions that those principles are generally applicable here. In Wellington City Council v Attorney General \[1990\] 2 NZLR 281, the Court of Appeal observed that whether a particular process has resulted in a product essentially different will be a question of fact and degree. Judge Sinclair found that the sculpture was very different from the spheres. For these reasons, Judge Sinclair found for the purposes of the GST Act the spheres were consumed and used in New Zealand in the manufacture of the sculpture, and accordingly the supplies of spheres were not eligible to be zero-rated. In regards to the second issue, the Commissioner submitted that what is required by sections 11(1)(a), (b) and (c) is that the supplier of the goods is the person who exports the goods. Judge Sinclair agreed with that submission, and reiterated her earlier finding that it was the sculpture that was exported and this was not exported by the disputant. In regards to the third issue, the disputant alleged that there was an informal agreement constituting an agency agreement between it and the company that manufactured and exported the sculpture under section 60(1) of the GST Act. The general manager of this company denied they were acting as the disputant’s agent. Judge Sinclair also found that ownership of the spheres passed from the disputant to the United Kingdom company in New Zealand so that, at the time of the export, the disputant had no legal or beneficial interest in the spheres now incorporated into the sculpture on which to found an agency arrangement. Finally, the disputant submitted that the Commissioner has discretion under sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow zero-rating when the supplier does not export the goods. The Commissioner submitted that while she accepts the situation came about due to a change in terms of the disputant’s contract of supply with the United Kingdom Company, and not because of any deliberate attempt to avoid payment of its tax obligation, she has no discretion to zero-rate the supply. Judge Sinclair accepted the Commissioner’s submissions that the care and management responsibilities set out in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not authorise her to interpret or apply the GST Act in a manner which is inconsistent with the scheme of the legislation. In the present case, section 11(1) of the GST Act specifically requires that the supplier be the exporter. The GST Act does not provide any discretion to the Commissioner to deem someone to be the exporter to meet this requirement. 37 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25 No 8 September 2013 rEGuLAr CONTribuTOrS TO THE Tib Office of the Chief Tax Counsel The Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (OCTC) produces a number of statements and rulings, such as interpretation statements, binding public rulings and determinations, aimed at explaining how tax law affects taxpayers and their agents.

We'll tell you as soon as they're available - GS 605Guide to Registration for GST IR 665Stamp Duty 3 This is the text of a press release made by the Com- missioner of Inland Revenue recently: The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, has welcomed a Privy Council decision which con- firms that Inland Revenue has been acting correctly in the collection of information from third party sources. The case involved the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the National Bank challenging the Commission- er's right to information about unnamed taxpayers. The Court of Appeal had previously found in favour of the Commissioner, and the Privy Council has now upheld that decision. Mr Henry said he welcomed the Privy Council's finding that "the whole rationale of taxation would break down" if the Commissioner did not have the right to collect information from third party sources. The case arose from the Commissioner requiring some members of the Stock Exchange to produce a list of their largest clients and details of the purchase and sale of shares. He also required some banks, including the National Bank, to produce the names and details of bank customers trading in commercial bills. In March last year, the High Court decided the Commissioner could only request information from a third party source when the request related to a specific named taxpayer. The Commissioner then appealed, and that decision was subsequently over- turned by the Court of Appeal last July. The National Bank and the Stock Exchange appealed that decision and that appeal was heard before the Privy Council last month. In its written decision, the Privy Council said that "the whole rationale of taxation would break down and the whole burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers if the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information about taxpayers who may be negligent or dishonest." The Privy Council said that there were other provi- sions in the Inland Revenue Act that were designed to secure, and did secure, the secrecy of information obtained by the Commissioner about the affairs of every taxpayer. "Every taxpayer is protected by the secrecy obliga- tion imposed on the Commissioner." The Council said that if the argument of the Stock Exchange and the National Bank was correct, confi- dentiality did not assist the taxpayer who made an honest return of their income or the dishonest tax- payer under investigation by the Commissioner. Instead it "assists the dishonest taxpayer who con- ceals both his identity and his liability to tax from the Commissioner," the Council said. The National Bank and the Stock Exchange also argued that the Commissioner's requirements made demands on sharebrokers and bankers that were onerous and expensive to obey. However, the Privy Council said there was "no doubt" that sharebrokers and bankers have or ought to have the information which the Commissioner has requested, and that the Commissioner had "demonstrated that he was pre- pared to modify his requirements to meet any genu- ine difficulty." The Council said that every sharebroker or banker would resent the time and expense incurred in com- plying with the Commissioner's request for informa- tion. "But the Commissioner must carry out his functions of ensuring that assessable income is assessed and that the relevant tax is paid." Mr Henry said that Inland Revenue would continue to collect third party information as part of its audit activities. "But these powers will continue to be used judi- ciously. There won't be any large increase in the amount of third party information we will be gather- ing." He said that the Department was well aware that it could be time-consuming and costly for organisa- tions to comply with its requests for information. "Because we are aware of this, we will offer to extract the information ourselves, or provide assistance if requested." In addition, where the relevant information is avail- able publicly for a fee it was usual for the Department to go through the normal public channels and pay the charges, Mr Henry said. Privy Council Decision Collection of Information from Third Parties 4 Materiality and Precision - Accruals Income Tax Regime Introduction This item explains the meaning of the terms "materi- ality" and "precision" as they are used in the accruals regime, and discusses the materiality and precision requirements of the regime. Precision is concerned with the accuracy of calcula- tions made by taxpayers under determinations by the Commissioner pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Materiality is a measurement of the difference between the amounts calculated under two separate accrual methods. Precision Precision requirements are outlined in Determina- tion G2. It provides that calculations must be car- ried to a sufficient number of decimal places so that going to one further decimal place will not change the result by more than five dollars. Precision is an accuracy criterion designed to ensure consistency in calculations made. It establishes a standard to be used in calculations arising from other determinations, and has no bearing on the question of materiality. Determination G2 applies to all calculations re- quired by the accruals regime. Accordingly, tax- payers are obliged to comply with G2 even if they are making calculations pursuant to another deter- mination. A precision test based on calculating to a fixed number of decimal places is considered not to be appropriate as it allows for inaccuracies in the final results when large dollar amounts are involved. This can happen even if the methods of calculation prescribed in other determinations are used. For that reason it has been decided to keep to a pre- cision measure based on a dollar figure. The current figure of five dollars has been reviewed and will be retained. It is considered to give a suitable level of accuracy, and not to result in an unacceptable level of compliance costs. Materiality In general, section 64C(2) of the Act requires use of the Yield to Maturity Method (YTM) to calculate in- come or expenditure in relation to a financial ar- rangement. The aim of this method is to allocate to each income year an amount that is fair and reason- able. The Commissioner can make determinations setting out how this method is to be applied to particular types of financial arrangement. Alternatively, there are some financial arrangements for which it is not possible to carry out the calculation of income or expenditure using the YTM. In these cases the Com- missioner may also make a determination setting out alternative methods of calculation to be used. However, in either of the above situations the Com- missioner is required to accept other methods of cal- culation used by taxpayers which meet certain crite- ria. One of these conditions is materiality. That is, the results of a calculation must not be "materially different" from those obtained using the prescribed method. Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) No.6, issued by the New Zealand Society of Ac- countants, establishes a materiality test for financial statements reporting purposes. SSAP-6 mentions that in deciding whether an item is material both the nature and amount of the item usually need to be taken into account. The Department endorses these comments. However, as a practical guide to assist in determin- ing when the materiality tests of the accruals income tax regime have been met, the Department has set guidelines using amount criteria only. These guide- lines should be regarded solely as indicators and are not hard and fast rules. There may be instances where the circumstances of a particular case are such that the use of the guidelines is inappropriate. The question of materiality in those cases will need to be decided on the facts of the case. Materiality Guidelines In applying the materiality guidelines each type or class of financial arrangement should be considered separately. The guidelines are applied to the amount of the dif- ference between the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement calculated using - i) either the YTM or other method as prescribed by determination of the Commissioner; AND ii) the accounting method adopted by the taxpayer. That difference will be regarded as materially differ- ent if it is equal to or greater than either - 5 (a) five per cent of the amount calculated according to the determination; or (b) $500,000. That difference will not be regarded as being materi- ally different if it is less than both - (a) five per cent of the amount calculated according to the determination; and (b) $500,000. Note: The dollar level referred to in the guideline should not be confused with recommendation 72 of the Consultative Committee on Tax Simplification. That recommendation favours the use of straight- line calculations for taxpayers with financial ar- rangements having a total face value of less than one million dollars. The materiality provisions are designed to give tax- payers some degree of flexibility in their selection of calculation methods. Accordingly, taxpayers or their agents will not always have to apply the pre- scribed method of calculation in order to determine whether their alternate method is acceptable. They will need to do this only where they think that the materiality guidelines may be exceeded. In practice the Department will only apply the pre- scribed method to test the accounting methods used by taxpayers. Amendments to income or expendi- ture figures resulting from such recalculations are not likely to be common occurrences. In some cases the Commissioner may determine more than one method for calculating the income or expenditure from a class of financial arrangements. If the taxpayer has chosen an alternative method, the materiality requirement will need to be satisfied in relation to only one of those prescribed methods. Taxpayers should consistently use that same pre- scribed method as the measure for materiality over the life of the financial arrangement. Other Requirements of Alternative Methods Materiality is only one of four criteria that must be met in order for an alternative method of calculation to be acceptable in terms of section 64C. The other three requirements are that: the method conforms to the principles of accrual accounting Although commonly used in accounting literature, the term "the principles of accrual accounting" is not defined in the Act or in a determination. It is a widely used, but largely unspecified concept. There are a number of generally accepted "correct" ways in which a taxpayer might accrue income and expenditure. This is particularly so for more com- plex financial arrangements. The Department ac- knowledges this wide scope of choice, while stress- ing the need for taxpayers to adhere to the general tenor of the legislation when adopting an alternate method. the method conforms with commercially accept- able practice There is a relationship between the concepts "com- mercially acceptable practice" and "principles of ac- crual accounting". It has been suggested that if a method conforms to the principles of accrual ac- counting, then it is also likely to meet the "commer- cially acceptable practice" requirement. In essence, the term "commercially acceptable prac- tice" means the commercial application of account- ing principles. These principles incorporate accrual accounting. As with the term "principles of accrual accounting", "commercially acceptable practice" is imprecise and open to interpretation. When considering computation issues, the courts have readily acknowledged the importance of estab- lished business conventions in the interpretation of tax laws. (See the comments of Richardson J. in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Farmers' Trad- ing Co. Ltd. (1982) 5 NZTC 61,201 at pp 61,203-4. the method be applied consistently One of the reasons for granting the concession of al- lowing taxpayers to use an alternative method is that they are using or prefer to use that method for financial reporting. Consequently it is reasonable to require taxpayers to be consistent in their use of the alternative method. This requirement is compatible with the trend of aligning accounting practices for financial and tax reporting purposes. Reference: HO 10.A.2.1A FBT - Prescribed Rate of Interest The Minister of Revenue has advised that the prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit of low interest loans has been re- duced to 13% for the quarter commencing 1 July 1991. 6 Summary Any National organisation seeking prior approval for overseas tour and conference deductions should now apply to its local Inland Revenue office. Background For some time, Inland Revenue has accepted appli- cations for prior approval to deduct the business-re- lated cost of overseas tours and conferences by groups. Until now, national organisations have submitted these applications to the Head Office of Inland Reve- nue. District and Regional offices have been han- dling applications for local groups. Revised Policy Both local and national groups seeking prior ap- proval of tour and conference deductions should apply to their local district offices. They should send such applications to the office of the district in which the principal organiser of the tour is based. Individual Claims Inland Revenue considers individual claims when participants furnish their annual returns of income. Each claim is treated on its merits according to in- come tax law. Only those expenses that are neces- sarily incurred in producing a taxpayer’s assessable income are allowable as a deduction. Irrespective of any prior approval set at a specified portion of ex- penses incurred, any taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction for more or less than that portion, de- pending on the circumstances of the case. Partici- pants must retain receipts and full details of their expenditure. Reference:HO 10.0.4.7 Technical Rulings: Chapter 20. Retention of Business and Other Records New Policy Microfilming There are no changes to the current rules on micro- filming financial records after 1 year. Here are the present rules: Retain original of these records (before micro- filming) for at least the last Financial Year for which an Income Tax Return has been filed: • Financial transaction records such as: -expense vouchers, invoices, tax invoices, copies of tax invoices, debit and credit notes -records of cash receipts, till tapes and receipt books -records and associated invoices of all goods purchased and sold, together with identifica- tion of buyers and sellers. (These require- ments do not apply to cash retail sales, or to cash wholesale sales made in the same way as cash retail sales.) Summary Inland Revenue has reviewed its policy on two as- pects of record retention methods, as a result of Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommen- dations. Background The requirements laid down in TIB No.6 (issued December 1989) are still largely valid, and should be adhered to. However, we have relaxed the require- ments on two issues: 1. Microfilming 2. New Technology and Electronic Recording We are also reviewing the retention period for busi- ness and other records. Currently, records must be kept for at least 10 years after the end of the income year (or taxable period) to which they relate, unless: • The Commissioner has given notice in writing that retention of certain records is not required; or • In the case of a company, the company has been wound up and finally dissolved. Approval of Overseas Tour and Conference Expenses 7 Points to note on the use of Microfilming or any other New Technology • Any records stored using new technology must be of good quality and must be easily readable • The records, when reproduced in printed form, must be identical in format and all other respects to the original records • There must be an adequate index to the stored material • If some records are stored using a particular method, all records in that class must be stored using the same method. If some documents or files are vetted before being stored using a par- ticular method, it is not acceptable for the vetted documents to be destroyed • Viewing and printing facilities for stored records must be available free of charge to Inland Revenue officers • If requested, persons must locate selected data which has been stored and print any items se- lected free of charge • It may be necessary to establish the admissibility of records which have been stored using a par- ticular method, in any proceedings Approvals and Assistance Providing you follow the above policy, you do not have to apply for prior approval to use new technol- ogy to maintain records in an electronic format. Please remember that failure to adhere to the above policy will be a breach of Section 428 of the Income Tax Act 1976, and the penal provisions available to the Commissioner will be applied accordingly. Any taxpayers, accountants or other agents wishing to vary the above policy must get written approval to do so. If you need any further information about the using new technology and electronic recording, any Inland Revenue Office will be able to help. Please direct any enquiries to the Verification Unit in your local Inland Revenue office. Application for Destruction of Records Inland Revenue is prepared to consider applications for the Destruction of Records after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the year in which a taxpayer was assessed. This applies to Private Companies, Self Employed Taxpayers, Partnerships and Trusts. The Critical Factors that affect such applications are: • Record of Compliance with Inland Revenue (fur- nishing of returns, payment of taxes, cooperation with enquiries, etc) • Reputation of the taxpayer in general business • Nature of taxpayer’s business • Accounting system -A record of all goods and services supplied by or to the registered person with identification of suppliers • Accountant's Working papers including: -client questionnaires -stock sheets (and the records from which those statements are compiled) -depreciation schedules -debtors’ and creditors’ calculations • Records and explanations of the accounting sys- tem, e.g., Chart of accounts, accounting manual. In a business with a computer based accounting system, the systems logic and full audit trail is required. • Records of business assets and liabilities • Internal business memoranda, including man- agement reports and documents • Written communications with other parties, in- cluding business letters, facsimile messages and telex messages • Records relating to fringe benefits provided to employees, together with supporting documents • Records relating to imputation credits, foreign payment withholding dividends, or branch equivalent tax accounts. • Records relating to specified superannuation con- tributions to a superannuation fund. The retention period before microfilming of books of account and other prime records has now been re- duced to 3 years. Retain original of these records (before micro- filming) for at least 3 years: • Books of account including cash books, journals and private ledgers. • Business bank statements, cheque butts and de- posit slips. • Wage Records • Minute books (shareholders and directors) and documents and papers submitted to meetings of shareholders and directors. Electronic and other new technologi- cal methods of record retention Because of new record storage facilities (eg, laser disks), and improved methods of referral and re- trieval, Inland Revenue will allow different storage methods on the condition that the data can be re- stored to paper legibly in its original format. 8 Books of Account must be Retained You must still keep Books of Account (Journals, Ledgers, Cashbooks) for at least 10 years after the end of the income year (or taxable period) to which they relate. Making an Application Applications to destroy records should be made to the Manager (Taxpayer Audit) in the District Office where the file is held. Reference: I.301 Earlier this year the Governor-General, by Order in Council, announced the average market values of specified livestock for the income year commencing on 1 April 1990. This was in accordance with the provisions of section 86D of the Income Tax Act 1976. Listed below, under the various classes of specified livestock, are the values to be used for the standard values scheme and the herd scheme for the income year, together with the trigger price for high price livestock. Note: For the 1991 income year, farmers who have elected to use the standard values scheme for valuing livestock must use the lesser of the 1990 or the 1991 standard values. The definition of “stand- ard value” in section 86 of the Income Tax Act 1976 was amended recently to reflect this change. The change is designed to minimise the tax effects that would have resulted from the rapid escala- tion in stock prices. Continued over page...

"Unconditional gift" has a special meaning for GST purposes. Section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (1985) defines unconditional gift. Generally, a payment is an unconditional gift if a person makes a payment to a non-profit body, and that person (or an associated person) receives no “identifiable direct valuable benefit” as a result of that payment. In Appendix B to TIB Vol.2, No.4 (November 1990), we explained the meaning of unconditional gift. This item continues that explanation of unconditional gift by considering: (i) Does an acknowledgement that a distribution has been made amount to an “identifiable direct valu- able benefit” in the form of a supply of goods and services; and (ii) Can a distribution to a non-profit body with a condition attached still be an unconditional gift? (1) PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Background Since the November 1990 TIB, the question has arisen whether an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” ac- crues to the person making a distribution (the donor), when the recipient acknowledges that the donor made the distribution. For example, the name of the donor may be included on posters, reports, bro- chures, or programmes produced by the recipient of the distribution. Does such acknowledgement amount to an “identifi- able direct valuable benefit” in the form of the supply of goods and services, and thereby disqualify the distribution from being an unconditional gift? Public Acknowledgements - Inland Revenue’s View Whether a donor receives an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” is a question of fact and must be determined on a case by case basis. The nature, extent, and circumstances surrounding the distribu- tion must be considered. The following factors are important in determining whether the recipient of a distribution is liable for GST on that distribution: i. If the non-profit body receiving the distribution is not a registered person, and has no liability to register for GST, the distribution will not be subject to GST. This is because only a registered person charges GST on supplies it makes. ii. Where there is no acknowledgement that the donor made the distribution (and no other benefit accrues to the donor), there is no “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. The distribution will be an unconditional gift. iii. There is a distinction between advertising and a simple acknowledgement: (i)Advertising is clearly a service and gives rise to an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” to the person making the distribution, irrespec- tive of whether that person profits because of the advertising. The distribution is subject to GST in the hands of the recipient. (ii)A simple acknowledgement, however, does not give rise to an “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. The distribution is not subject to GST in the hands of the recipient. iv. Whether recognition amounts to advertising or a simple acknowledgement is a question of degree, and all circumstances surrounding the distribu- tion must be considered. For example, 100 do- nors listed on a page in a programme are receiving a simple acknowledgement. However, if a non- profit body devotes a whole page of a programme to a particular donor, this amounts to advertising. v. If a donor receives a GST tax invoice from a non- profit body in respect of any distribution, the parties are acknowledging that there has been a supply of goods and services. That distribution is subject to GST in the hands of the recipient. Further, the donor is entitled to claim an input tax credit where the donor acquired the supply for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Where a donor does not receive a GST tax invoice, this may be evidence that the parties to the distri- bution consider that there has been no supply of goods and services. However, lack of a GST tax invoice cannot by itself determine the matter. This is because a supply of goods and services may still occur even though a non-profit body did not issue a GST tax invoice. GST and Unconditional Gifts 12 Example 5 An insurance company decides to sponsor a horse race. The racing club (a registered non-profit body) names the race after the insurance company. Inland Revenue considers that such a distribution is subject to GST. The insurance company receives an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” in the form of a supply of goods and services - that is, the insurance company is receiving advertising. (2) DISTRIBUTIONS MADE WITH CON- DITIONS ATTACHED The November 1990 TIB considered unconditional gifts from the viewpoint that there is not an uncondi- tional gift where a donor makes a distribution, and any benefit is conditional on that distribution. This article does not depart from that view. Rather, it approaches the problem from the perspective that a distribution is made with a condition attached. For example, a distribution of $3000 may be made to a registered non-profit body on the condition that a computer is purchased with the money. Does the “earmarking” of the distribution disqualify it from being an unconditional gift? Inland Revenue considers that a donor can still make an unconditional gift even though the donor attaches a condition to that distribution. As long as the distribution is voluntary and for the purposes of the non-profit body, and the person making the distribu- tion (or an associated person) does not receive an “identifiable direct valuable benefit”, the distribu- tion can still be an unconditional gift. Example 6 A company makes a voluntary distribution of $500 to a football club (a registered non-profit body) on the condition that the football club purchases soccer balls with the money. Neither the company (nor an asso- ciated person) receives an “identifiable direct valu- able benefit”. The distribution is an unconditional gift even though a condition is attached to the distribution. The payment is voluntary and for the purposes of the non-profit body, and neither the company nor an associated person receives an “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. Example 7 A company makes a distribution to a registered non- profit body to allow that body to stage a concert. It is a condition of the distribution that the company receives tickets to the concert without further pay- ment. Where a donor does not receive a GST tax invoice for a distribution, the case must be considered objectively to decide whether the donor has re- ceived an “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. Examples Example 1 ABC company makes a distribution of $1,000 to a local sporting club (a non-profit body). Equipment is purchased with the $1,000. The club is not registered for GST, nor does it have any liability to register. The distribution cannot be subject to GST. The club is not a registered person for GST purposes. There- fore, it does not charge GST on supplies it makes. Example 2 DEF company places an advertisement in a paper asking non-profit bodies to apply for funds. A local theatre group (a registered non-profit body) files an application and receives $500. At a performance, the theatre group produces a programme. The pro- gramme states that the performance is “with the assistance of” and then lists 30 organisations that have made donations to the group. The programme includes the name of DEF company. Inland Revenue considers that DEF company has derived no “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. The distribution is an unconditional gift for GST pur- poses, and has no GST implications. Example 3 ABC trust makes a substantial distribution to a reg- istered non-profit body. The non-profit body builds a hall with those funds and affixes a plaque which states that the hall was funded by the generous donation of ABC trust. Inland Revenue considers that ABC trust has not derived an “identifiable direct valuable benefit”. The distribution is an unconditional gift for GST pur- poses and has no GST implications. Example 4 A bank makes a distribution to a registered non- profit body to allow the non-profit body to operate a helicopter. The helicopter has the bank’s name and logo painted on it. Inland Revenue considers that such a distribution is subject to GST. The bank receives an “identifiable direct valuable benefit” in the form of a supply of goods and services - that is, the bank is receiving advertising. 13 Inland Revenue considers that such a distribution is subject to GST. The company receives an “identifi- able direct valuable benefit” - that is, receipt of the tickets without further payment. Application Date This policy applies from 26 July 1991. Any live objections existing at that date will be considered in terms of this policy statement. Late objections will be considered in terms of the Department’s policy on the acceptance of late objections. TIB No.5, Novem- ber 1989 sets out this policy. Reference:HO GST N.1.1 Technical Rulings 108.7 Objections to PAYE Deductions - Deferral of Disputed Tax Inland Revenue has recently reviewed its policy on PAYE deductions and objections in terms of section 337(4). Previously we did not allow the benefit of the section 34 deferral regime to employers who objected to PAYE determinations under section 337(4). We have now reconsidered this position. Inland Revenue recognises that as the law currently stands "Notices of Deficient Tax Deduction" should be treated as though they are assessments for the pur- poses of the objection procedure. Consequently, employers who are objecting to a PAYE determination and who have received a No- tice of Deficient Tax Deduction may defer half of the amount stated as payable in that Notice.

This Bill was for- merly part of the Taxation Reform Bill which was introduced on 19 December 1990. The Acts resulting from the Taxation Reform Bill (No.3) are the: • Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 • Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 15 Contents Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 Tax Exemption for Community Taskforce Allowance ....................................................... 16 Accrual Regime Amendments ............................................................................................... 16 Forestry Taxation ..................................................................................................................... 18 Livestock Taxation ................................................................................................................... 19 Agricultural Development Expenditure ............................................................................... 21 Assessability and Deductibility of Monetary Remuneration ............................................ 21 Loss Carry-Forward and Grouping Rules ........................................................................... 23 Excess Retention Tax Abolished ............................................................................................ 25 Retirement Tax Repealed ........................................................................................................25 Provisional Tax ......................................................................................................................... 26 Fringe Benefit Tax .................................................................................................................... 26 FBT and Charities ..................................................................................................................... 26 FBT on Loans to Life Insurance Policyholders .................................................................... 27 FBT on Loans to Employees - Method of Fixing of Prescribed Rate of Interest ............ 27 FBT and the Cost Price of Motor Vehicles ............................................................................ 28 Offsetting of Tax Refunds .......................................................................................................28 Relief in Cases of Serious Hardship ...................................................................................... 29 Resident Withholding Tax - Technical Correction to Due Date Change ........................ 29 No-Declaration Rate of Resident Withholding Tax Deductions ....................................... 30 Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 Application of GST to Government Grants and Subsidies ................................................ 30 Zero-Rating of Intellectual Property Rights ......................................................................... 31 16 Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991 Tax Exemption for Community Taskforce Allowance Section 3 Introduction This amendment exempts from income tax the allow- ance that the New Zealand Employment Service (Department of Labour) pays to participants of the Community Taskforce scheme. Background The Community Taskforce scheme will allow people who receive the unemployment benefit to undertake work with a sponsor. While on the scheme, the participant continues to receive the unemployment benefit from the Department of Social Welfare. The participant will also receive a $15 a week allowance to cover incidentals such as transport from home and work. The New Zealand Employment Service pays this amount to the sponsor, who in turn pays it to the participant if and when he or she turns up for work. Otherwise it is refunded. Key Issues The amendment inserts a new paragraph in section 61, which exempts income from tax. The amend- ment provides that this allowance is exempt from tax when derived by a participant. As the sponsor is acting as agent on behalf of the New Zealand Employment Service in paying the allow- ance to the participant, the allowance is not subject to GST or income tax in the hands of the sponsor. The Community Taskforce programme came into effect on 1 July 1991. Accrual Regime Amendments Sections 4, 5, 6, 18 Sections 4, 5, 6, and 18 implement some of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee’s recommen- dations on the accruals regime, specifically - • To provide that taxpayers to whom the accruals rules apply, but who have financial arrangements of less than $1 million, may calculate their income on a straight line basis. (Recommendation 72) • To raise the thresholds below which a taxpayer is classed as a cash basis holder. (Recommendation 74) • To allow the calculation of deferred income (for determining whether or not a person qualifies as a cash basis holder) to be done on a straight line basis. (Recommendation 75) • To allow a deceased person’s estate to account as a cash basis holder (for up to five years after the death of that person) where the deceased was a cash basis holder. (Recommendation 80) Section Analysis Section 4: Accruals in relation to income and expenditure in respect of financial arrangements Section 4 inserts sections 64C(2A) and (2B) into the principal Act. Specifically, section 64C(2A) provides that a person who holds or issues financial arrange- ments of $1,000,000 or less in any income year may calculate income or expenditure for that year on a straight line basis in respect of those arrangements. Any amount of income or expenditure calculated using the straight line method is deemed to be in- come derived or expenditure incurred in the relevant income year. There are restrictions on the application of this pro- vision in that: (a) The amount allocated to any income year must be fair and reasonable; (b) The straight line method must be applied to all financial arrangements to which it can be applied and to which that person is a holder or issuer during that year; and (c) The person must continue to use the straight line method for financial arrangements to which it has been applied until they mature, are remitted, or are sold or otherwise transferred, even if the person exceeds the $1 million threshold. Section 64C(2B) provides for the valuing of financial arrangements to be taken into account in determin- ing whether the value of the financial arrangements issued and held by a person exceeds $1 million. It also provides for the calculation of income or expenditure for the first income year a person begins using the straight line basis for a financial arrangement. 17 Section 64C(2B)(a) provides that in the case of a fixed principal financial arrangement, the value of that arrangement is its nominal or face value. In the case of variable principal debt instruments, the value is the amount owing by or to the person on any day. Section 64C(2B)(b) provides that in the first income year for which the straight line method is used and - (i)The financial arrangement was acquired in a prior income year; and (ii) The financial arrangement continues to be held or issued by the person at the end of the first income year in which the straight line method is used, the income or expenditure in respect of that financial arrangement for that first income year (in which the straight line method is applied by the taxpayer) is calculated according to the following formula: a - b - c - d Where - a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income had the straight line method applied from the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued until the end of the first income year; and b is the sum of all amounts which would have been expenditure had the straight line method applied from the date the financial arrangement was ac- quired or issued until the end of the first income year; and c is the sum of all amounts of income deemed to have been derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement before the commencement of the first income year; and d is the sum of all amounts deemed to have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement before the commence- ment of the first income year. Any positive amount arising from that formula is deemed to be income derived by the person in the first income year. A negative amount is deemed to be an expenditure incurred by the person. Subsection (3) amends the provision which requires persons to use other methods of calculation (section 64C(3)) where it is not possible to use the yield to maturity method. The effect of the amendment is that where the yield to maturity method or the straight line method cannot be applied, the taxpayer may use another method which meets the other requirements of section 64C(3). Subsection (4) consequentially amends section 64C(5) which provides that certain persons and financial arrangements do not have to be accounted for under the accruals provisions during the term of the ar- rangement. The list of which sections a person is not required to comply with is consequentially extended to include the new sections 64C(2A) and 64(2B). Subsection (5) provides that this section applies to the income year commencing 1 April 1991 and every subsequent income year. Section 5: Cash Basis Holder Section 5(1) amends the cash-basis holder thresholds by: • Raising the income the person can derive from financial arrangements before ceasing to be a cash basis holder from $50,000 to $70,000; and • Raising the total value of financial arrangements a person can hold before ceasing to be a cash basis holder from $400,000 to $600,000. • Raising the deferred income threshold to $20,000 from $15,000. Subsection (2) amends the deferred income thresh- old twice. Firstly, the $15,000 deferred income threshold is raised to $20,000, or such greater amount the Commissioner may from time to time declare. Secondly, a person may calculate the cash basis holder threshold on the straight line basis or yield to maturity basis, or an alternative method approved by the Commissioner where it is not possible to use the first two methods. The straight line method can be applied whether or not the person is entitled to use it. In other words, a person with financial arrange- ments of over $1 million may still apply the straight line basis for the purpose of this calculation only. Subsection (3) amends section 64D(6), which pro- vides that no person who holds financial arrange- ments which produce trustee or beneficiary income can be a cash basis holder, to provide that this is subject to the amendment providing that a trustee of an estate may be a cash basis holder in certain cases. Subsection (4) of this subsection inserts subsection 64D(7A) to provide that the trustee of a deceased person’s estate is able to account for tax as a cash basis holder (for up to five years after the death of that person) where the deceased was a cash basis holder. In effect, the requirement that a cash basis holder be a natural person shall be waived for the year of death and four subsequent years. The estate shall become a cash basis holder only where all requirements of such, other than the natural person test, are met. Note that a base price adjustment is still required on the transfer of financial assets to the estate. If, after having met all the tests of being a cash basis holder, the estate ceases to qualify as such, it is not possible to requalify at a later date under this subsec- tion. 18 Subsection (5) provides that this section applies to the income year commencing on 1 April 1991 and every subsequent income year. Section 6: Determinations Section 6 provides the Commissioner with the power to issue a determination setting out how to apply the straight line method. A determination will provide certainty as to how the straight line method is to be applied in more complex situations (e.g., a reducing principal loan). A deter- mination will give taxpayers comfort that the method they have used will not be disputed by the Commis- sioner. The determination will be issued shortly. Section 18: Trustee Income Section 18 consequentially amends section 228(1)(c) of the principal Act. The amendment to trustee income provides that a natural person may be a cash basis holder where the requirements of section 64D(7A) are met. Sections 7 and 36 make a number of changes to the tax treatment of forestry. The major amendments intro- duce: • an anti-avoidance provision to prevent the reali- sation of existing cost of bush accounts; • deductibility of expenditure incurred on planting and maintaining trees; • deductibility of expenditure incurred on creating access tracks, with an increased depreciation rate for “minor” roads. Section Analysis Section 7: Income Derived from the Use or Occupa- tion of Land Subsection (1) inserts a new section 74(2A), which is an anti-avoidance provision designed to prevent the realisation of existing cost of bush accounts by the sale of a forest to an associated person at less than that cost of bush. Where such a sale does occur the vendor may not deduct an amount which exceeds the exist- ing cost of bush. The cost of timber to the associated person purchasing the forest is set at the purchase cost of the timber, and any amount not allowed as a deduction to the vendor. Subsection (6) provides that subsection (1) applies only to timber sold on or after 1 April 1991. Subsection (2) inserts a new section 74(3A). This subsection provides immediate deductibility for any expenditure incurred on the construction of access tracks for a specific operational purpose and which are not used for longer than 12 months after the completion of that construction. This amendment relates to the amendments made to the Thirteenth Schedule to the principal Act as outlined below. Subsection (3) provides that any expenditure which was deductible under section 74(3A), and which is subsequently recouped by the taxpayer, is assessable income to the taxpayer in the year in which it is recouped. Subsections (4) and (5) remove the cost of bush accounts in relation to expenditure on the planting and maintaining of trees. This provision makes expenditure incurred on planting and maintaining trees deductible where it is incurred during or after the income year commencing 1 April 1991. Subsection (7) provides that subsections (2) to (5) of the Amendment Act apply to expenditure incurred in the income year commencing 1 April 1991. Section 36: Thirteenth Schedule Amended This section of the Amendment Act amends the Thirteenth Schedule to the principal Act to set new rates of depreciation on roads and access tracks. A new paragraph (e) provides that a forester may depreciate expenditure on the construction of roads to or on the land, being roads which are formed and wholly or substantially metalled or sealed, and any culverts or bridges that are necessary for the pur- poses of that construction. The new rate of deprecia- tion is 5% DV. A new paragraph (ea) provides that a forester may depreciate at 20% DV, expenditure on the construc- tion of roads to or on the land (and any culverts or bridges that are necessary for the purposes of that construction) where- (i) Those roads are formed and partially metalled or sealed; or (ii) Those roads are not metalled or sealed. A provision is included to exclude access tracks to which section 74(3A) applies from paragraph (ea). This prevents a possible argument that access tracks to which section 74(ea) applies have to be depreci- ated as an unsealed road along with any other access tracks. Subsection (2) provides that this section applies to the income year commencing on 1 April 1991 and every subsequent year. Forestry Taxation Sections 7 and 36 19 should they wish. This provision is duplicated with the further expansion of the definition of herd live- stock to include all classes of specified livestock. Specifically, livestock owners who have elected to use the herd scheme in respect of one or more types of livestock prior to the income year commencing 1 April 1991 are entitled to use this election. In detail, section 85A (2)(b) is amended to provide that any election to include livestock in the herd scheme shall be on a type by type basis subject to sections 85A (2A) and 85A (2B). Section 85A (2B) provides that where any taxpayer has elected to adopt the herd livestock scheme before the beginning of the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1991, the taxpayer may further elect to exclude those classes of livestock now being added to the herd scheme in this Act. Any election made may be revoked on a class by class basis by the taxpayer in any subsequent year. How- ever, the election to exclude livestock classes, once revoked in relation to a class of livestock, cannot be reversed. Section 10: Standard Value of Livestock Section 86 is amended so that, in the case of the 1991 income year, the standard values applying to trading stock are frozen at the lesser of the 1990 and the 1991 standard values. This calculation is undertaken on a class by class basis and is compulsory, as the tax- payer must use the lower of the two values. This provision applies only to the 1991 income year and does not affect the herd scheme in any way. The amendment only applies for one income year and is to allow time for a livestock taxation review to take place. Section 11: Valuation of High Priced Livestock Section 11 amends the high-priced scheme to ensure a more effective targeting of the scheme when live- stock values are increasing. The high-priced scheme ensures that the cost of a high-priced breeding animal is allocated over the breeding life of that animal. Prior to the Amendment Act, the high-priced scheme was applied to an animal where that animal was purchased at a cost 3 times (or in the case of sheep and goats, 4 times) the previous year’s average market value (NAMVs). The Amendment Act provides that the high-priced scheme applies only where the pur- chase cost of the animal exceeds by 3 times (or in the case of sheep and goats, 4 times) the higher of the previous year’s or the current year’s livestock values. Livestock Taxation Sections 2, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 26 Sections 2, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 26 make a number of significant amendments to livestock taxation by: • expanding the definition of herd livestock to in- clude all specified livestock; • providing that specified livestock may be ex- cluded from the herd scheme should a farmer so wish; • introducing a provision to spread income arising where a farmer moves livestock into the herd scheme or where the farmer is increasing herd livestock numbers; • amending the high-priced scheme to ensure that non-breeding livestock are not included in the scheme when livestock values increase rapidly; • freezing the standard values applying to the trad- ing stock scheme at the lesser of the 1990 and the 1991 values. Section Analysis Section 2: Interpretation (Amends definition of Herd Livestock) Section 2 (1) amends section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 by inserting a new definition of the term “herd livestock”. The new definition provides that all specified livestock are now also herd livestock. In other words, trading stock animals can now be moved into the herd scheme should the livestock owner so wish. This subsection applies to the income commencing on 1 April 1991 and every subsequent income year. Section 9: Livestock Valuation Elections Section 9 replaces the existing section 85A (2)(b) and inserts a new section 85A (2B). When introduced, section 85A (2) provided that when a livestock owner elected to include livestock in the herd scheme, all herd livestock of that type had to be included in the scheme. In other words, if a farmer elected to include deer in the herd scheme all classes of deer owned by the farmer which could be included in the herd scheme had to be included. With effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1989, the definition of herd livestock was expanded to include further mature classes of live- stock. Livestock owners already in the herd scheme were given an option to exclude those new classes 20 This introduces an element of uncertainty as, for most taxpayers, the current year NAMVs are not known until late or even after the end of their income year. However, the provision ensures that when values are increasing, entry levels will reflect that increase. Where values are decreasing, an entry level based on the previous year’s NAMV will apply, providing certainty when values are declining. Some have suggested that the solution to the problem of non-breeding animals being included in the high- priced scheme was to increase the multipliers. How- ever, where livestock values increase very rapidly, an increase in multipliers may not be sufficient to ensure that large numbers of livestock are not in- cluded in the high-priced scheme. Also, increasing multipliers would give farmers excessive write- downs where livestock values are not increasing. Finally, more livestock would be included in the determination of the value of the NAMVs. This would result in an increase in NAMVs. Section 12: Spreading of Income Arising on entry into herd scheme and on increase in size of herd Section 12 inserts a new section 86DA, which effec- tively spreads over 3 income years: • 30% of the unrealised income from the retention of herd livestock. Unrealised income will also arise where livestock moves through the livestock classes. This income is defined as “homebred herdstock deferrable income”; and • Income arising where specified livestock is moved into the herd scheme from another scheme. This income is defined as “new herdstock deferrable income”. “Homebred herdstock deferrable income” means an amount (not being less than nil) calculated in accord- ance with the following formula: 30 x (a - b - c) 100 where - a is the total herd value of all livestock which is female, more than 1 year of age at the end of the income year, and that class of livestock is valued in the herd scheme at the end of the year. b is the cost of animals purchased or captured during the year where that livestock is female, more than 1 year of age at the end of the income year, and that class of livestock is valued in the herd scheme at the end of the year, (Note: the unrealised income associated with animals purchased or captured and then retained is included in the formula by item (b) bringing animals purchased or captured into account at their purchase or capture cost and item (a) ac- counting for these animals at their herd value). c is the total value of all herd livestock on hand at the beginning of the year where that livestock is female, of a class that is more than 1 year of age at the beginning of the income year, and is of a class valued at the end of the income year in accordance with section 86A of the Act. “New herdstock deferrable herd income” means an amount (not being less than nil) calculated in accord- ance with the following formula: d x (e - f) where - d is in relation to any class of livestock being added to the herd scheme the lesser of: (a) The number of that livestock of that class on hand at the beginning of the income year; and (b) The number of that livestock of that class on hand at the end of the income year; and e is the herd value declared for that year for that class of livestock; and fis the average closing value of an animal of that class of livestock at the end of the immediately preceding income year. The average closing value is to be determined by dividing the total closing livestock value of that class of livestock by the number of animals that were on hand at the end of that immediately preceding income year. The result of the above formulas comprises “deferra- ble herd income”, which can be spread in accordance with subsections (2) to (5) of this section. For the 1990 income year deferrable herd income includes only the taxpayer’s homebred herdstock deferrable in- come for that year. For the income year commencing 1 April 1991 and future income years, deferrable herd income comprises both new herdstock deferra- ble herd income and homebred herdstock deferrable income. The application of the provision spreading income arising when livestock numbers increase through retaining animals is to help farmers restock after recent adverse events, particularly the East Coast droughts. Subsections 86DA(2) to (5) provide the mechanics of the spread once the amount of income to be spread is calculated. 21 Subsection (2) provides that a taxpayer must elect to spread deferrable herd income in respect of an in- come year. The election is by notice in writing in the return of income for that income year. Subsection (2) also provides that the deferrable herd income is spread 1/3 to the current income year and 1/3 to each of the next 2 income years. This income is deemed to be income derived by the taxpayer in the income year to which it is allocated. Subsection (3) provides that in a year where a farmer dies or ceases farming all the deferrable herd income becomes due in that year. Subsection (4) provides that the Commissioner may cancel the spread. Any residual amount outstanding is due in the income year in respect of which the spread was cancelled. Subsection (5) is the normal accounting year provi- sion. Section 26: Determination of Assessable Income Section 26 amends section 374B(1) of the principal Act. Section 374B(1) provides for the calculation of income for the purposes of Family Support. This amendment provides that the 3-year spreading pro- vision, provided in section 86DA (as inserted by section 11 of this Amendment Act), does not get taken into account when calculating Family Support. In effect, the current position, that farmers with livestock included in the herd scheme have their Family Support calculated based on the basis of trading stock values, is continued. Sections 14 and 15 provide deductibility for certain types of expenditure which previously had to be capitalised and depreciated. Section Analysis Section 14: Certain expenditure on land used for farming or agricultural purposes Section 14 amends section 127 of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection (A1). This new subsection provides that the following expenditure shall be deductible: (a) The destruction of weeds or plants detrimental to the land; (b) The destruction of animal pests detrimental to the land; (c) The clearing, destruction, and removal of scrub, stumps and undergrowth; (d) The repair of flood or erosion damage; (e) The planting and maintaining of trees for the purpose of preventing or combating erosion; (f) The planting and maintaining of trees for the purpose of shelter; (g) The construction on the land of fences for agricul- tural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit- proof. Subsection (2) provides that this section applies from the income year commencing 1 April 1991. Section 15: Farmers’ expenditure on tree planting Section 15 of the Amendment Act amends section 134 of the principal Act to provide that the section no longer applies to trees for which a deduction can be claimed under section 127(A1). In effect this section now only applied to trees of an ornamental nature and trees planted by farmers not in the business of forestry. While this section has no application subsection its effective application date is the income year com- mencing 1 April 1991. Agricultural Development Expenditure Sections 14 and 15 Assessability and Deductibility of Monetary Remuneration Sections 8 and 13 Introduction The amendments remove the tax deferral opportuni- ties arising from the timing mismatch between the time a deduction is claimed for monetary remunera- tion (i.e., salary, wages, and other remuneration) and the time that the remuneration is returned as income. The amendments also deny a deduction for balance day provisions such as holiday pay. Background The principles underlying the mismatch between the assessability and the Deductibility of monetary re- muneration are: • The employer is entitled to claim a deduction when the monetary remuneration is “incurred”: • The monetary remuneration is not assessable to 22 the employee or shareholder/employee until it “derived” (i.e., paid or credited). The most common mismatch is the one year deferral of tax for shareholder/employees. For some time case law has allowed remuneration to be deducted by the company in the year in which it is incurred (the year in which the services are provided) but returned as income by the shareholder/employee in the fol- lowing year when it is actually paid or credited. The recent Court of Appeal decision \[CIR v Glen Eden Metal Spinners Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC\] confirmed that, by committing itself in a resolution, a company can deduct the costs of directors’ remuneration incurred, even though the amount deducted exceeds the amount actually paid to the directors in the following year. The deferred payments bonus scheme is another version of this mismatch. This scheme is based on the advantage obtained by an employer deducting the cost of a bonus to an employee in an income year even though that bonus is not paid to the employee until years later. The bonus is not returned as income by the employee until the year in which it is paid. Monetary remuneration includes any wage, salary, bonus, director fees, or payment made in respect of employment. Key Issues The provisions amend sections 75 and 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976, which deal the derivation of income and accrual expenditure respectively. • Derivation of income Section 8 amends section 75 of the Income Tax Act 1976 which determines when income is derived. The amendment requires a shareholder/employee of a company to return the monetary remuneration de- rived from that company in the same income year in which the company has claimed a deduction for that remuneration. The amount to be returned is the amount claimed as deduction under section 104A of the Act. For example, monetary remuneration claimed as a deduction by a company with a balance date of 30 September 1991 is returned by the share- holder/employee in the 1991 income year (i.e., end- ing 31 March 1991). Where a company has incurred monetary remunera- tion in an income year and only part of that amount has been paid to the shareholder/employee, the balance is derived in the income year in which it is paid to the shareholder/employee. • Estimation of Provisional Tax The amendment will require a shareholder/employee with a 31 March balance date who derives remunera- tion from a company with a late balance date to pay provisional tax on income that has not been derived by the company and paid to the shareholder/em- ployee. As a result, a shareholder/employee may find it difficult to estimate provisional tax. • Doubling up of income in the 1991 income year Where a shareholder/employee has been taking ad- vantage of the timing mismatch, the amendment will result in a doubling-up of income in the 1991 income year. Taxpayers with a 31 July balance date who are affected by the doubling-up of income will be eligible in terms of the current provisional tax rules for a remission of underestimation additional tax and use- of-money interest on short-paid provisional tax for the 1991 income year if payment of the short-paid provisional tax is made by 7 February 1992. Under the existing provisional tax rules the Commissioner is required to remit such penalties and interest which result from a change in the law enacted subsequent to the beginning of the month prior to the due date for the payment of the third instalment of provisional tax. The amendments received the Governor-Gener- al's assent on 28 June 1991. Application for such a remission will need to be made to the Commissioner. Taxpayers with an August or September balance date who have estimated their 1991 provisional tax will need to make catchup payments on the date of their third provisional payment to avoid becoming liable for underestimation additional tax and/or use- of-money interest. This relief from underestimation additional tax and use-of-money interest does not apply to 1992 provi- sional tax estimates. • Calculation of 1992 and 1993 Provisional Tax An adjustment must be made where a shareholder/ employee has been affected by the doubling-up of income in the 1991 income year, and uses the 1991 residual income tax plus the uplift factors to deter- mine 1992 provisional tax and the first and second instalments of 1993 provisional tax. The 1991 re- sidual income tax is reduced by the tax payable on the remuneration returned through the operation of the amendment. The amount of the reduction is calcu- lated by applying the average tax rate of the share- holder/employee to that remuneration returned. • Accrued expenditure Section 13 amends section 104A, which deals with accrued expenditure. Where an employer incurs expenditure by way of monetary remuneration in an income year which has not been paid in that income year or within the period allowed following the end of the income year, the amount not paid is treated as being the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure and is added back as assessable income. The amount 23 • Shareholder/employee A shareholder/employee is a person who receives or is entitled to receive income which is not treated as a source deduction payment. • Paid The term “paid” is defined along the lines of section 75, which deals with derivation of income. “Paid” includes remuneration credited in account, rein- vested, accumulated, or dealt with in the interest or on behalf of a person. The mere accruing of remu- neration such as holiday pay and long service leave to a reserve does not constitute payment. • Application date Section 8 applies to monetary remuneration derived during or after the income year commencing 1 April 1990. Section 13 applies (except for holiday pay) to mon- etary remuneration incurred on after 1 April 1990. The provision applies to holiday pay from 1 April 1991. Any reserves created under the existing rules prior to the application of these amendments will not be treated as unexpired accrued expenditure and will not be added back as assessable income. added back is deductible in the income year in which it is paid. The test for determining when services for accrued monetary remuneration are performed is payment. • Period allowed for payment Where the employee is not a shareholder/employee, the remuneration must be paid in the income year in which it is incurred or within 63 days after the end of the income year. The amendment denies a deduction for holiday pay, long service leave and sick leave incurred in an income year unless payment has been made within the income year or the 63 day period. Where the employee is a shareholder/employee of a company, the remuneration must be paid in the income year or within the time allowed for the fur- nishing of the return of income for that income year. This is the last day for furnishing a return under the extension of time arrangements. • Holiday pay The amendment allows holiday pay to be claimed as a deduction in the income year incurred under the existing rules for the 1991 income year. From the income year commencing 1 April 1991, holiday pay incurred will be treated like any other monetary remuneration incurred and only be deductible when it has been paid. Carrying forward of Losses Section 16 amends subsections (7) and (7A) of section 188 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 188(7) provides that a limited liability company can carry forward its losses only if there has been a 40 percent continuity of share ownership from the commence- ment of the income year in which a loss is incurred until the end of the income year in which a loss is offset. Prior to the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990 this shareholding continuity requirement was determined by “looking through” any corporate shareholders in the loss company to the ultimate natural person shareholders. The 1990 Amendment Act restricted this look through requirement to com- panies limited by shares only, to cater for the situa- tions where there are no ultimate natural person shareholders, e.g., the subsidiaries of local authori- ties. It was found that the 1990 amendment to section 188 was too wide in its effect and could facilitate the trafficking of losses. This is because there are several readily utilisable types of corporate entity (e.g., com- panies limited by guarantee) which effectively have natural person shareholders controlling them but which nevertheless are not caught by the 1990 amend- ment wording of the look through requirement in section 188(7). Section 16 reinstates the previous requirement in section 188 which required one to look through any corporate shareholder in a loss company to the ulti- mate natural person shareholders to ascertain whether the shareholder continuity requirements had been satisfied. Specific provision, however, has been made for local authorities, statutory producer boards and statutory bodies established by specific Act of Parliament to ensure that the subsidiary com- panies of these entities are not prevented from car- rying forward their losses by reason only of a lack of ultimate natural person shareholders. These parent entities are exempted from the corporate shareholder look-through requirement. The term “special corporate entity”, within the meaning of new section 191(1)(g), has been used in section 16 for reasons of drafting conciseness to refer to a local authority, statutory producer board or a statutory body established by specific Act of Parlia- ment. A fuller description of this term is contained below in the TIB item on section 17. Loss Carry-Forward and Grouping Rules Sections 16, 17, 29, 30 and 31 24 In summary, section 16 tightens up section 188 to prevent manipulation for loss trafficking purposes while specifically providing for the bona fide loss carry-forward situations of the subsidiaries of local authorities, statutory producer boards and other statutory bodies. Section 16 applies to the tax on income derived in the income years commencing on or after 1 April 1988. Loss Carry - Forward Consequentials - Sections 29, 30 and 31 Sections 29, 30 and 31 make the equivalent amend- ments to section 15 of the Amendment Act in respect of the parts of the principal Act dealing with imputa- tion (section 394E(4)), dividend withholding pay- ments (section 394ZW(4)) and branch equivalent tax accounts (section 394ZZP(6)). Again use is made of the special corporate entity term which is defined in new paragraph (g) of section 191(1). The parts of the Act referred to above contain share- holder continuity provisions (similar in concept to that found in section 188(7)) which, if not satisfied, operate to cancel any credits accumulated in an imputation credit, dividend withholding payment or branch equivalent tax account. These shareholder continuity provisions require one to look through all corporate shareholders to the ultimate natural per- son shareholders in determining whether the requi- site shareholder continuity requirements have been satisfied. Such shareholder continuity provisions, as was the case in section 188, are problematical for the subsidi- aries of special corporate entities (within the mean- ing of new section 191(1)(g)) because their parent companies do not have any ultimate natural person shareholders as contemplated by the look-through provision. Sections 29 to 31 effectively exempt spe- cial corporate entities from the corporate shareholder look through requirement. Where shares are held by a special corporate entity, then for so long as they continue to be held by that entity, they shall be deemed to be held by the same person regardless of any change in the members or directors of a special corporate entity. The separate look-through provi- sion in section 191(1)(b) is also stated not to apply to a special corporate entity in relation to the various continuity of shareholding provisions amended by sections 29 to 31. The amendments made by sections 29, 30 and 31 apply from the income year commencing on or after 1 April 1988. Group Loss Offsetting - Section 17 Section 17 amends section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which sets out the requirements that must be satisfied for a number of companies to constitute a group and utilise the losses of other companies in the same group. The amendments made by section 16 are principally intended to place corporate groups which include a local authority, statutory producer board or a statu- tory body established by specific Act of Parliament, on a level footing with other corporate groups in respect of the general ordinary and specified group provisions of section 191. While corporate groups including such entities were previously given limited access to the specified group provisions of section 191 (subsections (4), (4A) and (5)) by section 191(6)(b), they were not given access to the ordinary group provisions (subsections (3) and (7)). For example, the offsetting of losses was not possible within a corpo- rate group which included a local authority, and which was at least two thirds but less than 100 percent commonly owned. Section 17(1) makes the most substantive amend- ments by inserting new paragraphs (g) and (h) in section 191(1). New paragraph (g) defines the term “special corpo- rate entity” which, in turn, is used in new paragraph (h) and sections 188, 394E(4), 394ZW(4), and 394ZZP(6). The term is used for reasons of drafting conciseness and means: (i)Any local authority as defined in section 2 of the Local Government Act 1974; or (ii)Any statutory producer board as defined in section 197E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976; or (iii) Any statutory body established by Act of Parlia- ment (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere), where the Commissioner, having regard to the terms of the statute by which the statutory body is established, is satisfied that it would be appropriate to treat the body as a special corpo- rate entity. While the local authority or statutory producer board references are self-explanatory, further background should be given to (iii). This provision refers to what are more commonly known as statutory corpora- tions, which are established by specific Act of Parlia- ment. While the provision extends to statutory bod- ies established by an Act of Parliament of a foreign jurisdiction, it should be noted that the scheme of section 191 permits only New Zealand sourced losses to be offset against New Zealand sourced income. The main criteria that the Commissioner would use in deciding whether it was appropriate, having regard to the terms of the statute by which a statutory body is established, to treat a statutory body as a special corporate entity is whether the body has any ultimate natural person shareholders with a benefi- cial interest; if it has, it is unlikely to be so appropri- ate. A statutory body will need to submit a copy of its parent statute to Inland Revenue to allow a deci- sion to be made as to whether it is appropriate to treat that body as a special corporate entity. 25 It is necessary to make special provision in section 191 for a corporate group which includes a special corporate entity, as the general ordinary and speci- fied group provisions mainly contemplate ordinary limited liability companies and are accordingly often couched in share capital language. Additionally, section 191(1)(b) requires one to look through all corporate shareholders to the ultimate natural per- son shareholders of the relevant companies. Such provisions pose problems for entities covered by the special corporate entity term which do not have share capital or natural person shareholders. New paragraph (h) addresses these problems by expressly deeming a special corporate entity to have a paid-up capital and issued and allotted shares. The members or directors of such an entity, in their collective capacity as such, are deemed to be the shareholders of the entity and will be deemed to hold all of the paid-up capital, issued and allotted shares, entitlement to profits and voting power of the entity. Paragraph (h) will give a corporate group which includes a special corporate entity access, in its own right, to the general ordinary and specified group provisions of section 191. The amendment will mean that a corporate group which includes, for example, a local authority will be able to offset tax losses by either subvention payment or election. Such a corpo- rate group will no longer be dependent on section 191(6)(b) to gain limited access to the specified group offsetting provisions. Subsections (2) and (3) of section 17 are directed at correcting a drafting oversight in section 191(6)(b). Section 191(6)(b) caters for companies without share capital whose capital is not capable, in terms of section 191(6)(a), of being deemed to be share capital, e.g., statutory producer boards and local authorities. While it is certainly the intention of section 191(6)(b) to enable companies with no share capital to have access to the specified group offsetting provisions a drafting deficiency in the provision precluded such companies from, in fact, forming a specified group. Subsection (3) of section 17 is a remedial amendment to section 191(6)(b) and it gives effect to the provi- sion’s intention by expressly stating that companies to which section 191(6)(b) applies shall be deemed to be companies included in a “specified group”. Subsection (2) of section 17 amends section 191(3) by providing that a deemed specified group constituted under section 191(6)(b) also qualifies as a “group of companies” under section 191(3). Subsection (4) inserts a new subsection (6A) in sec- tion 191 which effectively restates in a separate sub- section the contents of former section 191(6)(c) which provided that the Commissioner was entitled to disregard a small amount of paid-up capital or nomi- nal value of shares, or a small number of allotted shares. The various amendments effected by section 17 ap- ply from the income years commencing on or after 1 April 1988. Excess Retention Tax Abolished Section 19 Section 19, which repeals Part V of the Act, abolishes excess retention taxation, (ERT) on income derived in the 1991 and subsequent income years. Because ERT is assessed two years after the income is derived, ERT will still be assessed in the 1991 and 1992 income years in relation to income derived in the years ending 31 March 1989 and 31 March 1990. The Valabh Committee in its report to the Govern- ment on the taxation of distributions from companies (November 1990) recommended the repeal of ERT. The reasons which the Committee advanced for the repeal of ERT are set out in Chapter 4.4 of its report, which has been released to the public. Retirement Tax Repealed Sections 2 and 20 Sections 2(2) and 20 of the Amendment Act repeal Retirement Tax. Retirement tax was introduced in 1990 to allocate a specific part of income tax and Fringe Benefit Tax to the cost of Guaranteed Retirement Income. The rationale for introducing Retirement Tax was to iden- tify the actual tax cost of Guaranteed Retirement Income. These amendments repeal the definition of Retire- ment Tax, Part VA of the Income Tax Act 1976, the Twentieth Schedule, the various footnotes in the First Schedule, and clause 14 of part A of the First Schedule. It was considered that these provisions achieved little, if anything, in practice and unneces- sarily increased compliance and administration costs. The repeal of Retirement Tax provisions will have no effect on the levels of tax revenue. These amendments apply from the date on which the Act received the Royal assent. 26 Provisional Tax Sections 22 and 32 When the interim provisional tax regime was imple- mented it was intended that use of money interest would be paid on the total amount of tax overpaid by the taxpayer and correspondingly interest charged on the total amount of tax underpaid by the provi- sional taxpayer. The amendments in sections 22 and 32 confirm this policy in relation to under- or overpayments of Guar- anteed Retirement Income Earner Surcharge and Family Support. Section 22: Provisional Tax and Guaranteed Retire- ment Income Earner Surcharge Section 22 amends the Guaranteed Retirement In- come Earner Surcharge to confirm that the Use-of- Money Interest applies to under and overpayments Section 32: Interest to be charged where Residual Income Tax exceeds Provisional Tax Section 32(1) of the Amendment Act amends section 398A of the principal Act to insert a definition of the term “income tax payable” to include the correct amount of Family Support and Guaranteed Mini- mum Family Income in interest calculations. Subsection (2) confirms the date on which interest charging commences where a taxpayer is liable for use of money interest. Previously the legislation was not clear that a taxpayer who was not required to make payments of provisional tax still had a third instalment date for the purposes of this section. Subsection (3) provides that this section will apply to tax on income derived in the income year commenc- ing 1 April 1991 and in every subsequent income year. FBT and Charities Section 23 Introduction Section 23 provides that fringe benefits provided by charities to employees are not exempt from fringe benefit tax provided that they are not employed in a business carried on by the charity. Section 23 also makes a number of minor amendments to the fringe benefit tax regime as a consequence of the recent changes to the taxation of superannuation schemes. Background When introduced, the fringe benefit tax legislation provided that charities were exempt from fringe benefit tax in respect of fringe benefits provided to employees involved in their charitable activities. This exemption was removed with effect from 1 October 1990. Key Issues Subsection (1) inserts a definition of “charitable or- ganisation” in section 336N which is any society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which, in the quarter, section 56A(2) of the principal Act applies. This differs slightly from the previous definition as universities are now spe- cifically excluded from being a charity. Introduction The Amendment Act amends the fringe benefit tax regime in five ways by: • providing an exemption from fringe benefit tax for fringe benefits provided by charities to their employees; • making a number of minor amendments to cor- rect drafting oversights in relation to the imposi- Fringe Benefit Tax Sections 23, 24 and 35 tion of fringe benefit tax on superannuation schemes; • amending the calculation of the cost price of motor vehicles; • allowing the prescribed rate of interest to be lowered during a quarter; • imposing FBT on low interest loans made by a life insurer to its policyholders. 27 Subsection (4) inserts a new paragraph (h) into the definition of a fringe benefit to provide the necessary exemption. This amendment takes effect from the quarter com- mencing 1 October 1991. This date ensures that charities have never been required to pay FBT on benefits provided to employees who work in non- business areas. Other Amendments Section 23 also makes a number of minor amend- ments to the definition of fringe benefit tax. Subsection (2) amends the definition of fringe benefit tax to reinsert in paragraph (db) a reference to “any specified insurance premium”. These words were accidentally omitted when paragraph (db) was amended to remove a reference to contributions to non-designated funds. The second amendment removes from the definition a reference to contributions to a designated fund or a non-designated fund. At the same time the amend- ment tidies up the definition slightly. These amend- ments are a consequence of the recent changes to the taxation of superannuation schemes. These amendments take effect from 15 December 1989, the effective date of the original amendments. FBT on Loans to Employees - Change to Method of Fixing Prescribed Rate of Interest Section 24 Introduction Section 24 of the Amendment Act makes a change to the times at which the prescribed rate of interest on employee loans can be changed for FBT purposes. Background Section 336W currently empowers the making of regulations declaring the rate of interest which is to apply to employment related loans. Such regulations must be made not less than one month before the start Introduction Section 23 of the Amendment Act alters the provi- sions which impose FBT on low interest loans made by a life insurer to its policyholders. Previously, FBT was chargeable on all low interest loans to policy- holders where the interest rate charged by the life insurer was less than the prevailing FBT prescribed rate of interest. Background The effect of the old provision was that life insurers could be liable for FBT on all loans to policyholders, including situations where the loan and the interest rate charged were arm’s length transactions. The amendment alters the criteria for those loans which may be liable for FBT. Section 336N(9) of the principal Act has been repealed and replaced with another provision which ensures that a potential FBT liability is limited to situations where the loan is made available, or the interest rate charged on the loan is set, having regard to the status or capacity of the borrower as a policyholder. Key Issues The threshold at which a policyholder loan may be liable for FBT has been raised to ensure that the loan is granted or made available to the person, or the interest rate is set, having regard to the capacity or status of the borrower as a policyholder, before the loan can be liable for FBT under the new section 336N(8A) of the principal Act. This means that arm’s length loan transactions undertaken by insurers will not be subject to FBT merely because the borrower is a policyholder. In addition, the new provisions make explicit refer- ence to the situation where a loan has been provided to an associated person of a policyholder or by an associated person of the insurer. This provision merely confirms the position that, in determining the liability for FBT policyholder loans are subject to the same associated person considerations as employee loans. Application Date The amendments apply as from the FBT quarter commencing 1 October 1990, which was the applica- tion date for the original provisions. FBT on Loans to Life Insurance Policyholders Section 23 28 of a quarter and the interest rate fixed must apply for the whole of that quarter. The requirement for the prescribed rate to be fixed at such an early point has meant that, at times, the FBT prescribed rate of interest for the quarter has been higher than the prevailing market rate of interest during much of the quarter. Where that is the case, employers must charge employees a higher rate of interest than they charge on arm's length loan trans- actions. The situation is particularly likely to occur during periods of declining interest rates. Key Issues The amendment is therefore the result of the need for more flexibility in setting the FBT interest rate. The amendment provides that a new regulation may now be made up to one month before the end of a quarter and the new rate would apply for the whole of that quarter. A regulation can only be made during a quarter if it reduces the rate previously fixed for that quarter. Offsetting of Tax Refunds Sections 25, 27, 28, 33 Introduction Legislative changes have been made to the Income Tax Act which will enable the Commissioner to offset tax refunds against outstanding tax liabilities of the person entitled to the refund. Background The Income Tax Act provides only very limited powers of offsetting tax refunds against other liabili- ties. The FIRST systems provide for an automatic offset of a tax refund to certain outstanding liabilities of the same taxpayer. Legislation is needed to pro- vide for this automatic offsetting. Key Issues The amendment adds two subsections to section 409 of the Act. The first provides the Commissioner with the discretion to offset a tax refund against a person’s tax liabilities that have not been paid and are due and FBT and the Cost Price of Motor Vehicles Section 35 Introduction The basis for determining the fringe benefit value of cars provided to employees has been amended in a new Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act. Background The policy behind the Fringe Benefit Tax system has always been that the value of a benefit to be taxed is the amount that it would cost the employee to ac- quire that benefit personally from his or her tax paid income. That cost would include Goods and Services Tax. This amendment has been made to ensure that this policy is clearly reflected in the Income Tax legislation. In arriving at the fringe benefit value of a vehicle, employers must now include in the calcu- lation any GST paid on purchase. Key Issues The method of determining the taxable value of a car for Fringe Benefit Tax purposes is unchanged apart from the requirement to incorporate GST in the calculation. Employers now have two options for arriving at the fringe benefit value of any motorcar supplied to employees: Option 1 Take the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, including the GST paid by the employer on acquisi- tion, and apply the existing formula of 6 percent per quarter (24 percent per annum) to that inclusive cost price. Option 2 Take the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, exclusive of any GST paid on acquisition; and apply to that cost price the alternative formula in the amended Tenth Schedule. At present this is 6.75 percent per quarter (27 percent per annum). The alternative formula produces the same effect as under Option 1 using the GST rate prevailing at the time (i.e., GST of 12.5% is added to the formula rather than the cost price). Option 2 has been added to allow for taxpayers who may have difficulty complying with the requirement to identify the GST element on all their vehicles. It is recognised that most businesses will have been re- cording vehicle assets on a GST exclusive basis. The amendment applies to fringe benefits provided on or after 1st July 1991. 29 There are consequential amendments: • Section 374F(1) has been amended to make it clear that an allowance of credit of tax in the end of year assessment is to be refunded to the tax-payer and cannot be used to offset another outstanding tax liability. • Section 362(2) has been amended to allow any refund arising in respect of overpaid PAYE de- ductions to be subject to the offsetting provisions. A similar provision has been made for overpaid provisional tax \[S.389(1)\]. The automatic offset will not be fully operational until all tax types are converted to the FIRST systems. payable. It is important to note that whilst the offset will be done automatically by the computer, taxpay- ers will be able to request that a refund be used to offset an outstanding tax liability other than that selected by the automatic process. The second subsection denies the Commissioner the authority to offset a tax refund where the refund arises from: • an export tax credit; • a family support credit of tax; • a refund of excess resident withholding tax; or • a refund of excess non-resident withholding tax. Relief in Cases of Serious Hardship Section 34 Introduction Two changes have been made to section 414 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (Relief in Cases of Serious Hardship): • The Commissioner’s Delegation has been in- creased from $5000.00 to $50,000.00. • A new proviso has been inserted requiring the Commissioner to have regard to maximising the net present value of any recovery when exercising discretion under the delegation. Background The Commissioner’s Delegation under section 414 was last increased in 1986. The level of $5000.00 for hardship cases is no longer adequate. Key Issues Many hardship claims on behalf of individual tax- payers now exceed the $5000.00 statutory limit. All cases which exceed the limit must be referred to the Minister of Finance for approval. To avoid delay in processing hardship claims, the Commissioner’s delegation in section 414(5) has been significantly increased from $5000.00 to $50,000.00. A new proviso has been added to section 414(2). This proviso requires the Commissioner to adopt a more “commercial” approach when considering whether to grant relief to taxpayers under section 414. Officers exercising the Commissioner’s delegation will look first to the hardship of the taxpayer. Once satisfied that action under section 414 is justified, it is then appropriate for them to look for ways to maximise the net present value of any potential recovery of tax owing. The principal consideration in making any decision under section should, however, remain the hardship that would be entailed for the taxpayer (or his/her estate). Resident Withholding Tax - Technical Correction to Due Date Change Section 21 Section 21 makes a minor amendment to the applica- tion date provisions of section 15(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1991. The amendment ensures that the change in the due date for the payment of resident withholding tax deductions from the 14th day of the month to the 20th day applies to all resident withholding tax deduc- tions “payable” after 1 July 1992 not, as the section was previously worded, “made” after that date. 30 No-Declaration Rate of Resident Withholding Tax Deductions Section 37 supply an IRD number. The purpose of this amend- ment is to encourage taxpayers to supply that IRD number, by imposing a higher rate of deduction where the number is not supplied. Key Issues The amendment to the Nineteenth Schedule pro- vides that the rate of deduction of Interest PAYE will be increased from 24c to 33c on payments made after 1 April 1992, where the recipient has not provided their IRD number to the payer of interest. Where a deposit/account belongs to more than one person, only one IRD number is required to be recorded by payers. Introduction A higher no-declaration rate of Interest PAYE deduc- tion will apply from 1 April 1992 where a person receiving interest does not provide their IRD number to the payer of interest. Background Section 327ZD lists the items of information which payers of interest are to provide to the Commis- sioner, to be used, where required, to check that taxpayers are returning income correctly. One of those items is the tax file number of the recipient. There was, however, no incentive for anyone to Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1991 Application of GST to Government Grants and Subsidies Section 2 Introduction The amendment ensures that government grants and subsidies received by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity are subject to GST. Background Since the introduction of GST, it has always been the Government’s intention that GST was payable on government grants and subsidies received by a reg- istered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. However, a recent Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decision held that a wage subsidy paid by the Department of Labour to an employer was not subject to GST. The case concerned whether or not payments made by the Department of Labour to an employer under the Job Opportunity Scheme were consideration for a supply of services and therefore subject to GST. While the TRA decision was based on the evidence before it and the circumstances of the particular case, it raised the issue of whether the GST Act should be amended to clarify the original intent. Prior to the amendment, it was considered that grants and sub- sidies were covered by general provisions of the Act i.e., consideration for a supply of goods and services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Key Issues The amendment provides that where a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is made by the Crown or a public authority to: • a person in respect of that person’s taxable activ- ity, or • a person for the benefit and on behalf of another person in respect of that other person’s taxable activity, the payment will be treated as being consideration for a supply of goods and services in the course of the taxable activity. If the recipient of the payment is registered or liable to be registered that person will be required to account for GST on the payment. • Payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy The amendment does not define grant or subsidy per se. Butterworths’ Words and Phrases Legally Defined states that “In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edn) ‘grant’ is defined as ‘An authoritative bestowal or conferring of a right, etc.: a gift or assignment of money etc. out of a fund’”. Further, “Again referring to the dictionary meanings of the words ‘grant’ and ‘subsidy’ there is one common thread throughout, that is a gift or assignment of 31 • Any payment of a kind declared by the Governor- General by Order in Council not to be taxable grant or subsidy. Application date The amendment applies from the commencement of the GST regime on 1 October 1986 to ensure that the Government’s original intention is reflected in the legislation. This also protects the revenue in relation to persons who have accounted for GST on grants and subsidies received in respect of their taxable activity. However, for persons who have not ac- counted for GST on such payments a liability is created for the payment of the GST component of the grant or subsidy. This liability existed under Inland Revenue’s policy on the treatment of government grants and subsidies notwithstanding the TRA deci- sion. The Commissioner is prohibited from issuing an assessment or reassessment after the expiration of four years from the end of the taxable period to which the return relates or the assessment was made. How- ever, this time limit is waived where the Commis- sioner is of the opinion that the person has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full and true disclo- sure of all material facts necessary to determine the tax payable for a taxable period. Saving provision A savings provision provides that the amendment shall not apply in respect of any completed court proceedings and for any objections lodged on or before 19 December 1990. money by government or public authority out of public funds to a private or individual or commercial enterprise deemed to be beneficial to the public interest. Subject to minor refinement the words ‘grant’ and ‘subsidy’ appear from their dictionary meanings to be almost synonymous.” This definition was given in a Canadian case GTE Sylvania Ltd v R \[1974\] 1 FCR 726. However, the provision does indicate what pay- ments are treated as being or not being a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy. A payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy includes: • A suspensory loan or advance upon that loan or advance becoming non-repayable because the conditions for non-repayment are satisfied. • Any payment of a kind declared by the Governor- General by Order in Council to be taxable grant or subsidy where that payment is excluded from being a payment in the nature of a grant or sub- sidy. The following payments are excluded from the defi- nition of a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy: • Any benefit paid under Part I of the Social Secu- rity Act 1964. Benefits covered by this exclusion include unemployment benefit, domestic pur- poses benefit and guaranteed retirement income. • Any payment made to a person for the personal use and benefit of that person or a relative. This exclusion is intended to cover benefits similar to those covered by the above exclusion but are not paid under the Social Security Act such as family support tax credits. Zero-Rating of Intellectual Property Rights Section 3 Introduction This amendment clarifies the zero-rating provision to ensure that all services supplied in connection with intellectual property rights are zero-rated. Background The amendment contained in the Goods and Services Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 ensured that certain services supplied for and to non-residents in respect of intellectual property rights were zero-rated. The services zero-rated were the filing, prosecution, granting, maintenance, transfer, assignment, licens- ing, or enforcement of intellectual property rights. However, that amendment did not cover the serv- ices of searching, advising in respect, opposing the grant or seeking the revocation of, or opposing steps taken to enforce intellectual property rights. By inference, it was arguable that these services were not zero-rated. This would have created a liability to pay GST on these services supplied since 1 October 1986. Such services were zero-rated in terms of the previous legislation that applied since 1 October 1986. The provision, which allows for the zero-rating of services in connection with intellectual property rights for use outside New Zealand, was also defi- cient in that it was limited to the services first men- tioned in the above paragraph. There is no reason why these additional services should not be zero- rated if they are provided in connection with intellec- tual property rights for use outside New Zealand. 32 Key issues The amendment ensures that all services supplied in respect of intellectual property rights are zero-rated. This covers services supplied for and to non-resi- dents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. It also covers services sup- plied to residents and non-residents in connection with intellectual property rights for use outside New Zealand. The additional services zero-rated are searching, advising in respect, seeking revocation of or defend- ing, or defence of enforcement of intellectual prop- erty rights. • Refund of GST paid Where a registered person has imposed GST on services supplied which are zero-rated in terms of this amendment, that person will be entitled to a refund of the GST paid. A credit note will have to be issued if a tax invoice has been issued to the recipient of the supply. The previously agreed consideration for the supply has been altered due to the impost of tax being zero-rated. • Validating provision An amendment is also made to the validating provi- sion contained in the GST Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991. This is to ensure that the validating provision applies to this amendment. Application date This amendment applies to supplies made on or after 1 October 1986. Tax Treatment of Real Estate Salespersons' Expenses TIB Volume Two No.6 of February 1991 reported the announcement in Government’s December Economic Statement that taxpayers in receipt of “commission- only income” were to be permitted to deduct tel- ecommunications, advertising, and motor vehicle expenses incurred in deriving commission-only in- come, effective from 1 April 1991. Details of the proposed amendment were reported on page 11 of that TIB. The Taxation Reform Bill (No.3) introduced section 105AA and amendments to sections 105 and 106B of the Income Tax Act 1976. In reporting back that Bill, Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Select Committee recommended that these measures be withdrawn from the Bill and that the issue be dealt with by way of amendment to the Real Estate Agents Act 1982. The Minister of Justice, the Hon. Doug Graham, has announced that the Government intends introducing an amendment to the Real Estate Agents Act to deem real estate salespersons to be self-employed for all purposes, including revenue, holidays, sick leave and personal grievances. It is expected that this amendment will be introduced shortly. The current position remains that, until enactment of the announced amendment to the Real Estate Agents Act, real estate salespersons will not be entitled to deduct expenses incurred in deriving their income from that source. 33 Due Dates Reminder July 31 GST Return and payment due for period ended 30 June 1991.

Announcements These proposals were announced in Parliament on Budget night, but there is presently no specific Bill covering them. Tax Simplification Consultative Committee Deferral The Minister of Revenue, Hon Wyatt Creech, made this press release on Budget night: The Government has decided to defer the decision to set up a further Tax Simplification Consultative Com- mittee for twelve months, the Minister of Revenue Wyatt Creech announced on Budget Night. The move will allow the Government time to fully implement the recommendations of the previous Simplification Committee before deciding whether another committee is established. The first Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended a very large number of changes in its quest to simplify the tax system, Mr Creech said. It made 176 recommendations, of which a number have yet to be implemented. The Government feels that the recommendations of the first Simplification Committee should be fully implemented before a second committee is estab- lished. As well, any new simplification initiative would be premature, given the changes in compliance require- ments that could be placed on individuals, business and the IRD as a result of the work of the Change Team on Targeting Social Assistance and other Gov- ernment initiatives like the Child Support Agency. A further simplification exercise should not be un- dertaken until the implementation of these measures is completed. Mr Creech added that the Institute of Policy Studies was currently conducting a compliance cost study, the results of which should be known by the end of the year. This should provide better information on where the most significant compliance costs are, Mr Creech said. 3 Removal of Inter-Corporate Dividend Exemption Amendment to Income Tax Act Introduction There have been a number of changes to the taxation of inter-corporate dividends. The main changes are the: • Removal of the general inter-corporate dividend exemption on dividends paid on or after 1 April 1992; • Removal of the inter-corporate dividend exemp- tion on dividends paid under section 192 and 195 debentures or under certain fixed return shares acquired after 30 July 1991 - effective from Budget night; • Exemption from income tax for dividends derived from foreign companies. This exemption is subject to certain exceptions. Background Section 63 provided an income tax exemption for inter-corporate dividends to prevent the multiple taxation of dividends passing between companies. However, under the imputation regime multiple taxation can be avoided by allowing companies re- ceiving dividends to utilise any attached imputation credits. The inter-corporate dividend exemption was unnecessary after the imputation regime was intro- duced. The exemption also created tax avoidance opportunities and was utilised in a number of tax planning strategies, including the transfer of losses through redeemable preference share deals. Key Issues Removal Of General Inter-Corporate Divi- dend Exemption Inter-corporate dividends will generally be subject to income tax from 1 April 1992. Non cash dividends which are subject to fringe benefit tax under section 336N(8) of the principal Act will still be exempt from income tax, but only to the extent that fringe benefit tax is payable. From 30 July 1991, dividends derived by a New Zealand resident company or dividends derived as category A income by a trustee of a group investment fund from a foreign company are exempt from in- come tax, but subject to foreign dividend withhold- ing payment. However, this exemption does not apply to dividends or similar income for which a deduction has been obtained where the dividends are derived from a company that is incorporated overseas but resident in New Zealand under a Dou- ble Taxation Agreement. These dividends or similar income will be subject to income tax under the Act. The terms “foreign company” and “group invest- ment fund” are defined in this Amendment Act. Transitional Measure to Stop Redeemable Preference Type Share Deals Dividends paid on certain redeemable preference type (RPS) share transfers entered into after Budget night are taxable from Budget night. Dividends are taxable if they are paid on RPS shares or section 192 and 195 debentures acquired after Budget night, except where they are subject to a binding pre-Budget contract. RPS shares issued before Budget night which are subject to a post- Budget alteration, or a post-Budget financial ar- rangement will also be subject to this provision. For RPS shares in this category, dividends are taxable only if they are payable at a fixed rate or at a rate determined by reference to commercial interest rates, or if they are otherwise equivalent to interest having regard to redeemability, security and variability. Inland Revenue will closely monitor any loss transfer transactions entered into after Budget night. For administrative reasons, dividends taxable under this transitional provision will not be subject to resi- dent withholding tax during the period from 30 July 1991 to 1 April 1992. Application Dates 1 April 1992. Transitional provisions - 8pm on 30 July 1991 1st Key Dates 1993 income year. Transitional provisions - 1992 income year Budget Night Legislation 4 Loss Carry Forward and Loss Grouping Amendments to Income Tax Act which in this example is 10 percent each. Whether Lossco has met the minimum 40 percent continuity of shareholding is determined as shown below. 1/9/91Lowest A10%90%10% B90%10%10% Minimum Continuity20% Lossco has not met the requirements of section 188(7) and may not carry forward any accumulated losses for offset against any 1992/93 profits. A relief provision has been introduced which applies where a change in shareholding after 30 July 1991 occurs pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8 pm on 30 July 1991. In that event, the shares acquired after 30 July 1991 are deemed acquired on Budget night and held through to the date of acqui- sition. However, the variation in the shareholdings cannot otherwise have breached the continuity rules. Taking the example above, if shareholders A and B had entered into a binding contract before Budget night, they would be deemed to hold 100 percent continuously. Continuity Percentage The minimum continuity threshold applicable in the 1992 income year remains at 40 percent, but it increases to 66 percent in subsequent years. The expression “continuity percentage” is defined to re- place the expressions 40 percent in the 1992 income year and 66 percent in subsequent years wherever mentioned in section 188. Application Date 8 pm 30 July 1991 1st Key Date 1992 income year Loss Carry Forward Introduction As part of the general reform of the loss carry for- ward rules, new legislation requires each sharehold- er's lowest percentage of rights in a company over a continuous period to be taken into account in deter- mining the continuity of shareholding rules. Background Section 188(7) of the principal Act required a mini- mum 40 percent continuity of shareholding for losses to be carried forward. This enabled share swapping or significant variations in shareholdings to occur without breaching the continuity rules. Key Issues Lowest Percentage of Rights Test From Budget night to the end of the 1992 income year (the “specified period”), the 40 percent continu- ity threshold will be satisfied by taking into account the lowest percentage of rights attached to shares held by each shareholder of a company. Example Lossco has a 31 March balance date. From 1 April 1991 to 31 August 1991, 100 fully paid up shares are held by individuals A and B, who hold 10 percent and 90 percent respectively of the rights attached to the shares. On 1 September 1991 A and B alter their shareholdings in Lossco to 90 percent and 10 percent respectively (effecting a swap of shares) and retain these proportions to 31 March 1992. From Budget night, A and B are deemed to hold the lowest percentage of rights attached to the shares held by A and B throughout the specified period, Grouping Of Losses Introduction As part of the general reform to group losses, a loss company and one or more profit companies must be members of the same group at all times from Budget night to the end of the loss company's accounting year. This is the year that corresponds to the 1992 income year. Background Section 191 provides a set of rules governing loss offsets between commonly owned companies. Com- panies that are 66.66 percent commonly owned may form an ordinary group and companies 100 percent commonly owned may form a specified group. Commonality of the minimum applicable thresholds was determined at the end of the income year (31 March). These rules enabled a profit company to 5 acquire a loss company with losses at any time before 31 March each year, causing further erosion to the tax base. Key Issues Commonality Of Shareholding The thresholds of 66.66 percent and 100 percent commonality must now be met at all times from 30 July 1991 (the specified time) to the end of the loss company’s accounting year corresponding to the income year ending 31 March 1992. Example (illustrating the requirement of commonality at all times from the specified time): Assume Lossco has a standard balance date of 31 March. Lossco has $100 in losses carried forward as at 29 July 1991 and as at that date is only 60 percent commonly owned together with Profitco. Typically, on 30 March 1992 the shareholders of Profitco would have topped up their shareholding in Lossco to 66.66 percent, ensuring minimum commonality of 66.66 percent as at 31 March for purposes of obtaining the benefit of Lossco’s losses in Profitco. In the absence of a Budget night amendment, the losses could have been so offset to Profitco. ShareholdersCommonality percentages as at: 29/7/91 31/3/92 A30%33.33% B 30%33.33% 60%66.66% Because the amendment applies from 30 July 1991, the commonality percentages held at all times from 30 July 1991 to 30 March 1992 will be below 66.66 percent (the minimum threshold required at all times from 30 July 1991 to the end of its accounting year - in this case 31 March 1992). Lossco may not offset its losses to Profitco. Groups of companies with non-standard balance dates must maintain commonality of shareholding to the end of the loss company's accounting year corre- sponding to the income year ending 31 March 1992. Special relief provisions have been introduced where the acquisition of shares after Budget night is pursu- ant to a binding contract entered into before Budget night. The relief provision operates to deem the further acquisitions to have taken place from 30 July 1991 and to have been held to the date the shares were actually acquired. Application Date 8 pm 30 July 1991 1st Key Date 1992 income year Introduction Budget night legislation amended the imputation regime in two ways. First, the regime was changed as a result of the removal of the inter-corporate dividend exemption. Second, several defects which had become apparent in the anti-avoidance sections were corrected. Background Removal of Inter-corporate Dividend Exemption The general inter-corporate dividend exemption was removed for dividends paid after 1 April 1992. In addition, dividends paid on shares issued in lieu of debt instruments after Budget night are taxable to corporate recipients from that time. Consequential amendments were made to: • Section 394D of the Act (credits arising to the imputation credit account (“ICA”) of a company); • Section 394E (debits arising to the ICA); and • Section 394ZE (conversion of unutilised credits to loss carry forward); and • Section 394ZG (the general imputation anti-avoid- ance provision). Defects in the Anti-Avoidance Rules Several defects in these rules became apparent over recent months. These are specifically identified be- low. Key Issues Changes Consequent Upon Removal of Inter-corporate Dividend Exemption. • Section 394D(1) Subparagraph (va) was inserted into section 394D(1)(a). This subparagraph provides that a credit Changes to Imputation Regime Amendments to Income Tax Act 6 will not arise to an ICA where income tax is paid by way of the crediting of an imputation credit. This ensures that companies do not obtain a double credit in the ICA for imputation credits attached to divi- dends they receive. Section 394D(1)(d) was also amended. Until Budget night a company either obtained a credit in its ICA for imputation credits attached to dividends it re- ceived or it included the dividend in its assessable income (in the case of life insurance companies). Paragraph (d) prevented a company receiving a dou- ble benefit. However, in limited circumstances from Budget night and generally from 1 April 1992 divi- dends will be assessable to a company. The company will include the dividend and credit in its assessable income and, in order to prevent double taxation of the dividend, a credit will arise in the company’s ICA for the amount of the imputation credit attached to the dividend. This requires the amendment of para- graph (d). Both of these amendments came into force on Budget night. • Section 394E(1)(ab) Paragraph (ab) was repealed, with effect from 1 April 1992. • Section 394ZE(3) Paragraph (b) of this section, which provides for the conversion of unutilised imputation credits into a loss to carry forward, was amended. Excess credits are divided by the extra emolument rate (28 percent). That rate is an approximate mid-point between indi- vidual rates. For companies including dividends in assessable income, the appropriate rate is the com- pany tax rate (33 percent). For dividends received by trustees of Group Investment Funds, the appropriate rate is the rate of tax paid in relation to Category A income - also 33 percent at present. The amendment applies to unutilised credits which have been included in assessable income for the 1991- 92 and subsequent years. • Section 394ZG This is the general anti-avoidance provision in the imputation and dividend withholding payment re- gimes. The terminology in the section reflected the fact that when it was included in the Act dividends were not assessable to companies. Companies could not obtain the benefit of a credit of tax for imputation credits attached to dividends received. They there- fore could not obtain a “shareholder tax advantage”, only a “company tax advantage”. This terminology became redundant after Budget night. Now, where companies obtain a “credit advantage” they will also obtain an “account advantage”. The section has been amended to reflect this. Correction of Defects in the Imputation Anti-Avoidance Provisions • Section 2 For the purposes of the Act section 192 and 195 debentures will now be treated as shares. For the imputation anti-avoidance provisions in sec- tion 394ZG, this amendment applies to arrange- ments entered into after Budget night. For pre- Budget arrangements, it will apply from 1 April 1992. For the purpose of the anti-stapled stock provision (section 394ZF), it will apply to dividends paid from Budget night until 1 April 1992 for ar- rangements entered into after Budget night, and to dividends paid after 1 April 1992 in all cases. It also applies from Budget night to the anti-dividend strip- ping provisions in section 99(5) and 198. In other cases the amendment takes effect from 1 April 1992. These debentures are treated as equity in some re- spects in the Act but they have been used to avoid the imputation anti-streaming provisions. The opportu- nity has also existed for them to be used to avoid the provisions referred to above. • Section 394ZF This section counters stapled stock arrangements. Defects in the section were identified: dividends which are beneficiary income and dividends paid to persons associated with the shareholder might not have fallen within its scope. These deficiencies were remedied with effect from Budget night. However, where a dividend is paid before 1 April 1992 under an unaltered pre-Budget night arrangement, the amendment will not apply. • Section 394ZG As noted earlier, this section is the general anti- avoidance provision for the imputation and divi- dend withholding payment regimes. Several defects in the section became apparent recently. They were: • Section 394ZG(2)(a) did not include arrangements involving the issue of shares - only their disposi- tion; • It was not clear that the anti-streaming provision in subsection (2)(b) applied to dividends which were beneficiary income and streaming arrangements involving the use of bonus issues; and • The Commissioner had no power to deny credits to a shareholder who had been a party to a streaming arrangement in terms of subsection (2)(b). These defects were remedied from Budget night for arrangements entered into after that time and from 1 April 1992 for unaltered pre-Budget arrangements. 7 Non-Resident Withholding Tax on Interest Relaxed, Approved Issuer Levy Introduced Amendments to Income Tax Act and Stamp and Cheque Duties Act Introduction Amendments to the Non-Resident Withholding Tax regime and the introduction of the “approved issuer levy” were announced in the Budget. From 1 August 1991 “approved issuers” will be able to pay interest to non-residents without deducting Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT). Approved issuers will be required to pay a levy for the right to issue securities that are subject to a zero rate of NRWT. The levy, to be known as the “approved issuer levy”, is calculated at a rate of 2 cents for every $1 of interest paid on the security. Background The amendment to the NRWT regime is intended to reduce some of the costs incurred by New Zealand residents when they borrow from non-resident in- vestors who are either unwilling or unable to bear the costs of having withholding tax deducted from their interest income. Such non-resident investors typi- cally require the resident borrower to “gross up” the amount of interest paid by the amount of any with- holding tax applied to that income. This tends to increase domestic interest rates. Zero Rating of Interest NRWT These conditions must be satisfied before any interest payments can be subject to a zero rate of NRWT: • The persons paying and receiving the interest can- not be associated; • The interest must be paid by an “approved issuer” on a “registered security”; • Approved issuer levy of 2 cents for every $1 of interest must be paid by the due date. The important requirements relating to: • approved issuer status, • registration of securities, and • payment of approved issuer levy are explained in detail below. This measure only relieves a liability to NRWT. New Zealand residents and non-residents who have a fixed establishment in New Zealand will still be liable for income tax on that interest income as they are not subject to the NRWT regime. Interest payments to non-residents that do not satisfy the conditions for zero rating will be subject to NRWT in the normal manner. Approved Issuer Status Borrowers who wish to pay tax free interest to non- residents must apply in writing to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (stating their name and IRD number) to obtain approved issuer status. This will be granted unless the applicant has been in serious default or neglect in complying with tax obligations during the period specified in Section 311B of the Income Tax Act. Approved issuer status will apply from the date on which the application was received. The Commissioner may also revoke approved issuer status for serious default or neglect in complying with tax obligations. However, revocation will affect only the person’s ability to issue new tax free securi- ties, not the status of existing securities. All applications should be sent to: The District Commissioner Inland Revenue Department Non-Resident Centre P O Box 1247 DUNEDIN Telephone Number (03) 4771-340 Fax Number(03) 4790-659 Registration of Securities Only securities that have been registered with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will qualify for a zero rate of NRWT. Approved issuers may register by completing a reg- istration form (IR 291B), which they should send to the Non-Resident Centre as noted above. Registra- tion will be accepted providing the registration form has been duly completed and the security that is being registered relates to money lent to an approved 8 issuer after 1 August 1991. All registered securities will be assigned a registration number, and registra- tion will take effect from the date on which the application was received. Payment of Approved Issuer Levy Approved issuers are required to pay a levy for the right to pay interest that is subject to a zero rate of NRWT. Approved issuer levy is calculated at a rate of 2 cents for every $1 of interest paid ("leviable value"), and must be paid to Inland Revenue by the 14th of the month following the interest payment. Failure to pay the approved issuer levy by the due date will make that interest payment liable for NRWT, to the extent that the approved issuer levy is defi- cient. For example, if $10,000 interest is paid by an ap- proved issuer on a registered security on 1 Septem- ber, an approved issuer levy of $200 must be paid to Inland Revenue by 14 October. If no levy is received by Inland Revenue by the due date (14 October) the entire interest payment ($10,000) will be liable to NRWT. Payments of approved issuer levy should be sent to Inland Revenue’s Southern Processing Centre, P O Box 3754, Christchurch, together with a completed approved issuer pay-in slip, IR 67B. As failure to pay the approved issuer levy by the due date renders that interest payment liable for NRWT, the Commissioner has been given discretion under section 86M of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act to accept a late payment of levy as being on time. However, that discretion can be exercised only where the delay was due to circumstances beyond the payer's control. Inland Revenue has prepared a pamphlet on the new Approved Issuer Levy (IR 291A), which is available from any of our offices. Guaranteed Retirement Income Earner Surcharge Amendment to Income Tax Act Simple examples of the abatement are provided be- low. Inland Revenue’s involvement in the new National Superannuation scheme will be to supply Social Welfare with details of the National Superannui- tant’s income (and if married, the spouse’s income), from the tax returns furnished. From this informa- tion Social Welfare will do a square-up and make a further payment if National Superannuation was underpaid, or require a repayment of any overpay- ment. These under or overpayments will adjust the National Superannuitant’s income in a future income year or years. The tax treatment of these under or overpayments is still to be determined. The definition of a pay period taxpayer has been amended to exclude any person (and, if married, that person’s spouse) where the “other income” of the person, or the combined income for a married couple, exceeds $4,160. “Other income” is now defined in section 356 as an amount calculated in accordance with the formula: a - b - c where- (a) Is the amount of the taxpayer’s taxable income, plus one-half of any pension or annuity that is not taxable income. (b) Is the amount of any gross national superannua- tion and gross living alone payment received. Introduction The Guaranteed Retirement Income Earner Surcharge has been repealed from the 1992/93 tax year. From 1 April 1992 it will be replaced by a revised National Superannuation scheme, which the Department of Social Welfare will administer. Key Issues From 1 April 1992 Social Welfare will pay the new National Superannuation, which will abate accord- ing to the National Superannuitant's income (and, if married, the income of the National Superannui- tant’s spouse), where that income exceeds $80 per week or $4,160 per annum. The spouse's income will be taken into account whether he/she also receives National Superannuation or not. The income that will be taken into account for abate- ment purposes will be the same as that currently used for “other income” for surcharge purposes, i.e., the taxable income of the taxpayer, plus one-half of any pension or annuity, less the National Superannua- tion and any specified foreign social security pen- sion. The amount of this income will abate the gross National Superannuation at 90 cents in the dollar for every dollar of income that exceeds the threshold of $4,160. National Superannuitants aged 70 and over will be paid a minimum rate of National Superannuation equal to 50 percent of the standard rate for a married person. Currently this is $4,405.70 a year before tax. 9 (c) Is the amount of any specified foreign social secu- rity pension received. Various consequential amendments have been made as a result of guaranteed retirement income being replaced with National Superannuation. Application Date 1 April 1992.

The duty will apply to all gaming machines owned by about 2,050 gaming machine operators currently licensed under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. The legislation to impose and collect this duty will be incorporated into the Gaming Duties Act 1971. The legislation to impose Gaming Machine Duty has been referred for consideration to the Internal Affairs and Local Government Select Committee. The Gov- ernment intends that the Gaming Duties Amend- ment Bill will be referred back to Parliament for its third reading by 22 August 1991. Background At present, the Lotteries Commission, racing clubs and the Totalisator Agency Board pay duty on their gaming turnover. However, gaming machine turno- ver has not been subject to duty. The new gaming machine duty will remove this inconsistency. The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for regulatory functions such as the licensing of gaming machine operators. It will also be responsible for conducting random audits of gaming machine op- erators. The Inland Revenue Department will be responsible for collecting gaming machine duty. Simi- lar arrangements exist for both lottery and totalisator duty. 10 Key Issues Imposition of duty Duty will be imposed, at the rate of 5.5 percent, on the turnover of dutiable games played by means of a gaming machine on or after 1 October 1991. A gaming machine is a machine used to play any game of chance, instant game lottery, or prize competition. Explicitly excluded are machines used as a means of drawing a lottery such as Lotto or selecting numbers in a game of Housie. Turnover is the amount of money or money’s worth, in the form of cash, tokens, or credits won, paid to play a gaming machine. Returns and payment of duty A gaming machine operator must deliver a monthly return of the gross turnover of all gaming machines and the duty payable on that gross turnover. A gaming machine operator is: • A society licensed under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 to operate gaming machines; or • Any other person who operates gaming machines, otherwise than pursuant to a licence issued under the Gaming and Lotteries Act. This is to ensure that unlicensed operators are subject to duty on their turnover. The return and payment of the duty is due on the 20th of the month following the month to which the return relates. For example, the return and payment of duty for the month of October is due on 20 November. Where a gaming machine operator has had its licence cancelled or its renewal refused, the return and duty payable are due seven days after the cancellation of the licence or the refusal to renew. In these circum- stances, the return period begins on the first day of the month in which the cancellation or refusal to renew occurred and ends on the day after the cancel- lation or refusal. The Department of Internal Affairs will advise Inland Revenue of the cancellation of the licence or the refusal to renew. Interest on unpaid gaming machine duty Interest at the rate of 5 percent a month or part of a month is payable on unpaid duty from the due date and is recoverable as if that interest were duty pay- able. Any interest charged is not subject to any remission. Interest will not be charged on any amount of duty unpaid (deferrable duty) which is subject to an objection. Assessments and objection procedures Generally, the filing of returns and the payment of duty will be on a self-assessment basis. However, the Commissioner will have the ability to issue assess- ments in certain circumstances. These circumstances are: • A person defaults in delivering a return; • The Commissioner is not satisfied with a return; • The Commissioner is not satisfied that the amount of duty calculated as payable by a person is the correct amount; or • The Commissioner believes that a person, al- though that person has not delivered a return, is liable to pay duty. Where a return has been delivered, the Commis- sioner may not issue an assessment or an amended assessment after the expiration of four years from the end of the month in which the return was delivered or the assessment was made. This time limit is waived where the Commissioner believes that a person has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make full and true disclosures of the facts necessary to determine the amount of the duty payable. If an assessment is issued by the Commissioner, it may be objected to in the same manner as is available for GST assessments, and may be referred to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. Inter- est will be payable on duty in dispute (refundable) and deferrable duty (payable) in the same way as for GST. Recovery of duty Gaming machine duty is recoverable as a debt to the Crown. Unpaid duty and interest thereon also con- stitute a debt due and payable, jointly and severally, by: • In the case of an incorporated gaming machine operator, all persons who, at any time during the return period, were officers, trustees, or other persons acting in the management of the gaming machine operator such as the secretary and treas- urer. • In the case of an unincorporated gaming machine operator, all persons who, at any time during the return period, were members, officers, or trustees of the gaming machine operator. Unpaid duty will rank in bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership, without limitation of amount, as a preferential claim. It will have the same priority as PAYE and GST. The Commissioner can serve a written notice on a third party to deduct a specified sum from any amount payable or to become payable to a defaulting gaming machine operator or any person who has 11 defaulted in the payment of duty. Every amount deducted must be paid to the Commissioner within the time specified in the notice. Where an amount has been deducted but not paid to the Commissioner, the amount deducted is recoverable from the person making the deduction as if the deduction were gam- ing machine duty payable by that person. Offences Penalties for offences will be as follows: • A fine not exceeding $200 for the offence of failing to deliver a return by the due date; • A fine not exceeding $1000 for the offence of wil- fully or negligently giving false information; • A fine not exceeding $500 for the offence of not making a deduction from a payment owing to a gaming machine operator and paying that deduc- tion to the Commissioner. Refund of duty and interest paid in error or in excess A gaming machine operator will be entitled to a refund of any gaming machine duty and interest paid in excess or in error. Before a refund is made, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the duty was paid in error or in excess. The time limit for such refunds is eight years from the date of payment unless an application has been made within the eight year period. Exchange of information The Department of Internal Affairs and the Inland Revenue Department will have the ability to ex- change information for the purposes of administer- ing gaming machine duty legislation. The type of information that will be exchanged is: • The names and addresses of the societies licensed under the Gaming and Lotteries Act to operate gaming machines; • Details of licences cancelled or not renewed; and • Details of under-declared turnover identified dur- ing random audit activities. Application Date The general application date of the gaming duty legislation will be 1 October 1991. However, the provision that allows for the exchange of information comes into force on the date of assent to allow the Inland Revenue Department to obtain the informa- tion necessary to establish the names and addresses of gaming machine operators. In this case, Inland Revenue made payment from the Crown Account, which represented an indirect in- come subsidy to the Corporation. The Amendment Inland Revenue is now required to pay self-em- ployed levies to the Corporation when they are paid to the Department. Application Date 1 August 1991. Introduction The way that Inland Revenue accounts to the Acci- dent Compensation Corporation for self-employed ACC levies was amended in Budget night legislation. Background Previously, the Commissioner paid an amount equivalent to a self-employed levy to the Corpora- tion on the date on which that levy was assessed. Often this would occur before Inland Revenue re- ceived the levies. Change to ACC Levies System Amendment to Accident Compensation Act Introduction As a result of the introduction of “KiwiCards”, an amendment was required to the Inland Revenue Department Act to enable the Social Welfare Depart- ment to obtain certain information to establish Fam- ily Support Tax Credit (FSTC) recipients’ entitle- ments to the card. Health Reform - “KiwiCard” Amendment to Inland Revenue Department Act Background Section 13A has been inserted into the Inland Rev- enue Department Act 1974, so specific information can be transferred to the Department of Social Wel- fare. This information will be used solely to establish an initial entitlement to “KiwiCards” for FSTC recipi- ents. 12 Application Date The amendment took effect from Budget night and will expire on 31 March 1992. The amendment allows only for the release of the following information for the year ended 31 March 1991: • Name and address • Number of children • Amount of the tax credit Loss Carry-Forward and Grouping Rules Introduction New rules are implemented relating to the carrying- forward and grouping of tax losses. Existing sections 188 and 191 will be repealed and replaced with nine new sections. The new rules are designed to tighten the criteria under which companies can carry for- ward losses and offset losses against the profits of other companies. The policy intention of the new loss carry-forward and grouping provisions is to ensure that, as far as practicable, only those individuals who have borne the initial economic burden of a company’s losses are able to ultimately gain the benefit of those losses for tax purposes. The intention of the new rules includes that of preventing the commercial trafficking of com- pany tax losses to the detriment of the Revenue. Background The current restrictions on the ability of companies to carry forward and group losses are contained in existing sections 188 and 191, which will be repealed by this Bill with effect from the 1992/93 income year. The restrictions in the current sections 188 and 191 have proved to be inadequate and losses have been carried-forward and offset in circumstances where those individuals that have gained the benefit of tax losses are not the same persons as those that have borne the economic burden of those losses. Key Issues Purpose of Continuity Provisions - New Section 187A The statutory purpose of the new loss and credit carry forward rules is stated as ensuring that in New Tax Bill Introduced References to Standard and Non-Standard Income Years Introduction A proposed amendment will shorten references in the Income Tax Act to standard and non-standard income years. The provision is of a general interpre- tative nature only and has no substantive effect. Key Issues For example, the Income Tax Act will be able to refer to “the 1992-93 income year” rather than as “the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1992” or “the income year ending on the 31st day of March 1993”. This will simplify drafting. References in the Act to persons with standard in- come years will mean people whose balance date is 31 March. References in the Act to persons with non-standard income years will mean people whose income year ends on a date other than 31 March, being a non- standard income year which corresponds to the rel- evant standard income year. People with non-standard income years will be re- ferred to as having: (i) an early income year, if their non-standard in- come year ends between 1 October and 30 March inclusive; or (ii) a late income year if their non-standard income year ends between 1 April and 30 September inclusive. Application Date These amendments apply from the date on which the amendment Act receives the Royal assent. 13 general, at least to the extent of the new minimum continuity of shareholding threshold (66%), only those natural person shareholders who have borne the initial economic burden of a company’s losses are able to ultimately gain the benefit of those losses for tax purposes. This preamble-type provision provides a guide as to the broad scheme and purpose of the continuity provisions. It sets out the principle underlying the detailed rules. Measuring Shareholders’ Economic Interests - New Sections 187B, 187C, 187D The Bill introduces the concept of a shareholder’s economic interest in a company. This concept is central to the continuity and grouping provisions. A common measure of a shareholder’s economic inter- est in a company will apply for the purposes of the loss and credit carry-forward provisions (referred to in the Bill as the continuity provisions) and the grouping rules. Since a number of provisions require a shareholder to determine its interest in a company, clarity and consistency is enhanced by having a common set of provisions to determine a shareholder’s economic interest in a company. A shareholding individual’s economic interest in a company will generally be measured by reference to the percentage of voting power held by that person in a loss company. In certain circumstances where a shareholder’s economic interest in a loss company may not be accurately reflected by the voting power held by that person, an additional market value test must also be used to measure that shareholder’s economic interest. Voting Interest Determination - New Section 187C A shareholder’s interest in a company’s tax losses or credits will be measured primarily by reference to the percentage of voting power held by that person in relation to decision-making by the company. Apart from measuring an interest by reference to market value, voting power is seen as the best proxy for a measure of a shareholder’s beneficial interest in the losses or credits of a company, and it will often be relatively simple to apply. By exercising voting power, a shareholder can protect its position relative to other shareholders and can ensure appropriate access to the earnings of the company when they are distributed. Under the new rules, voting power will be defined as the percentage of power to vote in relation to deci- sion-making concerning the: (i) Distributions to be made by the company; (ii) Constitution of the company; (iii) Variation in the capital of the company; and (iv) Appointment or election of directors of the com- pany. Where voting percentages vary for these different types of decision-making, the average of these rights will be used for the purpose of applying the voting power test. It should be noted that this approach is different from and supersedes that taken in the 1991 Budget report supplement on business tax policy (page 88). Application of Market Value Test - New Section 187D In certain circumstances a shareholder’s economic interest in a company at any time will be determined by reference to both the percentage of voting power (in respect of that interest) and the percentage that the market value of the interest held by that share- holder is of the total market value of all interests in the company at that time. Shareholders’ economic interests, computed using both the market value and voting power tests, will be used in determining whether the minimum shareholder continuity or commonality thresholds have been satisfied. In general, a shareholder’s economic interest will be determined using both the market value and voting power tests where that shareholder’s economic inter- est in a loss company may not be accurately reflected by the voting power held by that person. The market value of an interest will be defined as what the interest could be sold for in an arms-length transaction. In the case of any share or option listed on an approved New Zealand or foreign stock ex- change, its market value would be determined as its middle-market quotation at that time, unless such a quotation does not reflect its true market value. Shares will also be valued by excluding the value attributable to any options issued over those shares that are themselves taken into account in applying the market value test to prevent double counting. For the purpose of the continuity provisions, the circumstances where a shareholder’s economic in- terest is measured by reference to both the market value and voting power tests include where: (i) A shareholder has an entitlement to a certain proportion of company profits which, if it can be ascertained, is different from its voting power and can veto any alteration to that entitlement; 14 (ii) The company or its shareholders have issued options (other than certain options over listed company shares) to acquire shares at their mar- ket value, or options are issued over interests in the company not yet held by the issuer. (iii) The company has issued debentures covered by section 192 of the Income Tax Act after Budget night. Section 192 debentures are taken into account because they share similar characteris- tics to equity instruments in that their yields depend on the profits of the company. In addi- tion, in relation to the credit carry-forward rules only, the market value test would be triggered if the company issues night fixed rate dividend shares or section 195 debentures after Budget night. (iv) The company has issued shares (other than fixed rate dividend shares) the returns on which are guaranteed by a third party; or (v) The shares have been subject to an arrangement with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the credit and loss carry- forward and grouping rules. The transitional rules (primarily contained in the Budget night legislation) are designed so that on Budget night almost all companies will be able to provisionally measure their shareholders’ interests for the purposes of the new loss and credit carry- forward and grouping rules, by referring solely to the voting power test. This is because section 192 and 195 debentures and fixed rate dividend shares issued before Budget night will not trigger a requirement to apply the market value test until 1 April 1994, if they are still on issue at that time. It will only be as companies issue such instruments after Budget night that there might be a requirement to compute share- holders’ interests by reference to the market value of those interests. Tracing Through Companies - New Section 187C Subject to certain exceptions (e.g., the special rules concerning listed companies) it is only the economic interest of the ultimate natural person shareholder that will be taken into account in determining whether the shareholder continuity and commonality thresh- olds have been met. It is therefore necessary to trace through the interests of interposed corporate share- holders in a company to that company’s ultimate natural person shareholders. Nominees and Bare Trustees - New Sections 187B and 187C The nominee (nominee includes a bare trustee) pro- visions will continue to require one to look to the beneficial owner of shares in determining whether continuity or commonality of shareholding require- ments have been satisfied. Under the new nominee provisions a person is no longer deemed to be the nominee of his/her spouse or child, as is the case under existing section 191(1)(d). The significance of this change is that transfers within a family group will potentially breach continuity except where such transfers are pursuant to a matri- monial property agreement or a disposition under a will or intestacy. There will be a common and clearly defined set of provisions that define nominees for the purposes of the new loss and credit carry-forward and grouping rules, and that deem the interests they hold to be held by the beneficial owners of such interests (on whose behalf the nominees act). Other Trustees People who are trustees of a trust (apart from bare trustees) will be treated as the same single person for the purposes of the continuity provisions, provided that any change in trustees does not have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the continuity provisions. An example of this intention or effect would be where there is a change in the beneficial ownership of a trust's assets. A corporate trustee (other than the Public Trustee, Maori Trustee or a trustee company in terms of the Trustee Companies Act 1967) will generally be deemed to have disposed of its assets to a third party and reacquired them if there is any change in the shareholding of the corporate trustee. This deemed sale and reacquisition would result in a breach of continuity for any loss company owned by the corpo- rate trustee. However, a deemed sale and reacquisition of a corporate trustee's assets will be deemed not to occur if it can be shown that the corporate trustee's shareholding change did not have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the continuity provisions; e.g., where the change in shareholding does not result in a change in the beneficial ownership of the trust's assets. Application of General Rules for Deter- mining Shareholder’s Economic Interests to Certain Non-Standard Companies The general rules for determining shareholders’ eco- nomic interests should apply to the following non- standard companies: Unlimited Liability Companies; Companies Limited by Guarantee; No Liability Companies; Co-operative Companies; Building Societies; and Unit Trusts. 15 These entities typically have shares or units that carry voting power for which a market value can be deter- mined. For example, co-operative companies and building societies are similar to other companies in that both have share capital and identifiable share- holders, and voting rights typically attach to the relevant shares. Unit holders should normally be able to determine their economic interests in a unit trust either by reference to the percentage of voting power they hold in the unit trust and its management, or the market value of their interests. Widely-held unit trusts, co-operative companies and building societies will be treated in a similar manner to listed companies for the purposes of the shareholder continuity rules. Listed Companies - New Sections 187B and 187C For the purposes of the new loss and credit carry- forward rules, it will not be necessary to separately identify direct interests held by any persons that together with their associates hold economic inter- ests of less than 10% in the listed company. The interests of those shareholders who each hold inter- ests of less than 10% in a listed company will collec- tively be treated as being held by one shareholder. It will also be unnecessary to look through interests held by a listed company in a loss company unless the listed company and its associates hold an interest of 50% or more in the loss company. Special rules for listed companies are necessary to reduce compliance costs a listed company would otherwise face in having to identify and separately take into account for the purposes of the loss and credit carry forward rules all the minor interests held in it by natural persons. Special Corporate Entities - New Sections 187B and 187C The current definition of a special corporate entity will be expanded to include (in addition to a local authority, statutory producer board or a statutory body established by a specific Act of Parliament) a public authority, life insurance fund and a group investment fund. For the time being, the members or directors of special corporate entities on Budget night will be deemed to hold, in their collective capacity, all the voting power and all the market value of the entity for the purposes of the loss and credit carry forward and grouping rules. Corporate groups which include a special corporate entity will be placed on an equal footing with other corporate groups for the purposes of the grouping provisions in new section 191. It is necessary to make special provision for entities covered by the special corporate entity definition because as a rule these entities do not have share capital or natural person shareholders, features which the general loss and credit carry forward and grouping rules are predicated on. As stated in a TIB Vol Three No.1 (July 1991), an entity seeking special corporate entity status under the category of a statutory body established by a specific Act of Parliament must submit a copy of its parent statute to Inland Revenue to allow a decision to be made as to whether it is appropriate to treat that body as a special corporate entity. Carrying-Forward of Losses: General Rules - New Section 188 The minimum continuity of shareholding which must be maintained at all times during a continuity period for a company to carry forward its losses will be increased from 40% to 66%. This minimum continu- ity threshold is referred to in the new legislation as the “continuity percentage”. The relevant continuity period will be from the be- ginning of the loss company’s accounting year in which the loss was incurred through to the end of the loss company’s accounting year in which the carried forward loss is offset against the company’s current year assessable income. The lowest percentage economic interest held by each shareholder during the continuity period will be used to determine whether the shareholder continu- ity requirements have been satisfied. If both market value and voting power tests are required to be applied then the lowest economic interest of a share- holder under either of these tests will be taken into account. If the aggregate of the lowest percentage economic interest held by each shareholder in a company is equal to or greater than the continuity percentage the shareholder continuity requirements will be satisfied and the loss will be eligible for carry-forward. A breach of continuity can therefore potentially take place where the number and identity of a company’s shareholders does not change over a continuity pe- riod but the proportion of shares held by each share- holder does. For example, at the beginning of a continuity period shareholders ‘A’ and ‘B’ hold re- spectively 80% and 20% of the shares in the company “Lossco”. During the continuity period ‘A’ sells a 16 60% interest in Lossco to ‘B’. The lowest percentage interest held by the shareholders over the continuity period would be 20% in the case of both ‘A’ and ‘B’. Continuity would be breached as the aggregate of lowest percentage economic interests is 40% which is less than the required continuity percentage. Lossco would therefore not be entitled to carry forward its losses to the next income year. Relief Provisions - New Section 187C Shares in a company which are transferred pursuant to a matrimonial property agreement will be deemed for the purposes of the continuity provisions to have been acquired by the transferee on the same date those shares were acquired by the transferrer. Similarly, if shares in a company are transferred under the will or intestacy of a deceased person, the shares will be deemed to have been acquired by the beneficiary or trustee on the same date those shares were acquired by the deceased person. Loss Carry Forward Transitional Rules Losses incurred in the 1991/92 and prior income years that would have been eligible for offset in the 1991/92 income year, will continue to be eligible for offset in 1991/92 or carry-forward into the 1992/93 income year and beyond provided that: (i) A 40% continuity of shareholding is maintained at all times from Budget night to the end of the loss company’s 1991/92 income year under the carry forward rules in existing section 188 as modified from Budget night. The 40% continuity threshold needs to be satisfied by taking account of the lowest percentage of shares held by each share- holder in a company during this period (provided that where a change of shareholding occurs after 30 July 1991 pursuant to a binding contract en- tered into before 8pm on 30 July 1991 the relevant shares shall be deemed to be acquired at that time); and (ii) A 66% continuity of shareholding, computed using the new rules, is maintained from the beginning of a loss company’s 1992/93 income year. Mining Losses - New Section 188C The provisions of existing section 188 relating to the losses of mining companies and petroleum miners are separated out from new section 188 and restated in a separate section. There are no substantive changes to the existing provisions. Special Partnerships Section 211B of the Act, which relates to special partnerships is amended. A claim for a loss carry- forward will not be allowed unless the Commis- sioner is satisfied that, if the partnership had been a company, and the interests of the partners in the partnership’s certified capital had been shares in that company, the loss could have been carried forward under section 188. The criteria for the carry-forward of losses will therefore be the same for both special partnerships and companies. Part-Year Losses - New Sections 188 and 191 A company will be permitted to carry-forward or group part-year losses by preparing a set of accounts that relate to the part-year of loss and show the losses attributable to that part-year. Grouping of Losses: General Rules - New Section 191 Under the new grouping rules loss and profit compa- nies must be members of the same group at all times from the beginning of the loss company’s income year (i.e., its accounting year) in which the loss is incurred to the end of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is offset. Whereas before shareholder commonality under the grouping rules was only taken at two points in time (i.e., 31 March in the year of loss and 31 March in the year of loss offset) there will now be a requirement of continuity of commonality of shareholding. The new rules are designed to restrict the ability of companies which are not members of the loss source group from benefiting from those tax losses. The income of one of more profit companies will be able to be offset against the carried-forward or cur- rent year losses of a loss company if the profit and loss companies are at least 66% commonly owned at all times from the commencement of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is incurred to the end of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is offset. A loss company and one or more profit companies will qualify to be part of a group for loss offsetting purposes if at all times during the requisite period the aggregate of the lowest percentage economic interest of each shareholder in each of the companies in a group is at least 66%. This is similar to the prescribed proportion test in existing section 191 with the main exception that the 66% commonality of shareholding has to be maintained at all times from the commence- ment of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is incurred to the end of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is offset. The losses eligible for offset under section 191 will be: (i) losses of the loss company able to be carried forward into the income year of offset pursuant to section 188 (which means the continuity test must be satisfied in relation to the loss company); and 17 (ii) losses incurred in the income year of offset. If shareholders’ economic interests are required to be determined using both market value and voting power tests, the lowest percentage interest held by a shareholder in each company would be the lowest percentage computed using either the market value test or the voting power test. Where the balance date of the profit company is later than the balance date of the loss company, the loss company will have to maintain shareholder continu- ity until the end of the profit company’s accounting year before its loss can be offset against the assessable income of the profit company. The restrictions in the current legislation which per- mit only New Zealand sourced losses to be offset against New Zealand sourced income will be re- tained. Loss grouping will only be available for the losses of: (i) Companies that are incorporated in New Zealand and that are not dual resident companies; or (ii) Companies that are carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment to the extent to which, if a profit had been made from the transaction in which the loss was incurred, the amount of the profit would have been assessable income derived by the company from that busi- ness carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Means of Effecting Group Offsets - New Section 191 The means by which corporate groups actually offset losses will be simplified under the new grouping rules. Any corporate group will be able to offset the carried-forward or current year losses of member companies against the profits of other member compa- nies by a combination of subvention payments and elections. Under the current rules, ordinary groups (i.e., corporate groups which are at least two-thirds but less than 100% commonly owned) are restricted to using subvention payments to effect the offset of losses. With a common means of effecting group offsets the current ordinary group/specified group distinction will no longer exist. Transitional Grouping Rules Where the losses to be utilised relate to the 1990/91 and prior income years, the loss and profit compa- nies will have to be members of the same group in the income year that the loss was incurred (i.e., 31 March in the relevant year) and at all times from Budget night to the end of the loss company’s income year in which the loss is offset. Where the losses to be utilised are incurred in the loss company’s 1991/92 income year, the loss and profit companies will have to be members of the same group at all times from Budget night to the end of the loss company’s 1991/92 income year for those losses to be offset in that year. Application Date The new loss and credit carry-forward and grouping rules come into force from the beginning of the 1992/ 93 income year (i.e., in respect of income years commencing on or after 1 April 1992). For the pur- poses of both the new carry-forward and grouping rules, references to income years for companies with non-standard balance dates include accounting years corresponding to the relevant income year. As out- lined above, transitional measures already enacted with effect from Budget night protect the corporate tax base in the transitional period from Budget night to the beginning of the 1992/93 income year. Tax Recovery Introduction A new tax recovery section will replace section 276. The new provision will enable the Commissioner to recover tax from directors and shareholders of com- panies that have entered into arrangements or trans- actions to deplete the assets of the company, leaving the company unable to meet its tax liability. Background The original section 276 had a number of deficiencies in its scope and ease of avoidance. The new recovery section is designed to ensure that those persons who are a party to the arrangement are responsible for the payment of any shortfall in tax. In this respect, it is better targeted than the original section. The new recovery section will also have wider recovery provi- sions, as the Commissioner can recover from both the shareholder as well as a director of the company. Key Issues Application or Recovery Provision The new recovery provision will be triggered by arrangements or transactions that have been entered into to deplete the company of its assets so that it has insufficient funds to fully meet its tax liabilities. However, it will not be triggered by formal (under insolvency proceedings) or informal (under section 414A of the Income Tax Act) arrangements between 18 the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the company and its other creditors, which would result in the Commissioner accepting less than the full amount of tax outstanding. The determinants for the amount of tax liabilities will be based on both current and foreseeable future liabilities such as tax in dispute and unpaid annual Provisional Tax payments. Who would be liable? The new recovery provisions would apply only to: • Directors of the company at the time the arrange- ment/transaction was entered into; • Shareholders of the company who had a control- ling interest in that company at the time the ar- rangement/transaction was entered into; • Associated shareholders in the company whose combined interest gave them a controlling interest in the company; and • Shareholders who did not have a controlling inter- est in the company at the time the arrangement/ transaction was entered into, but who had ben- efited from the arrangement/transaction to an ex- tent greater than their proportional interest in the company would warrant. Controlling interest will be defined in a similar man- ner to that employed for the purposes of the Control- led Foreign Company (CFC) legislation (see section 245C). Amount to be Recovered Directors of the company will be jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the shortfall in tax that has resulted from the arrangement/transaction. Shareholders with a controlling interest in the com- pany at the time the arrangement/transaction was entered into, or a non-controlling shareholder who received a benefit which exceeded their interest in the company would be liable for: • tax to be recovered up to the extent of the greater value of their shareholding in the company and the value of the benefit they derived from the arrange- ment; and • any additional late payment penalty. Application Date 31 July 1991 1st Key Date 1991/92 Income Year. Qualifying Company Provisions for Closely-Held Companies Introduction The Bill introduces an elective regime for the taxation of closely-held companies or “qualifying compa- nies”. This will take effect from the 1992-93 income year. Background The Valabh Consultative Committee in its interim and final reports on the Taxation of Distributions from Companies (released in November 1990 and on Budget night 1991) made recommendations for the taxation of small, family owned companies. The Government has accepted their recommendations and included in the Bill legislation to give effect to them. Key Issues Criteria for entry into the regime Companies with the following characteristics will be eligible to enter the qualifying company regime: • The company is not a foreign company; • The company has five or fewer shareholders. Share- holders related by blood or marriage within the first degree (e.g., parent/child, husband/wife) are deemed to be one shareholder; Example: Company A has the following share- holders : Jack- Father Jane- Mother Paul- Son Pauline - Son's wife Susan- Daughter Mary- Jack's brother's wife For the qualifying company regime there are only three shareholders 1. Jack - Jane, Paul - Susan (All 1 degree from Jack) 2. Pauline 3. Mary • Each Shareholder in the company is a natural person, or a trustee of a trust where all the income is distributed to beneficiaries, or a qualifying company; • The company receives during the year no more than $10,000 of foreign income which is not divi- dend income - i.e., it can receive any amount of foreign dividend income; • The shareholders have elected to assume responsi- bility for the tax payable by the company. In general, of course, the company will pay tax. However, the shareholders must assume joint and several liability for that tax. 19 Election into the Regime All shareholders and directors of the company must elect by notice to the Commissioner that the company should become a qualifying company. In general, any election takes effect on the first day of the income year following the election. However, companies may nominate a future income year. Companies have until 1 October 1992 to elect whether they will be qualifying companies for the first year of the regime, the 1992-93 income year. Taxation of Qualifying Companies Qualifying companies will be taxed on all dividends which they receive. For the 1992-93 income year, this means that qualifying companies with early balance dates will be taxed on dividends prior to 1 April when the general inter-corporate dividend exemp- tion is abolished. It also means that the exemption until 1 April 1994 for dividends paid on redeemable preference shares issued prior to the Budget will not apply to qualifying companies receiving such divi- dends. Imputation credits attached to dividends received by the company will be credited to that company’s imputation credit account and will be available to offset company tax on the dividend. No resident withholding tax will be deducted on dividends paid prior to 1 April 1992 to early balance date qualifying companies. Qualifying companies may group for loss offset pur- poses only with qualifying companies. Qualifying company election tax Dividends paid by a qualifying company to its share- holders will either have maximum imputation cred- its attached or be exempt from tax. For this reason, and because it is not intended that the regime be retrospective, revenue reserves in existence before a company enters the regime will be taxed to the company at the corporate tax rate on entry into the regime. This tax is known as “qualifying company election tax”. The company will pay this tax on the amount calcu- lated in accordance with the formula set out in the legislation. In effect, this is the amount which would be taxable to shareholders if the company were to wind up. As a concessional transitional measure, where a company elects before 31 March 1993 to become a qualifying company a rate of qualifying company election tax of 7.5 percent will apply. That tax will be payable on the lesser of taxable reserves held at the date of election or on 30 November. However, tax at the full company rate is payable on the excess of dividends received over dividends paid during the period from November 1990 until the date of elec- tion. This is to prevent companies paying dividend income into a company which will make the election to become a qualifying company, thereby taking advantage of the concessional rate. On entry into the regime, a company must also cancel its losses. Again, as a transitional measure, compa- nies electing to enter the regime by 31 March 1993 will lose only 25 percent of losses. Taxation of Shareholders As noted earlier, shareholders will receive either fully imputed dividends or exempt dividends. This means that where the company pays no tax on a profit (e.g. capital profits) those profits will flow through to the shareholder tax free. Non-cash dividends will be exempt. Shareholders of some qualifying companies will be able to elect to access the company’s losses. In order for qualifying companies to pass through losses, they must have only one class of share. All losses will be attributed each year to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding. More information is contained on the proposed re- gime in the Valabh Committee reports referred to above. Local Authority Taxation Introduction Two anti-avoidance amendments relating to the taxa- tion of local authorities will be implemented. The first amendment will insert a look-through provision in the local authority trading enterprise (LATE) defi- nition contained in the Local Government Act 1974 (LGA). This will ensure that any the entity under the control of a local authority is in fact covered by the LATE definition. The second amendment will align the Income Tax Act definition of “local authority” with that contained in the Local Government Act. Background From 1 November 1989 local authorities which were previously exempt from all income tax (other than on income received in trust) have had to pay tax on all income derived from LATEs. LATEs themselves are taxed depending on their nature, i.e., on the same basis as companies, trusts, etc. 20 The definition of a LATE is contained in section 594B of the LGA. One of the statutory purposes of local government is the “operation of trading undertak- ings on a competitively neutral basis”. Key Issues The amendments will help to carry out the intention of the current legislation. This intention is to make local authorities liable for tax on income from the trading activities of entities under their control, thus ensuring that these activities operate on a competi- tively neutral basis. The current LATE definition in the Local Govern- ment Act contains a major loophole; subsidiaries of LATEs do not come within the LATE definition, even though they are still under the effective control of a local authority. The absence of a look-through provi- sion in the LATE definition means that any second tier or further tier company or organisation does not come within the LATE definition. As local authorities are not liable for tax on income derived from non-LATE entities, a local authority can gain a tax advantage by structuring its affairs (e.g., by using a holding company structure) to circumvent the LATE definition. While a non-LATE entity is still taxed in its own right according to its nature, a local authority can effectively extract tax free income from a non-LATE entity by charging the non-LATE for high rentals, management fee charges and the like. Although the cost of the high rentals and manage- ment fees is deductible to a non-LATE entity which is under the control of a local authority, the corre- sponding receipt derived by the local authority is not assessable because of the continued application of the local authority tax exemption for income from non-LATE sources. Local authorities can therefore readily maximise the tax free income they derive from non-LATE entities while at the same time mini- mising the taxable income of these entities. The above tax avoidance avenue is not available for LATEs as section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act makes local authorities liable for tax on all income (not just dividends) derived from LATEs. A look through provision will be inserted in the LATE definition to ensure that second tier and fur- ther tier subsidiaries of current LATEs also come within the LATE definition. A local authority would therefore be liable for tax on all income it derives from such second tier and further tier subsidiaries. The current definition of “local authority” in the Income Tax Act is very wide and could give rise to several tax avoidance opportunities. The LGA local authority definition, in contrast, is more specific and finite and would be unlikely in itself to give rise to any tax avoidance opportunities. An amendment will align the local authority definition in the Income Tax Act with that contained in the LGA. Application Date These amendments will apply from the date on which the amendment Act receives the Royal assent. It is proposed that a group of companies will be able to elect to consolidate where these companies have 100 percent common ownership. Ownership will be measured by a shareholder’s economic interest in a company (as used in the loss provisions). The features of consolidating include the ability to: • Transfer inter-corporate dividends tax free; • Transfer inter-group assets tax free; and • Introduce a consistent and simplified joint assess- ment process. Consolidation All member companies must be New Zealand resi- dent taxpayers and there will be no requirement that a parent company must be included in the consoli- dated group. The consolidated entity will have special rules gov- erning returns, payment of tax, record keeping requirements, and pre-consolidation losses and cred- its. Special rules will also be developed for exit and entry from the group. It is proposed that only when a company exits or the assets exit the group, that a taxable event occurs. In order to meet avoidance concerns, certain tracing rules will be required. Announcements 21 Depreciation The Government announced its general support of the depreciation recommendations made in the Valabh Committee’s discussion document on “Tax Accounting Issues”. This support will now enable the commencement of the comprehensive review of rates planned by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Officials were also directed to investigate the feasibil- ity of extending depreciable allowances to intangible assets with a limited economic life. The Earner's Premium Introduction In the Budget it was announced that the Accident Compensation Corporation was introducing an Earn- er’s Premium to cover non-work and non-motor vehicle accidents. This premium is designed to lessen the burden on employers, who are currently funding payments for these accidents. The premium will be assessed at a yet to be determined flat rate. It will be paid by the earner on salary and wages or self- employed income. Inland Revenue will act as collec- tion agent for the premium on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation. Background Currently, all payments for accidents are funded from the Employer Levy, Self-Employed Levy, and the Motor Vehicle Registration Levy. This generally places employers in the position of having to pay for the cover on their employees for accidents that hap- pen outside the workplace and over which they have no control. To continue to fund the current level of pay out for these accidents, the levies would have had to be substantially increased. The Corporation has instead announced that employers will not be charged for non-work related accidents and that the individual earners will provide their own cover. Key Issues There will be a flat rate, yet to be determined, set for all earners. The term “earner” covers both employ- ees and self-employed persons. The same definitions and maximum earnings rules applying to the em- ployer levy will apply to the Earner’s Premium, except in relation to deemed employees on withhold- ing payments. There are four basic categories of earners, each with their own collection procedures. Employees Employers will be required to deduct the premium along with the PAYE deductions from their employ- ees' wages and pay the total to Inland Revenue with their IR 66N. The booklet “PAYE Tax Tables” will be amended to include the premium so that only one amount will need to be deducted from the employ- ee’s earnings per pay period. When an employee terminates employment, or at the end of the year for employees who are still working for the employer, the employer will calculate the amount of the cumu- lative Earner’s Premium and show it separately on each employee's IR 12. Calculating the cumulative Earner’s Premium will be relatively simple as the amount of the premium will be a flat rate for all earners. This calculation will be necessary so em- ployees can determine the amount of PAYE paid, to complete their annual income tax return. The em- ployer will reconcile both the PAYE and Earner’s Premium on the IR 68 reconciliation form. Self-Employed The self-employed will pay the Earner’s Premium along with their payment of the Self-Employed ACC Levy. It will be assessed on the same leviable earn- ings with the same maximum leviable earnings. Withholding Payments The Earner’s Premium on all withholding payments income will be calculated at the end of the year when the person furnishes an income tax return. Payment would be made at the same time as terminal tax. Shareholder/Employees Where tax is deducted at source, shareholder/em- ployees will be regarded as normal employees and pay the premium when the PAYE is deducted. Where tax is not deducted at source (by virtue of section 6 of the Income Tax Act 1976), the Earner's Premium will be accounted for at the time the ACC Employer Levy is paid on that income, i.e., with the annual reconcili- ation due 31 May following the determination of the shareholder/employee income. Application Date The Earner’s Premium will apply from 1 April 1992. 22 Valuation of Local Authority Asset Transfers Background Part XXXIVA of the Local Government Act 1974 (LGA) provides for the establishment of Local Au- thority Trading Enterprises (LATEs). A number of local authorities have established LATEs to under- take trading activities. Generally the LATEs are established to replace un- dertakings previously conducted by the local au- thorities themselves. A transfer of assets is fre- quently associated with the transfer of operations. Issue Inland Revenue has received enquiries about the tax treatment of these asset transfers. Section 594ZM of the LGA states that: “Nothing in section 111 of the Income Tax Act 1976 shall apply in respect of any property ac- quired by a local authority trading enterprise from a local authority pursuant to an establish- ment plan.” Section 111 of the Income Tax Act 1976 deals with depreciation allowances where a taxpayer acquires a depreciated asset. Depreciation is generally based on the price paid for an asset. Section 594ZM of the LGA does not comment on how the transferred assets are to be valued. Policy Inland Revenue considers that the assets should be transferred at either: a) their “notional tax written down book value”, notwithstanding section 594ZM(3) of the Local Government Act 1974; or b) their true market value. - Notional Book Value “Notional tax written down values” are to be calcu- lated in accordance with depreciation rates prescribed by Inland Revenue. That is, the original historic cost of the asset less “notional” depreciation at the sched- ule rates over the number of years the asset was used by the Local Authority. - Market Value Market value should be an accurate representation as well as agreed to between the parties. There will be no “depreciation recovered”, unless the transferring local authority has (i) been a taxpayer and (ii) claimed depreciation on the asset(s) in ques- tion. Where either method of valuation is used Inland Revenue requires: (i)an actual sale of assets by a local authority to a LATE at either accurate “notional tax written down values” or true market values; and (ii)full consideration for the sale passing between the parties; and (iii) complete and detailed documentation evidenc- ing the transaction (including the listing of indi- vidual asset values). This policy applies from 1 November 1989. Reference 10 L 6.2 Public Service Mileage Rates Use For Income Tax Purposes Introduction We have been asked to clear up the confusion about Inland Revenue’s policy on using Public Service Mileage Rates (PSMR) for the purposes of reimburs- ing employees for using their own motor vehicles for work related purposes. Background For many years Inland Revenue, for administrative ease, has allowed taxpayers to use the PSMR for claiming deductions against assessable income and for calculating reimbursing allowances paid to em- ployees. Some years ago the Commissioner of Inland Revenue restricted the use of the PSMR for tax de- duction purposes to 2,000 kms per annum. Where the travel exceeded 2,000 km the actual expenditure incurred for the full year had to be claimed. At the same time this ruling was also intended to apply to allowances and reimbursing payments. While there was adequate publicity about the restric- tion of taxpayers' claims in their returns of income, it 23 is now clear that it was not widely known that the restriction also applied to the other areas mentioned. Hence, there has been very little employer compli- ance with the restriction. Ruling Because of the circumstances mentioned above, the Commissioner will allow the use of the PSMRs on an unrestricted basis to continue. We will not attempt to rectify any cases where the 2000km limit has been exceeded in the past, provided the correct c.c. rating and annual kilometre bandings have been used. Shareholder/employees The above ruling will not apply to shareholder/ employees. Where the company reimburses a share- holder/employee for motor vehicle expenditure, the public service mileage rates may only be used where the business running does not exceed 2,000 kilome- tres in any one income year. Where the annual business travel is more than 2,000 km reimbursement must be made on the basis of the actual expenditure incurred. No deduction or reimbursement for depre- ciation will be permitted. The ruling in TIB 3 - Appendix E, page 9 still applies. The Future The reimbursement of motor vehicle expenses to employees is a matter that was considered by the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee (TSCC). The Government accepted most of the recommendations made. Inland Revenue is currently attending to the details for implementation of the recommendations. One recommendation was that the use of PSMRs be acceptable where the distance travelled did not ex- ceed 5,000km in any one year. After 5,000 km an approved rate should determine the rate of accept- able reimbursement. There was also concern that the PSMRs, with the various “mileage bands” and c.c. ratings, were complicated for employers to use and keep track of the annual progressive mileage. There would also be difficulties where a worker changed employers during an income year. To overcome some of these difficulties Inland Rev- enue has decided that employers can: • continue to use the PSMR on an unrestricted basis, or • as an alternative, use the following rates; Examples of use of above chart. (1) Employee travels 4,850 in an income year. The employee can be reimbursed by either; (a) the average PSMRs - column (i), or (b) the average column (ii) rate of 55c per km, or (c) the actual expenditure incurred. (2) The employee travels 10,800 kms in the year. Reimbursement can be either; (a) the average PSMRs - column (i) for the first 5,000kms and then 34c per km there after, or (b) the average column (ii) rate of 55c for the first 5,000kms and then 34c per km thereafter, or (c) the rate as per column (iii) for the full 10,800 kms, or (d) the actual expenditure incurred.

NOTE 2: The alternative rate can be used as from 1 August 1991. Employers who wish to change to this system from the PSMRs, used for the first part of the tax year, should ensure that the annual reimburse- ment does not exceed the maximum that would be available using the alternative rates. NOTE 3: Where the employee changes employers during an income year the new employer should obtain from the employee details of the year to date motor vehicle reimbursement paid to ensure maxi- mum limits are not exceeded.

Accrual Determinations - Fee Setting Background Regulations 3(1) and 11(1) of the Income Tax (Deter- minations) Regulations 1987 require that fees be charged for accrual regime determinations made in terms of section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Under section 64E(1) the Commissioner is empow- ered to determine certain matters relating to financial arrangements. A taxpayer may wish to apply for a determination to ascertain the tax treatment for a particular financial arrangement. The criteria for setting these fees are set out in Regu- lations 11(2) and 11(3). The Commissioner was not obliged to set fees for the first two years that the Regulations were in force. That time has now lapsed. For the year beginning 1 July 1991 the fees are: Application Fee (non-refundable)$100 Processing Fee (per hour)$90 (that is per hour spent directly processing the application) These fees include GST. Regulation 13 does allow the Commissioner to waive fees in exceptional circumstances, either in full or in part. Applications for determinations should be made to: The Manager Technical Policy Development Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington The information required for applications is set out in Regulation 3(1). Accrual Determination G24: Straight Line Method The Consultative Committee on Tax Simplification recommended taxpayers be able to use the straight line method (rather than yield to maturity) to account for financial arrangements. The straight line method can be applied if the face value of financial arrange- ments held or issued by the person is below $1 million. Legislation implementing this recommendation re- ceived royal assent on 28 June 1991. The new section 64E(1)(aa) of the Income Tax Act 1976 gives the Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to determine how the straight line method applies to any financial arrangement or class of financial ar- rangement. Determination G24: Straight Line Method sets out two ways of applying the straight line method. Method A applies to arrangements where the princi- pal is fixed and interest, if any, is payable at regular intervals. All finance charges, as defined in the determination, are spread equally to each income year over the term of the arrangement. Method B applies to all other financial arrangements, for example, loans with reducing principals. The finance charges under method B are spread over the term of the arrangement in proportion to the princi- pal outstanding. The determination was signed by the Commissioner on 10 July 1991. It is printed in full in the appendix to this TIB.

1 TIB Appendix Volume Three, No. 2August 1991 Determination G24: Straight Line Method ISSN 0114-7161 2 Determination G24: Straight Line Method This determination may be cited as “Determination G24: Straight Line Method.” 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1) Under section 64C(2A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”), a taxpayer may use the straight line method to account for financial arrange- ments. The method may be used when the total value of all financial arrangements issued and held by that taxpayer is less than $1,000,000 at all times during the income year. “Value” in rela- tion to a financial arrangement is: (a) For a fixed principal financial arrangement the nominal or face value of the arrangement; and (b) For a variable principal debt instrument the amount owing by or to the person. (2) This determination sets out two methods for applying the straight line method to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred. Both methods refer to Total Finance Charges. The Total Finance Charges are the amount that will be spread over the term of the arrangement. (3) Total Finance Charges include interest, any premium or discount, and fees (excluding those deductible at the commencement of the loan). Interest payable under a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement is, however, excluded from the Total Finance Charges to be apportioned be- cause it is not known in advance. (4)Method A applies only where the loan is for a fixed amount of principal with interest, if any, payable at regular intervals. All Periods Be- tween Payments must be of equal length. Method A allocates the Total Finance Charges equally to each Period in the term of the arrangement. Method B applies where the principal outstand- ing may vary, and the payments may be at irregular intervals. It allocates the Total Finance Charges to each period in the term of the ar- rangement in proportion to the principal out- standing in each Period and the length of that Period. (5) A Variable Rate Financial Arrangement is one where the interest rate is linked to an external indicator price or index. In this case the actual interest payable in respect of a Period is added to the Total Finance Charges excluding interest that have been apportioned to that Period. Note that as a result the Total Finance Charges might be negative, if the Variable Rate Financial Ar- rangement was issued at a premium. (6) For this determination to apply - (a) The amounts and due dates of all principal repayments must be known or reasonably able to be anticipated, and (b) Interest, if any, must be calculated on the principal outstanding from time to time. (7) This determination can be applied to financial arrangements denominated in a foreign cur- rency, in conjunction with Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. (8) Where a Period spans two income years, the amount of income derived or expenditure in- curred in respect of the Period is apportioned between income years on a daily basis using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (9) Section 64C(2B)(b) of the Act sets out the proce- dure to be followed on changing from the method previously used to account for the financial ar- rangement, to the straight line method. Exam- ple H illustrates how this procedure is applied. (10)Section 64C(2A)(c) of the Act says that a person using the straight line method must apply that method consistently to a financial arrangement until it matures, is sold, remitted or transferred unless the prior consent of the Commissioner to adopt another method is obtained. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Act. 3. Scope of Determination This determination applies where a person decides pursuant to section 64C(2A) of the Act to calculate the income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement using the straight line method, and the financial arrangement meets the following criteria: (1) The financial arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement as defined in this deter- mination, or the interest rate, if any, is specified in the financial arrangement and is fixed; and 3 (2) The amounts of principal (including any fees and any premium or discount at the time of issue or acquisition) and the times or intervals at which they are to be advanced and repaid are known or can reasonably be anticipated or are able to be determined as at the first balance date after issue or acquisition; and (3) Interest, if any, is calculated on the amount of principal outstanding from time to time. 4. Principle For financial arrangements which meet the criteria of this determination, the Total Finance Charges may be apportioned over the term of the financial arrangement pro rata with the principal expected to be outstanding in each Period Between Payments and the length of that Period. In the case of Variable Rate Financial Arrangements interest payable is ex- cluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges; instead the actual interest payable in re- spect of a Period is added to the Total Finance Charges (excluding interest) which have been ap- portioned to that Period. In all other cases interest is included in the calculation of Total Finance Charges. 5.Interpretation (1) In this determination, unless the context other- wise requires - Expressions used have the same meaning as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Period” or “Period Between Payments” means the term, commencing immediately after a pay- ment is payable or receivable and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable: Provided that if a Period exceeds one year it shall be deemed to comprise one or more Periods each of one year followed (or pre- ceded, at the option of the holder or issuer as the case may be) by a Period of less than one year: “Total Finance Charges” in relation to a financial arrangement means - (a) in respect of an issuer, the total of all amounts payable by the issuer less the total of all amounts receivable by the issuer, pursuant to the financial arrangement; (b) in respect of a holder, the total of all amounts receivable by the holder less the total of all amounts payable by the holder, pursuant to the financial arrangement; excluding amounts of interest payable or receiv- able under a Variable Rate Financial Arrange- ment: Provided that any amounts payable in rela- tion to the financial arrangement shall be reduced by the amount of item z as defined in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act: “Variable Rate Financial Arrangement” means a financial arrangement under which the interest rate is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking rates or general commercial rates. (2) The length of all the Periods or Periods Between Payments of a financial arrangement shall be measured in time units of days, weeks, fort- nights, months, quarters, half years or years as is appropriate to the smallest Period Between Payments, provided that where such a time unit is inappropriate for only one or two Periods this fact shall be disregarded, and the length of those one or two Periods shall be measured in days and expressed as a fraction of the time units appropriate to the remaining Periods Between Payments. (3) Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that deter- mination. (4) For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capi- tal letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6. Method (1) Method A (a) Method A may be applied to any financial arrangement where the amount of principal is fixed and interest, if any, is payable at regular intervals throughout the term of the financial arrangement, and the length of all Periods Between Payments is the same. The financial arrangement may be issued at a premium or discount and fees may be payable. 4 (b) The amount of income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in a Period is an amount equal to- (i) The Total Finance Charges divided by the number of Periods in the financial ar- rangement, plus (ii) In the case of a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement the amount of interest pay- able or receivable in respect of that Period. (c) Income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred using this method shall be allocated to income years in accord- ance with Determination G1A: Apportion- ment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (2) Method B (a) Method B may be applied to any financial arrangement. It shall be used in all cases were the length of the Periods Between Payments are unequal or the amount of principal varies. (b) The amount of income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in re- spect of a Period is equal to- (i) The amount calculated according to the formula- a x b x c d where - a is the Total Finance Charges payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be; b is the length of the Period; c is the amount of principal outstanding during the Period Between Payments; d is the sum of all items e calculated in respect of every Period Between Pay- ments; and e in respect of any Period is (b x c), plus (ii) In the case of a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement the amount of interest pay- able or receivable in respect of that Period. (c) Income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred using this determina- tion shall be allocated to income years in accordance with Determination G1A: Appor- tionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 7. Examples Method A (1) Example A (a fixed rate fixed principal borrow- ing) This is an example of a fixed rate borrowing under which the principal is fixed. On 12 February 1992 a company borrows NZ$10,000 for 5 years at a fixed interest rate of 16 per cent p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The money is raised by issuing notes at a discount of 5 per cent. The borrower is a New Zealand taxpayer who is eligible to use the straight line method. Contingent fees of 2.5 per cent of $10,000 are payable by the borrower to the lender; there are no non-contingent fees. The Total Finance Charges payable by the bor- rower are - $ 10,000principal payable +250fees paid +8,000interest payable -9,500principal received 8,750 The length of each Period is measured in time units of half a year, and the principal outstanding is $10,000 throughout the term of the loan. There are 10 half yearly time periods over the 5 year term of the loan because interest is payable half- yearly. Therefore Method A may be used, and the ex- penditure incurred in each Period is the Total Finance Charges of $8750 divided by the number of Periods: $8,750/10 = $875 This expenditure would be spread between in- come years on a daily basis using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expendi- ture on a Daily Basis. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. In the first Period (12 February 1992 to 12 August 1992) 5 the expenditure calculated using the straight line method is $875. There are 182 days in the Period. Expenditure on a daily basis is therefore $875/ 182 = $4.81. In the 1992 income year expenditure incurred is: 12/2/92 - 31/3/92 48 days. 48 x $4.81 = $230.88 In the 1993 income year expenditure incurred is: 31/3/92 - 12/8/92 134 days 134 x $4.81 = $644.54 12/8/92 - 12/2/93 184 days$875.00 12/2/93 - 31/3/93 47 days 47 x $4.83\* = $227.01 $1,746.55 \* There are 181 days in the period 12 February 1993 to 12 August 1993 therefore the daily rate is $4.83. Expenditure for subsequent income years is cal- culated in the same way. Expenditure for each income year, except the year the loan matures, is shown below: 1992$ 230.88 1993$1,746.55 1994$1,749.23 1995$1,749.23 1996$1,753.10 TOTAL$7,228.99 When the arrangement matures the base price adjustment (section 64F) is used to calculate ex- penditure in the final income year (1997). The base price adjustment is calculated according to the formula: a - (b + c) a = all amounts paid = $10,000 (principal) + $250 (fees) + $8,000 (int.) = $18,250 b = acquisition price = all amounts received = $9,500 (principal) c = expenditure incurred in previous years = $7,228.99 (as calculated above) Therefore a - (b + c) = $1,521.01. This amount is deemed to be expenditure in- curred. If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of $875 in each Period. (2) Example B (a variable rate loan) This is the same as Example A except that interest is determined according to a market indicator. e.g. the bank bill or commercial bill rate. Since the notes with a face value $10,000 were issued at a 5 per cent discount, and contingent fees of 2.5 per cent were payable by the borrower (to the lender), who is the issuer in relation to this financial arrangement, the Total Finance Charges to the borrower are - $ 10,000principal payable +250fees paid - 9,500principal received 750 Note that since the arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement interest amounts are excluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges. The length of each Period is measured in time units of half a year, and the principal outstanding is $10,000 throughout. In the first period an inter- est rate of 10 per cent p.a. applied, and, interest of $500 was payable. Method A may be used to calculate the expendi- ture incurred in respect of each Period, that is - (a) $750/10 = $75 plus (b) the actual interest payable in respect of that Period. In the first six month Period the interest rate was 10 per cent p.a. so that total expenditure incurred was $75 plus actual interest of $500 which is $575. This expenditure would be allocated on a daily basis to each day in the Period using Determina- tion G1A: Apportionment of Income and Ex- penditure on a Daily Basis. If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. (3) Example C (a zero coupon loan) A New Zealand company raises $5,000 by issuing 5 year notes with a face value of $10,000 at a 50 per cent discount. No interest is payable. The tax- payer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The Total Finance Charges payable by the bor- rower are - $ 10,000amount payable - 5,000amount received 5,000 6 In this case Method A may be used. The Period Between Payments is 1 year and the appropriate time unit is a year. There are 5 periods between payments. Therefore the dis- count would be allocated equally as $1,000 to each of the five periods in the term of the loan, and would then be apportioned to income years using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. Method B (4) Example D (a reducing principal fixed interest loan) On 12 February 1992 a company borrows NZ$10,000 for 5 years. The money is raised by issuing notes at a discount of 4.5 per cent. $2,000 of the notes are to be repaid on each anniversary of the loan. Interest at 16 per cent p.a. is payable half yearly in arrears on the bal- ance of the notes outstanding during the half year. The borrower is a New Zealand company. There are no fees. The taxpayer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The length of each Period is half a year. The interest payable in the first year is $1,600. Each subsequent year this reduces by $320. The Total Finance Charges to the borrower are there- fore - $ 10,000principal payable +4,800interest payable - 9,550principal received 5,250 (i) total interest payable 1,600 + 1,280 + 960 + 640 + 320 = 4,800 Therefore a = $5,250 (‘a’ is a variable used in the formula described in Method B). The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges, where b = 1 throughout (since there is one time unit of half a year in each Period):- Half year Principal (b x c) Expenditure Periodoutstanding cea x b x c d 110,00010,000875 210,00010,000875 38,0008,000700 48,0008,000700 56,0006,000525 66,0006,000525 74,0004,000350 84,0004,000350 92,0002,000175 102,0002,000175 Total d =60,0005,250 This expenditure would be spread using Deter- mination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjust- ment). If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. (5) Example E (a reducing principal variable rate loan) This is the same as Example D except that interest is determined according to a market indicator. The notes, with a face value of $10,000, were issued at a 4.5 per cent discount. There are no fees. The Total Finance Charges to the borrower are - $ 10,000principal payable - 9,550principal received whence a =450 Note that since the arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement interest amounts are excluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges. The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges, where ‘b’ equals one throughout (since there is one time unit of half a year in each period). The actual interest payable in the Period must be added to the amount 7 apportioned in each Period to determine total expenditure. Half year Principal (b x c) Expenditure Periodoutstanding cea x b x c d 110,00010,00075 210,00010,00075 38,0008,00060 48,0008,00060 56,0006,00045 66,0006,00045 74,0004,00030 84,0004,00030 92,0002,00015 102,0002,00015 Total d =60,000450 This expenditure would be spread using Deter- mination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjust- ment). If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. (6) Example F (a loan with different repayment periods) A New Zealand taxpayer borrows $75,000 and agrees to repay $100,000. Repayments are $30,000 at the end of year one and $70,000 at the end of year four. The taxpayer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The Total Finance Charges payable by the bor- rower are - $ 100,000 amount payable - 75,000 amount received whence a = 25,000 The length of each Period is a year therefore b = 1. The principal outstanding is $100,000 in the first (one year) Period, and $70,000 in the subsequent Periods. Hence the Total Finance Charges are allocated as follows: Period Length Principal (b x c) Expenditure (years)outstanding bcea x b x c d 11100,000100,0008,065 2170,00070,0005,645 3170,00070,0005,645 4170,00070,0005,645 Total d =310,00025,000 The expenditure incurred in each Period would be spread between income years using Determi- nation G1A: Apportionment of Income and Ex- penditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjust- ment). (7) Example G (discounted Government Stock) A taxpayer buys New Zealand Government Stock on the secondary market. Details are as follows: Face value $500,000 Coupon16 per cent p.a. payable half yearly Maturity15 August 1994 Settlement1 March 1992 Price$548,978 (YTM = 11.6% pa) The taxpayer is not a cash basis holder but is eligible to use the straight line method to account for its financial arrangements, and decides to do so. The Total Finance Charges are - $ 500,000maturity value + 200,000five coupons of $40,000 - 548,978purchase price whence a = 151,022 There is a broken first Period of 167 days, fol- lowed by five half year Periods. A time unit of half years is appropriate. Since the Periods are of unequal length, Method B applies. The 167 days represents 167 x 2/365 = 0.9151 of a half year. Therefore b = 0.9151 in the first Period and b = 1 in the remaining periods as there is one time unit of half a year in each Period. 8 The following table can be constructed: Half year Principal (b x c) Expenditure Periodoutstanding cea x b x c d 1500,000 457,550 1 28,117 2 2500,000 500,000 30,726 3500,000 500,000 30,726 4500,000 500,000 30,726 5500,000 500,000 30,727 Total d =2,457,550151,022 1 e = b x c = 0.9151 x 500,000 = 457,550 2 a =151,022Total Finance Charges b =0.9151Length of Period c =500,000Principal outstanding d = 2,457,550sum of all items ‘e’ above The income derived in each Period would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportion- ment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjust- ment.) (8) Example H (transition to the straight line method) This is similar to Example A, which is summa- rised as follows: An amount of $9,250 (after fees and discount) is borrowed on 12 February 1991, repayable by 10 half yearly interest payments of $800 each, plus a final payment of $10,000. The yield to maturity is 18.356 per cent. Assume the borrower is a New Zealand taxpayer with a 31 March balance date and used the yield to maturity method for the first income year. Then the expenditure deemed to be incurred in the income year ending 31 March 1991 is calcu- lated as follows: (a) Amount attributable to period 12 February - 11 August 1991: $9,250 x 18.356%/2 = $849 (b) Amount attributable to income year ending 31 March 1991: $849 x 47 days/181 days = $220 Assume that in the 1991/1992 income year the taxpayer meets the criteria for the straight line method and decides to use Method A of this determination. Then the amount of expenditure calculated in accordance with section 64C(2B)(b) is as follows: (a) From example A, the amount of expenditure that would have been deemed to be incurred under the straight line Method A up to 31 March 1992 is as follows: (i)period 12 February - 11 August 1991: $875 (ii) period 12 August - 11 February 1992: $875 (iii) period 12 February - 31 March 1992 875 x 48 days/182 days = $231 $1,981 (b) Therefore, using the formula in section 64C(2B)(b) a =0income derived using the straight line method b =$1,981 expenditure incurred using the straight line method c =0income derived in prior income years d =$220expenditure incurred in prior in- come years (c) The amount calculated in accordance with the formula is - a - b - c + d = 0 - 1,981 - 0 + 220 = -$1,761 and since this is a negative amount, it is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the borrower. This determination is signed by me on the 10th day of July in the year 1991. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue

The Unit will be known as Income Tax Audit from 1 July 1991, and its new role will see it doing different types of audit. Acting Director Taxpayer Audit, Joy Hames, said the changes should make the Unit’s role clearer and make it more effective. There has been a shift from the examination of income details to a concentration on expenditure. During a recent review it was clear that the same taxpayers’ tax returns were checked each year, and overall coverage was not being achieved. Name Change The new name, Income Tax Audit, will help the public identify the Unit’s work. It will also bring it into line with other divisions of Taxpayer Audit such as GST Audit and Payroll Inspectors. “We expect the new name will help raise the Unit’s profile and make its work better understood,” Ms Hames said. Purpose Under Inland Revenue’s Corporate Plan, the pur- pose of the Taxpayer Audit Programme is to “detect and bring to account those who do not pay the correct amount of tax”. Income Tax Audit’s role is to carry out a balanced programme of checks concentrating on taxpayers whose income/turnover is under $1.5 million. For the six months ended 31 December 1990 it as- sessed over $18 million extra tax by carrying out checks on 33,415 income tax returns. The discrepan- cies uncovered were five times the operating costs of the Unit. The new focus is expected to be even more effective. New Activities Income Tax Audit continues two previous activities and has added three new functions. These are: Routine Audit: this activity involves reviewing se- lected items from selected tax returns. If necessary, we will contact taxpayers or their agents and ask for the source documentation to substantiate expenses claimed. Extended Audit: we will review full accounts from selected tax returns. This involves interviews with taxpayers, who will be questioned about their “op- erating procedures” such as the recording of sales, disposal of assets, payments of expenditure etc., as well as specific items contained in the accounts and tax return. Where a taxpayer has an agent we will also review the agent’s working papers and ques- tionnaire. The agent will be invited to attend the interview with the client. The selection of returns for both types of audits is based on a variety of methods and does not mean that the return is incorrect. Technical Checks: these checks will mainly revolve around specialist tax areas such as accruals, uneco- nomic ventures, share trading, new legislation and similar things. Interviews may not be necessary in all of these cases. The Unit will continue its previous activities of: • Checking for people outside the tax system who have not furnished returns, or people who omit untaxed income. • Matching of: a) employer tax deduction certifi- cates to employees' tax returns, and b) details of interest and dividends to taxpayers' tax returns. Training and Quality We have introduced an extensive training programme for the staff on Income Tax Audit to give them the necessary skills to carry out their role efficiently and effectively. Quality standards are also being intro- duced for guidance of staff members conducting the reviews. These changes have been made to increase the effec- tiveness of Inland Revenue’s Audit activities in line with our continuing efforts to make improvements in all areas of our operation. 3 In TIB Volume Three, No.2 of August 1991, we printed the following table to show the rates that employers can use instead of using the Public Service Mileage Rates. Public Service Mileage Rates Use for Income Tax Purposes Unfortunately, one sentence was left out, due to a printing error. The sentence was to the effect that the rates apply to all vehicles, regardless of their c.c. rating. Tax Free Allowances - Employment Contracts Act 1991 Introduction We have been asked to set out our policy on the tax treatment of allowances under the new employment contracts regime. Background Section 73 of the Income Tax Act 1976 governs the income tax exemption of allowances paid to employees to cover expenditure they incur in gaining or producing assessable income. The theme of the Income Tax Act is that an allowance paid to an employee is taxable unless it is exempted from tax by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner issues a determination stating the extent to which an allowance is exempt from tax. In the past allowances contained in national awards or other similar documents did not need a fresh determination each time the agreement was renegotiated. Provided the allowance increased in the same proportion as the gross salary there was no need to seek Inland Revenue approval of the new level of the allowance. Ruling With the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 there will be a phasing out of national awards. Where tax exempt allowances contained in national awards or other similar documents are transferred to employment contracts there is no need for a new determination provided the previous rules on increases are met. Where the allowance increases in the same proportion as the gross salary the increase will be exempt without any need to apply for a fresh determination. This rule is to be applied for transfers from awards to contracts, to increases under contracts and to transfers from one contract to another for work and terms of employment that are substantially the same. If the allowances in the new documents are increased by more than the same proportion as the gross salary, or the allowances are new or of a different type, approval for exemption should be sought from local Inland Revenue offices.

We ruled that where it was not possible for a yearling to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply due to the nature of the contract for the sale of the yearling, the supplier would be allowed a 6 month extension in which that yearling must be exported. This extension was provided under section 11(1C)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment Inland Revenue has reviewed its policy on the limi- tation to “yearling only”. We have decided that the policy will equally apply to other age bloodstock. This means that bloodstock sold at yearling sales which sales take place immediately after 1 August (the official birthdate of bloodstock) will also qualify for the consideration of the 6 months extension. Apart from providing a consistent treatment, the new policy means that bloodstock sold at yearling sales taking place immediately after 1 August (the official birthdate of bloodstock) will also qualify for the 6 months extension. No change has been made to the requirements that - • Any request for an extension of time beyond the 28 day rule, but not exceeding 183 days, must be made in writing and accompanied by a copy of the contract of supply, and • The animal has not and/or will not be used under the “consumption” principle, e.g., for breeding racing or entry into show in New Zealand. Tax Simplification - Recommendation 101 - GST Tax Invoices Introduction The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee in its final report recommended: “That there should be a simple procedure by which purchasers, unable to get a correct tax invoice from a supplier within 28 days, may notify the IRD which should exercise its powers to force compliance with the law.” This item explains that procedure. Legal Duty Section 24(1) of the GST Act requires a supplier to provide a GST tax invoice to a registered person who receives the supply. The invoice must be issued within 28 days of any request. If a registered person does not provide a tax invoice, that person commits an offence under s.62(1)(l) of the GST Act. They are then liable to: (a) A fine up to $500 upon conviction on the first occasion; (b) A fine up to $750 upon conviction on the second occasion; (c) A fine up to $1000 upon conviction for a third or subsequent time for each month of default. Inland Revenue Procedures If a purchaser has not received a tax invoice within 28 days of request, they should contact the Taxpayer Services Unit of their local Inland Revenue Office. That unit will then contact the supplier and inform them of the obligations and penalties under the GST Act. If the supplier still refuses to issue a tax invoice, the purchaser should again contact Inland Revenue. We will then consider a prosecution under s.62 of the GST Act. Going Concerns and Tax Invoices After entering into an agreement, the parties may disagree whether the transaction was the supply of a going concern. The vendor may think the supply was a going concern (and taxed at zero percent) and the purchaser may think the supply was not a going concern (and taxed at 12.5 percent). When this happens the purchaser usually obtains a tax invoice that shows tax has been charged at zero percent. Because the purchaser wants to claim an input tax credit, the purchaser contacts Inland Rev- enue and informs us that an incorrect invoice has been issued. We are then asked to make the vendor issue another invoice showing the supply was subject to GST at 12.5 percent. However, the vendor may refuse to issue a further tax invoice on the grounds the supply was a going concern. 5 We do not see our role as a referee of such disputes. Contracting parties should agree the going concern status of any transaction upon entering a sale and purchase agreement and draft the contract accord- ingly. However, Inland Revenue has a responsibility to make sure registered persons comply with the obli- gations under the GST Act. In particular, Inland Revenue has a responsibility to make sure that cor- rect tax invoices are issued and returns filed cor- rectly. If, therefore, a question of compliance arises, Inland Revenue has a responsibility to determine the facts and ensure the correct amount of tax is assessed. Inland Revenue Procedures Where the parties are unable to agree whether the supply was a going concern, contact should be made with the Taxpayer Services Unit of Inland Revenue. That section will clarify Inland Revenue’s policy of what is the supply of a going concern. That policy is currently set out in TIB No.5 1989. If the parties to the transaction still don’t agree whether the supply was a going concern, and it appears that the vendor has not provided a correct tax invoice or may not have accounted for GST correctly, the matter will be referred to the GST Audit section. The GST Audit section will then decide whether the supply was a going concern. To determine the matter the GST Audit section will usually obtain a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and interview the parties involved in the transaction. After making a decision, Inland Revenue will inform both parties of that decision. Where the Assets are not sold as a Going Concern Where it is decided that the sale was not a going concern and GST has not already been accounted for, we will assess the vendor for GST on the total consid- eration payable. If the vendor has not already issued a tax invoice, we will ask the vendor to do so. It is then up to purchaser to follow up the issue of a correct tax invoice. If the vendor fails to issue a correct tax invoice, the pur- chaser should again contact the GST Audit section. We will then enforce the provisions of the GST Act. When a tax invoice has already been issued but shows the incorrect rate of GST (zero instead of 12.5 percent) the GST Auditor will instruct the supplier to issue a debit note in terms of s.25 of the GST Act. If the vendor fails to do this, the purchaser should again contact Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will then enforce the provisions of the GST Act. Where the Assets are sold as a Going Concern If it is decided that the sale was a going concern, we will advise both parties of this. This usually ends Inland Revenue’s involvement in the dispute. Reference H.O. GST T.4.1 Child Support Changes The Child Support Bill 1991 was introduced to Parlia- ment on 22 August 1991. A number of taxpayers will be affected when the present liable parent contribution scheme is replaced by the child support scheme from 1 July next year. There are approximately 100,000 liable parents re- quired to pay the liable parent contribution, and 28,000 required to pay court ordered maintenance. At present, the Department of Social Welfare admin- isters the liable parent contribution scheme and col- lects and pays out maintenance orders. The new scheme will be administered by the Child Support Agency, a part of Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will assess non-custodial parents' liability, using an assessment formula based on their taxable income. Failure to pay will result in automatic deductions from wages, bank accounts, etc. The Child Support Agency will also collect Court- ordered spousal maintenance and pay the amounts received to the qualifying spouse for orders of $10 a week or more. Inland Revenue will automatically reassess liable parents who are currently paying under the liable parent scheme or a court order for maintenance. This will happen early next year. These parents will receive a notice of assessment for child support at that time, but will continue paying under the present scheme until the child support scheme starts on 1 July next year, to give them time to adjust their financial affairs. A question and answer booklet on the Child Support Bill is available from all Inland Revenue offices. When the bill becomes law, we will send further information to tax practitioners, custodial and non- custodial parents and other interested groups. 6 Tax Simplification Recommendations The following two tables give a summary of the Tax Simplification Consultatitive Committee's recommendations. They show which of these have become law, and when the new payment dates apply from.

Background On 1 August 1991 the New Zealand Wool Board (the Board) announced that it will be making supplemen- tary payments to woolgrowers for all wool sold between 6 February 1991 and 30 June 1991. The payment to each woolgrower is to be made in two instalments; 50% on 1 October 1991 and the balance on 1 October 1992. Income Tax Ruling Based on information presented it has been decided that these supplementary payments are to be treated as income in the year in which they are received. For example, the payment to be received on 1 Octo- ber 1991 should be returned in the 1992 income year, and the 1 October 1992 payment in 1993. GST Ruling The GST treatment of supplementary payments is governed by section 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Where a price is altered after a taxable supply is made an adjustment must be made to correct the amount of GST involved. An adjustment is by way of a debit or credit note if a tax invoice has been issued and that invoice is later found to be incorrect. The Wool Board, or the Wool Board’s agent, will produce the appropriate debit note. The adjustment is to be made in the return period in which the price change became apparent. For people using the invoice accounting basis, this will be the earlier of the date of receipt of either the supplemen- tary payment or the debit note. If the woolgrower is on a payments basis of account- ing then the adjustment will be made in the period in which the payment is received. Reference: HO 10.W.5.1. Fringe Benefit Tax - Prescribed Rate of Interest This item replaces that in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Three Number 1, July 1991. The Minister of Revenue has advised that the pre- scribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit of low interest loans has been reduced to 12.4% for the quarter commencing 1 July 1991. A recent law change allows us to reduce the rate so it better reflects the current market rate. This is being done for the first time this quarter. Unless it is further amended, this new rate will also apply for the quarter commencing 1 October 1991 and subsequent quarters.

The lowest price and discounted values are alterna- tive methods of calculating the acquisition price for the purposes of section 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("the Act”). The item makes three main points: (i)The accruals regime was intended to capture interest income or expenditure on debt and debt substitutes. It was not intended to impute inter- est where none existed. (ii) The accruals regime, while diluting the capital/ revenue distinction for certain financial arrange- ments, did not intend to tax changes in the capital values of properties traded on a deferred basis. (iii) The determination of the lowest price and thus the interest component of a deferred property settlement is a matter for negotiation between the parties to an arrangement. The Commis- sioner can not impute interest where it is genu- inely agreed between the parties that no interest will be paid. However, where the objective facts indicate that interest is disguised or capitalised, In- land Revenue may challenge the lowest price stated by the parties. This item refers to sections 64B, 64BA, 64E, and 64F of the Act and Determinations G17A and G21. Background Taxpayers and their agents have asked Inland Rev- enue to clarify the meaning of “lowest price” for deferred property settlements. In addition they ques- tion whether Inland Revenue can challenge the “low- est price” agreed between the parties to a deferred property settlement. This item considers the intent of the accruals legisla- tion towards property transactions, and the legisla- tion as enacted. It draws on the Report of Consultants on the Effect of the Accruals Regime on Property Transac- tions published in July 1988 and provides examples to illustrate Inland Revenue’s position. It commences by reviewing briefly the legislation applying to prop- erty settlements. For the purposes of this discussion, deferred prop- erty settlements are agreements for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option where full payment is not made at the time that the first right (as defined in section 64B) in the property is transferred. Legislation Financial arrangements include real and personal property transactions where there is a lapse between the time that the property is transferred and settle- ment. Where there is a deferral of consideration for a property transaction it is assumed that the transac- tion contains an interest element, whether capital- ised or otherwise. This interest element must be spread according to the provisions of the accrual regime. An agreement for the sale and purchase of property is defined in section 64B as an agreement entered into by a person to purchase, acquire, sell or dispose of property. Property is defined as any capital asset (excluding foreign exchange or a financial arrange- ment), trading stock (as defined in section 64B), consumable aids, and property acquired or sold for private or domestic purposes. Certain agreements for the sale and purchase of property are excluded from the accrual regime for compliance reasons. They are: (i) Private or domestic agreements for the sale and purchase of property; and (ii) Short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property. Both are defined in section 64B. These arrangements are excluded from the regime by the definition of an excepted financial arrangement. They are excluded to the extent that they do not form a part of another financial arrangement. Specified options (as defined in section 64B) for the sale and purchase of property which do not lapse are treated for tax purposes in the same way as agree- ments for the sale and purchase of property. Where a deferred property settlement is subject to the accrual rules, any interest component (whether implicit or explicit) in the agreement must be spread in accordance with section 64C and determinations over the term of the arrangement. When the deferred property settlement matures the base price adjustment (section 64F) must be calcu- 9 lated. The base price adjustment ensures all income or expenditure from a financial arrangement is ac- crued. The critical variable in the base price adjust- ment is the acquisition price. The acquisition price is, in effect, the price agreed for the property less any interest component. Section 64BA defines the acqui- sition price for the purposes of the base price adjust- ment. There are two methods of determining the acquisition price. First, the lowest price that would have been agreed between the buyer and seller at the time the contract was made, presuming payment in full at the point at which the first rights in the property are to be trans- ferred. Secondly, where the lowest price is not applicable, the acquisition price is the discounted value of the cash flows relating to the deferred property settle- ment. The method used to determine the discounted value is described in Determination G17A: Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Cur- rency and Determination G21: Deferred Property Set- tlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency. Intention of the legislation The Report of Consultants on the Effect of the Accruals Regime on Property Transactions discusses the inten- tion of the accruals regime towards deferred prop- erty settlements. It says that: (i)It was not intended that the capital/ revenue distinction be diluted to the extent that unreal- ised gains or losses on capital assets and accrued revenue gains and losses on revenue assets be brought to account for tax purposes; and (ii) In relation to agreements for the sale and pur- chase of property (where the intention is to hold that property on either revenue or capital ac- count) the intention of Parliament was only to bring to tax the interest component whether capitalized or not. Any change in the value of the property which is the subject of an agreement is to be disregarded; and (iii) It was not intended that an interest component be deemed to exist as a matter of course where the parties agreed that interest was not payable. The report says that: “It has been suggested that, where there is any delay in passing of consideration, there must be an interest component. This argument, we con- sider, can be dismissed on the basis that, al- though in pure economic terms there is a benefit delaying payment, the accruals regime does not seek to impute an interest component where the parties have agreed that no interest is to be charged. The courts have never sought to impute an inter- est component in a contract where there has not been one agreed between the parties. The courts have, however, intervened when an interest component within an agreement is disguised as something other than interest. ... The Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue and the courts cannot attempt to impose terms which interfere with the “free market system” and the ability of parties to negotiate their own terms. This is analogous to the fact that the courts will not generally question the adequacy of consideration in a contract. ..” (Page 89). The lowest price The legislative mechanism used to meet these objec- tives is the concept of lowest price. The Report of Consultants on the Effect of the Accruals Regime on Property Transactions says the definition of lowest price in section 64BA concentrates on: (i)The intention of both the parties to the agree- ment for the sale and purchase of property or the specified option; and (ii) The particular purchaser negotiating the price for the property rather than any purchaser. This is in contrast to the definition of cash price used in the Credit Contracts Act which concentrates on the price at which the property would be sold to any purchaser; and (iii) The time at which the rights in the property the subject of the agreement are to be transferred. It is at the date of transfer that the lowest price should be determined. The provision relies on the intention of both the buyer and the seller in determining the lowest price. It is thus a subjective test. This means that Inland Rev- enue cannot ignore a lowest price that has been genuinely agreed between the parties. If the parties have agreed to a lowest price which results in an interest rate of 9% Inland Revenue cannot ignore that because it feels that a rate of 15% is a more realistic market rate. The test however is the lowest price the parties would have agreed on, not the lowest price the parties agree to state they agreed on. Inland Revenue may consider the objective facts to determine whether or not the parties have genuinely agreed to the price they assert. The situation is similar to that where a taxpayer asserts that he or she is in business. In that situation Inland Revenue can look to the objective facts for assistance in determin- ing whether the taxpayer genuinely had a profit motive despite the taxpayer's assertion. The fact that the test is a subjective one does not mean that it is decided purely on the claims of the taxpayer. 10 The test is what the taxpayers really agreed, not what they claimed to have agreed. Examples (i)A taxpayer with accumulated losses of $400,000 sells a capital asset for a deferred payment of $500,000. The asset is valued at $450,000. Pos- session of the asset is to pass immediately and payment is to take place in 18 months. The parties state in the agreement for sale and pur- chase that the lowest price they would have agreed upon for immediate payment is $100,000. The objective facts however suggest the lowest price was asserted by the parties in order to transfer the advantage of the vendor’s tax losses. In this situation, unless there is some compelling evidence Inland Revenue would not accept the taxpayers' assertions that $100,000 was the lowest price they would have agreed on. (ii) One company sells another company a building for $10 million dollars with payment to take place 12 months after possession passes. In most circumstances Inland Revenue would not accept that $10 million was the lowest price that the parties would agree on if payment was made when first right in the property passed. The parties may assert this but in many cases the surrounding circumstances would not support the assertion. Assuming that the taxpayers are commercially sophisticated, it would be reason- able to assume that they had considered the time value of money. If the compensation in the nature of interest was disguised in the purchase price it would be open to the Commissioner to challenge the price agreed. (iii) A parent sells a child a farm for $1,000,000 with the purchase price left outstanding for 10 years. The lowest price agreed between the parties when possession of the property passed was $1,000,000. The transaction is in substance a ten year interest free loan. In the case of such intra- family dealings Inland Revenue may accept that the $1,000,000 was the lowest price agreed. The extension of credit is based on the natural love and affection the parent has for the child. The parties have not turned their minds to the time value of money. It has no relevance in their relationship. Discounted value Where the lowest price does not apply the acquisition price is the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property. The Commissioner of Inland Rev- enue has issued two determinations (G17A and G21) detailing the method of calculating the acquisition price. The discount rate used to calculate the acqui- sition price is the market interest rate on bank or treasury bills or government stock of a term similar to the term of the deferred property settlement. Those determinations provide examples of the appli- cation of the discounting method. Conclusion The parties to a deferred property settlement should identify the lowest price they would agree to pay and receive for the property which is the subject of the agreement. The lowest price must be determined at the date that the first rights in the property are transferred. The lowest price is a matter for negotia- tion between the parties to an arrangement. Inland Revenue cannot impute an interest component where it does not exist. However, where the facts indicate that interest is disguised or capitalised Inland Revenue may challenge the lowest price stated by the parties. In the absence of agreement over the lowest price the discounted value method detailed in Determination G17B and G21A should be applied. Reference: H.O.

These changes put into effect the Government’s an- nouncement of 7 November 1991 that: • The Budget night proposal to abate National Su- perannuation through an income-tested scheme administered by the Department of Social Wel- fare is not to proceed; and • The surcharge administered by the Inland Rev- enue Department is to continue. Key Issues The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.6) 1991 inserts a new Part XA into the Income Tax Act. The new Part, which is very similar to the present one, • changes the rate of the surcharge from 20 to 25 percent, and • lowers the surcharge threshold from $7,202 to $4,160 for single superannuitants and from $12,012 to $6,240 for a married couple. The surcharge will thus apply to a greater number of superannuitants. Other changes to Part XA are of a purely technical nature: • References to guaranteed retirement income and related terms have been replaced with appropri- ate references to national superannuation; • Living alone payments to national superannuitants are now included within the definition of “na- tional superannuation”; • The sections have been renumbered and reor- dered. Superannuitants who are already liable to pay the surcharge may have made elections under the old legislation. These are deemed to continue to apply. New elections may be made at any time. For the purposes of calculating Provisional Tax, the GRI surcharge will be included in 1991 or 1992 residual income tax. Application Date Income year commencing 1 April 1992 (or alternative balance date). GST Treatment of Allowances Paid to Employees Introduction This item clarifies the GST treatment of input credits in respect of allowances paid to employees. Background On page 5 of TIB Volume 2 No.3 we explained the rules relating to claiming GST input credits where employers reimburse employees for work related expenditure. We have been asked to clarify the statement in the item that GST input credits are not allowed where an allowance is paid. This ruling is in variance to a paragraph (Chapter 3.5.6.) of the GST Technical Rulings prior to the recent reprint. The GST Technical Rulings paragraph intimates that a GST input credit will be allowed where a share- holder/employee is reimbursed for the use of a private motor car on work related travel. The exam- ple in the paragraph shows the GST input credit calculated on the basis of reimbursement using the Public Service Mileage Rates (PSMRs). For the rea- sons explained in TIB Vol.2 No.3, this ruling is incorrect. There is no GST incurred by the employer and there is insufficient connection between the pay- ment made by the employer and the expenditure incurred by the shareholder/employee. Ruling The ruling at Chapter 3.5.6 of GST Technical Rulings only applied to shareholder/employees. As from the date of the publication of this TIB employers will no longer be entitled to any further GST input credits where the PSMRs have been used to reimburse share- holder/employees for work related travel. This ruling will not affect employer costs of ordinary employees’ reimbursement. It was never Inland Revenue policy that employers could claim an input tax credit in respect of ordinary employees where an allowance was paid or travel was reimbursed by way of the PSMRs. The ruling given in TIB Volume 2 No.3 is confirmed. Employers cannot claim GST input tax credits on allowances paid, or travel reimbursed using the PSMRs, in respect of ordinary employees. The same ruling will apply to employers of shareholder/em- ployees as from the date of this TIB.

The new due date for payment of end-of-year tax for Provisional Taxpayers whose Residual Income Tax in the previous year was more than $2,500 is the 7th day of the month contained in the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976. The new due date for Provisional Taxpayers who are natural persons, and whose Residual Income Tax in the previous year was $2,500 or less, is the 20th day of the 8th month after balance date. For all other Provisional Taxpayers, end-of-year tax is due on the 7th day of the month contained in the Eighth Schedule. We wish to thank Mr Jim Gordon, the New Zealand Society of Accountants' Taxation Director, for bringing this error to our attention. Accrual Determinations Recently Signed by the Commissioner The following two accrual determinations have been signed recently. Determination G5A: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes Determination G5A differs from determination G5 in that it allows an initial or final coupon payment to be ignored for the purpose of determining whether the coupon interest payments under the note are payable at regular intervals and are of equal amounts. The determination is reproduced in Appendix A to this TIB. Accrual Disclosure Exemption - D3 Exemption D3 is a general exemption from the re- quirements to disclose details of interrelated ar- rangements to the Commissioner. D3 exempts from disclosure all interrelated arrangements (the making of which is a generally accepted commercial practice) except for those interrelated arrangements that are referred to in the schedule to the exemption. A more detailed discussion of the exemption to- gether with a copy of the determinations is contained in Appendix B to this TIB. Goods and Services Tax on Fringe Benefits Introduction This item corrects an error in the Fringe Benefit Tax Guide - IR 409 (April 1989) and an omission in the GST Guide - GST 600 (September 1991). Fringe Benefit Tax Guide - IR 409 (April 1989) On page 57 of the FBT Guide, under the paragraph relating to “GST on Fringe Benefit”, a list of the types of fringe benefits not included for GST purposes is set out. This list includes “employer contributions to employee superannuation, sickness, accident, death benefit funds and life insurance policies”. Upon review of the list it became apparent that employer contributions to employee sickness, acci- dent, and death benefit funds do not fall within the exclusion list set out in s21(3A) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and are therefore subject to GST. Thus, fringe benefits in the form of employers' contributions to employee sickness, accident and death benefit funds should not be excluded when working out the GST on fringe benefits. Goods and Services Tax Guide - GST 600 (September 1991) There has been some confusion as to whether catego- ries “D” or “E” of the fringe benefit categories are to be included in the calculation of GST on fringe ben- efits. Some employers have maintained that as the proce- dure provided on page 91 of the GST Guide only refers to categories “A” and “C”, categories “D” and “E” are to be excluded in the calculation of GST on fringe benefits. The “procedure” provided on page 91 of the GST Guide was merely meant to be an example of the calculation method. Unfortunately, the term “proce- dure” rather than “example” was used, resulting in some confusion as to whether categories “D” and “E” are to be included in the calculation. Categories “D” and “E” should be included in the calculation of GST on fringe benefits where appropriate. 4 Deduction of Provision for Long Service Leave Taxation Review Authority Decision - Case M123 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,788 Comment Recent amendments have been made to section 104A to deal with the deductibility of monetary remunera- tion. One result of these changes is that the deduction of a provision made for long service leave, as claimed in the above case, is largely prevented. The changes affecting such deductions apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1990. An explanation of the amendments is on page 21 of TIB Volume Three No.1. The TRA’s decision in Case M123 was not appealed by the Department for administrative reasons. How- ever, we still consider the unanimous judgment of seven Australian High Court judges in Nilsen to be the more appropriate authority governing treatment of deductions of this nature. Another case involving a deduction claimed in respect of a provision made for long service leave is currently awaiting hearing by the High Court. Until this case is decided any deductions for provisions made for long service leave, claimed in income years prior to 1991, will continue to be disallowed. This is in line with the Department’s long-standing policy as set out in Tech- nical Rulings paragraph 20.50.4. Reference: 10.H.3.1 Introduction This item sets out Inland Revenue’s policy on the application of the above decision to other cases in- volving a deduction claimed for provision for long service leave. Background The taxpayer concerned was a company whose em- ployees’ entitlement to long service leave was gov- erned by a number of industrial awards. The tax- payer claimed a deduction for an amount in respect of long service leave which its employees had be- come entitled to but did not take during the year. The Commissioner disallowed the amount claimed on the grounds that it was not deductible until the year the leave was actually taken and payment made. The TRA, in deciding for the taxpayer, held that the liability for the expenditure had been “incurred” in the year the employees became entitled to the long service leave. In its decision the TRA elected to follow the decision of the Privy Council in the Hong Kong case of C of IR v Lo & Lo \[1984\] BTC 281 in preference to a number of other cases, notably the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd v FC of T 81 ATC 4031. Employment Status of Owner/Driver Carriers "Among other things, expenses that were deductible to the self-employed would not be deductible to employees. Also, there would be changes for the treatment of GST, PAYE deductions, Accident Compensation levies and Fringe Benefit Tax." However Mr Henry reassured owner/driver carri- ers that there would be no immediate tax changes. "We understand that the decision is to be appealed. When we have considered the outcome of the appeal we will let owner/drivers know what the tax conse- quences are. No matter what we do we will not seek any back taxes from these people if the appeal indi- cates that they are employees and we have accepted in the past that they are self-employed." " Inland Revenue made this Press Release on 30 No- vember 1991: "Owner/Driver Carriers Reassured Owner/driver carriers have been reassured that In- land Revenue will not be pursuing back taxes as a result of the recent Employment Tribunal decision indicating some may be employees. The Tribunal last week found that an owner/driver courier whose contract had been terminated was an employee and not self-employed. Commissioner of Inland Revenue David Henry said today that the tax consequences of that decision for those involved could be significant. Harbour Boards / Port Companies - Depreciation on Tugboats Background Harbour Boards were brought into the Income Tax system from 1 April 1987 by section 197D of the Income Tax Act 1976. Port Companies incorporated pursuant to the Port Companies Act 1988 are also liable to income tax. As these taxpayers have only recently been brought into the tax system, tugboats have not appeared in the Department’s schedule of approved depreciation rates. Ruling Tugboats may be depreciated at the rate of 10% diminishing value as from 1 April 1987. This includes the deck equipment and main engines on the vessel. Reference: H.O. 10.D.3.6F 5 Accrual Regime - Contingent and Non-Contingent Payments Relating to Financial Arrangements Summary This item deals with the accrual regime treatment of fees paid in relation to financial arrangements (sec- tions 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976). It discusses sections 64C, 64BA(2) and 64BA(3) of the Act. Background The accrual regime is intended to spread all costs of a financial arrangement over the term of that ar- rangement. This intention is achieved by - (a) Section 64C(1); and (b) The definition of acquisition price in section 64BA and its use in the base price adjustment or cash base price adjustment. Section 64C(1) determines the cash flows to be used for calculating income or expenditure over the term of an arrangement, using an accrual method (usually the yield to maturity method). The acquisition price of a financial arrangement is a component of the base price adjustment. The base price adjustment is calcu- lated when a financial arrangement matures, is sold or transferred. Costs associated with financial arrangements include amounts which are contingent on the implementa- tion of the financial arrangement (e.g., brokerage fees). In addition, non-contingent payments that exceed 2% of a financial arrangement's core acquisition price must also be spread. The core acquisition price is defined in section 64BA. Examples of non-contin- gent payments are legal fees which are payable whether or not the transaction proceeds, and non- refundable bank fees. Ruling Section 64C(1) of the Act determines the cash flows used to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred. All consideration provided to or by the person in relation to a financial arrangement must be included in those calculations. Consideration in- cludes payments made between the holder and the issuer (e.g., interest, bank fees) or between the holder or issuer and a third party (e.g., brokerage fees). The only exception to this rule is payments that do not depend on the financial arrangement going ahead. As long as these payments do not exceed 2% of the core acquisition price, they are excluded from ac- crual calculations. Non-contingent payments are those that must be paid regardless of whether the financial arrangement proceeds. Non-contingent payments may be deductible under section 136 or section 104 of the Act. Treatment of fees paid to third parties Fees relating to financial arrangements that are paid to a third party must be included in accrual calcula- tions. They are part of the consideration paid in relation to the financial arrangement. For example, if an amount is paid to an issuer's sharebroker for submitting applications for an issue of debenture stock, is it subject to the accruals regime? The answer is yes. As such payments relate to the financial arrangement and are contingent on its im- plementation, they must be accrued over the term of the arrangement in accordance with section 64C. This means that issuers can deduct the brokerage fees they have paid over the term of a financial arrange- ment if the total amount of expenditure incurred in any income year satisfies the deductibility criteria of section 106(1)(h). The recipient of the brokerage fees in this case is not a party to the financial arrangement. The fees will therefore be assessable in the income year in which they are derived. Holders can also deduct brokerage or other contin- gent fees paid over the term of a financial arrange- ment using the yield to maturity (or an alternative) method. Discussion Section 64C of the Act gives taxpayers a way of calculating income or expenditure from financial arrangements during the term of the arrangement. The principal method of accrual is the yield to matu- rity method. To apply the yield to maturity method the cash flows from the financial arrangement must be identified. Section 64C(1) Section 64C(1) identifies the relevant cash flows. It says that: “.. regard shall be had to the amount of all consid- eration provided to the person and by the person in relation to the financial arrangement..” Consideration is not defined in the Act. For the purposes of the accrual regime consideration means all benefits that are received or provided in relation to the financial arrangement. Consideration includes all amounts paid to or by a holder or issuer (e.g., interest, principal and fees). The deductibility or otherwise of the various amounts outside sections 64B to 64M of the Act is irrelevant. It is the net effect 6 (as reflected under section 64C or section 64F) of the benefits given and received that constitutes expendi- ture incurred or income derived. All such benefits provided or received must therefore be included in accrual calculations. The phrase “in relation to” covers payments between the parties to the financial arrangement or those made to third parties. The general rule is that all benefits provided or received in relation to financial arrangements are accrued. The one exception is stated in section 64C(1), which excludes from the accruals calcula- tion: “..the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) and (3) of this Act..” Item z is defined in section 64BA as the smaller of: (i) The amount of all consideration provided in relation to the financial arrangement by the issuer or holder, as the case may be, that is not contin- gent on the implementation of the financial ar- rangement: (ii) An amount equal to 2 per cent of the core acqui- sition price of the financial arrangement. Fees not contingent on the implementation of the financial arrangement are those fees payable regard- less of whether or not the arrangement proceeds. Non-contingent fees could include such things as legal fees, non-refundable application fees and valu- ation fees. These expenses may be deductible upfront under sections other than 64B to 64M, e.g., section 136 or section 104. Accrual Methods Sections 64BA and 64C(1) of the Act provide the framework for determining cash flows to be used for accrual calculations. Section 64C(2), (3), and (4) and determinations detail the accrual methods of ac- counting for income or expenditure for tax purposes. The primary method of accrual is the yield to matu- rity method. However, taxpayers may use alternative calculation methods. An alternative method must have regard to the principles of accrual accounting, conform with commercially acceptable practice, be consistently applied for financial reporting purposes and pro- duce a result that is not materially different from that obtained using the method set by determination. Inland Revenue stated in Public Information Bulletin 167, December 1987, that: ”..Any fee contingent upon the implementation of the financial arrangement must be included in the amortization calculation, except that where the result of dealing with it separately would not be materially different from including it, it is accept- able to deal with it separately..” Inland Revenue published its policy on materiality in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Three, No.1 of July 1991. Examples (1) A (the issuer) borrows 100 from B (the holder). The loan is repayable in instalments which total 100 plus interest. A pays an arrangement fee of 5 to C. C is in the business of introducing borrowers and lenders. This fee is payable if the loan pro- ceeds, and is therefore contingent on the imple- mentation of the financial arrangement. A, B and C are New Zealand taxpayers. (i)A’s total expenditure is the interest on the loan plus the arrangement fee of 5. This total expenditure is spread over the term of the loan using the yield to maturity method or an alternative. (ii) B’s total income derived is the interest re- ceived from A. This interest amount is spread over the term of the loan using the yield to maturity method or an alternative. (iii) C’s income is the arrangement fee of 5 which is assessable in the income year that it is derived. (2) A (the issuer) borrows 100 from B (the holder). The loan is repayable in instalments which total 100 plus interest. A pays an uplifting fee of 5 to B on the day the loan is advanced. A and B are New Zealand taxpayers. (i) A’s total expenditure is the interest on the loan plus the fee of 5. The amount is spread over the term of the loan using the yield to maturity method or an alternative. (ii) B’s total income is the interest on the loan plus the fee of 5 received from A. The amount is spread over the term of the loan using the yield to maturity method or an alternative.

Accrual T:145 Fringe Benefit Tax - Prescribed Rate of Interest The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low-interest loans has been reduced to 11.3 percent for the quarter commencing 1 October 1991. The rate for this quarter was previously 12.4 percent, but it has been reduced because of the fall in commercial interest rates. This new rate will also apply for the quarter commencing 1 January 1992 and following quar- ters, unless it is subsequently reviewed. 7 Due Dates Reminder December 1991 20 PAYE Tax Deductions for first 15 days of December 1991 due - "Large" employers only.

Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This determination rescinds and replaces Determi- nation G5: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes, made on 5 August 1987. Apart from minor amendments, this determination differs from Determination G5: Mandatory Conver- sion Convertible Notes only by expanding the Scope of the Determination. This amendment allows an initial or final coupon interest payment to be ignored for the purpose of determining whether the coupon interest payments under the note are payable at regular intervals and are of equal amounts. A mandatory conversion convertible note is a finan- cial instrument which is redeemable only in com- pany shares. Coupon interest may be payable on the note for the period between issue and redemption. This determination details the manner in which income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of a mandatory conversion convertible note is to be calculated. It also prescribes the method for calcu- lating the part of the income or expenditure that is attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) and (e) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination Except where its application is specifically excluded in another determination, this determination ap- plies to every mandatory conversion convertible note where - (a) Conversion is at a predetermined ratio into shares of a company; and (b) Coupon interest payments, if any, are payable at regular intervals of not more than twelve months and are either of equal amount or are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator: Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph, where, by reason only of - (i)The issue date of the convertible note: (ii)The conversion date of the convertible note - the condition set out in this paragraph is not met in respect of any coupon interest payment and the rate at which the payment is calculated is consistent with the other coupon interest pay- ments required under the convertible note, this determination shall apply as if the condition were met; and (c) The market value of the underlying shares at the date of issue of the note is not less than eighty percent of the acquisition price of the note on that date; and (d) The note is not part of another financial arrange- ment. 4. Principle A mandatory conversion convertible note is a hy- brid of debt and equity. It can be regarded alterna- tively as a loan with repayment in shares or as a forward purchase of shares. As a share is an ex- cepted financial arrangement (section 64B of the Act) it is necessary to arbitrarily separate the debt and equity components of the note. This determination treats all amounts in respect of a note other than the coupon interest payments as relating to the underlying shares. Income and ex- penditure in respect of the note is calculated by pro rata daily apportionment of the coupon interest payments to income years. Changes in market conditions may impact on the value of a note on a secondary market. Due to the difficulty in accurately attributing the effects of such market changes between the debt and equity com- ponents of the note it is assumed that any changes in value on a secondary market are due to the equity component. 5. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires - (a) Expressions used, except the expression “in- come year”, have the same meanings as in section 2 and section 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976: (b) “Coupon interest payment” means any amount payable on the note by the note issuer to the note holder other than payments relating to the re- demption or conversion of the note: (c) “Income year” means - (i) Where a taxpayer furnishes a return of in- come under section 15 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for an accounting year ending with a balance date other than the 31st day of March, the period of twelve months ending on that balance date; or (ii) In respect of any other person, the year in which the income has been derived by the person: 3 (d) “Mandatory conversion convertible note”, or “note”, means any debenture, bond, certificate, document, note, or writing issued or given by a company - (i) Evidencing, acknowledging , creating, or relating to a loan to the company or any money subscribed to the company or any other liability of the company, whether or not there is a charge over the undertaking or any of the assets of the company securing the whole or any part of the amount in respect of which the company has issued or given the note; and (ii) Providing, pursuant to a trust deed or other- wise, and whether exclusively or not, for that amount, with or without interest thereon and whether at par or otherwise, to be converted into, or to be redeemed or paid by the issue of, shares or stock in the capital of a company, where the conversion, redemption, or pay- ment by the issue of shares or stock is manda- tory. (e) “Underlying shares”, in relation to a note, means the shares or stock into which the note is convert- ible, or in which it may be redeemed or paid. 6. Method (1) The part of a mandatory conversion convertible note that is attributable to the underlying shares shall be - (a) In respect of income, gain or loss, or expendi- ture, and also in respect of consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer: all amounts other than coupon interest payments; (b) In respect of the acquisition price: the acqui- sition price of the note. (2) The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a mandatory conversion convertible note shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the coupon interest payments to income years pursuant to Determination GlA: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. 7. Example Example A On 13 September 1987 a convertible note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 12 percent payable semi-annually in arrears. The note is mandatorily convertible to ten shares in the issuing company on 13 September 1988. The market value of each share at issue date is $9 and by conversion date this has risen to $15. Both the issuer and holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination GlA on a 365 day basis. The coupon interest payments are made as follows: 13 March 1988$6.00 13 September 1988$6.00 (a) Year ended 31 March 1988 Coupon payment 13/3/88$6.00 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/9/88 There are 18 days between 13 March and 31 March 1988, and 184 days between 13 March and 13 September 1988 18/184 x $6.00 =$0.59 Income/Expenditure$6.59 (b) Year ended 31 March 1989 As the note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied using the following values: a (all consideration paid)=$12.00 b (acquisition price)=0 c (amounts in previous years) =$ 6.59 Income/Expenditure= a - (b + c) = $12.00 - (0 + $6.59) = $5.41 As all amounts other than the coupon payments are deemed to be attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and share market values can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the note an ac- quisition price of nil (for accrual purposes) hence the zero value of “b” in the above base price adjustment. Example B On 13 November 1991 a convertible note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 10 percent payable semi-annually in arrears with the exception of the first period which is of five months. The note is mandatorily convertible to ten shares in the issuing company on 13 October 1993. The market value of each share at issue date is $9 and by conversion date this has risen to $15. Both the issuer and holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination GlA on a 365 day basis. The coupon interest payments are made as follows: 13 April 1992$4.15 13 October 1992$5.00 13 April 1993$5.00 13 October 1993$5.00 (a) Year ended 31 March 1992 Apportionment of couponpayment 13/4/92 There are a total of 152 days in the first period. Of these 139 are in the year ended 31 March 1992. 4 TIB Appendix B Exemption D3: Exemption from the Requirements to Disclose Interrelated Arrangements under Section 64H(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 Overview of Exemption D3 1. Introduction The Commissioner has issued an exemption from the obligation to disclose interrelated arrangements under section 64H(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). This exemption, D3, applies to the income years commencing 1 April 1991 and 1 April 1992. The full text of the exemption is provided later in this Appendix. This item sets out the background to the exemption, and gives a description of its provisions. 2. Background (a) Section 64H(1) of the Act requires taxpayers to disclose details of interrelated arrangements to the Commissioner. (b) The Commissioner has power under section 64H(2) of the Act to exempt a person or class of persons from this disclosure obligation. Such an exemption can apply to particular financial ar- rangements or classes of financial arrangements where the making of that type of financial ar- rangement is a generally accepted commercial practice. (c) To date the Commissioner has issued two ex- emptions under section 64H(2). The first exemp- tion was for the income year commencing 1 April 1985 and the succeeding four years. The second exemption, D2, was for the income year com- mencing 1 April 1990. (d) These two exemptions exempted all taxpayers from the obligation to disclose an interrelated financial arrangement where: (i) the making of the interrelated arrangement was a generally accepted commercial prac- tice; and (ii) the interrelated arrangement was of a type specified in the schedules to the exemptions. (e) The Commissioner has issued a further exemp- tion, D3, which applies to the income years commencing 1 April 1991 and 1 April 1992. This exemption exempts all interrelated arrangements from disclosure where: (i) the making of the interrelated arrangement is a generally accepted commercial practice; and 139/152 x $4.15 = $3.80 Income/Expenditure$3.80 (b) Year ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/4/92 13/152 x $4.15=$0.35 Coupon payment 13/10/92$5.00 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/4/93 There are a total of 182 days in the period between payments. Of these 169 are in the year ended 31 March 1993. 169/182 x $5.00= $4.64 Income/Expenditure$9.99 (c) Year ended 31 March 1994 As the note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a D (b + c) is applied using the following values: a (all consideration paid)=$19.15 b (acquisition price)=0 c (amounts in previous years) =$13.79 Income/Expenditure= a - (b + c) = $19.15 - (0 + $13.79) = $5.36 As all amounts other than the coupon payments are deemed to be attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and share market values can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes) hence the zero value of “b” in the above base price adjustment. This determination is signed by me on the 7th day of November in the year 1991. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 5 (ii) the interrelated arrangement is not of a kind specified in the schedule to the exemption. 3. Exemption D3 The exemption, after defining various terms for the purposes of the exemption, then states that - Any person who in an income year is party to an interrelated arrangement shall be exempt from the requirements of section 64H(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of the interrelated arrangement and the income year where - (a) The making of the interrelated arrangement is a generally accepted commercial practice; and (b) The interrelated arrangement is not of a kind specified in the Schedule hereto. The important point to note is that the previous exemptions exempted from disclosure the interre- lated arrangements that were listed in the schedules to the exemptions. The new exemption takes the reverse approach. The new exemption exempts all interrelated arrangements from disclosure unless they are one of the types listed in the schedule to the exemption (or the making of the interrelated ar- rangement is not a generally accepted commercial practice). 4. Generally Accepted Commercial Practice It is important to note that the Commissioner has power to issue an exemption under section 64H(2) only in respect of a financial arrangement the mak- ing of which is a generally accepted commercial practice. It follows from this that any interrelated arrangement the making of which is not a generally accepted commercial practice must be disclosed, regardless of whether it is of a type referred to in the schedule to the exemption. In the Commissioner’s view tax avoidance is not a generally accepted commercial practice. Any inter- related arrangement that has a purpose or effect of tax avoidance must be disclosed under section 64H(1). 5. The Schedule to the Exemption The schedule to the exemption describes 5 catego- ries of interrelated arrangements that must be dis- closed. The wording of the schedule is set out below together with a discussion of the scope of each category. Residents and Non-residents Any interrelated arrangement where: a) The parties to one of the arrangements making up the interrelated arrangement include both a resi- dent of New Zealand and a non resident of New Zealand; b) The value of the interrelated arrangement ex- ceeds $2 million at any time in the income year; and c) The interrelated arrangement has a purpose other than only to achieve the exchange of a sum of money in one currency for an equivalent sum of money in another currency, such exchange not being subject to any agreement to reverse the exchange at some future date. Points to note in relation to this category are that - a) It does not apply to arrangements to exchange one currency for another (except where there is an arrangement to reverse the exchange at a later date). b) A person is a New Zealand resident for the purposes of the exemption in respect of an activ- ity or arrangement carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (see the interpre- tation section of the exemption). The term fixed establishment is defined in section 2 of the Act as being: in relation to any person, means a fixed place of business in which substantial business is carried on by that person; and includes- (a) A branch, factory, shop, or workshop in which in each case substantial business is carried on; and (b) A mine, quarry, oil well, or other place of natural resources subject to exploitation; and (c) An agricultural, pastoral, or forestry property;- but does not include- (d) The use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display, or delivery of goods or mer- chandise belonging to a business; or (e) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or for collecting information or for advertising for a business: For example A Co, an Australian company that operated through a branch in New Zealand, would have a fixed establishment in New Zealand. For the purposes of this exemption, A Co would therefore be deemed to be a resident of New Zealand in relation to any interrelated arrangement it entered into in respect of that fixed establishment. If A Co entered into an interrelated arrangement in respect of the fixed establishment with a New Zealand resident, the interrelated arrangement would be between two New Zealand residents and would not require disclosure. On the other hand if A Co entered into an interrelated arrangement in respect of the fixed establishment with B Co, another Aus- tralian company, that interrelated arrangement would be between a resident (A Co) and a non- resident (B Co) and would need to be disclosed. 6 c) A person is not a New Zealand resident for the purpose of the exemption in relation to an activ- ity or arrangement carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand. For exam- ple NZ Co, a New Zealand company which operated a manufacturing business in Australia, has a fixed establishment in Australia. NZ Co would therefore be a non-resident for the pur- poses of the exemption in respect of any interre- lated arrangement entered into in relation to that Australian fixed establishment. An interrelated arrangement between NZ Co and a non-resident in relation to the Australian manufacturing busi- ness would be an interrelated arrangement be- tween two non-residents and would not be sub- ject to disclosure. On the other hand an interre- lated arrangement between NZ Co and a New Zealand resident in relation to the Australian manufacturing business would be an interre- lated arrangement between a resident and a non- resident (NZ Co) and would be subject to disclo- sure. d) Only interrelated arrangements with a value in excess of $2 million at any time during the income year must be disclosed. The rules for valuing interrelated arrangements are set out in the Inter- pretation section of the Exemption. Perpetual Notes Any interrelated arrangement where one of the arrangements making up the interrelated arrange- ment is a perpetual note and the value of the interre- lated arrangement exceeds $2 million at any time in the income year. The following arrangement would fall into this cat- egory: a) A Co issued perpetual notes with a face value of $2.5 million to B Co. b) The perpetual notes pay coupon interest of 10% p.a. in arrears in perpetuity. c) B Co sold the right to receive interest from the perpetual notes for years 6 to infinity to C Co a subsidiary of A Co. Only interrelated arrangements with a value in ex- cess of $2 million at any time during the income year must be disclosed. The rules for valuing interrelated arrangements are set out in the Interpretation sec- tion of the Exemption. Preference Shares Any interrelated arrangement where: a) One of the arrangements making up the interre- lated arrangement is a share in a company which does not rank equally with the ordinary shares in the company in terms of voting rights and rights to distributions; and b) The value of the interrelated arrangement ex- ceeds $2 million at any time in the income year. The following arrangement would fall into this cat- egory: a) A Co lent $1 million to B Co for 5 years at 10% interest p.a. b) It was a term of the arrangement that B Co issue $1.1 million in redeemable preference shares to A Co. The shares were to be redeemed in 5 years and pay a fixed dividend of 12% p.a. Only interrelated arrangements with a value in ex- cess of $2 million at any time during the income year must be disclosed. The rules for valuing interrelated arrangements are set out in the Interpretation sec- tion of the Exemption. In the above example the value of the interrelated arrangement is found by adding the amount of the loan to the value of the redeemable preference shares. The value of the interrelated arrangement therefore exceeds $2 mil- lion and it must be disclosed. Related Pricing Any interrelated arrangement where - a) In respect of one of the arrangements (“the sub- arrangement”) making up the interrelated ar- rangement, the amount of consideration pro- vided or received by one of the parties under the sub-arrangement is influenced by the fact that the sub-arrangement is part of an interrelated ar- rangement; and b) The value of the interrelated arrangement ex- ceeds $2 million at any time in the income year: Provided that this provision shall not apply to an interrelated arrangement where the amount of con- sideration to be provided or received by one of the parties to the sub-arrangement is influenced only by the existence of a security arrangement as part of the interrelated arrangement. The following interrelated arrangement would fall into this category: a) Company A leased a building from company B for a term of 3 years for a rental of $200,000 p.a. A normal market rental for the premises would be $250,000 p.a. b) It was a term of the arrangement between the parties that Company A lend $2 million to Com- pany B at 7.5% interest for 3 years. The normal market rate of interest for a loan of the type in this arrangement would be 10% p.a. This interrelated arrangement requires disclosure under this category because the amount of consid- eration provided under the sub-arrangements is influenced by the fact that the sub-arrangements are part of the interrelated arrangement. The rental for the building (to be received by Company B) was set at $50,000 below a normal market rental because the interest on the loan (to be paid by Company B) was 7 $50,000 p.a. below the market rate. The pricing of one sub-arrangement was influenced by the pricing of the other sub-arrangement. The proviso to this category removes the need to disclose interrelated arrangements where the pric- ing of a sub-arrangement is influenced only by the existence of a security arrangement. For example, a lender may be prepared to lend money at 15% interest unsecured. On the other hand the same lender will lend money at 12% if the loan is secured by a mortgage given over a related party’s property. In this situation the loan and the mortgage make up an interrelated arrangement and the consideration that is paid under the loan is influenced by the existence of the interrelated arrangement. If the loan was not part of an interrelated arrangement (i.e., if the mortgage was not given) the interest rate would have been higher. The proviso makes it clear that this type of interrelated arrangement does not have to be disclosed. Large Arrangements Any interrelated arrangement with a value which exceeds $20 million at any time in the income year. The rules for valuing interrelated arrangements are set out in the Interpretation section of the Exemp- tion. If the value of the interrelated arrangement exceeds $20 million it must be disclosed. 6. Disclosure Return Where an interrelated arrangement is not exempted from disclosure by this exemption (i.e., it is one of the types of interrelated arrangements referred to in the schedule or the making of the interrelated ar- rangement is not a generally accepted commercial practice) details of it must be provided to the Com- missioner. These details are to be provided to the Commissioner on the prescribed Disclosure Return, the IR 4A. This return is to be filed together with the taxpayer’s annual income tax return.

Where an asset acquired for a non-taxable purpose is used for a taxable purpose, the registered person can make a deduction under s.21(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act to the ex- tent the asset is applied for the taxable purpose. In PIB 171 of March 1988 (paragraph 2.2.3) we stated that s.21(5) deductions could only be made where part of the residential dwelling had been set aside as an office. This statement has caused uncertainty be- cause it only allows s.21(5) deductions for farm house expenses (phone, electricity, etc.) where the regis- tered person sets aside an office. We have been asked to review paragraph 2.2.3, particularly the require- ment that an office must be set aside before s.21(5) deductions can be made for farm house expenses. Ruling An office does not have to be set aside before s.21(5) deductions can be made for farm house expenses. Where Inland Revenue has accepted for income tax purposes that a percentage of the phone, electricity, or farm house etc. is used in the farm business (and has allowed an income tax deduction to that extent), that percentage can also be used for GST purposes and s.21(5) deductions. This ruling reverses that in PIB 171 paragraph 2.2.3 and applies from 1 April 1992. Objections will be considered in terms of Inland Revenue’s policy on the acceptance of late objections. That policy is set out in TIB No.5 of November 1989. Example Inland Revenue accepts for income tax purposes that a farmer uses the phone (25%) and electricity (25%) in the farming business and an income tax deduction to that extent is allowed. The farmer has not actu- ally set aside an office and wants to know if those per- centages can be used for s.21(5) deductions for the phone and electricity. The farmer can use the 25% figure for the s.21(5) deductions for the phone and electricity. It does not matter that the farmer has not actually set aside an office. Reference: H.O. GST A.7.1F Technical Rulings 110.9.2.1 Discussion When farm land and a residential dwelling are sold in one transaction, we consider that the single trans- action can be “apportioned” or “divided” into two separate supplies for GST purposes. The first is the supply of farm land, and the second is the supply of the residential dwelling including land attached to the residential dwelling. This land is often referred to as “curtilage”. The supply of the farm land and the supply of the residential dwelling must then be considered inde- pendently to determine whether GST is charged by the vendor or an input tax credit can be claimed by the purchaser. The supply of farm land by a registered person will fall within the terms of s.8 of the GST Act. It will be subject to GST at 12.5 percent. The supply of a resi- dential dwelling (including curtilage) is not a supply “in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity” and will not be subject to GST. Whether a purchaser is permitted an input tax credit on acquisition of the farm land and residential dwell- ing depends on whether the farm land and/or the residential dwelling are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. As a general Background In PIB 171 of March 1988 we stated that when farm land and a residential dwelling are sold in the same transaction, GST is only charged only on the value of the farm land. GST is not charged on the value of the residential dwelling. We have recently been asked to confirm that policy. Ruling When a registered person sells farm land and a resi- dential dwelling in the same transaction, our view is that GST is only charged on the value of the farm land. GST is not charged on the value of the residen- tial dwelling. This confirms our earlier view set out in PIB 171. When a registered person purchases farm land and a residential dwelling, an input tax credit is allowed on the purchase of the farm land where it is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. That will usually be the case. An input tax credit is only allowable on the purchase of the residential dwelling where the dwelling is also acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. That will not usually be the case as the farm house will usually be acquired principally for a private or ex- empt purpose. 3 rule, the farm land will be acquired for the princi- pal purpose of making taxable supplies, and an in- put tax credit will be available to the purchaser. However, the residential dwelling will usually be acquired for a private or exempt purpose, so no in- put tax credit will usually be available to the pur- chaser. Valuation Where there are two supplies, one that is taxable and one that is non-taxable, GST is only charged on the taxable supply. No GST is charged on the non-tax- able supply. Each supply must therefore be sepa- rately valued for GST purposes so that GST is only charged on the taxable supply. We have discussed how separate supplies can be valued for GST purposes in PIB 171, and also in TIB Volume Two No.8 of April 1991. This method still applies. Reasons for the Approach We consider the transaction can be “apportioned” or “split” in the way first set out in PIB 171 and dis- cussed above for the following reasons: (1) The GST Act contemplates apportionment The GST Act contemplates apportionment. In particular s.10(18) contemplates that there are circumstances where a single transaction will be partly taxable and partly non-taxable. When this happens s.10(18) ensures that GST is only charged on that part of the consideration that is attributable to the taxable supply. GST is not charged on that part of the transaction that is non-taxable. (2) The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) Cases In Case M89 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,556 the vendor sold farm land to a purchaser for $170,000 “inclusive of GST if any”. The farm land had a residential dwell- ing and a cottage on it. The vendor attempted to zero rate the transaction as the sale of a going concern. However, Inland Revenue considered that the sale of the farm land was subject to GST at 12.5 percent. The TRA agreed. In deciding what amount was subject to GST, the TRA determined that it was not the entire purchase price ($170,000) that was subject to GST. Rather, that amount was to be reduced by the value of the dwell- ings on the farm land. The value of the two farm houses was $80,000. This meant that the value of the farm transaction for GST purposes was only $90,000. The valuation adopted in Case M89 supports our policy on farm houses. In Case M89 only the farm land was subject to GST. The farm houses were not. We further consider that Case M98 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,599 and Case N46 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,382 support our approach. (3) We adopt the same approach in other situations The most common example is the insurance indus- try and insurance policies that cover life (exempt) and fire and general (taxable) insurance. In such cir- cumstances GST is not charged on the life insurance part of the premium but is charged on that part of the premium relating to any other insurance (See PIB 168 of January 1988). Examples Example 1 A dry stock farmer (registered for GST) decides to sell bare farm land (farm land without stock). On the land there is a residential dwelling which the farmer has lived in. The farm land is valued at $135,000 and the dwelling (and curtilage) is valued at $85,000. The farmer wants to know whether GST should be charged on the transaction. GST Treatment The supply of the farm land is a taxable supply and GST (12.5 percent) must be charged on the value of the farm land ($135,000). The supply of the residen- tial dwelling (and curtilage) is a private sale and no GST is charged. Example 2 A hobby farmer (not a registered person for GST) sells bare farm land to a neighbour who is registered for GST as a farmer. On the farm land there is a resi- dential dwelling. The sale price is $235,000 with the residential dwelling (and curtilage) valued at $100,000 and the farm land valued at $135,000. The neighbour intends to use the farm land to run stock and will live in the residential dwelling. The pur- chaser wonders if a secondhand goods input tax credit can be claimed. GST Treatment Because the supplier is not a registered person no GST is charged on the transaction. The farm land is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (the farming business) and a secondhand goods input tax credit can be claimed of $15,000 (1/9 of $135,000). The residential dwelling (and curtilage) is not acquired for the prin- cipal purpose of making taxable supplies, so no secondhand input tax credit can be claimed. Example 3 A registered person (a dry stock farmer) sells a farm consisting of: 4 i. Farm land (valued at $150,000); ii. A residential dwelling (valued at $100,000); and iii. An orchard (valued at $200,000). The orchard is sold “lock, stock, and barrel” as a going concern. The vendor finds a purchaser (a registered person for GST) who is interested in buying the property with the intention of using the farm land in an already existing farming business. The purchaser also in- tends to continue the orcharding business. The par- ties agree the purchase price will be $450,000 “plus GST (if any)”. The vendor now wants to know whether GST should be charged on the transaction. GST Treatment The supply of the farm land is a taxable supply and GST (12.5 percent) must be charged on the value of that supply ($150,000). The supply of the residential dwelling is not subject to GST as it is not a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The supply of the orchard is the supply of a “taxable ac- tivity as a going concern” and is subject to GST at 0 percent. The vendor charges GST at 12.5 per cent on the $150,000 ($18,750) and GST at 0 per cent on $200,000 ($0). No GST is charged on the sale of the residen- tial dwelling. The purchaser can claim an input tax credit for the farm land only ($18,750). Reference:H.O. GST A.5.1F Technical Rulings Ch 110.9 Depreciation Rates Increase and Petroleum Mining Legislation This article is about the Government's announcement of 16 December 1991 regarding depreciation rates increase and petroleum mining legislation. These announcements are not yet law, but the nec- essary legislation will be passed by 31 March 1992. Depreciation Rates Increased The Government has announced the introduction of a 25% loading to be applied to current rates of depre- ciation. The following types of assets will qualify for the load- ing: • New depreciable assets (excluding buildings); • Imported second-hand assets (excluding motor cars); • Primary sector land improvements; and • Bloodstock used for horse breeding. All qualifying depreciable assets purchased and first used on or after 16 December 1991 and on or before 31 March 1993 will qualify for the loading. Assets subject to a binding contract of purchase en- tered into on or before 31 March 1993 and first used on or before 31 March 1994 will also qualify for the loading. Appendix A to this TIB contains more information about these changes. Petroleum Mining Legislation The Government has announced its intention to in- troduce new tax legislation affecting the petroleum mining sector. The legislation is intended to elimi- nate the current punitive tax treatment of petroleum exploration and development expenditure, both onshore and offshore. The new legislation will involve a restructuring of three key aspects of taxation that affect investment in the petroleum sector: exploration expenditure, development expenditure and farm-out arrange- ments. It will apply from 16 December 1991. Appendix B to this TIB contains detailed information about these changes. GST-The Supply of a Commercial Building as a Going Concern - New Threshold Background In TIB Volume One No.5 of November 1989, Inland Revenue provided guidelines on what is a going con- cern for GST purposes. We indicated in an example that the supply of a commercial building would be accepted as the supply of a going concern where the supplier had been letting it and 80 percent or more of the building continued to be tenanted at the time of supply. We have been asked to review the 80 per- cent threshold Discussion In Case M89 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,556 the Taxation Re- view Authority (TRA) discussed Inland Revenue’s 80 percent threshold. The TRA indicated it consid- ered a percentage of ”...far less than 80 percent could amount to the going concern of property letting”. In Case N38 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,322 the TRA held there was the transfer of a taxable activity of leasing car sale yards even though only 4 of 8 car yards compris- 5 ing the taxable activity were leased. Those 4 yards accounted for approximately 52 percent of the land devoted to the taxable activity. The remaining 48 percent comprised the 4 untenanted car yards. These cases indicate that if the issue was to be de- cided by the TRA, the TRA may well determine the supply of a commercial building could be the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern even though the building was less than 80 percent tenanted at the time of supply. Given the approach of the TRA, it is clear the 80 per- cent threshold is no longer an appropriate guideline of when the supply of a commercial building is the supply of a taxable activity as going concern. New Guideline Inland Revenue now accepts that where a commer- cial building is sold and at the time of supply 50 per- cent or more of the building is let, there is the sup- ply of a taxable activity as a going concern. The sup- ply is zero rated for GST purposes. We note the following: i.In establishing whether the new threshold is met the rentable floor area should be used; ii. The test must be applied at the time of supply. This is because the time of supply is the point in time at which the obligation to charge GST (if any) is imposed; and iii. The new threshold will apply from 1 April 1992. Objections will be considered in terms of Inland Revenue’s policy on the acceptance of late objec- tions. That policy is set out in TIB No.5 of No- vember 1989. Reason for Guideline Inland Revenue is aware that there is difficulty in determining when the supply of a commercial build- ing is the supply of a taxable activity as a going con- cern. By publishing a threshold we aim to provide certainty to registered persons. They can be certain that when a commercial building is sold and 50 per- cent or more (previously 80 percent or more) of the rentable floor area is let at the time of supply, we will accept the supply is zero rated for GST purposes. However, the new threshold is only an administra- tive guideline. It will be applied with discretion. This means that there may be situations where a commer- cial building can still be supplied as a taxable activ- ity as a going concern even though it is less than 50 percent tenanted at the time of supply.

GST Z.1.6F Technical Rulings Ch 107.9.2.1 Inland Revenue authorised to match Data with Social Welfare and Accident Compensation Corporation New Sections 13A and 13B of Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 Introduction The Inland Revenue Department Amendment (No.3) Act of 1991 introduced new sections 13A and 13B to the IRD Act, together with associated secrecy pro- visions. On 18 December 1991 (the date of Royal Assent to the amending Act) Inland Revenue was authorised to disclose certain taxpayer information to the Depart- ment of Social Welfare and the Accident Compensa- tion Corporation for matching purposes. The provi- sions are summarised below. Background The Government's Budget Night Policy Statement on Social Assistance, Welfare that Works, announced that employers would be required to inform Inland Rev- enue of their employees' start and finish dates, where these occurred on or after 1 April 1992. As part of budget night legislation, the Inland Rev- enue Department Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 au- thorised Inland Revenue to disclose information to Social Welfare for community services card pur- poses. The information to be disclosed was: • the names and addresses of taxpayers receiving Family Support Tax Credits • the number of children to which that credit re- lated • the amount of that credit. This authority commenced on 1 August 1991. This provision applied only to particulars from the income year ending 31 March 1991. This limited supply of information is made so Social Welfare and Accident Compensation can match it with their own beneficiary information. Where that matching indicates an apparent discrepancy, Social Welfare and Accident Compensation must undertake further investigation or verification before taking any adverse action against the beneficiary client. The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 repealed these provisions and re-enacted them with slightly expanded scope. It also extended the income years to which the provisions apply up to the year ending 31 March 1994. This is the current proposed date for Inland Revenue to hand adminis- tration of Family Support over to Social Welfare. 6 Data matching undertaken by Inland Revenue with Social Welfare and Accident Compensation is subject to the scrutiny of the Privacy Commissioner in terms of authorities given by the Privacy Commissioner Act 1991. Key Issues The purpose of section 13A is to facilitate the ex- change of certain specified information between In- land Revenue and Social Welfare and Accident Com- pensation for the purposes of verifying - (a) the entitlement or eligibility of any person for any benefit or earnings related compensation; or (b) the amount of any benefit or earnings related compensation which any person is (or was) enti- tled to or eligible for. Subsection (5) permits Inland Revenue to cause a comparison of beneficiary information held by Social Welfare or Accident Compensation to be made with any information held by Inland Revenue about that beneficiary. Subsection (6) provides that where the result of such a comparison indicates that any person- (a) receives a benefit and any other income at the same time; or (b) receives earnings related compensation and any other income (including self-employment) at the same time - Inland Revenue may supply to any authorised officer of Social Welfare or Accident Compensation all or any of the following information that it holds about that person: (a) where the person is, or was, employed while receiving any benefit or earnings related compen- sation, - (i) the date or dates on which that employment commenced: (ii) where applicable, the date or dates on which that employment ceased: (iii) the name and business address of each of the person's employers. (b) details of any other income that a person receives (received) while also receiving any benefit or earn- ings related compensation, if that other income would affect the person's benefit or compensation entitlement or eligibility. Subsection (8) provides that where the result of any comparison indicates that any person who applies for any benefit or earnings related compensation is re- ceiving income from any source, and that income may affect the eligibility for that benefit or earnings related compensation, Inland Revenue may supply details of that income to Social Welfare or Accident Compensation. In its new form, section 13B was enacted to facilitate the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and Social Welfare - (a) so Social Welfare can issue entitlement cards (as defined in section 132A of the Social Security Act 1964); and (b) for verifying any cardholder's entitlement or eli- gibility for an entitlement card. Under this section, at any time before 31 March 1994 Inland Revenue may supply to Social Welfare the following information from its records about Family Support Tax Credits for the year commencing 1 April 1990, or any subsequent year: (a) the names and addresses of people receiving Fam- ily Support Tax Credit; and (b) the IRD number of each person receiving Family Support; and (c) the amount of Family Support; and (e) whether the Family Support is a full credit or a partial credit. For these purposes, Inland Revenue is authorised to compare information supplied by Social Welfare with that held by Inland Revenue. "Entitlement card" is defined by section 132A of the Social Security Act to include all types of community service cards currently distributed by Social Welfare. The secrecy obligations imposed on all recipients of taxpayer information by section 13 of the Inland Rev- enue Department Act 1974 are extended to those of- ficers of Social Welfare and Accident Compensation who possess any information received from Inland Revenue's data. Application Date The disclosures authorised by sections 13A and 13B may be made at the Commissioner's discretion at any time between 18 December 1991 and 31 March 1994. 7 Gaming Machine Duty and Casino Duty Legislation enacted Gaming Duties Amendment Act 1991 Introduction The Gaming Duties Amendment Act 1991 inserts into the Gaming Duties Act 1971 two new parts to impose and collect a gaming machine duty and casino duty. A duty on gaming machine profits applies from 1 March 1992, at the rate of 20 percent. The duty ap- plies to all gaming machines owned by about 2,050 gaming machine operators currently licensed under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. A duty on the casino win of casino operators applies from 20 December 1991. This duty will initially ap- ply to just two casino operators, licensed under the Casino Control Act, expected to be operating in a year or two. Background At present, the Lotteries Commission, racing clubs and the Totalisator Agency Board pay duty on their gaming turnover. Until now, gaming machine op- erators have not been subject to duty. The new gam- ing machine duty removes this inconsistency. The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for regulatory functions such as the licensing of gaming machine operators. It is also responsible for conduct- ing random audits of gaming machine operators. The Inland Revenue Department is responsible for collecting gaming machine duty. Similar arrange- ments exist for both lottery and totalisator duty. The Casino Control Authority is responsible for the regulatory functions relating to casino operators. Inland Revenue is also responsible for collecting the casino duty. Imposition of Gaming Machine Duty Duty is imposed at the rate of 20 percent on the gam- ing machine profits of dutiable games played by means of gaming machines on or after 1 March 1992. A gaming machine is a machine used to play any game of chance, instant game lottery, or prize com- petition. Explicitly excluded are machines used as a means of drawing a lottery such as Lotto or select- ing numbers in a game of Housie. Also excluded are machines used merely to dispense tickets in a prize competition, such as "Avago" cards. "Gaming ma- chine profits" is a defined term in the legislation, equating to the operator's gross margin from games played on machines. Imposition of casino duty Duty is imposed at the rate of 4 percent on the "casino win" across all authorised games played in casinos. The casino win is a defined term, similar to gaming machine profits and equating to the casino operator's gross margin on games played. There is provision for a carry-forward of any losses against profits in ensuing months. Returns and payment of duty Gaming machine operators must deliver a monthly return of the gaming machine profits of all gaming machines and the duty payable on those gaming machine profits. A gaming machine operator is: • A society licensed under the Gaming and Lotter- ies Act 1977 to operate gaming machines; or • Any other person who operates a gaming machine otherwise than pursuant to a licence issued under the Gaming and Lotteries Act. This is to ensure that unlicensed operators are subject to duty on their gaming machine profits. Casino operators are exempt from the gaming ma- chine duty on their gaming machine profits. Instead, casino operators pay casino duty on their gross mar- gin across all authorised games. Casino operators must also deliver a monthly return of their casino win and casino duty payable on that win. The returns and payments for both gaming machine duty and casino duty are due on the 20th of the month following the month to which the return re- lates. For example, the return and payment of duty for March are due on 20 April. Where a gaming machine operator or casino opera- tor has had its licence cancelled or its renewal re- fused, the return and duty payable are due seven days after the cancellation of the licence or the refusal to renew. In these circumstances, the return period begins on the first day of the month in which the can- cellation or refusal to renew occurred and ends on the day after the cancellation or refusal. The Department of Internal Affairs will advise Inland Revenue of the cancellation or refusal to renew. Penalty interest on unpaid duty Penalty interest at the rate of 5 percent a month or part of a month is payable on unpaid gaming ma- chine duty and casino duty from the due date and is recoverable as if that interest were duty payable. Any interest charged is not subject to any remission. Interest will not be charged on any amount of duty unpaid (deferrable duty) which is subject to an ob- jection. Assessments and objection procedures Generally, the filing of returns and the payment of duty will be on a self-assessment basis. However, 8 Inland Revenue has the ability to issue assessments in certain circumstances. These circumstances are: · A person defaults in delivering a return; · Inland Revenue is not satisfied with a return; · Inland Revenue is not satisfied that the amount of the duty calculated as payable by the person is the correct amount; or · Inland Revenue believes that a person, although that person has not delivered a return, is liable to pay duty. Where a return has been delivered, Inland Revenue may not issue an assessment or an amended assess- ment after the expiration of four years from the end of the month in which the return was delivered or the assessment made. This time limit is waived where Inland Revenue believes that a person has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make full and true disclo- sures of the facts necessary to determine the amount of duty payable. If Inland Revenue issues an assessment , it may be objected to in the same manner as is available for GST assessments, and may be referred to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. Interest is pay- able on duty in dispute (refundable) and deferrable duty (payable) in the same way as for GST and in- come tax respectively. Recovery of duty Gaming machine duty and casino duty, along with unpaid duty and interest payable, are recoverable as a debt to the Crown. In the case of gaming machine operators, it consti- tutes a debt due and payable, jointly and severally, by: · for an incorporated gaming machine operator, all persons who, at any time during the return period, were officers, trustees, or other persons acting in the management of the gaming machine operator such as the secretary and treasurer. · for an unincorporated gaming machine operator, all persons who, at any time during the return period, were members, officers, or trustees of the gaming machine operator. Unpaid duty will rank in bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership, without limitation of amount, as a preferential claim. It will have the same priority as PAYE and GST. Inland Revenue can serve a written notice on a third party to deduct a specified sum from any amount payable or to become payable to a defaulting gam- ing machine operator, casino operator or any person who has defaulted in the payment of duty. Every amount deducted must be paid to Inland Revenue within the time specified in the notice. Where an amount has been deducted but not paid to Inland Revenue , the amount deducted is recoverable from the person making the deduction as if the deduction were duty payable by that person. Offences Penalties for offences will be as follows: • A fine of up to $200 for failing to deliver a return by the due date; • A fine of up to $1,000 for willfully or negligently giving false information; • A fine of up tp $500 for not making a deduction from a payment owing to a gaming machine opera- tor or casino operator and paying that deduction to Inland Revenue. Refund of duty and interest paid in er- ror or in excess Gaming machine operators and casino operators are entitled to a refund of any duty and interest paid in excess or in error. Before a refund is made, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the duty was paid in error or excess. Applications for such refunds must be made within eight years from the month of over- payment. Exchange of information The Department of Internal Affairs and the Inland Revenue Department will have the ability to ex- change information for the purposes of administer- ing gaming machine duty and casino duty legislation. The type of information that will be exchanged is: • The names and addresses of societies licensed un- der the Gaming and Lotteries Act to operate gam- ing machines; • Details of licenses cancelled or not renewed; • Details of under-declared gaming machine profits identified during random audit activities; and • Details of casino operators' gross margins from authorised games, along with anything uncovered during audit activities. Application date The general application date of the gaming duty leg- islation is 1 March 1992. The application date of the casino duty is 20 Decem- ber 1991. 9 GST and Cheque Clearance Fees There is some confusion about Inland Revenue’s policy on the GST treatment of cheque clearance fees. Inland Revenue’s policy on this matter is set out in PIB 148 (May 1986), at Question 23 on page 8. It states: “Cheque clearance fees charged by banks to their customers are charges for financial services, therefore these fees are exempt from GST. However, when a retailer, e.g. supermarket, charges a fee to customers making payments by cheque, the fee is not a charge for financial serv- ices and GST must be accounted for on these fees.” The reason for this is that the charge made by a re- tailer for cheque clearance fees is simply a charge to cover the retailer's costs in accepting the cheque as a form of payment. The retailer does not supply finan- cial services for the charge made to the customer. Section 3(1)(b) of the GST Act makes reference to “payment and collection” of a cheque. This may have caused some confusion on the matter. However, these are legal terms when they refer to cheques. They apply to the receipt of a cheque by a bank and its presentation as agent for the customer to the bank upon which the cheque is drawn (collec- tion), and the clearing of the cheque by the second bank (payment). The retailer's charge does not come within the defi- nition of financial services in section 3 of the GST Act, so it does not qualify for the exemption in section 14 of that Act. As a result, the retailer's charge is for a supply of services, and is taxable in the normal way. A recent case which highlights some of the principles applied in this policy is Commissioner of Inland Rev- enue v Databank Systems Limited Reference: Technical Rulings, Ch 104.6.3.2. H.O. GST.E.3.2 FBT - Prescribed Rate of Interest for Quarter commencing 1 January 1992 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest loans has been lowered to 10.50 percent for the quarter which com- menced on 1 January 1992. The rate for this quarter had previously been set at 11.30 percent, but the rates have continued to fall and the new figure of 10.50 percent reflects the current average first mortgage interest rate from all major lenders. The new rate will continue to apply for the quarter commencing 1 April 1992 and subsequent quarters until further amended. As usual, we will be review- ing the rate again in May to check whether it still reflects the market rates during that quarter. The rate was changed by the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1985, Amendment No. 12, which were made by Order in Council on 24 February 1992. We have again made use of the 1991 amendment which allows the pre- scribed rate to be reduced during the quarter. Farm Fertiliser purchased before Balance Date Introduction We have been asked to clarify when farmers may claim a deduction for fertiliser purchased prior to balance date but applied to the land after that date. Background For a variety of reasons farmers often purchase bulk fertiliser before their annual balance date in order to claim a deduction in the income year of purchase. Sometimes the farmers pay for the fertiliser but the fertiliser remains at the vendor company’s premises. In other instances the fertiliser is delivered to the farm but not spread until after balance date. The deduction of the expense could be affected by the “accrual rules” under section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act). Accrual Implications Section 104A requires that the deduction for the pay- ment of goods and services not used in the produc- tion of income in an income year be deferred until those goods or services are used in producing assess- able income. In the situations mentioned above the deduction of the pre-purchase of fertiliser will be deferred until after balance date if the fertiliser has been paid for but not applied to the land. While the fertiliser is sitting in the vendor’s store or sitting in the farmer’s storage bin it is “not used in the produc- tion of assessable income”. There are exemptions to the above rule. Under Determination E7, for the year commencing 1 April 1991, a taxpayer does not have to comply with the accrual expenditure treatment where the unexpired portion of expenditure on “consumable aids” at bal- 10 ance date is $58,000or less. Fertiliser is a “consum- able aid” along with other farm expenditure items such as fuel, hay, chemicals etc. Where the total unexpired portion of expenditure on consumable aids at balance date is $58,000 or less there is no need for farmers to comply with section 104A. The pre- purchase of fertiliser can be claimed as a deduction in the year the expenditure is incurred. Where the unexpired portion of expenditure is more than $58,000 the accrual expenditure rules will apply. Use of the Income Equalisation Scheme The income equalisation scheme is designed to even out fluctuations in farm income. Deposits to the scheme are deductible for income tax purposes in the year of deposit. The deposits are assessable income when they are withdrawn. Generally, deposits must be left in the scheme for a period of 12 months for the benefits to apply. There is provision in the scheme for Inland Revenue to make early refunds where a farming business is af- fected by an adverse event. Inland Revenue can also make early refunds in “any other case or class of case”. Where, for a particular reason, a farmer has diffi- culty in applying fertiliser to the land before balance date we will accept deposits to the scheme at balance date. The refund of these deposits can be made when the fertiliser has been purchased and applied to the land. To qualify for this concession the deposit must be made within two weeks after balance date. The de- posit must be accompanied by a letter explaining the reason why the fertiliser cannot be purchased or ap- plied. Reasons could include the condition of the land due to flood or drought, the lack of fertiliser or the unavailability of a top dressing contractor. Re- funds of these deposits will be made when the ferti- liser has been applied. Farmers must send the in- voices from the fertiliser company and the top dress- ing contractor with the application for a refund of the deposits made. In cases where the deposit is greater than the ferti- liser and application costs incurred the farmer has the option of: • leaving the balance in the income equalisation account and withdrawing it after the 12 month period. The amount would then be assessable in the year of withdrawal, or • withdrawing the balance at the time of with- drawal of the expenditure incurred and having that balance treated as assessable income in the tax year of deposit. Reference:H.O. 10.F.1.5 Technical Rulings Ch 19, Part 4, 22.5 Opossums removed from Withholding Payments Regime Sellers of opossums are no longer subject to the With- holding Payments regime, although they are still li- able for income tax on the net income or profit they derive from opossum trapping activities. The Government considered the amendment to the Regulations simplified compliance for both trappers and the purchasers of opossum skins. They felt it was important to eliminate any possible disincentive to opossum trapping, in order to help contain the seri- ous threat that bovine tuberculosis poses to New Zealand’s beef export trade. This change was made by the Income Tax (Withhold- ing Payments) Regulations 1979, Amendment No 9, and took effect from 16 January 1992. Skin buyers should note that they are still required to keep records in order to substantiate their claims for deductions. The requirement that details of sell- ers be recorded in sufficient detail to enable them to be readily identified is set out in section 428(2)(c)(i). Sphagnum Moss Pickers included in Withholding Payments Regime From 1 April 1992 payments made to sphagnum moss pickers will be subject to a withholding tax of 25 cents in the dollar. The change was made by the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, Amendment No. 10. Buyers of sphagnum moss will be required to deduct withholding tax from payments made to sphagnum moss pickers. The withholding tax must be deducted at the rate of 25 cents in the dollar. If the sphagnum moss picker does not give the buyer a signed IR 13, the buyer must deduct withholding tax at the no- declaration rate, which in this case is 40 cents in the dollar. 11 The IR 10 and Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Background The IR 10 is an integral part of Inland Revenue's E-File system. We use it for providing information to the Statistics Department and to build up data for audit case selection. Accountants and taxpayers who file returns manu- ally (i.e., who don't use E-File) may either send in an IR 10 or a set of financial statements with tax returns. However, we are encouraging accountants to use both the E-File system and the IR 10. The New Zealand Society of Accountants has raised concerns about the IR 10. Specifically, there is a lack of information disclosure when using an IR 10 com- pared with the information disclosed in the financial statements. This could affect how Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies to reassessments after the four year time limit has passed. Problem 1. Income shown in statements, but not in IR 10 A taxpayer who filed an IR 10 instead of financial statements may be disadvantaged if an audit/inves- tigation of back year returns reveals a discrepancy. If such a discrepancy is in an item that is recorded in the financial statements (obtained during the audit/ investigation), but which did not need to be recorded on the IR 10, section 25(2) could be used to reopen the statue barred assessment with the argument that full disclosure was not given in the return for that particular item. This problem does not exist when financial state- ments are filed with the tax return. If a reassessment is not issued for the item before the four year time limit has passed, then Inland Revenue is statute barred from re-opening that assessment because full disclosure was made to Inland Revenue with the re- turn. 2. All Mention of Income Omitted The details of income to be recorded on the IR 10 do not cover all income sources. Two situations can occur where there will be omission of income when filing a return (either manually or through the E-File system) with an IR 10. a) If an item of assessable income did not have to be recorded on the IR 10, but has been recorded in the financial statements. b) The income is omitted completely from the finan- cial statements, and is not included when calcu- lating taxable income. Policy Inland Revenue will be applying the following policy when auditing/investigating back year returns which were filed with an IR 10: If an audit/investigation reveals an item incorrectly recorded in the financial statements which is deemed to be either assessable income or non-deductible ex- penditure, but which did not have to be so recorded on the IR 10, then - • If no conclusive evidence is held to prove a fraudu- lent or wilful misleading by the taxpayer, no stat- ute-barred back year assessment will be re-opened under section 25(2). • If there is conclusive evidence that a taxpayer in- tended to fraudulently or wilfully mislead, then section 25(2) will be applied to re-open statute- barred assessments. If an audit/investigation reveals an omission of in- come then - • If the omission is because disclosure was not re- quired on an IR 10, (but the income was recorded in the financial statements which were not filed with Inland Revenue), then this will not be a rea- son for re-opening a statute-barred assessment. • If the income was omitted from the financial state- ments then section 25(2) may be applied to re-open a statute barred assessment. Summary The IR 10 is a means of providing important infor- mation to our Department and to the Statistics De- partment. We acknowledge the concerns raised by the New Zealand Society of Accountants and have introduced the above policy for auditing/investigat- ing back year returns which are filed with an IR 10. 12 Due Dates Reminder April 5 PAYE deductions for last 16 days of March due - "large" employers only. 7 First instalment of 1993 provisional tax due for taxpayers with December balance dates.

1 Appendix A: Depreciation Rates Increase This announcement is not yet law, but the necessary legislation will be passed by 31 March 1992. On 16 December 1991 the Government announced the introduction of a 25% loading to be applied to current rates of depreciation. The following types of assets will qualify for the loading: • New depreciable assets (excluding buildings); • Imported second-hand assets (excluding motor cars); • Primary sector land improvements; and • Bloodstock used for horse breeding. When the scheme will apply All qualifying depreciable assets purchased and first used on or after 16 December 1991 and on or before 31 March 1993 will qualify for the loading. Assets subject to a binding contract of purchase en- tered into on or before 31 March 1993 and first used on or before 31 March 1994 will also qualify for the loading. Depreciation of plant and equipment The depreciation deduction will be calculated at one and a quarter (125%) times the rate published by the Commissioner in the Depreciation booklet (IR 260) issued May 1991 for that particular class of asset. Example: A taxpayer who has a 31 March balance date enters into a contract on 17 December 1991 to buy a new truck valued at $100,000, which is deliv- ered on 3 April 1992 and first used on 6 April 1992. According to the schedule of depreciation rates, the rate for a truck is 20% D.V. (diminishing value basis). The depreciation rate is subject to the loading of 25% which brings the rate to be used up to 25% D.V. The taxpayer is entitled to claim $25,000 for the income tax year ended 31 March 1993. For the 1994 income tax year the taxpayer could claim $18,750. If the taxpayer were to be allowed only the current 20% rate of depreciation the deductions would amount to $20,000 for 1993 and $16,000 for 1994. Asset Ownership The taxpayer will be entitled to claim deductions on the qualifying asset at the loaded rate in every in- come year that the asset is owned by that taxpayer. On any change of ownership the asset will cease to be classed as new and therefore the depreciation rate to be used for that particular asset will revert to the Commissioner's rate in existence at that time. The loaded rate will not be available for assets for which contracts to purchase are entered into after midnight on 31 March 1993. Assets acquired under Specified Leases The loaded rate may be applied to assets first used before midnight on 31 March 1994 pursuant to a specified lease (as defined in section 222A(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. For leased assets first used by the lessee between midnight 31 March 1993 and midnight 31 March 1994 the lessor must have en- tered into a contract to purchase the asset prior to midnight 31 March 1993. Administration The depreciation regime will continue to be admin- istered by the Commissioner as in the past. For ex- ample, a taxpayer will be able to claim a full 12 months' depreciation on any asset purchased and first used at least six months prior to the taxpayer's balance date. If the asset is purchased and first used within six months of balance date, a full six months of depreciation may be claimed. Example: A taxpayer who has a 30 June balance date en- ters into a contract on 17 December 1991 to buy a truck valued at $100,000. The truck is delivered on 3 April 1992 and first used on 6 April 1992. The current depreciation rate for a truck is 20% D.V., which multiplied by one and a quarter is 25% D.V. The taxpayer is entitled to claim $12,500 for the 1992 income tax year and will be entitled to claim $21,875 for the 1993 income tax year. TIB Appendices Volume Three, No. 5March 1992 2 Special Rates Where an asset is not listed in the Commissioner's published schedule, or if the asset is expected to wear out faster than is indicated on the schedule, a taxpayer may make a submission to the Inland Rev- enue Department to request that a rate be set. Depreciation of Fruit Trees and Vines Fruit trees and vines planted on or after 16 Decem- ber 1991 will qualify for the interim 25 percent load- ing. At the same time their treatment will be brought into line with that of other assets. A provision al- lowing scrapping of fruit trees and vines will be in- troduced, as will one allowing fruit trees and vines to be depreciated on a straight line basis, should a taxpayer so wish. Depreciations of Stallions and Mares Stallions and mares which stand at stud on or after 16 December 1991 will qualify for the 25 percent ex- tra loading. Treatment of Primary Sector Assets The Thirteenth Schedule of the Income Tax Act 1976 lists assets which can generally be described as im- provements to land, such as dams and stopbanks. Taxpayers who create, or buy these assets new, on or after 16 December 1991 will qualify for the 25% loading on those assets. Thirteenth Schedule assets will be brought under the general depreciation pro- visions from 1 April 1993, except for fruit trees and vines, for which the treatment changes on 16 De- cember 1991. Economic Rates The Commissioner is currently reviewing all tax de- preciation rates with a view to establishing base rates which are more closely aligned to economic rates of depreciation. It is proposed that industry and inter- ested parties will be widely consulted during this review in 1992. Depreciation: Questions and Answers 1.What assets will qualify for the 25% loading? .All new depreciable assets excluding buildings. .Second-hand imported assets excluding motor- cars and buildings. 2.How will the 25% loading apply? The schedule of current rates and special rates approved by the Commissioner will be increased by 25%. Common rates will increase as follows: 3.Over what period will the 25% loading apply? All qualifying assets purchased and first used between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) will receive the 25% loading. All qualifying assets for which a binding purchase contract was entered into between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) will qualify for the 25% loading, provided that the asset is first used on or before 31 March 1994. 4.Does that asset have to be physically used in NZ? No. The asset must, however, be used in the production of New Zealand assessable income.

In accordance with the current policy where an asset is employed for less than 6 months in an income year, a half year's depreciation may be claimed. Where the asset is employed for 6 months or more a full year's claim may be made. 6.Has legislation giving effect to the regime been passed? No. Legislation has yet to be introduced but will be passed by 31 March 1992. 7.Does the 25% depreciation loading apply on top of the 2 and 3 shift allowance rates? Yes. The loading applies to all rates approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 8.What is happening to the current review of economic rates of depreciation? This review is continuing and will be completed by 31 March 1993. 9.What happens to depreciation rates after 31 March 1993? . For assets purchased prior to 16 December 1991: The current rates of depreciation applying to all depreciable assets owned prior to the date of an- nouncement will continue to apply for as long as they remain in the ownership of the taxpayer. . For assets purchased on or after 16 December 1991 and before 31 March 1993: The loading of 25% will continue to apply to qualifying assets for as long as they remain in the ownership of the taxpayer. . For assets purchased after 31 March 1993: The rates applying to assets purchased and used after 31 March 1993 will be determined by the economic rates review currently being under- taken plus any loading to be determined. 10.What happens when I sell an asset to which the load- ing applies? The current rules relating to ordinary deprecia- tion will apply. Depreciation will be recovered on sale. 11.If I sell an asset to which the loading applies will the purchaser be able to use the loading? No. The purchaser must revert to the ordinary rates in existence at the time of sale. Bloodstock Depreciation: Questions and Answers 1.Do the stallions I currently have at stud qualify for the loading? No. 2.What stallions qualify for the loading? Two criteria must be met by a stallion before it qualifies for the loading. One, it must not have been depreciated prior to 16 December. Sec- ondly, where the stallion qualifies for deprecia- tion on or after 16 December, the loading ceases if the stallion is sold. So any subsequent owners of that stallion do not qualify. 3.If I import a stallion does it qualify for the loading? If the stallion has not previously being depreci- ated under New Zealand's Income Tax Act pro- visions, it will qualify. 4.What happens if I purchase a stallion from someone who has used that stallion for breeding purposes? You do not qualify for the loading as the stallion previously was depreciated by another person. 5.Do mares qualify for the loading? Yes, the same qualification criteria apply to mares. 6.If a stallion I own qualifies for the loading, what de- preciation rate applies? There are two different rates you may apply. You may depreciate the stallion using the straight line method of accounting or the diminishing value method. 7.What is the straight line rate? 25 percent per annum. 8.What is the diminishing value rate? 37.5 percent per annum. Fruit Trees and Vines: Questions and Answers 1.Will my existing fruit trees and vines qualify for the loading? No, but any trees you plant on or after 16 Decem- ber will qualify for the loading, if they aren't deductible. 2.What trees and vines will qualify as being deductible? A tree planted to replace an individual tree - for example, one which is dying. 3.When I scrap a number old trees to make way for new trees will I be able to write off the book value of those old trees? Yes, if those trees are scrapped on or after 16 De- cember. 4.What is the current rate of depreciation on trees and vines? 10% diminishing value. 5.Will the depreciation rates applying to fruit trees and vines be included in the Commissioner's economic rates review? Yes. It is likely that different depreciation rates will be set for different types of fruit tree and vine. 4 Appendix B: Petroleum Mining Legislation The Government has announced its intention to in- troduce new tax legislation affecting the petroleum mining sector. The legislation is intended to elimi- nate the current punitive tax treatment of petroleum exploration and development expenditures, both onshore and offshore. The new legislation will involve a restructuring of three key aspects of taxation that affect investment in the petroleum sector: exploration expenditures, development expenditures and farm-out arrange- ments. Exploration expenditures Exploration will be deductible in the year incurred. Development expenditures Expenditure will be capitalised and depreciated over seven years, starting from: • the first year of commercial production for on- shore projects; and • the year the expenditure is incurred for offshore projects. Farm-out arrangements Exploration expenditure incurred as the result of a farm-out arrangement (where a licence or licence share is transferred for work done in the licence): • will not be assessable in the hands of the farm-out party; and • will be treated as exploration expenditure in the hands of the farm-in party. There will be a general anti-avoidance provision to ensure that farm-out arrangements are not seen as a means of transferring losses. Joint ventures A petroleum joint venture is not to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes. Legislation The regime will be effective from 16 December 1991. The necessary legislation will be passed by 31 March 1992.

Taxation Reform Bill (No.4) The Taxation Reform Bill (No 4) covered a wide range of issues and gave effect to a series of changes that are predominantly procedural or administrative in nature. The bill was introduced into Parliament on 19 December 1991, and the resulting acts received royal assent on 13 March 1992. Upon passage, the bill was divided into separate acts: • Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 • GST Amendment Act 1992 • Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1992 • Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1992 • Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1992 • Child Support Amendment Act 1992 • Accident Compensation Amendment Act 1992. Unless otherwise indicated, section numbers in the headings of the following items refer to the Income Tax Amendment Act 1992. Trade Unions no longer included in Friendly Society Definition Section 2(1) Introduction “Trade organisations” will no longer come within the ambit of the previous friendly society definition. Background The income of a friendly society, as defined in sec- tion 2, is exempt from tax except so far as it is de- rived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership (section 61(23)). Previously the definition was wide enough to include trade unions, employer organisations and industrial associations. This changed with the passing of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (ECA). The ECA provided that “every union, employers organisation or association” that was previously reg- istered under the Labour Relations Act 1987 shall become an incorporated society registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908. Therefore, trade organisations cease to be friendly societies from 15 May 1991. (See also pages 8 ans 10 of this TIB for further discus- sion on trade associations under sections 11(2) and 16.) Key Issues “Friendly society” now means any society or credit union or association of credit unions registered or deemed to be registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982. Many trade associations who become incorporated societies will not see any great change. Their income will comprise merely interest on subscriptions held in current accounts. However, in those cases where income is derived from larger investments, or pos- sibly in the form of rental income, it will be neces- sary to complete accounts for tax purposes. Any affected trade union, employer organisation or industrial association which will now be liable to income tax because their income is above the $1,000 exemption provided in section 61(34) of the Income Tax Act 1976 will no longer qualify for a Certificate of Exemption from Resident Withholding Tax. These organisations should advise payers of interest that their interest income is no longer exempt. Some of these organisations may now be liable for provisional tax. They should contact their nearest Inland Revenue Office for information about this. Application Date These amendments apply from 1 April 1992. 3 Confirmation of Tax Treatment of Student Grants and Allowances Sections 2 (2), 11(3), 13 and 23 Definition of Income Year and Associated Terms Section 3 A formal definition of the expression “income year” and certain other terms has been inserted into the Act. Such definitions did not previously exist. They have been inserted for convenience of reference. Definitions are now in place for: •Income Year •Standard Balance Date (etc) •Non-standard Balance Date (etc) •Early Balance Date (etc) •Late Balance Date (etc) In addition, references to Income Years in the Act shall be taken as including non-standard accounting years (section 3(3)(a)). Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 amends four provisions in the Principal Act which affect student grants and allowances. These amendments are consequences of the Educa- tion Amendment Act 1990 (which repealed section 163 of the Education Act 1964) and of the Student Allowances Regulations 1991. Background Since 1 April 1988, student allowances and grants have been assessable income. This liability arose under three provisions, namely: • as “salary or wages” as defined in section 2 of the Act; • as “basic grants and independent circumstances grants" made pursuant to regulations made un- der section 193 of the Education Act 1964 • as “income derived from any other source what- soever” under section 65(2)(l). From that date, “scholarships or bursaries ... other than a basic grant or an independent circumstances grant made pursuant to regulations made under sec- tion 193 of the Education Act 1964” have been exempt from income tax. Because the definition of “salary or wages” includes student grants and allowances and because “salary or wages” are within the definition of “source deduc- tion payment” in section 6(1), the income tax due was required to be deducted at the time of their pay- ment under the PAYE provisions. Key Issues Section 193 of the Education Act 1964 has been re- pealed. The Student Allowances Regulations 1991, which apply from 1 January 1992, were made pur- suant to the authority of section 303 of the Education Act 1989 To continue the income tax assessability of student grants and allowances, the exemption of scholar- ships or bursaries, and the deduction of income tax under the PAYE provisions, the reference to section 193 of the Education Act 1964 has been altered in: • the paragraph (ca) definition of “salary or wages” in section 2; • the paragraph (da) of section 65 (2) (assessable in- come) definition of “basic grants”; • the section 61(37) exemption of scholarship and bursaries; and, • the section 374A definition of “financially inde- pendent”. This latter provision is relevant for calculating fam- ily support tax credit entitlements. A reference to section 303 of the Education Act 1989 has been substituted in each case. The effect of these amendments is to continue the current tax treatment of student allowances, grants, bursaries and scholarships, and to leave unchanged Family Support entitlements. Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). 4 Information from Returns now accepted Electronically Section 5, 8 and 30, Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 Section 2 and 3, Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1992 Introduction The Income Tax Act and the Inland Revenue Depart- ment Act have been amended to enable the Commis- sioner to receive and act on electronically filed infor- mation from returns. Background The Act previously required returns to be filed by way of paper. Inland Revenue’s FIRST computer systems enable us to receive information electroni- cally. The Income Tax Act has therefore been amended to enable the Commissioner to receive and act on electronically filed information from returns. The Inland Revenue Department Act has been amended to clarify the point in time that an electronic return is received and covers the prescribing of elec- tronic formats for electronically filed information. Key Issues Power of Commissioner to receive and act on electronic information The Income Tax Act before amendment gave the Commissioner the power to receive and act only on paper returns \[section 9\]. The new section 14A gives the Commissioner the power to give approval to tax- payers or their agents to file the information from returns by electronic means in a prescribed electronic format. Where return information is received in this manner the Commissioner will treat the information as if it were a return furnished pursuant to section 9 or any other provision of the Act which relates to the furnishing of returns. This means that the Commis- sioner can issue assessments, accept objections and so forth on the basis of the information electronically filed. Retention of the paper copy The software package which all those filing electroni- cally must use will print a copy of the electronically filed information in a normal return format. New section 14A(3)(b) deems this paper copy to be the return of the taxpayer. The taxpayer is required to retain it on behalf of the Commissioner and produce it on request. These paper returns may be kept by taxpayers or their agents. New section 428A details the requirements for keep- ing paper returns from which the information has been electronically filed. Essentially the paper return must be retained for seven years unless the Commis- sioner requires the return to be kept for a greater period or a notice in writing has been issued to the effect that retention is not required. Signing the return The return produced by the software package will incorporate the declaration found on all paper re- turns. Section 17A of the Inland Revenue Depart- ment Act requires all returns to be signed. Receipt of an electronically filed return Section 17A of the Inland Revenue Department Act has been amended to ensure that receipt of the elec- tronic information by Inland Revenue is deemed to be the receipt of the return. Prescribed Format Section 22A of the Inland Revenue Department Act has been repealed and replaced. A return or infor- mation filed electronically is deemed not to be in a prescribed format unless it is transmitted in an elec- tronic format that has been certified by the Commis- sioner as matching the prescribed format. It was necessary to legislate in this manner because it is not possible to publish in paper form the electronic for- mat. Other Returns In time the FIRST systems will cater for information or returns other than income tax returns. The legis- lation for electronic filing has been drafted to cover all returns required under the Income Tax Act. Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). 5 “IR 5 Taxpayer” defined Section 6(1) Introduction Section 17 of the Income Tax Act has been amended to define an IR 5 taxpayer. Background For many years there has been a distinction between IR 5 and IR 3 taxpayers, based on whether or not the taxpayer was a provisional taxpayer, but “IR 5 tax- payer” was not defined. The need to define an IR 5 taxpayer arose because of changes to the provisional tax rules, for implemen- tation of FIRST, and to enable easy instructions to be given to taxpayers for filing purposes. Key Issue An “IR 5 taxpayer” will mean any natural person where - (a) the only income of the person in an income year is New Zealand sourced income that consists only of any one or more of the following: (i) Salary or wages; or (ii) Extra emoluments; or (iii) Resident withholding income; and (b) The person does not derive in that year income consisting of either withholding payments or ben- eficiary income as defined in section 226(1) of the Act. The reason for the limitation to New Zealand sourced income is that under FIRST IR 5 processing there is no provision for calculating overseas tax credits. Application Date The amendment will apply for the 1991/92 income year. Changes to Return Filing Date Section 6(2) Introduction Certain changes have been made to Return Filing Dates. Background This reflects recommendations of the Tax Simplifica- tion Consultative Committee (TSCC). The TSCC rec- ommended that non-IR5 taxpayers should have four months from balance date in which to file their re- turns, and that all return filing dates should be on the 20th day of a month rather than the customary 7th. Once planned changes to provisional tax payment dates were deferred, a change to return filing dates would have meant that provisional taxpayers would be required to pay their first provisional tax payment on the 7th day of a month, even though their return was not due for filing until the 20th. This would have been confusing for taxpayers who normally send their first payment and their tax return together, so the actual date changes have been deferred mean- time. The TSCC recommended that the time to file for non IR 5s be extended to the fourth month after balance date. This would have been advantageous for late balance date taxpayers but it would have been diffi- cult for persons with October or November balance dates as the new return forms are often not available until early in April. Key Issues A new subsection 17(2) of the Income Tax act there- fore sets the due dates for filing annual income tax returns. IR 5 returns are due by 7 June, as at present. Returns from late balance date taxpayers are due by the 7th day of the 4th month after a taxpayer’s bal- ance date. All other returns are due by 7 July. Future Developments When the TSCC’s recommendations on aligning due dates to the 20th day are eventually adopted the leg- islative wording will be in place for a simple amend- ment to change the numbers. Application Date The amendment applies for the 1991/92 income year. 6 Time Limitations for Amendment of Assessments Section 7 Introduction This amendment effects two changes to section 25 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. These amendments are necessary for three reasons. The first is to clarify the time within which the Commissioner may amend an assessment. The second is to accommodate changes in the manner in which Inland Revenue processes returns and consequently, the basis on which assess- ments are made. The third is to clarify that the four year time limit in the provision does not apply to default assessments. Background Subsection (1) of section 25 imposes a four year time limit within which the Commissioner may amend, by increasing the amount thereof, an assessment for any income year. Previously, the time limit for amendment expired four years “from the end of the year in which the assessment was made”. Doubts have arisen on occasions where an assessment was made late in an income year and not notified to the taxpayer until after the end of that income year. Also, because the term “assessment” is not defined in the Act, the current language of the subsection arguably contemplates that some act of the mind is necessary for an assessment to be made. Modern returns processing under FIRST Systems renders such an assumption no longer valid in the great ma- jority of circumstances. Finally, it has also been argued that the “returns” referred to in the subsection need not be the same as those “assessed” for any income year. That is, that default assessments could not be amended where subsequently a return is filed for an income year. The legislative intention is that the “returns” referred to as filed be the same as those “assessed” in any income year. Key Issues From date of assent, subsection (1) of section 25 is amended to insert the expression “(other than pur- suant to section 21 of this Act)” after the expression “income tax for any year”. This amendment will exclude default assessments from the scope of the section. Also from that date, the subsection is further amended by substituting the expression “the notice of assessment was issued” for the expression “the assessment was made”. This amendment will clarify the commencement date of the time limit for amend- ment of assessments. Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Extension of Time to make Objections Section 9 and 18, Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 Section 8, GST Amendment Act 1992 Section 3, Estate & Gift Duties Amendment Act 1992 Section 2, Stamp & Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1992 Introduction Taxpayers have been given a formal right to apply for an extension of time in which to make an objec- tion. Background These amendments give effect to recommendations of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee (TSCC) relating to tax in dispute. In the past, a taxpayer who failed to lodge an objec- tion within the prescribed time, could only apply to the Commissioner to make a late objection and then await the Commissioner’s discretion. This created uncertainty for such taxpayers, since the original time for objection was expired but the Commissioner had not yet made his decision whether or not to ac- cept the application for late objection. Key Issues For all the above Revenue Acts, the amendments en- able taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for an extension of time in which to make an objection be- fore the expiry of the objection period. Application date These amendments apply from 1 April 1992. 7 Six Month Time Limit for Stating Cases to High Court Section 10 Introduction The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee (TSCC) recommended that the Commissioner of In- land Revenue should be subject to a six month time limit within which to state a case for the opinion of the High Court. This amendment gives legislative effect to that rec- ommendation, for objections made on or after 1 July 1992. Background Section 33 of the Income Tax Act 1976 prescribes the circumstances and manner in which objections to assessments may be referred to the High Court in the first instance. Where an objection is disallowed by the Commis- sioner, the objector is permitted two months in which to state a case for the opinion of the High Court. There is no similar time limit within which the Commissioner may elect to state a case for the opin- ion of the High Court. Key Issues Section 33 is amended to provide that for requests for cases stated made on or after 1 July 1992, the Com- missioner shall state a case within six months of ei- ther: • the date of receipt of the objection, or • the date on which the Commissioner and the ob- jector agreed to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, or • the date on which the High Court orders that a case be stated for its opinion. The High Court is granted power to extend the time for the stating of a case for its opinion. Where the Commissioner fails to file a case within the set period, the Court may, on application from the objector, allow the objection. Application Date This amendment applies to cases stated on or after 1 July 1992. NRWT Removed for Niuean Companies Sections 11(1) and 11(5) Introduction Section 61 of the Income Tax Act, as it relates to Niue, has been amended, at the request of the Niuean gov- ernment. Background Niue has no Companies Act of its own. Niuean com- panies have therefore traditionally been incorporated under New Zealand law. In recognition of this fact, income derived by these companies is exempt from New Zealand taxation under s61(9) of the Income Tax Act, as are the dividends paid by them to share- holders who are Niuean residents (under s61(48)). However, the operation of the New Zealand NRWT regime means that income derived from a Niuean company by a person resident in a country other than Niue or New Zealand will attract New Zealand NRWT. The Niuean Government requested the re- moval of this disincentive to foreign investment. Key Issues The amendments to the Act exempt from New Zea- land tax: • the income of a company where that income is derived exclusively or principally from Niue, and • the dividends paid by such companies to persons who are not residents of either New Zealand or Niue. Application Date These amendments apply from 1 April 1992 8 Transitional Relief for Trade Associations Subsections 11(2)and 11(4) Introduction This is a relief provision for those trade associations discussed above under section 2(1) (see Page 2) which are deemed to be incorporated societies from 15 May 1991. It avoids the need for them to furnish part year tax returns. Background Previously trade unions and employer organisations were expressly included in the definition of “friendly society” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976 and were therefore entitled to an exemption from tax on income derived within the circle of membership. With the enactment of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 they were no longer within that definition and lost their tax exempt status from 15 May 1991. As it is preferable for a change of taxation status to take place from the commencement of an income year a short exemption period has been provided to align the change in status with the commencement of a standard accounting year. Key Issue A new subsection 61(23A) exempts certain trade un- ions and employer associations from income tax for the period from 15 May 1991 to 31 March 1992. No specific provision has been made for trade asso- ciations which do not have a 31 March balance date. Consideration of the use of an alternative balance date will be subject to the usual rules, and the effect of this exemption will need to be taken into account. Taxable income of a trade association derived out- side the circle of membership is not affected by this change. It remains taxable. A consequential change to section 61(39) of the In- come Tax Act 1976 omits words that are no longer necessary in light of the new definition of “friendly society” substituted by section 2(1) of this Act. Application Date These amendments apply from 13 March 1992. New Start Grants: Extension of Deadline Section 12 Introduction The provisions relating to New Start Grants have been amended to give farmers on the East Coast of the North Island who suffered from drought an ex- tra year to organise their tax position. Background Section 64FB(2) of the Income Tax Act applies to farmers who suffered from the drought which oc- curred on the East Coast of the North Island during the 1988 and 1989 income years. It provides that where a farmer had debts remitted by 30 September 1990 as a prerequisite for receiving a New Start grant, the amount forgiven was not counted as assessable income to the extent to which it could not be offset against accumulated losses. Key Issues The 30 September 1990 date by which an East Coast farmer had to have all debts incurred and remitted was an extremely tight deadline for some given their circumstances. This amendment provided an extra year for these farmers to sort out their financial af- fairs. This meant those farmers who suffered from the East Coast droughts had until 30 September 1991 to finalise their tax position. Application Date The amendment itself applies from the date of the enactment of the Amendment Act, but the nature of the amendment means that the effective application date is 30 September 1990. 9 Extension of Relief Provisions to Estimators of Provisional Tax for Shareholder-Employees affected by the 1991 Amendments to Section 75 Section 14 Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 adds to the transitional provision to section 75 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which was contained in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991. It extends the adjusted 1991 residual income tax for the purposes of capping any 1992 under-estimation penalty. Background The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 pro- vided a transitional provision for section 75(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The transitional provision was needed because taxpayers affected by the operation of the amended section 75 were faced with two years' income assessable in the one income year. This provision allowed taxpayers who used the 1991 residual income tax plus the uplift factors to deter- mine 1992 provisional tax and the first and second instalments of 1993 provisional tax to adjust their 1991 residual income tax by the tax payable as a re- sult of the operation of the amendment. However, this adjustment of the provisional tax amount did not apply to cap any 1992 under-estima- tion penalty. Key Issues The amendment ensures that the adjusted amount of 1991 residual income tax applies to cap any 1992 ex- posure to under-estimation penalty. Application Date This amendment applies to cap any exposure to under-estimation penalty for the 1992 income year. Monetary Remuneration includes Directors' Fees for Purposes of Sections 75 and 104A Section 15 Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 adds a further subsection to section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976. It makes it clear that for the purposes of the operation of that section and section 75, monetary remuneration includes directors’ fees. Background The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 con- tained new rules governing the assessability and deductibility of monetary remuneration. It had been pointed out to Inland Revenue that directors’ fees were not explicitly included as monetary remunera- tion. The inclusion of directors as employees is some- what indirect: • an employee is defined as someone who is entitled to receive a source deduction payment; · withholding payments are source deduction pay- ments; and · directors fees are subject to withholding payments. There appeared to be some confusion among taxpay- ers as to whether the new rules actually applied to directors’ fees. Key Issues The new subsection makes it clear that for the pur- poses of the operation of sections 75 and 104A, mon- etary remuneration includes directors’ fees. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent. (13 March 1992) 10 Valuation of Trade Associations' Assets Section 16 Introduction Section 16 inserts a new section 197I into the Act. This section makes provision for the valuation of assets of “trade associations” which cease to be ex- empt from tax from 1 April 1992. Background With the change in taxation status of trade unions and employer organisations it was necessary to pro- vide a mechanism for valuation of assets which were owned by these organisations during their tax-ex- empt period. Provisions similar to those provided in 1988 for State Owned Enterprises, Statutory Producer Boards, Co- operatives and similar organisations have been intro- duced (Sections 197A to H refer). Key Issues Subsection (1) defines “trade association” to encom- pass affected organisations. Assets which in future can be depreciated in accord- ance with section 108 and which were on hand prior to 1 April may be valued as if they had previously been used in the production of assessable income and been depreciated in accordance with the Commis- sioner’s ordinary depreciation for taxation rules. (subsection (2)) Where the asset is a building, it may be valued at acquisition cost for depreciation purposes (subsec- tion (3)). If there is a dispute about the cost of a depreciable asset, or about the date of acquisition, it must be determined by agreement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Failing such an agreement, the Commissioner shall make a determination as to cost or date as appropriate. (subsection (4)) Application Date The amendment comes into force on 1 April 1992. This applies from a specific day, not for an income year. Controlled Foreign Company Transitional Provisions extended, Foreign Investment Fund Regime deferred Section 17 Introduction The Income Tax Act has been amended to extend the transitional provisions of the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime, and to defer the application of the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime. Background Section 245Y of the Income Tax Act originally pro- vided that if a CFC was resident at all times during the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1990 in a country or territory other than those listed in the Seventeenth Schedule to the Act, any person who held an income interest in that CFC was not required to calculate attributed foreign income or attributed foreign loss until 1 April 1990. The application date of the FIF regime was 1 April 1988 unless a fund was resident in a country or ter- ritory not listed in the Seventeenth Schedule. Persons with an interest in a fund resident in a country not listed in the Seventeenth Schedule were not required to calculate FIF income or loss until 1 April 1989. The transitional period of the CFC regime was ex- tended to 31 March 1991 by the Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No 2) 1991. This Act also deferred the application date of the FIF regime until 1 April 1991. Key Issues The document Taxing Income Across International Bor- ders - A Policy Framework was released as a Budget annex on 30 July 1991. The Government welcomed comment on the issues discussed in that document, including the CFC and FIF regimes. To allow sufficient time to receive and consider pub- lic submissions as part of the review of the CFC and FIF regimes, the Government has decided to extend the transitional provisions of the CFC regime and postpone the application of the FIF regime for a fur- ther year. Accordingly, a further amendment has been made to section 245Y of the Act to extend the period to which the transitional provisions relating to the CFC regime will apply. Before this amendment these pro- visions had ceased on 31 March 1991. They will now apply until 31 March 1992. However, the CFC regime will continue to apply to interests held in CFCs resident in countries or terri- tories listed on the Seventeenth Schedule. 11 The amendment also provides that the application of the FIF regime has been deferred for a further year. It will now apply from 1 April 1992. The amendments contained in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1991 inserted an anti-avoid- ance provision, to ensure that interests acquired in the period between the date of the announcement of the deferral of the application of the FIF regime, and the date from which the FIF regime was to apply would be subject to the FIF regime. The application of this provision has been extended to include all interests acquired between 19 December 1991 (the date of the announcement of the extended deferral), and 1 April 1992 (the new application date). Inter- ests acquired by virtue of any rights attached to an interest held in a FIF before 19 December, or through the operation of law, will continue to be unaffected. Section 245Y(3A) is amended to allow companies with late balance dates to return the attributed for- eign income derived from 1 April 1992 in their 1993 returns of income. A similar amendment has been made to section 245Y(10), providing that this provi- sion will equally apply to the FIF regime. FIF income will not have to be taken into account for provisional tax estimates. However, taxpayers may take anticipated FIF losses into account if they wish. Tax payable on any FIF income will not be taken into account when calculating any underestimation pen- alty charged under section 384, additional tax charged under section 398, and any interest payable in terms of section 398A. Refunds of tax arising as a result of the deferred ap- plication date of the FIF regime will not generally qualify for interest on tax overpaid. However, where a person who is entitled to receive interest on tax overpaid under section 413A receives a refund of tax previously paid on FIF income, that person will continue to be entitled to receive interest in relation to the amount of tax refunded. A minor clarification has been made to section 245Y(1A). The words “or foreign entity” have been removed, as from 1 April 1989 the seventeenth schedule has no application to the FIF regime. Inland Revenue is considering whether the current disclosure exemption will be extended for another year. Taxpayers will be notified in a later TIB. Application Date These amendments apply from 13 March 1992. FBT - Payments by Associated Persons recognised Section 21(1) Introduction This amendment corrects an oversight in the FBT regime by allowing a reduction in the taxable value of a benefit supplied to an associated person of an employee to be reduced by any amount paid by that associated person. Background A principle behind FBT is that the tax is levied only on the net value of the benefit provided. In situations where the employee receiving the benefit makes some payment towards it, the taxable value is re- duced by the amount of that payment under the pro- visions of section 336P. A benefit provided by an employer to an associated person of an employee - generally the employee’s family - is also subject to FBT. There was, however, no corresponding provision reducing the value on which FBT was payable by any payment towards the benefit if that payment was not made by the em- ployee. It should be noted that administratively Inland Rev- enue has always allowed the taxable value of a fringe benefit to be reduced by any payment made by an associated person, and this amendment simply clari- fies the legal position. Key Issues The amendment ensures that where a benefit is pro- vided to an associated person of an employee, and that person makes a payment towards the benefit, the value on which FBT must be paid is reduced by the amount of the payment. This will not alter Inland Revenue’s current practice. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). 12 FBT - GST-Exclusive Values where Employee part-owns Motor Vehicle Section 21(2) and 21(3) Introduction This amendment corrects an oversight in the FBT regime. Recognition is now made of the GST-exclu- sive valuation method where employees or associ- ated persons make a contribution to motor vehicle costs. Background Section 336P(1) acts to reduce the taxable value of a fringe benefit which is a motor vehicle when that motor vehicle is part-owned by an employee, or subsequent to the amendment made by section 21(1) of this Amendment Act, an associate of that em- ployee. Where a motor vehicle is part-owned, the taxable value is reduced by 10%, on an annual ba- sis, of the cost price of the vehicle to the employee or associate of the employee. The 10% reduction, compared to the total annual liability on 24% of the cost price, recognizes the fact that the employer will continue to meet the running and maintenance costs of the vehicle. The impost of FBT where a motor vehicle is provided was amended by section 35 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1991. This amendment pro- vided a new option of valuing motor vehicles in a manner which is exclusive of GST. Through over- sight, this new valuation method was not recognized in section 336P. Key Issues This amendment recognizes the GST-exclusive method of valuation under clause 3 of the Tenth Schedule. Where this method of valuation is used, the value of the motor vehicle on which the employer is liable for FBT is reduced by the appropriate frac- tion of 10% plus GST of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the person who receives its benefit. Inland Revenue’s current practice in this area will not change. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Changes to Tax Payment Dates Sections 22, 26 and 27 Introduction These sections change the terminal tax date for non- provisional taxpayers back to 7 February. Background The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee (TSCC) recommended that the due date for payment of terminal tax by non-provisional taxpayers be brought forward to 20 November for the 1991/92 income year. Amendments to give effect to that TSCC recommendation were in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1990. Although the TSCC approved a comprehensive set of provisional tax reforms, the total package of rec- ommendations has not yet been adopted which has led to some practical problems. It was soon realised that the change to terminal tax due date for non-pro- visional taxpayers without the corresponding changes for provisional taxpayers (yet to be adopted) would not be equitable. Three of those amendments dealing with due dates for payment of terminal tax have been reversed un- til such time as the new provisional tax regime as a whole is introduced. At that time it is proposed that payment dates will change to the 20th day of the appropriate months Key Issues Section 22 amends section 361 to set 7 February as the terminal tax date for all employees. Sections 26 and 27 amend respectively sections 388 and 395 of the Act, to set 7 February as the terminal tax date for all taxpayers who are not employees and who have a 31 March balance date. Terminal tax for taxpayers with non standard bal- ance dates is due on the 7th day of the month speci- fied in the Eighth Schedule to the Act. Application Date These amendments apply to terminal tax for the 1991/92 and subsequent income years. 13 Words “Family Benefit” now repealed Section 24 Introduction Section 24 of the Amendment Act corrects an over- sight by repealing the words “Family Benefit” in sec- tion 374D. Background Section 374D of the Income Tax Act provides tax credits, known as Family Support Tax Credits, for low income earners with children. With the abolition of family benefit with effect from 1 April 1991, those sections in the Income Tax Act which used that term needed to be amended. These amendments were made by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1991. The term was generally replaced with refer- ences to a dependent child and the principal caregiver of a dependent child. Through oversight, this amendment was not made to item y in section 374D(2). Key Issues This section replaces the words “entitled to receive a family benefit” with the words “a principal caregiver” in item y of section 374D(2). Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Reference to “Specified War Pension” removed from Act Section 25 Introduction An amendment to the Income Tax Act repeals the remaining reference to the “specified war pension” and replaces it with the term “veteran’s pension”. Background As at 1 April 1990, the “specified war pension” was abolished and replaced by the “veteran’s pension”. At that time, not all references in the Income Tax Act to the “specified war pension” were repealed. The amendment rectifies this anomaly. Key Issues The definition of “qualifying person” in the Part of the Act dealing with the guaranteed minimum fam- ily income credit of tax contained a reference to “specified war pension”. The amendment removes this reference to “specified war pension” and re- places it with the term “veteran’s pension”. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). New Start Grants: Tax Write Off in cases of Serious Hardship Section 28, Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 Section 2, Accident Compensation Amendment Act 1992 Introduction Section 414 of the Income Tax Act and section 114 of the Accident Compensation Act 1982, which relate to the write off of tax in cases of serious hardship, are amended. Background New Start grants are provided to farmers who find themselves in financial difficulties due to adverse events. The package provides a $45,000 grant, clear of any debts, where a farmer enters into an agree- ment with his/her creditors whereby the farmer’s debts would be extinguished by the sale of the farm. Key Issues These amendments, contained in the relevant amendment Acts, provide relief from the payment of unpaid tax deductions and Accident Compensa- tion levies where the farmer is in receipt of a New Start grant. The relief is granted only in respect of unpaid tax deductions and ACC levies incurred in the farming activity for which the New Start grant is provided. Application Date The amendments apply to New Start grants for pre- viously “approved” adverse events. They will not apply to grants provided for future adverse events. 14 Record Retention Period reduced Sections 20 and 29, Income Tax Amendment Act 1992 Section 10, GST Amendment Act 1992 Introduction The Income Tax Act and the GST Act have been amended to reduce the period for which taxpayers must retain tax records. However, the Commis- sioner of Inland Revenue has been granted powers to order that these records be kept for longer than the standard period set down. Background These amendments give effect to recommendations of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee (TSCC) relating to Retention of Records. Key Issues The standard record retention period has been re- duced from ten years to seven years with effect from 1 April 1992. However, this standard period can be extended by the Commissioner for up to three years where a taxpayer is or has been under audit or inves- tigation, or where the Commissioner is contemplat- ing such action. These amendments will apply to GST records as well as income tax records. Two further changes permit even shorter retention periods in special cases: • Pay period taxpayers who receive income from which tax has been deducted at source need retain records for only 12 months after the year in which they received it. • The Commissioner has also been empowered to reduce the records retention period to 12 months for classes of taxpayers who are not provisional taxpayers. These classes are not yet defined in or- der to leave the Commissioner some discretion in extending this privilege into the wider body of tax- payers. The exemption will apply only to records relating to payments from which tax has been de- ducted at source. Application Date These amendments apply from 1 April 1992 Employer Obligation to advise Employees' Commencement and Cessation Section 4 and 31 Introduction From 1 April 1992, an amendment to section 432 of the Income Tax Act 1976 will require all payers of source deduction payments to deliver to the Com- missioner of Inland Revenue “employment com- mencement and cessation certificates” for persons who commence or cease to be to employees of that employer. Background The Government’s Budget night Statement of Policy on Social Assistance, Welfare that Works, announced that employers would be required to inform Inland Revenue of the employment start and finish dates for each of their employees. Key Issues Section 432 is amended by the addition of subsections (2) to (7). Subsection (2) requires every employer who must deliver a remittance certificate pursuant to para- graphs (a), (ab) or (ac) of section 353 for any period commencing on or after 1 April 1992, to also deliver to the Commissioner a signed “employment com- mencement and cessation certificate” for any persons who commence or cease to be employees of the employer during the period. Subsection (3) provides that such certificate shall show the name and tax file number of the employer, the name of every person who commenced or ceased to be an employee of the employer, the tax file number of such employees (where supplied) and such other particulars as the Commissioner may re- quire. Subsection (4) requires that the commencement and cessation certificate shall be delivered not later than the date by which the remittance certificate is re- quired. Subsection (5) authorises the Commissioner to vary the requirements of subsections (2) to (4) to such ex- tent as the Commissioner thinks fit, provided that the no such variation may impose a more onerous requirement than is imposed by subsections (2) to (4). Subsection (6) provides that no certificate is required for a period unless a commencement or cessation has occurred in that period. It also permits the Commis- sioner to specify and exclude any class of employ- 15 ment from the requirements of the section. A certifi- cate is not required for the commencement and ces- sation of entitlement to national superannuation, veterans’ pensions, any income tested benefit or earnings related compensation. Subsection (7) defines “employee” as including any recipient of a “source deduction payment” as defined in section 6(1). That definition has been amended for the purposes of this obligation so as to include share- holder-employees. “Employee” includes both shareholder-employees and recipients of withholding payments. In the case of shareholder-employees, because the operation of section 6(2) and (3) is specifically ex- cluded from the obligations in section 432, all share- holder-employees remain potential recipients of source deduction payments, and the employing company must supply commencement and cessation particulars. Thus, where a shareholder-employee commences or ceases employment with a company on or after 1 April 1992, and there is any prospect of source deduction payment being made as a result of that employment, the commencement (or as the case may be, cessation) must be reported. In the case of recipients of withholding payments, commencements should be advised where a person accepts any position which gives rise to an entitle- ment to a withholding payment. Cessations, particu- larly in the case of casual workers such as fruit pick- ers, should be advised when the employer consid- ers that person is unlikely to undertake any further work for that employer in the foreseeable future. Application Date This amendment applies from 1 April 1992. Thus, “large ” employers must submit their first certificate to Inland Revenue by 20 April 1992 and “small” employers by 20 May 1992; in both cases only where an employee has commenced or ceased in their em- ployment after 1 April 1992. Additions to the Transitional List of Low Tax Countries Section 33 Introduction Legislative changes have been made to the Seven- teenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976 to add to Part B companies of certain types that are resident in Ireland, Malta, and Malaysia. Background The controlled foreign company (CFC) transitional provisions provide that if a CFC is resident at all times during the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1992 in a country or territory other than those listed on the Seventeenth Schedule to the Act, any person who holds an income interest in that CFC is not required to calculate attributed foreign income or attributed foreign loss until 1 April 1992. The Seventeenth Schedule contains a list of the known tax havens that existed at the time the sched- ule was formulated. It was amended in 1989 to in- clude companies obtaining tax preferences offered in Fiji and Western Samoa. Family Support Income Bands decreased Section 32 Introduction A new Eleventh Schedule has been introduced into the Income Tax Act. It decreases the width of the income bands used for classifying the expected in- come earned by a taxpayer during the coming year in order to calculate that person’s entitlement to in- terim Family Support instalments. Background The income bands reduce the chances for Family Support recipients to incur end of year debits due to wage or other unforeseen pay increases during the income year. Key Issues The new income bands are amended to ensure that only a maximum of $10 Family Support entitlement is forgone per week. This was the previous maxi- mum Family Support entitlement forgone when Fam- ily Support was introduced in 1986. The amendment was necessitated by the increases in the Family Sup- port abatement rates since the scheme was intro- duced in 1986. Application Date The amendment applies to the tax on income derived in the year commencing on 1 April 1992 and applies to applications for interim instalments of Family Sup- port for the 1992/93 income year. 16 Key Issues As the transitional provisions for the CFC regime have been extended for a further year, the Govern- ment has decided that the Seventeenth Schedule should be modified to include companies that utilise additional tax preferences offered in foreign jurisdic- tions. Part B of the Seventeenth Schedule has been amended to include a number of specified companies resident in Ireland, Malta, and Malaysia that obtain a tax preference offered in those countries, includ- ing: • Manufacturing companies deriving income in the period to 31 December 2010 from the sale of goods manufactured in Ireland; • Companies deriving income or capital gains from the following operations: -life assurance business with policy holders and annuitants who reside outside Ireland; -the management of the investments of one or more unit trusts where all the unit holders are resident outside Ireland. These companies incur an effective rate of tax of 10%. • Companies obtaining tax capital allowances, in- cluding initial allowances and accelerated writing down allowances available for qualifying assets of financial type operations carried out in the Shan- non Free Airport Zone, and designated Urban Renewal Areas of Ireland; • Any company that operates in Ireland undertaking administrative or liaison activities; Irish corporation tax of up to 15% of overhead ex- penses is imposed on this type of company; • Companies obtaining forms of tax relief or com- plete exemption from tax provided by legislation recently enacted in Malaysia, including: -the Labuan Offshore Business Activity Tax Act 1990; -the Offshore Banking Act 1990; -the Offshore Companies Act 1990; -the Offshore Insurance Act 1990; -the Labuan Trust Companies Act 1990; and -the Promotion of Investments (Criteria for the Grant of Pioneer Status to a Small-Scale Com- pany) Order 1990. • Companies resident in Malta that obtain relief or exemption from tax under any of the following Acts: -the Malta International Business Activities Act 1988; -the Offshore Trusts Act 1988; -the Malta Freeports Act 1989; and -the Merchant Shipping Act 1973. Application Date These amendments apply from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Confirmation of Annual Rates of Income Tax Sections 34, 35, and 36 Part II of the Amendment Act confirms the rates of income tax and excess retention tax for the 1992 in- come year. These annual rates are required to be fixed from time to time by an Act of Parliament. Key issues The annual rates of income tax for the 1992 income year are the amounts set out in the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The rates have not changed. The rate of excess retention tax for the 1992 income year is the amount set out in clause 11 of Part A of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act. This rate has not changed. Application Date 1 April 1991. Gift Duty Exemption for Superannuation Assignments extended Section 2, Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1992 Introduction Section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1992 extends the gift duty exemption for super- annuation assignments contained in section 74 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The exemption now covers elections by group superannuation scheme members to receive a reduced pension in return for the payment, commencing before the member’s death, of a pension to the member’s spouse. 17 Background Section 74 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 pre- viously exempted from gift duty elections by mem- bers of group superannuation schemes to receive a reduced retirement allowance or pension in return for the payment, after the member’s death, of a pen- sion to the surviving spouse or to any dependant. Key Issues The gift duty exemption in section 74 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 is extended to cover elec- tions by group superannuation scheme members to receive a reduced pension in return for the payment, commencing before the member’s death, of a pen- sion to the member’s spouse. The types of assignment which the amendment would apply to are typically those which allow for a more equitable superannuation provision to be made for non-contributor spouses. An example of a statutory assignment which would benefit from the amendment is contained in section 91B of the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956. This provision allows contributors to the fund to elect to surrender up to one-half of their superan- nuation entitlement in return for the immediate pay- ment of an annuity to another person. The type of superannuation assignment covered by the amendment could previously gain access to a gift duty exemption by being incorporated in a matrimo- nial property agreement. This option, however, is less desirable than a specific gift duty exemption as it imposes additional compliance costs on assignors who may be compelled to incur the significant cost of having a matrimonial property agreement drawn up for the reason only of effecting a superannuation assignment which does not incur a gift duty liability. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent. (13 March 1992) Use of symbols allowed on Electronically Transferred Tax Invoices, Debit and Credit Notes Section 2 and 7, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction An amendment to section 2 of the GST Act and the insertion of new section 25A into the Act allows reg- istered persons to use symbols, abbreviations or other notations on a tax invoice or a credit or debit note to represent particulars that are required to be shown on a tax invoice or a credit or debit note. Sym- bols can only be used where the tax invoice or credit or debit note is to be sent by electronic transfer. Background The GST Act requires particulars to be shown on a tax invoice or a credit or debit note. This can add to the costs and efficiencies of transmitting data elec- tronically. The amendment allows for these particu- lars to be represented by symbols, abbreviations or other notations. Key issues The Commissioner may approve, for the purposes of facilitating the electronic transfer of tax invoices and credit and debit notes, the use of symbols, ab- breviations or other notations to represent the par- ticulars required to be shown on a tax invoice or a credit or debit note. For example, the abbreviation “TI” may represent the words “tax invoice”. Such approval may apply generally to all registered person or a specific registered person or class of reg- istered persons. The Commissioner may impose conditions as to the use of symbols, abbreviations or other notations. Any approval given can be with- drawn or modified by the Commissioner at any time on giving reasonable notice. Credit note and debit note have been defined to be a document and therefore can be in an electronic for- mat. Application date This amendment applies from the date of assent. (13 March 1992) 18 Use of Trading Names on Tax Invoices allowed Section 2 and 9, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction A registered person may now use a trading name on tax invoices and credit and debit notes as a result of an amendment to the GST Act. Background This amendment enacts one of the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee’s recommendations. Previ- ously a registered person was not allowed to use a trading name on tax invoices or credit and debit notes. Instead, the registered person’s name was required to be shown and if the trading name was used, the tax invoice could not be used to claim a GST input tax credit. Key Issues The amendment allows a registered person to apply to the Commissioner to adopt a trading name. The trading name can be used on tax invoices and credit and debit notes instead of the actual name of the registered person. A registered person can only use one trading name. An application to adopt a trading name or change a trading name can be made either: (a) at the time of registration; or (b) by specifically notifying the trading name to be adopted and the date from which it will be used to the Commissioner. The Companies Act requires a company to use its company name on all invoices, receipts and notices. Therefore if a company wishes to use a trading name it must also use the company name. Application date This amendment applies from the date of assent. (13 March 1992) GST: Zero-Rating of Temporary Imports clarified Section 4, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction This provision amends section 11(2)(c) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This amendment recasts the original provision and provides that where serv- ices are provided in relation to goods temporarily imported into New Zealand, only the final service provided to the non-resident is zero rated. Background One of the founding principles of the GST Act is that goods and services consumed in New Zealand should be subject to GST and goods and services consumed overseas should be free of GST. GST Zero-Rated on Sales from Airport Duty-Free Shops Section 3, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction An amendment to the GST Act zero-rates GST on supplies made by certain duty-free shops to inbound air travellers and to travellers who purchase goods on their departure from New Zealand and uplift them on their return. Background The amendment clarifies the question of GST on duty-free purchases. The law required GST to be charged on supplies made to inbound travellers, but not on supplies made to travellers leaving the coun- try. In practice, duty-free stores have tended to zero- rate all sales. Key Issues The amendment applies to duty-free stores which are licensed as export warehouses and which operate within the Customs processing area at international airports. These duty-free stores may now zero-rate the GST on supplies made to inbound air travellers and to out- bound air travellers who uplift goods upon return- ing to New Zealand. Application Date This amendment applies from 1 October 1986. 19 Key Issues Where services are performed on a temporarily im- ported good but the services are provided to a resi- dent, consumption occurs in New Zealand and therefore the services will be standard rated. Where the service is provided to a non-resident, consump- tion occurs overseas and therefore the service should only then be zero rated. This amendment clarifies the intention of the existing legislation. Application Date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Taxable Period Returns Section 5, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction An obvious drafting error in the second proviso to section 16(1) of the GST Act is corrected. The proviso should allow a return otherwise due on the last working day of December to be furnished by 15 January in the following year. However, the pro- viso referred to the same year, which made the fur- nishing of the return by that date impossible. Key issue The provision has be amended to refer to the follow- ing year. Application date This amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). GST: Change of Accounting Basis requirements simplified Section 6, Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1992 Introduction The GST Amendment Act 1992 made changes to the provisions governing a change in accounting basis, contained in section 19C of the GST Act. Registered persons now calculate their tax to pay by reference only to their live creditors and debtors contained in the lists required to be produced under section 19B of the GST Act. Background Inland Revenue had been alerted to the possibility of a misinterpretation of section 19C of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The wording of the section in places seemed to indicate that registered persons could be required to hold records for longer than the maximum period, right back to the introduction of the GST, although in practice this was not the case. Key Issues Section 19C of the GST Act provides formulae for the calculation of any adjustment needed should regis- tered persons change their accounting basis between an invoice, payments, or hybrid basis. The amendment to section 19C simplifies the formu- lae set out in subsections (2) to (7), to the extent that they now require input tax and output tax to be taken into account only in relation to amounts due to or by persons included in the list of creditors and debtors required to be produced under section 19B of the Act. It has been Inland Revenue's practice to make the adjustment in this manner, rather than to look at all the taxable periods right back until the introduction of GST. Section 19B details the lists of debtors and/ or creditors that are required to be produced for each possible change in accounting basis. The amendment means the legislation will now re- flect Inland Revenue's practice, taking into account only live creditors and debtors when making the adjustment. Application Date The amendment applies from the date of assent (13 March 1992). 20 TRA may dismiss Objections for Non-Appearance Section 4, Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1992. Introduction This amendment operates to permit the Taxation Review Authority to dismiss an objection made by a taxpayer where there has been a failure by that tax- payer to attend any hearing of the objection. Background On occasions, a taxpayer will fail to appear in sup- port of an objection made to an assessment. The failure to give advance notice of an intended non- appearance typically disrupts the hearings schedule of the Taxation Review Authority and results in avoidable expense. Previously, where an objector failed to appear, the Authority could either adjourn the hearing or deter- mine the objection in the absence of the objector. As the burden is on an objector to establish that the as- sessment is in error, the latter option inevitably re- sulted in the objection being dismissed. However, the Authority still had to hear the evidence for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before it could dis- miss the objection. Key Issues The amendment permits the Authority to dismiss an objection for non-appearance on the part of the ob- jector without formally hearing the objection. The power to reinstate an objection on application by the objector is retained unchanged. Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Child Support Living Allowance Amendment to Child Support Act Key Issues Where the custody of a child is shared between par- ents, each parent should be treated as being both a liable parent and a custodian. The living allowance for each parent should be calculated as if both par- ents have full custody of the child. However, the term “dependent child” was defined to exclude any child in respect of whom the person is liable to pay child support. A dependent child could therefore not be taken into account for deter- mining the living allowance, and the legislation did not reflect the policy intent. Paragraph (c) of section 30(5) has been repealed to correct this. Application Date These amendments are effective from the date of assent (13 March 1992). Introduction Child Support will generally be assessed by way of a basic formula which takes into account a liable parent’s income, their current living circumstances, and the number of children for whom they are liable to pay. Background Under a formula assessment, a liable parent’s rel- evant income is reduced by a living allowance. The level of the living allowance is dependent on the li- able parent’s current living circumstances. Section 30 of the principal Act provides that the living allow- ance is increased by the maximum family support payment for each “dependent child” living with the liable parent. 21 Recent Legislation - Gaming and Lotteries Amendment Act makes Consequential Amendments to Revenue Acts Introduction The Gaming and Lotteries Amendment Act (No 2) was assented to on 29 August 1991. This legislation primarily amends the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 but also makes a number of con- sequential amendments to the Gaming Duties Act 1971, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and the Income Tax Act 1976. Background The Gaming and Lotteries Amendment Act (No 2) 1991 amends the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1971 in two areas. First, the amendment allows the New Zealand Lotteries Commission to conduct instant games as games of chance, rather than as prize competitions. Secondly, it improves the regulation of a variety of instant games. Key Issues A number of consequential changes to the Income Tax Act 1976, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Gaming Duties Act 1971 were made by the Gaming and Lotteries Amendment (No 2) 1991. New Zealand instant games, such as Instant Kiwi, have been brought within the regimes in the Gam- ing Duties Act 1971 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which applies to other types of New Zealand lotteries. The definition of “gambling” in the Accruals Rules in the Income Tax Act was consequentially amended to include New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, and New Zealand prize competitions. Application Date These amendments came into force on 29 August 1991. 22 List of Inland Revenue Publications as at April 1992 No.SubjectLatest Print IR 24IRD Calendar .................................................................................................................
