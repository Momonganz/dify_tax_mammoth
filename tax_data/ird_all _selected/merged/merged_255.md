The Manufacturers’ Network (formerly known as the New Zealand Manufacturers and Exporters Association) represents the interests of manufacturers throughout New Zealand. Virtually all of our manufacturing members are engaged in exporting or import-competing. The Manufacturers’ Network is New Zealand's only focused and independent voice for manufacturers, tracing its history back to 1879. Manufacturing makes up 12% of New Zealand’s GDP, is worth $23bn per year and employs over 250,000 people in mostly highly-qualified and well-paid jobs. Introduction The core issue we believe the Tax Working Group (TWG) should be focused on is how the tax system influences investment incentives for productivity activity, and how the tax system can be more fairly balanced in a way that will facilitate higher growth in productive industries. This needs to especially focus on high-value activities which provide exports and import- competing income and well paid jobs, like manufacturing. Productivity in New Zealand has lagged for decades behind many of our competitors and all manufacturers know the challenges involved in trying to access capital for investment in their businesses. Promoting growth in high value sectors of our economy critical for ensuring long term sustainable growth for New Zealand – this growth allows living standards for everyone to increase over time, and helps expand the tax base to allow New Zealand to pay for the services and infrastructure investments we need to make a more prosperous country. One of the most obvious and most significant areas of misalignment in our tax system is that while productive activities are taxed in the form of wages and profits, speculative activities, such as the capital gain obtained through investment properties, are largely untaxed. While the introduction of the bright line test appears to have helped as a stop-gap measure, the Tax Working Group should investigate more long term policy that avoid an arbitrary time frame as the measure for speculation and investment. The test for what’s a speculative activity is quite simple – it’s an investment where the operational returns alone wouldn’t be enough to justify the investment. (Auckland) rental properties and many dairy farms, which rely on capital gains for returns, with profits largely used for debt servicing are prime examples. What that means is that the vast majority of capital and new money through bank loans goes into existing assets – which not only crowds out productive investment, but has other social implications, such as the house price inflation we have seen over recent decades. House price inflation has made owning a home, particularly in Auckland, near to impossible for many first home buyers, and has added wage pressure for businesses as workers find housing costs taking up a larger proportion of their income. The above graph shows total lending (including bank and non-bank sources) across four sectors. The divergence of housing lending from business lending is clear. While the difference was not overly significant at the start of the series in 1998 (housing lending represented 146% of business lending), now the gap between housing and business lending is vast (226%) – a fact that is self-reinforced by the big appreciation of house prices. Not to forget – while this is outside the remit of the Tax Working Group – that the excessive levels of borrowing in the housing sector, largely financed from off-shore, puts an additional burden on exporters through artificially elevated exchange rates. Over the years, there has been a lot of discussion around how exactly this imbalance could be addressed. From our perspective, the challenge is finding the most effective and efficient way to do so, helping to direct our economy towards more productive investment while still meeting the housing needs of the growing population, particularly in Auckland. Whatever changes are made, these need to work with a wider Government strategy to move our economy towards high-value and productive activities. In addition, we believe there are a number of other changes within the tax system which can help promote productive growth in New Zealand, such as the expansion of R&D tax credits, with a focus on ensuring these are easily and efficiently accessible for companies in areas of process innovation as well as product innovation. It is critical that any R&D tax policy has a significant focus on the development side, which under the current system does not receive much attention. We now have a discussion document for the current Governments policy to re-introduce R&D tax credits, with an aim of increase our R&D spent to 2% of GDP – however, the Tax Working Group should also review the case for further expansion in the future. 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 Jun 1998 Apr 1999 Feb 2000 Dec 2000 Oct 2001 Aug 2002 Jun 2003 Apr 2004 Feb 2005 Dec 2005 Oct 2006 Aug 2007 Jun 2008 Apr 2009 Feb 2010 Dec 2010 Oct 2011 Aug 2012 Jun 2013 Apr 2014 Feb 2015 Dec 2015 Oct 2016 Aug 2017 NZ$ Millions Total Lending by Sector Housing Business Agriculture Personal consumer Source: RBNZ C5 The above graphs, sourced from the OECD, show New Zealand’s R&D spend vs the rest of the OECD, as well as how R&D expenditure is treated in terms of tax. It is evident that we are in the bottom half of the park, and have work to do to raise our R&D spending and subsequent innovation levels. Accelerated depreciation for plant and equipment is another critical policy the TWG should consider to push our economy in a more productive direction. Accelerated depreciation for productive plant and equipment is commonplace in many countries around the world – the fact we do not have a similar policy, puts our manufacturing and export businesses at a disadvantage. This policy would also better reflect the productive life of equipment, many of which need to be upgraded before they are fully depreciated under the current system. As a matter of fact, the current depreciation regime stifles innovation in manufacturing processes, as it acts as a disincentive to investing in current manufacturing technologies. Accelerated depreciation would have positive flow on effects, in terms of productivity and competitiveness, particularly at a time where even more rapid changes in technological requirements are expected to keep up with the competition globally. This policy can also be achieve in a largely revenue neutral way over the medium term – while there may be additional costs in the first few years of implementation, as companies are able to claim higher levels of depreciation, this will be offset in later years, where lower levels of depreciation can be claim and through increased tax revenue via higher profits and productivity. Specific questions in the background paper 1. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? The core issue we face as a country is positioning our economy and businesses to thrive and become more competitive and productivity. This in turn, and paired with more balanced tax settings, will enable a more fair economy with higher living standards. This does, however, come with a number of challenges:  Effectively correcting tax imbalances that favour unproductivity assets (largely existing housing) over productive investment. This imbalance also worsens inequality, as owners of existing assets accrue the most wealth via rent seeking and tax free capital gains, at the expense of those without homes as well as businesses and individuals who bear a higher proportion of the tax burden because of this.  Effectively supporting and incentives investment in innovation and R&D to build more high value businesses who can dominate export niches and effectively compete with imports – this requires both product and process innovation, and any policy needs to explicitly reflect this.  Meeting the investment needs of a rapidly changing technology environment – we must keep up with new developments in order to stay internationally competitive. Manufacturers face the need to continuously update plant equipment to increase productivity and maintain competitiveness, as well as the spectre of networked manufacturing technology, which holds great opportunities but will require significant ongoing investment.  Creating a tax system that can meet the challenges which come with supporting an aging populations.  Meeting the needs of an education system which will need to continue to improve and develop to meet changing skill requirements from businesses. 2. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? Firstly, the introduction of a capital gains tax, or similar policy, aimed at correcting the imbalances that favour investment in existing assets over productive businesses. Follow through on the Government’s policy to introduce R&D tax credits to incentivise innovation and work to expand these credits in a way which will boost New Zealand’s total R&D spending (both business and Government) closer to that of the OECD average. We need to see continued investment in education and training to deal with the changing skills needs into the future, as well as addressing the skill shortages that already exist. In house training of staff will continue to be a critical part of up skilling existing staff to ensure companies can improve productivity and deal with an aging work force. In house and other forms of training by businesses could be supported through the tax system – for example, there could be some tax loading on the cost of training and up-skilling staff, such as a 120% deduction on such costs. Such a policy would, however, need very clear rules around what is eligible training to ensure the policy is not misused. Increased training and continued up-skilling of staff will not only help businesses continue to compete, but will help move our people into better paying jobs and help them cope with the futures changing skill requirements. 3. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future focussed tax system? No comment. 4. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? In the longer term, if the tax imbalances which favor investment in existing assets can be corrected, we would want to see more capital moving into productive businesses, both as a proportion of total capital and of new lending. A measureable outcome would be increased investment in capital goods in productive industries. We would want to see this leading to growth in exports, import-competing businesses and productivity. 5. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? One challenge to fairness in the tax system going forward is how offshore companies are treated when compared to New Zealand companies. This is most obvious with the ongoing issue of creating settings where large multinational companies, i.e. Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, who hold significant market share in New Zealand are able to pay little to no tax for their sales. This creates an unfair advantage for any local company visiting to compete in similar spaces and adds additional tax burden onto individuals and local companies who correctly pay their fair share of tax. New Zealand needs to continue its work with other jurisdictions and the OECD as this issue is worked on. It is very likely that a cross jurisdiction approach will be needed to solve the issue and ensure such multinationals pay tax in the countries they operate. 6. New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? We currently see this as a good approach. The simplicity of the system allows it to be relatively efficient and simple. The more complex we make the tax system, the more opportunities will arise for tax avoidance and increase the cost of operating the system, and for businesses to comply. 7. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? For manufacturers and the wider aim of increasing productivity and innovation in New Zealand, we do see a case where adjustments to the tax system could effectively encourage and support activities that would enable these outcomes – which would flow on to wider growth in the economy and enable higher wages and living standards. The first would be around support for innovation – R&D Tax Credits – as detailed in our introduction. These second is accelerated depreciation for plant and equipment – also detailed in the introduction. This can facilitated increased investment in critical plant and equipment needed to improve productivity and remain international competitive. The policy can also be achieve in a revenue natural way – depreciation can be claimed at an earlier stage of an investments life cycle, but the overall size of the deduction would remain the same. 8. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Currently, owning homes and benefitting from future expected capital gains is the largest form of retirement saving in New Zealand. Settings over decades has hardwired this into our culture. We do believe there is scope for better encouraging retirement savings, which should largely come in the form of making sure investment incentives between other forms of retirement savings and investment in housing are more equal. This would also have other benefits, in moderating demand for existing housing for investment (pushing up prices) and increasing the capital stock in other areas (such as Kiwi saver, bank deposits, stock investment and business investment) that would help to flow on to higher capital availability for productive investment. 9. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? Currently, our tax system does not get the balance right between the productive economy and the speculative economy. This is evident in the continued cycles of rapid house price appreciation and the large proportion of new bank lending going into the purchase of existing homes and by the ongoing struggles that productive companies have to access new capital at a fair rate for investment. 10. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? While our tax system is relatively efficient, it can always be made simpler for businesses to comply. The TWG should investigate any areas where compliance costs can be efficiently reduced while maintaining the integrity of the system. 11. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Firstly, any tax measure aimed at maintaining natural capital needs to be implemented in a balanced and fair way. For example, the current emissions trading scheme, which has flaws in its exemptions towards agricultural emissions. Secondly, there is room for better incentivising for companies to upgrade plant and equipment to reduce emissions. Both the previously mentioned R&D tax credits and accelerated deprecation policies could help in this area. However, this could also come in the form of a specific tax credit or deduction for companies who are reducing their emissions. This would needs consideration as to its specific set up and rules to ensure it could not be misused. 12. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? One deduction which further promotes investment in non-productive assets is how tax can be deducted from interest payments on loans for rental and investment properties. This provides an unfair advantage for investors, who already benefit from large capital bases which make access to new capital much easier, over first home buyers. 13. What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Refer to introduction and previous questions. 14. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? No additional comment. 15. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? As we have seen in recent decades, the tax imbalance favoring investment in assets, paired with supply issues and the failure to keep up with demand, especially in Auckland, has resulted in dramatic increases in house prices. This obviously impacts everyone who is trying to find a house, especially impacting those without existing assets, who have benefitted from the rapid appreciation. The other side of this coin, is the pressure it has put on businesses. As housing costs have risen, workers find it hard and harder to afford to live in good homes close to where they work. This has added significant wage pressure and lost productivity through increased travel times, while businesses have not seen any corresponding increase in productivity or profits. 16. Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? The main concern we have is that any tax policy is well designed to effectively correct the imbalance between productive and speculative investment. While this may take the form of a capital gains tax, we are interested in any policy proposition that has the best change of efficiently solving the issue. However, while we would largely agree with a capital gains tax on residential and commercial investment property, we need policy makers to put serious consideration into how this may impact businesses, if they policy had any reach into sales of businesses beyond their land and commercial properties used for business. The value of – in our case – manufacturing businesses grows, when owner and staff are able to grow their business through better processes and better products and services. This should lead to increasing profits, which are then taxed. So a capital gains tax must not punish owners who add value to their business, aside from increases in land and property value. Therefore, any capital gains should focus on speculation in assets but not add additional taxes onto productive businesses. If New Zealand does introduce a capital gains tax, this would need to be implemented across all residential house investors fairly and with little to no exemptions. 17. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Our main concern around a land tax is how it would impact businesses. For example, if such a tax came in the form of an ongoing fair rate of return tax, this could favor big businesses, who have the capital backing and ability to pay. Where smaller business, who are more likely to have cash flow issues between orders may be hit hard if such a bill happens to fall at the wrong time. 18. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Any environmental tax needs to be implemented and charged across all emitting sectors in a fair way – this is to ensure that any emissions we do have a spent in the most productive way. We currently have an imbalance in this area, which the exemptions to the emissions trading scheme, leaving out agriculture emissions, while other sources have to pay. This exemption simply incentivises further investment in agriculture in a way which does not take into account its environmental impact, at the expense of businesses who do bear the cost of their emissions. 19. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Firstly, the introduction of an R&D Tax Credit, as we are expecting in some form from the current Government, would help small businesses investment more in innovation. Currently, the R&D grants system favors larger, more established companies who are able to put in the time and effort to apply and win grants. The current support system, administered through Callaghan Innovation, makes it comparatively easy for larger firms to in effect receive a 20% R&D tax credit, while smaller firms have to go through a complicated application process to receive a ‘Project Grant’ - and most SMEs find that not to be worth their while. As such, it constitutes a regressive tax. Small businesses find it hard to keep with investment needs in equipment. The introduction of accelerated depreciation for productive equipment could really help small businesses overcome these hurdles to grow and remain competitive, especially as technology requirements continue to increase. Lastly, there is some merit in a progressive tax rate for companies. We do not have any specific proposals in this area, but we would be very interested in any work the TWG could put forward in this area. 20. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? No comment. I appreciate being giving the opportunity to promote comment on behalf of our manufacturing members to this Tax Working Group. Regards, Dr Dieter Adam Chief Executive The Manufacturers’ Network

Submission by to the Tax Working Group Te Awheawhe Tāke on the Future of Tax 30 April 2018 Presented by: Dr Oliver Hartwich Executive Director The New Zealand Initiative PO Box 10147 Wellington 6143 \[1\] The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 2 1. Introduction and summary 1.1. This submission on the future of tax is made by The New Zealand Initiative, a think tank supported primarily by chief executives of major New Zealand businesses. In combination, our members’ revenues account for one third of New Zealand’s economy and provide employment to more than 150,000 people in New Zealand. The Initiative undertakes research that contributes to the development of sound public policies in New Zealand which help create a competitive, open and dynamic economy and a free, prosperous, fair, and cohesive society. 1.2. We strongly support an efficient tax system while recognising that no tax system can stand still. We agree that that the ability of the government to raise revenue ‘rests ultimately on the consent and acceptance of all New Zealanders.” 1.3. The Initiative has produced several reports over recent years which bear directly on some of the issues raised by the Tax Working Group in its background paper. These provide the foundation for our thinking and submissions herein. 1.4. Submissions: A. Income Redistribution 1.4.A.1. The tax system should not be used as a device for further income redistribution. It is a myth that income inequality is rising in New Zealand just as it is that economic growth drives economic inequality everywhere. At present the top four deciles of the household income distribution fund government spending which benefits the bottom six deciles. The taxable income of top earners is very responsive to changes in the top tax rate. 1.4.A.2. The sources of contemporary income inequality matter. Educational attainment, the proportion of the adult population not in paid work, the hours worked, and employment age are all relevant factors. 1.4.A.3. Household formation and structure reflects perhaps up to half of disposable household income inequality while higher housing costs hit those on lower incomes hardest. B. Capital gains and Wealth taxes 1.4.B.1. Capital gains and wealth taxes are not a recipe to solve the housing crisis. Only an increase in housing supply can achieve this. Matters other than wealth taxes should be investigated including boundary and density rules, local government funding, scalable construction models, building incentives and regulatory processes. C. GST as a housing incentive 1.4.C.1. Furthermore, the tax system can incentivise and facilitate increased housebuilding through GST equivalent payments from central government to local authorities on all new housing. D. Tax Credit where it is due 1.4.D.1. In New Zealand 91% of government spending is done by central government with 9% done at sub-central (local government) level. The bulk of local government funding comes from rates (property taxes) and so we do not see The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 3 much jurisdictional competition between councils. Whether a council is doing well or not, it will be always able to tax its property owners. However, councils doing a great job to attract businesses and create more housing are not automatically remunerated for their efforts. 1.4.D.2. While central government typically benefits from economic growth local government typically funds most infrastructure which makes that growth possible. Through the trialling of special economic zones, incremental regulatory devolution, revenue and cost sharing for extractive industries, taxes could more closely mirror economic activity across New Zealand. Growth can be encouraged overall and especially in areas where it is efficient to do so. E. GST Exemptions 1.4.E.1. No exemptions should be granted from GST. For the clear reasons which originally designed New Zealand’s GST system cost and efficiency are maintained with a no exemptions policy. If redistribution targets are to be pursued these are better achieved openly and through direct measures. F. Lifestyle Taxes 1.4.F.1. The New Zealand Initiative is highly sceptical of lifestyle taxes (alcohol, tobacco and junk food). There is no strong evidence that such taxes will achieve the intended public health outcomes. 1.4.F.2. We are concerned that these taxes regressively penalise those with the least ability or inclination to change their preferences. 1.4.F.3. Furthermore, we are unconvinced that lifestyle taxes are required to address externalities. 2. Income redistribution 2.1. Income can be measured at the individual, family or household level. It may be measured as pre-tax or post-tax market income or as disposable income (i.e. net of taxes and including government cash benefits). The Tax Working Group’s briefing papers themselves point out that it is not clear whether income or wealth inequality is increasing, decreasing or staying the same. It depends on what one measures. 2.2. In our 2016 report The Inequality Paradox: Why Inequality matters even though it has barely changed, Dr Bryce Wilkinson and Jenesa Jeram examined a wide range of evidence and measures. 2.3. The report concluded it is a myth that the increased income share for top income earners in New Zealand is due to a growing share of investment income in national income due to accumulated and concentrated wealth. Increasing labour income has been the main driver. 2.4. In addition, the real stock of capital in New Zealand has not grown faster than GDP. The private wealth ratio has instead risen because of the alarming increase in house process. 2.5. Changes in household structure also materially influenced household income inequality. The report found that on the evidence perhaps half the increase in disposable household The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 4 income inequality was due to these changes. High housing costs hit those on lowest incomes hardest. Housing is a necessity and these costs cannot be avoided. 2.6. Against this backdrop of a less than conclusive case for spiralling income or wealth inequality, The Inequality Paradox pointed out that those earning high incomes paid more, much more, in taxes. Treasury research indicated that by 2010 only the top 40% of income tax payers were net taxpayers. i.e. the lowest six deciles of tax payers received more in cash and transfers than they paid in income tax and GST. 2.7. The taxable income of top income earners is very sensitive to the top tax rate and increases to it could lead to very disappointing results. 2.8. The New Zealand Initiative therefore recommends against any income tax changes to redistribute national income. 3. Capital Gains, Wealth Taxes and Housing 3.1. Our submission here relates to wealth and capital taxes in the housing context only. 3.2. The New Zealand Initiative has published extensively on the housing issues which confront New Zealand: A. Priced out: How New Zealand lost its housing affordability, Michael Bassett and Luke Malpass (2013) B. Different places, different means: Why some countries build more than others, Michael Bassett and Luke Malpass (2013) C. Free to Build: Restoring New Zealand's Housing Affordability, Michael Bassett and Luke Malpass (2013) D. Up or Out: Examining the Trade-Offs of Urban Form, Jason Krupp and Khyaati Acharya (2014) E. Empty nests, crowded houses: Building for an ageing population, Jenesa Jeram (2014) 3.3. The Initiative submits that there is no need or sense in enacting new wealth or capital taxes to non-family home properties to somehow incentivise housing availability. The basic requirement is a supply of affordable housing, fit for purpose and demographic circumstances. This is first and foremost an issue of supply. 3.4. The factors which have accumulated over time to create New Zealand’s current housing crisis are well understood: They range from the planning system and the culture it has created to the limitations on the supply of land. They include questions of infrastructure funding and financing as well as matters relating to the size and the structure of the construction industry. 3.5. None of these are amenable to amelioration by the imposition of wealth, asset or capital- based taxes. We recommend no action in this regard save reference to Paragraph 4 below. The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 5 4. GST and Local Authority Funding 4.1. A key constraint on local government’s ability to fund housing infrastructure (and disincentive to actively build the same) is the narrow range of funding options available to local government. Councils derives most if not nearly all their revenue from rates. 4.2. Local government needs a structure to share in the proceeds of population and housing growth. A key recommendation was made in Free to Build: Restoring New Zealand's Housing Affordability (2013) by Bassett and Malpass. 4.3. We recommended that local authorities receive an encouragement grant for every new house built in their area, provided the house meets minimum delivery deadlines from application to completion. Grants would be benchmarked on the GST levied on the house, recognising the impact of GST on hose process. 4.4. For example, for a house and land package of $600,000 inclusive of GST central government would pay the council $78,260.88 as a one-off grant. It would be a straightforward calculation and involve no new compliance costs to infrastructure or service providers. 4.5. These grants would also foster a pro-development attitude within councils and provide a predictable cash flow to local governments by increasing their revenue from ore developments. It would also incentivise councils to speed up and stream line application processes. 5. Empower local New Zealand 5.1. The Initiative’s 2015 report In the Zone: Creating a toolbox for regional prosperity by Eric Crampton and Khyaati Acharya described a range of measures that could be adopted to promote regional prosperity. 5.2. A key recommendation was revenue sharing between central and local government based on growth and economic activity promoted within a region. A portion of the new income generated from increased activity in a region would be allocated to the local council. 5.3. A revenue sharing mechanism would apportion payments on improvements over a base period. Councils would have a greater incentive to provide high quality infrastructure. This would change growth to be seeing as a virtue and help to overcome resistance to change which is seen in some regional quarters. 5.4. It is possible to provide indicative estimations. Auckland Council collects roughly $1.45 billion in rates with other revenue bringing that up to $3.5 billion. As at 2014 Auckland contributed 35.3% of national GDP. If taxes correspond to GDP share, then Auckland contributed $21.7 billion of the $61.5 billion of the tax revenues collected by the government. 5.5. If Auckland received an even share of any increase in taxes it remitted to central government than a 1% increase in activity/taxes would see a $217 million increased tax take of which Auckland would receive $108 million. 5.6. Correspondingly higher amounts would be remitted for higher growth rates. For example, a 5% increase would see $542 million back into Council coffers. The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 6 6. GST Exemptions 6.1. No exemptions should be granted from GST. If redistribution targets are to be pursued these are better achieved openly and through direct measures. Direct cash transfers are usually more efficient that redistribution attempts via the tax system. Our 2016 paper The Outside of the Asylum by Eric Crampton compares New Zealand’s clean GST regime to messier overseas examples.The report is a cautionary tale about the perils that arise from introducing exemptions. 7. Lifestyle Taxes 7.1. The New Zealand Initiative has analysed lifestyle taxes (alcohol, tobacco and junk food) and has concluded that such taxes should be rejected on two main grounds. First, there is no strong evidence that lifestyle taxes will achieve the intended public health outcomes. And second, evidence that these taxes will work is necessary but not sufficient: overriding personal liberty requires a strong justification. 7.2. Our 2016 report The Health of the State by Jenesa Jeram looked at the public health studies that are used to justify sugar taxes and other junk food taxes. The Health of the State found many common flaws in such studies. A major flaw is that many studies that claim strong price-responsiveness focus on consumer expenditure but do not consider the fact people might be downshifting to cheaper brands or cheaper sizes ("family sized" or bulk items). Switching from Coca-Cola to homebrand cola will cost less but will not yield health benefits. 7.3. There is also insufficient evidence to suggest that junk food taxes will materially reduce obesity. In Official Information Act documents released to the New Zealand Initiative, the Ministry of Health found "insufficient evidence that a sugar tax would be effective in reducing obesity". 7.4. The regressive nature of lifestyle taxes is also a concern, as it has the potential to increase (not decrease as public health advocates claim) financial and health inequities. Imposing a regressive tax on poorer people ‘for their own good’ is only likely to be beneficial if the targeted population see it that way and respond accordingly, otherwise it is deeply punitive. Our 2018 report Smoke and Vapour: The changing world of tobacco harm reduction by Jenesa Jeram finds that tobacco excise system is now causing more harm than good. 7.5. The ability to ring-fence revenue (also known as hypothecated taxes) for positive expenditure (health services, health promotion, education, etc.) does not justify lifestyle taxes. If the purpose of the tax is to discourage behaviour, then the tax will not raise much for these programmes. And if these health-promoting programmes are as valuable and laudable as experts claim they are, then why not make the case for funding them out of the existing government budget? 7.6. Lifestyle taxes also cannot be justified on the grounds of addressing ‘externalities’ and recuperating the cost to taxpayers. For example, it is an unfortunate truth that the costs of obesity to the public purse over a lifetime are likely to be much, much lower than the direct medical costs of disease because of fiscal savings in foregone superannuation. Meanwhile, it has been acknowledged by The Treasury that smokers more than “pay their The New Zealand Initiative: Submission to the Tax Working Group Page | 7 way” in the tobacco excise they pay compared with the costs they might impose on the health system. 7.7. Alcohol excise is a blunt tool for addressing the harms of excessive drinking, when a range of more targeted measures can be implemented. 7.8. Though a strong evidence base is necessary for any new policy, it is not a sufficient justification for introducing one. Any policy also needs to be scrutinised on a philosophical basis. Lifestyle taxes are a blunt policy tool that affects the entire population: is this an acceptable reason for overriding personal liberty? 7.9. If lifestyle tax advocates ignore the benefits of consuming these products (the enjoyment people get), they ignore the very reason people might not act the way advocates want them to. 7.10. Lifestyle taxes are likely to be regressive, are not supported by an evidence base, might not address the costliest fiscal problems, and are unlikely to guide behaviour in ways policymakers necessarily intend.

Tauranga Property Investors’ Association PO Box 15-033 TAURANGA 3114 Email: 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Tauranga Property Investors’ Association’s Submission to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax 1. The Tauranga Property Investors’ Association was established in 1994 as a non-profit organisation for people who own or otherwise have an interest in residential, commercial or other investment property. Affiliated to the New Zealand Property Investors’ Association, the local association has 280 members representing a large group of experienced investors from a variety of backgrounds. Our members take pride in providing good quality homes for their tenants. 2. Thank you for the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand Tax System New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? 3. There is already a high level of focus and analysis on property taxes in New Zealand and our view is the current broad based system is simple to understand and works well. The assumption that rental property receives tax advantages is untrue. It is well known that the IRD have repeatedly said that property investment does not receive any tax advantages. A study commissioned by the New Zealand Property Investors Federation, by financial and economic consultants Morgan Wallace, shows that the marginal effective tax rate for rental property is actually higher than the majority of other assets. 4. In each of the last five years NZ rental property owners have paid tax on approximately $1.5b of rental income. The importance of rental properties to a local economy should not be understated. In addition to the provision of a home for tenants, property owners contribute significantly to their local economy by employing tradesmen and service industries such as plumbers, electricians, painters, carpet layers, property management companies. They do this through their spending on maintenance, upgrading properties, banking, insurance, Local Authority Rates and all the other costs which will have resulted in substantial GST payments to Inland Revenue. 5. The current system provides a good balance of providing somewhat cheaper rental prices for tenants while still encouraging investment in property where yields may be low, while still \[1\] contributing significantly to New Zealand's taxation requirements and local employment and property related expenses. Taxes and Behaviour: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? 6. The rental property sector is often incorrectly labelled as an unproductive sector, but rental property contributes hugely to the local economy through employment in the property related trades and services, banking and insurance companies while also providing homes for these workers and providing tax to Government. 7. The majority of rental property owners are just regular people trying to make a living and provide for their retirement. They are contributing to society by providing much needed housing while contributing to the local economy. The government have historically seen the value of private investment in rental properties because the government is unable to provide all of the housing required. There now seems to be a shift in focus with proposed taxes specifically targeting property investors, which will strongly discourage this form of investment. It is hard to see the merit in reducing the available rental stock because private investment in rental property benefits society and should be encouraged. Not everyone wants to own their own house. Retirement savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 8. We do not agree. A good tax system should not favour one investment over another or make investment in any type compulsory. There are many ways that people can provide for their retirement that suits their own individual circumstances and changing any taxes to penalise a sector of investors such as rental property owners may put groups of people off investing in anything at all. Discouraging personal accountability and ownership of investments for their own future may discourage people from investing or saving for their retirement. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system. Fairness and balance: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? 9. Rental property owners already have an increased level of scrutiny through the IRD having a Property Tax Compliance Unit and a Bright Line Test. It seems unfair that there is not a similar level of focus on buying and selling shares, the TPIA feel that a bright line test should apply to all investment types to fairly tax speculation, not just focus on property. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system: What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? 10. It is important to note that the income derived from assets is taxed just as a person's labour is taxed and that assets are frequently purchased from income which has already had tax paid on it, taxing these assets again would be very unfair. 11. There can be a number of unintended consequences with the introduction of new targeted taxes for example if something like a Capital Gains Tax was introduced that excluded the family home in order to reduce other taxes, there could be large unintended consequences, such as the reduction of people willing to invest in income producing assets such as rental properties and would encourage more money going into higher priced but non-productive family homes. 12. No new taxes should be introduced for New Zealanders, but better enforcement of current tax laws in particularly around share market speculation would increase the tax revenue and promote fairness and consistency of investment types. 13. Ring fencing of losses should not be implemented. This is said to be a loop hole for rental property investors but this is not true as all business can offset their costs and losses against other income. To specifically disallow this for property investors sends additional discouragement to property investors and will dissuade new investors from investing in this much needed sector to increase supply of rental properties. Chapter 7: Specific challenges. Housing affordability. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 14. Allowing losses on rental property to offset other income tax payable is an important aspect which allows owners to provide and maintain their investment return while being able to charge cheaper rent than would otherwise be required. Additionally, not taxing capital gains on a long-term investment also allows rental property owners to maintain their investment return and charge less rent. It is regularly assumed that that the ability of rental property owners to claim expenses such as mortgage interest, council rates, insurances and maintenance costs means they have an advantage over homeowners when buying property. This is not true. A rental owner gets rental income and pays tax on the profit (after expenses) they make while a home owner gets accommodation to offset these expenses. 15. Higher taxes have had no effect on housing affordability in any country that has them. Higher taxes specifically on rental property will increase the cost of providing rental property leading to either a reduction in supply, an increase in price, an increase in overcrowding or a likely combination of all three. Capital gains tax: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 16. New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax. Many people will still want to invest their money into property and this would encourage spending on larger more expensive family homes and reduce the investment into farms, businesses, shares, rental property and other assets. 17. A targeted Capital Gains Tax would be complicated to administer and is unlikely to raise significant tax income. 18. If a Capital Gains Tax is to be introduced it should include the family home as well as shares and other assets. Land Tax: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 19. New Zealand should not introduce a Land Tax. A Land Tax excluding the family home would have unintended consequences that would encourage more development of expensive homes on large sections of land which would not help alleviate the current housing and rental supply shortage. 20. A tax based on the value of an asset does not mean that the owner has the income to be able to pay for the tax. Local council rates on property in New Zealand are already expensive. A Land tax should not be introduced in New Zealand. 21. A land tax would increase the cost of providing rental properties, leading to reduced supply, increased rental prices, an increase in overcrowding and most likely a combination of all of these. 22. A land tax would increase business costs which would increase the price of all goods and services. 23. It would be complicated for mixed use premises, such as home and incomes, mixed-use commercial/residential properties and farms. We do not wish to be heard in support of this submission. Yours sincerely Simon Darmody President, Tauranga Property Investors’ Association \[1\]

This submission is made on behalf of Trade Me. We are New Zealand’s largest online auction and classified listing platform. We are an NZX and ASX listed company. We facilitate millions of transactions each year between our 4 million members, and employ approximately 600 people (primarily in Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch). Given the breadth of our operations, we have a broad and general interest in the future of tax in New Zealand. However, we focus mainly on our support for a fair regime for the collection of GST on imported low-value goods. We have structured our submission in line with the chapters in your Submissions Background Paper. Chapter 2: The future environment We agree that a number of the themes discussed in this chapter will impact on the tax system. We would like to add that: ●In the gig economy, there is likely to be a growth in independent contractor workers, which may put pressure on the PAYE system. To ensure compliance remains high and the cost of complying low it will be important that workers are provided with automated and easy to use tools to assist with their tax obligations (e.g. some independent contractors will struggle to budget for provisional tax cycles and others levies, such as ACC levies). ●It is important that New Zealand continue with its programme to address base erosion and profit shifting of large multinationals. This is necessary to ensure that New Zealand based companies subject to tax obligations can continue to compete against global giants. We must have a tax system that meets our revenue needs while not unduly restricting our ability to engage with the rest of the world and which ensures New Zealand remains an attractive place to do business. We would support New Zealand’s tax rate trending towards the OECD average, but are aware that given our broad based tax regime a comparison of the income tax rate alone would not necessarily be an apples with apples comparison. Any change in the company tax rate would need to consider the differential between the company tax rate and other rates (such as the personal and trust income tax rates) in order to avoid tax sheltering and to ensure New Zealand’s imputation regime remains appropriate. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system We agree that the ultimate purpose of taxes should be to improve the wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders and agree with the established criteria used in past tax reviews (domestically and internationally). The tax policy consultation process is also an important part of our tax system. In addition to IRD providing a formal window to consult, we think it is important for IRD to proactively seek out relevant stakeholder groups and engage with those stakeholders. It is becoming increasingly difficult for a business to stay across every public sector consultation paper that is relevant to its operations. If the IRD proactively identifies stakeholders that are likely to be materially affected by changes and proactively engages with those stakeholders, then policy outcomes will be more robust. For example, Trade Me can offer a unique perspective in relation to the design of any proposed regime for the collection of GST on low value imported goods and we would welcome IRD proactively contacting us at key stages in the development of any such policy to ensure that our market knowledge is appropriately captured (e.g. to ensure that proposed definitions will work in practice). Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Trade Me supports the current broad-based, low-rate tax system that applies in New Zealand. We would not support taxes common in other OECD countries (such as payroll taxes). We support the previous elimination of taxes such as excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty and cheque duty, and would not support the reintroduction of these taxes. It is an anomaly that GST is not levied on low-value imported goods we support the development of a fair regime to collect GST on these goods. We have provided additional information on this in our response to Chapter 5. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system In general terms, Trade Me agrees that the current system strikes an appropriate balance between the competing interests. 2 Trade Me does not support the concept of a progressive corporate income tax regime. We believe large and small companies should have the same tax rate to ensure that there is a level playing field. If Government wishes to encourage growth of certain small companies this should be achieved through a targeted and transparent grant regime (rather than a lower tax rate). However, we do support progressive individual income tax rates to address inequality. This part of our submission particularly relates to the following two paragraphs in the Submissions Background paper: “Due to the growth of online shopping there is an increasing volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected. This is because the GST (and other duties owing on these goods is below an administrative de minimis. The rationale for the de minimis is to achieve a balance between the administrative costs of collecting the GST at the border and the revenue collecting the GST at the border and the revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the clearance of goods at the border. The Group has been asked for advice on this by the Minister of Finance and has already provided that separately. Recent developments suggest there may be cost-effective options for collecting GST on low value imported goods. In particular, from 1 July 2018 Australia will become the first country to require offshore suppliers to that sell more than AU$75,000 per year of goods valued below AU$1,000 to Australian consumers to register for and charge GST on these sales. This follows on from the fact that many countries, including New Zealand, have required offshore suppliers of digital services to domestic residents to register for and collect GST.” Given our interest in the collection of GST on low value imported goods, we are wondering if the advice already provided by the Tax Working Group to the Minister of Finance will be published? We support, in principle, the collection of GST on these goods. In particular, and as expanded below, we support: ●A fair regime to collect GST on imported goods; ●FurtherexplorationoftheoptionsforcollectingGSTonimportedgoods,including how the different options could influence compliance; ●Carefuldraftingofanydefinitions,toensuretheregimedoesnotnegativelyimpact on competition in the online shopping and advertising markets; and ●An appropriate transition period that allows businesses to comply.

That’swhy,whenthepreviousGovernmentintroducedGSTonintangiblegoods,we supportedtheintentofusingelectronicmarketplacestocapturetaxableactivitieswherethe underlying supplier and consumer did not interact. Consistent with this, we support the development of a fair regime to collect GST on low value imported goods. It is an anomaly that GST is not levied on these goods and this creates a distortion between retail purchases from New Zealand based retailers and from international online retailers. We understand the competing interests here because we have both domestic and international sellers trading on our platform. However, care needs to be taken in the design, drafting and implementation of any regime for the collection of GST on low value imported goods. Otherwise, a different set of distortions would be created (which would advantage some types of online platforms, over others, and lead to adverse consumer outcomes). We believe our experience of providing a platform for domestic and international sellerswillbehighlyrelevanttoIRDandCustomswhenconsideringhowtodevelopa regime for the collection of GST on low value imported goods. Over the past 19 years of operating online, we’ve found that laws work best when they are: ●straightforward and easy for consumers to understand and apply; ●practicalforbusinessesandtraderstooperationaliseandenforcewithclear definitions; ●implemented in a pragmatic way; and ●consistent online and offline. FurtherexplorationoftheoptionsforcollectingGSTonimportedgoods, including how the different options could influence compliance Asnotedinyourpapera“goodtaxsystemisonewherethetaxdueisactuallycollected” and the cost of compliance needs to be materially lower than the revenue collected. AnimportantconsiderationforGSTonlowvalueimportedgoodsisthecollection mechanism.WehavehadtheopportunitytoreviewacopyofadraftIRDandCustoms consultation paper released under the OIA. That paper mentioned three possible avenues: ●The supplier or ‘marketplace’; ●The carrier or freight forwarding organisation; and ●The consumer at Customs. 4 However, the draft consultation paper did not show whether these options were robustly considered, or whether other options (e.g. placing the collection obligation on the credit card schemes) were considered. The draft consultation paper proposed that New Zealand take a similar approach to Australia. Yet even in a market the size of Australia, the ATO is anticipating a number of suppliers and marketplaces will not comply with the new obligations in respect of low value imported goods. We understand that the ATO has indicated that it expects the maximum level of compliance of offshore suppliers may be as low as 50%. Given the differences in the size and market dynamics between Australia and New Zealand, we believe the compliance rate may be even lower in New Zealand. Accordingly, we believe more consideration needs to be given to placing the GST collection obligation on carriers in New Zealand, who have a presence in New Zealand (which will improve compliance), particularly since carriers will already have processes in place for the carriage of high-value imported goods. An alternative, may be placing the obligation on the credit card schemes. In our view if the obligation was placed on entities with a local presence (such as a carrier or card scheme), then conscientious offshore suppliers and marketplaces who want to promote their services to New Zealand customers will streamline their sites and products to recognise that GST will be collected (e.g. in their pricing guides), but would not be at a disadvantage to less conscientious suppliers and marketplaces (who would not otherwise collect and account for GST). If the obligation is not placed on organisations with a local presence, a significant portion of GST collected from complying entities would need to be spent on enforcement and compliance. Alternatively, in the absence of an appropriate enforcement regime the lack of compliance could create genuine market distortions and questions around the regime’s overall utility. Careful drafting of any definitions, to ensure the regime does not negatively impact on competition in the online shopping and advertising markets The way the definitions are crafted may have significant consequences for compliance and collection, and the potential to affect the level of competition in the online shopping and advertising markets. Any new regulations need to be future-proofed, or New Zealand risks creating a new set of distortions in the market. For example, consider the structure of a traditional taxi co-operative in New Zealand against the structure of the Uber ride-sharing service. Uber has structured their operations in such a manner that each driver who operates via the platform separately contracts with the customer. As a result, the applicable GST threshold is considered for each driver, and not for Uber at an organisational level. The outcome of this is 5 that there is a significant portion of ride-sharing activity (and associated transactions) on which GST is not being collected. We believe that if any definition of “marketplace” is not sufficiently thoughtful and well constructed, this could result in a shift in the manner in which the online shopping and services are structured. For example, if social media platforms are not captured by the definition but bespoke marketplaces are, this would provide them with a 15% competitive advantage on price, which would distort activity across different business models. If the policy does favour using online marketplaces or suppliers to collect GST, all platforms, both onshore and offshore, including social media should be captured by the relevant definitions. In addition to the GST collection benefits, we believe this would have consumer protection benefits. Providing a trusted and safe platform for buyers and sellers to transact is extremely important to us (e.g. we provide support to our sellers to help ensure they comply with their obligations under the Consumer Guarantees Act and Fair Trading Act). Our concern is that by creating a GST collection environment which gives a 15% benefit to less structured platforms, this may reduce the level of protection afforded to New Zealand consumers. An appropriate transition period that allows businesses to comply. There will be compliance costs if the GST regime is changed. It will take considerable resource on our part to collect GST on behalf of our offshore sellers. This will include site changes and also re-negotiating of key contracts with overseas sellers (some of which may decide to pull their products from the site and New Zealand rather than incur the additional GST costs). Our experience in making changes to our site to comply with the new Australian model is that it has been more operationally challenging than expected. For example, historically we had not collected records regarding whether sellers are separately GST registered, and we also need to implement different product approaches for low value and high value goods. We would be happy to provide additional information on this to IRD to assist with their policy development process, to ensure that the transitional period and arrangements are fair. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system Trade Me supports the current broad-based tax approach. We do not consider that New Zealand should introduce material transaction or turnover taxes or additional payroll taxes. We believe further analysis is required to consider whether New Zealand should adopt an equalisation tax as an interim measure for non-resident online retail. 6 Chapter 7: Specific challenges As noted above, Trade Me does not support a progressive company tax rate. Rather we support small and large businesses having a level playing field in terms of their taxation obligations. We support a broad GST regime with few exceptions. We are aware of recent suggestions that the GST threshold should be changed on sugary drinks to promote healthy eating. These sort of varying rates are difficult to implement in practice. We see a huge range of goods traded over our site, and have experience interpreting standards and product requirements in respect of these goods. There is often considerable grey. We believe it is important that the taxation laws are clear, as this helps to reduce compliance and enforcement costs. Through our operation of Trade Me Property and Holiday Houses we are generally interested in any proposed capital gains tax or any other proposed taxes that could impact on property ownership, rentals and short term accommodation. We will watch the development of any proposed policy with interest, and the regime should ensure that any changes do not create unnecessary pain points in the real estate or accommodation markets. If a capital gains tax was introduced, we would strongly support payment of any such capital gains tax only on realisation (i.e. not on an accrual basis). Thank you for considering our submission. We would also welcome the opportunity to discuss our submission in person with the Tax Working Group. Sincerely, Jon Macdonald Chief Executive Officer 7 \[1\]

Feedback on Future of Tax 1 30 April 2018 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz TRUSTPOWER SUBMISSION: THE FUTURE OF TAX Introduction and overview Trustpower Limited (Trustpower) welcomes the opportunity to provide a submission to the Tax Working Group (TWG) on the Future of Tax in NZ. By way of background, Trustpower employs around 700 staff spread across many regions in NZ, with a head office in Tauranga, many regional site offices, including a call centre in Oamaru. Trustpower is an active participant in New Zealand’s energy markets as both a multiproduct retailer and renewable electricity generator. We have had a long-standing commitment to renewable energy. Our generation portfolio comprises nearly 100% hydro-generation. Trustpower recognises the Government is seeking to understand how issues such as climate change, agricultural emissions, and water quality can be addressed through taxation. TWG has been asked to consider whether there is a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base. It is this key area which is the focus of our submission. What tax issues matter most to you? As a hydro-electricity generator and user of water resources, the prospect of environmental taxes, royalties for water use, or economic resource rental, are of considerable interest to Trustpower. The ‘Future of Tax: Submissions background paper’ provides no precision on the underpinning policy drivers. The paper makes reference across a range of approaches from environmental taxes, or resource royalties or economic rent taxes. The former is motivated by environmental impacts, while the others are not. Understanding the Government’s motive would assist decision making, as a resource rental charge would require a very different approach to a cost recovery charge, for example. It would therefore be helpful if the TWG could signal whether the potential charge on freshwater is a means to create revenue for funding water management activities, to earn a return on public assets, to incentivise efficient water use by users, to address environmental degradation, or perhaps to address social issues such as iwi rights and interests? Without having anything concrete to comment on, our submission instead appeals for consideration and caution over the following matters –  Non consumptive water use does not contribute to resource scarcity. This raises the question of how many times the resource use might be taxed? Feedback on International climate change negotiations 2 30 April 2018  Wariness of employing an approach that might affect investment decisions, and hydro electricity production decisions.  Water that is used to generate electricity is a public good for the displacement of fossil fuel use – charges should therefore be different.  Linked to the above, unintended consequences in relation to the NZ hydro/electricity market and more broadly on climate change and renewable energy goals of the government.  The likelihood that costs may be passed on to consumers.  Awareness of distinctly different impacts depending on what mechanisms and metrics would be used, e.g. kw/hr, m3, or m3/sec charges.  The need for meaningful consultation once the policy drivers are understood and options can be developed /shortlisted. Trustpower understands the TWG is willing to discuss issues with key interested parties. We would welcome the opportunity to speak with the TWG and the secretariat to discuss the points raised, if required. Regards, ANNABEL DAVIES RISK, REGULATORY, STAKEHOLDER MANAGER \[1\]

VTT is a Council Controlled Organisation of New Plymouth District Council and is responsible for delivering regional development activities and regional tourism promotion in New Plymouth District and the Taranaki Region. VTT would like to commend the Government and the Tax Working Group on the open and engaging process they are undertaking to review our tax system and welcome the opportunity to be part of discussions on the future of tax in New Zealand. Objectives for the tax system VTT notes the Government’s stated objectives for the New Zealand tax system as set out in the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference. Given our role in promoting economic development VTT supports the following objectives: • A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy • An overall system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. VTT supports the existing tax system as being broadly fit for purpose, relatively simple and easy to administer. Purposes and principles of a good tax system VTT notes and supports the principles of a good tax system outlined in the Submissions Background Paper: • Efficiency • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal adequacy • Compliance and administration costs • Coherence. In addition, the Government has stated its desire to lift New Zealand’s productivity. Improving the productivity of the New Zealand economy is vital to improving overall economic performance. VTT believes that the tax system may have the potential to incentivise increased productivity, and that this is an important consideration when examining any changes to the existing system. 2 Specific Challenges VTT notes the specific challenges the Government has requested advice on, and makes the following comments. Capital gains tax (CGT) VTT notes that the recently extended ‘Brightline test’ means that New Zealand already essentially has a CGT focused on discouraging property speculation. We suggest its effectiveness should be evaluated prior to the introduction of any more comprehensive form of CGT. The compliance and administration costs involved in a more comprehensive form of CGT relative to anticipated revenue should be carefully considered. If the intention of such a tax is to address issues of housing affordability then we encourage the Government to take an evidence-based approach and look at the impact of CGT in other similar jurisdictions where it has been introduced. The potential disincentive to people saving and investing for their future should be taken into account, particularly in light of demographic projections and the need for New Zealanders to take greater personal responsibility in planning for their retirement. Land tax VTT notes that the existing local government rating system is based on the land and/or capital value of rateable properties, meaning that landowners already pay a form of land tax. The introduction of an additional land tax on the same asset, to generate revenue for central government, would be contrary to the principle of equity and fairness and would run counter to the objective of a tax system that is efficient and fair. The introduction of a land tax has the potential to disproportionately and negatively impact on regions where a high proportion of land is held in high value properties. This includes regions with high value but non-productive residential properties, such as Auckland and Queenstown, and regions with high value and highly productive farming properties, such as Taranaki. If one of the goals is to promote the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy then a further land tax is unlikely to achieve that. Progressive company tax rate A common outcome of increased productivity in a business is growth and the employment of more people. The introduction of a progressive company tax rate, with lower rates for smaller business, has the potential to discourage businesses from growing and contributing to a sustainable and productive economy. VTT is in favour of measures that encourage start-up ventures and support small businesses. VTT suggests there may be other options that could be explored to meet this outcome, including a time- bound mechanism such as a tax-free threshold for businesses in their early years of operation, for example. This could be linked to the payment of provisional tax to ensure fledgling businesses understand and comply with their tax obligations. Taxing for environmental outcomes Tax is one of the tools that the Government can use to try and achieve a particular desired outcome (environmental, social or other). Whether tax is the best tool and what the appropriate mechanism 3 might be is dependent on the particular policy outcome being sought and should always be considered in light of the principles of efficiency, equity and fairness, and coherence. VTT encourages the Government to ensure that any specific proposal for using tax to achieve environmental outcomes is considered in a well-informed and consultative manner with affected stakeholders to achieve the objectives of an effective tax system referenced above. GST VTT notes that the current GST system of having very limited exemptions is simple, fair and easy to administer. Other issues to consider Given VTT’s role as a regional development agency, we suggest the following issues should also be considered when looking at the future of our country’s tax system. Costs of tourism infrastructure Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of international tourists visiting New Zealand. Increased tourism brings a number of positive benefits including additional revenue for central government in the form of GST on tourist expenditure. The increase in visitors has also resulted in increased demands on local infrastructure throughout the country, the costs of which is largely borne by local government and, ultimately, local ratepayers. VTT encourages greater redistribution of the tax income that central government receives from visitors to New Zealand to local government, to help meet the costs of the increased demand on their local infrastructure. Transitioning to a zero-carbon economy In light of recent announcements related to off-shore oil and gas exploration and the Government’s intention to become a zero-carbon economy by 2050, it is important that there is well planned and appropriate investment in R&D and infrastructure that supports the conversion to clean energy. But equally important is sustaining investment in existing energy-related infrastructure to continue to meet the energy demands of a growing economy over the next decades. VTT suggests that one option for helping to ensure our country and our economy is progressing towards a clean energy future would be to hypothecate revenue the Government receives from oil and gas royalties into a fund dedicated to investing in clean energy related R&D and the infrastructure necessary for both the zero-carbon economy and sustaining existing energy related infrastructure during the transitional phase required to reach this goal. R&D Tax Incentives Since the Tax Working Group was formed the government has launched a separate process for submissions on an R&D Tax Incentive Proposal developed by MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan innovation. Venture Taranaki intends to make a submission on this issue via that specific process. This is due to be submitted by 1 June 2018. 4 Charitable status of regional development activities In addition to these comments on the broader tax system, there is also one specific tax issue which affects Venture Taranaki’s operations which we wish to bring to the Tax Working Group’s attention. VTT exists as a charitable trust under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. Prior to the Charities Act 2005, VTT had charitable status from an income tax perspective (exempt from paying income tax on any annual operating surpluses). When the Charities Act 2005 came into force, charities that wished to retain or obtain income tax- exempt status were required to register with the newly established Charities Commission. VTT applied to the Charities Commission to maintain its tax-exempt status and was turned down, along with a number of other major regional development agencies including Christchurch and Auckland. Subsequent case law has upheld the Charities Commission decision not to award charitable status to regional development agencies. This decision was based on very historic legal precedent and therefore denied the contemporary principles of economics and tax in reaching that decision. This decision has resulted in the major development agencies being required to pay tax, for example, on income that they receive from local and central government. VTT notes that regional development agencies are primarily public good entities that receive the majority of their funding from central, regional and local government and philanthropic organisations. There are several recognised regional development agencies identified as implementing regional growth strategies in partnership with central government. Providing these regional development agencies with charitable status would acknowledge their purpose in working for the benefit of the community and would ensure that any funding they receive can be rightfully and fully applied to the public good.

VTT is a Council Controlled Organisation of New Plymouth District Council and is responsible for delivering regional development activities and regional tourism promotion in New Plymouth District and the Taranaki Region. VTT would like to commend the Government and the Tax Working Group on the open and engaging process they are undertaking to review our tax system and welcome the opportunity to be part of discussions on the future of tax in New Zealand. Objectives for the tax system VTT notes the Government’s stated objectives for the New Zealand tax system as set out in the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference. Given our role in promoting economic development VTT supports the following objectives:  A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected  A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy  An overall system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. VTT supports the existing tax system as being broadly fit for purpose, relatively simple and easy to administer. Purposes and principles of a good tax system VTT notes and supports the principles of a good tax system outlined in the Submissions Background Paper:  Efficiency  Equity and fairness  Revenue integrity  Fiscal adequacy  Compliance and administration costs  Coherence. In addition, the Government has stated its desire to lift New Zealand’s productivity. Improving the productivity of the New Zealand economy is vital to improving overall economic performance. VTT believes that the tax system may have the potential to incentivise increased productivity, and that this is an important consideration when examining any changes to the existing system. 2 Specific Challenges VTT notes the specific challenges the Government has requested advice on, and makes the following comments. Capital gains tax (CGT) VTT notes that the recently extended ‘Brightline test’ means that New Zealand already essentially has a CGT focused on discouraging property speculation. We suggest its effectiveness should be evaluated prior to the introduction of any more comprehensive form of CGT. The compliance and administration costs involved in a more comprehensive form of CGT relative to anticipated revenue should be carefully considered. If the intention of such a tax is to address issues of housing affordability then we encourage the Government to take an evidence-based approach and look at the impact of CGT in other similar jurisdictions where it has been introduced. The potential disincentive to people saving and investing for their future should be taken into account, particularly in light of demographic projections and the need for New Zealanders to take greater personal responsibility in planning for their retirement. Land tax VTT notes that the existing local government rating system is based on the land and/or capital value of rateable properties, meaning that landowners already pay a form of land tax. The introduction of an additional land tax on the same asset, to generate revenue for central government, would be contrary to the principle of equity and fairness and would run counter to the objective of a tax system that is efficient and fair. The introduction of a land tax has the potential to disproportionately and negatively impact on regions where a high proportion of land is held in high value properties. This includes regions with high value but non-productive residential properties, such as Auckland and Queenstown, and regions with high value and highly productive farming properties, such as Taranaki. If one of the goals is to promote the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy then a further land tax is unlikely to achieve that. Progressive company tax rate A common outcome of increased productivity in a business is growth and the employment of more people. The introduction of a progressive company tax rate, with lower rates for smaller business, has the potential to discourage businesses from growing and contributing to a sustainable and productive economy. VTT is in favour of measures that encourage start-up ventures and support small businesses. VTT suggests there may be other options that could be explored to meet this outcome, including a time- bound mechanism such as a tax-free threshold for businesses in their early years of operation, for example. This could be linked to the payment of provisional tax to ensure fledgling businesses understand and comply with their tax obligations. Taxing for environmental outcomes Tax is one of the tools that the Government can use to try and achieve a particular desired outcome (environmental, social or other). Whether tax is the best tool and what the appropriate mechanism 3 might be is dependent on the particular policy outcome being sought and should always be considered in light of the principles of efficiency, equity and fairness, and coherence.

Our vision is for a New Zealand that promotes, values and supports effective volunteering for the benefit of individuals and communities – and our mission is to promote, support and advocate for volunteering. We are the only national organisation in New Zealand that focuses purely on volunteering. We hold the ‘big picture’ and are in a position to liaise, work with, and advise volunteers, government and business sectors. This helps ensure that volunteering occurs within a positive environment where it is encouraged and fostered. Over the past 16 years, VNZ has raised the profile of volunteer groups, activities, and management. We promote volunteering and its value to New Zealand society through advocacy, sharing stories, and producing tools like the Best Practice Guidelines and Competencies for Managers of Volunteers. We have a membership of 80 national and regional member organisations that involve volunteers in their work programmes. We advocate on behalf of these organisations and for other groups that are not members but are aligned to our mission and values. New Zealand’s Voluntary Sector New Zealand has more than 120,000 non-profit organisations, contributing to 4.4% of GDP when taking into account the volunteer labour contribution, and is similar to the contribution of the entire construction industry. The most up-to-date data on the volunteer sector states that in New Zealand there are more than 1.2 million volunteers who give more than 157 million hours of unpaid labour to the sector. In 2008, 67% of the Community and Voluntary Sector workforce was made up of volunteers; 90% of New Zealand non-profit organisations employ no staff, and rely solely on volunteers. 1 1 From the The New Zealand Non-profit Sector in Comparative Perspective, 2008 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Volunteering New Zealand (VNZ) appreciates the invitation to make a submission to the new Tax Working Group (TWG). We see the review as an opportunity to make changes to the tax system to benefit volunteers and volunteering in New Zealand. VNZ’s main recommendation to the Tax Working Group is that it give real consideration to the design and implementation of a Volunteer Tax Rebate. Such a rebate would stand as an effective way for the government to signal a real commitment to promoting volunteering in New Zealand. Whilst a volunteer tax rebate has been considered by previous governments, one has never been implemented, and the current tax review seems like the perfect opportunity to consider this option once again. Our submission also considers existing tax policies in the charitable and voluntary sector and raises some issues in this area that the TWG may wish to investigate further. 2. EXISTING TAX POLICIES Volunteering NZ strongly believes in the benefits that the voluntary sector provides to the economy and society at large; investing in volunteering is investing in wellbeing. Volunteering is also a very effective tool for cultivating social and human capital as it helps strengthen community ties and empower individuals. Tax policies that facilitate and promote charitable acts are thus viewed in general by our organisation as likely to provide a net public and private good. We have identified five existing policies that support the charitable sector in general: 1. Exemption from Income Tax for Charities: Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are exempt from paying income tax on any form of income received by the organisation, so long as the income is used for exclusively charitable purposes, and does not benefit any of its individual members, trustees, or associates. 2. Exemption from Resident Withholding Tax for Charities: Charities can be exempted from RWT being deducted on interest they receive. 3. Exemption from Fringe Benefit Tax for Charities: Employees of charitable organisations do not have to pay an FBT on benefits received insofar as the benefits are used to promote the charitable work of that organisation. 4. Tax Rebates for Individual Donors: Individuals are eligible to claim a tax credit of 33.33% for any donations they make valued $5 or greater to approved donees. 5. Tax Deductions for Companies and Māori Authorities: Companies and Māori authorities can deduct the total amount of donations they have made from their yearly taxable income, as long as this amount does not exceed their net income. 3. ISSUES WITH EXISTING POLICIES Generally speaking, VNZ does not have strong reason to believe the existing tax policies for charities are ineffective or failing to work as intended. However, we have been made aware of three issues that have raised some public concern, which the Working Group may wish to investigate or address. We would stress that at present our organisation has heard of these issues only anecdotally and only wish to draw them to the Working Group’s attention for further potential investigation. 1. Tax-Exempt Organisations Failing to Use Income for Charitable Purposes: There is public concern over real and possible instances where an organisation that receives a charity-related tax exemption arguably might not use income for charitable purposes. 2 A recent example described in the NZ Herald would be the Trinity Lands dairy farms. 3 2. Eligible Organisations being Denied Tax Exemptions: Some organisations which do not wish to or cannot register as charitable organisations are being denied the tax rebate which should be available to them as ‘donee’ organisations. This may be reducing the amount of donations they receive, as potential individual donors would be unable to claim a rebate. 3. Issues for Individual Volunteer Reimbursements and Honoraria Payments: We have heard reports of individuals receiving tax penalties and/or ACC levies applied to their reimbursements and honoraria paid to them through their volunteer contribution. These issues involve subject matter that are either too technical or beyond VNZ’s capacity to investigate to properly account for in this limited submission. We would thus encourage the Working Group to conduct independent research into these issues to develop a more precise understanding and determine appropriate solutions, if indeed they are required. (We have also been made aware of concerns about charitable organisations’ inability to receive tax refunds of imputation credits attached to dividends from NZ companies. We are told that Philanthropy NZ is making a more detailed submission to the Working Group on this issue, which we would support pending further research.) On the whole, VNZ approves of existing tax breaks, but is interested in the possibility of the government creating a new one specifically for volunteers, as no such exemption yet exists. 4. PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION VNZ supports all tax policies that empower or incentivise individuals and organisations to contribute to the general projects of philanthropy. Whilst we support the existing tax policies in this area, we observe that there are no tax policies that specifically support or promote a 2 Consider the issues raised in this blog post: https://letstalkabouttaxnz.com/category/charities/ 3 http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?objectid=11883740 culture of volunteering in New Zealand. As NZ observed a decrease in volunteering hours of 42% from 2003-2014, perhaps a tax policy response could help moderate this trend. 4 This is why we are proposing that government consider a volunteer tax rebate for individuals. Another reason to support a tax rebate for volunteers might be found in the Government Policy on Volunteering (2002), which states the government’s vision of a “society with a high level of volunteering,” where volunteers’ contributions are “actively supported and valued”. 5 A volunteer tax rebate would be a tangible and symbolic instantiation of this vision. It’s worth noting that such a rebate has been proposed to government in the past as part of a report published by Ministers Michael Cullen and Peter Dunne in 2006 on tax incentives for charities. 6 VNZ is unaware about the deliberations that prevented such a rebate from being implemented following the past review, but would argue that the current review provides a suitable opportunity to explore the issue once again. Following the advice of the 2006 submission, a volunteer tax rebate could: - Be offered to volunteers who have given time to a registered charity - Require an appropriate receipt or certificate which details hours spent volunteering - Be capped in a similar fashion to the tax rebate for individual donations - Be based on an equal hourly rate for all volunteer work (i.e. not changing based on factors such as expertise, etc) - Be offered only after a set minimum of volunteering hours is met (for an individual) - Recompense only a fraction of the time spent volunteering (so as not to defeat the purpose of volunteering altogether) - Provide an alternative form of reimbursement for volunteers who currently do not wish to claim expense reimbursements from already resource-limited organisations - Provide an economically progressive option for individuals from all levels of society to make charitable contributions, as individuals with lower incomes may view volunteering as preferable (in terms of cost) to monetary donations - Not impact on a volunteer’s eligibility to claim a donation rebate There are many other details that would need to be evaluated in designing such a rebate, such as administrative costs this may impose on charitable organisations, whether or not the rebate should be offered only for specific volunteer services, etc. However, VNZ believes in principle that a rebate could be a useful policy for fostering a healthy culture of volunteering in New Zealand, and would be a strong signal from government to volunteers that it values the cultural and economic contributions volunteering makes to our society. Of the main issues in implementing such a rebate, the two most salient in VNZ’s opinion would be the cost to the taxpayer and the increase in administrative costs it would impose 4 Statistics New Zealand, The contribution of non-profit institutions in New Zealand (infographic), at http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/economic\_indicators/NationalAccounts/non-profit-satellite- infographic.aspx 5 https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/Government-Policy-on-Volunteering/$file/Government-Policy- on-Volunteering.pdf 6 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2006-dd-charitable-giving.doc upon organisations through tracking volunteer hours. An example given by the 2006 report states that “the estimated revenue cost of a volunteer’s rebate based on a $5 hourly rate, a cap of 52 hours a year, and 143,000 volunteers claiming the maximum rebate would be $37.18 million,” which is far from insignificant. 7 New administrative costs would likely arise for organisations in the sector as tracking volunteer hours or providing receipts for such contributions are not required by legislation nor even standard practice. Without further research, VNZ would be hesitant to impose such a cost on smaller organisations. Perhaps the government could offer to bear this cost itself in some way. We would not support a volunteer tax rebate at the expense of organisations. Feedback about the possibility of a rebate that we’ve collected from volunteer organisations has been largely positive, albeit with some reservations. The main concern relates to fear of administrative costs involved in tracking volunteering hours, and the difficulties of designing and implementing systems for accurately reporting on this. But this fear is counterbalanced by another shared opinion that tracking volunteer hours should become standard (if not legally mandatory) practice anyway. Tracking volunteer hours could become useful for the sector and government in other ways as it helps formally recognise volunteer contributions, provides a performance indicator for stakeholders, may assist with internal resource management, and more, as leading research has suggested. 8 An alternative to a rebate for individual volunteers may be for the government to provide grants to organisations based on their number of volunteers or hours spent volunteering. This may also support an organisation’s capacity to maintain and develop a volunteer pool. However, VNZ would consider that an individual volunteer rebate would be a more direct way of recognising volunteer contributions. 5. CONCLUSION In general, Volunteering NZ considers that the tax policies for the charitable sector in New Zealand are supportive, functioning effectively, and in alignment with best international practice. However, maintaining and developing the sector should be considered an ongoing project, always with more room for improvement. We appreciate the large potential costs of providing new tax breaks and this is why our main recommendation is to further investigate the likely costs and benefits of a new tax rebate for volunteers. In addition to the changes and proposals suggested above, we would encourage more research be undertaken concerning the relationship between tax policies, charities, volunteer work, and the economic benefits they provide to society. We also recognise that tax policies alone are not enough to promote the charitable sector, and always encourage that a holistic approach be undertaken by government and community organisations towards this end. 7 This example is based on volunteer numbers from a Philanthropy New Zealand Survey and an expectation that only a percentage of volunteers would claim the rebate, as is the case with the donation rebate. 8 Carolyn J.

The Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society states that “In the future, all public services will use blockchain technology.” https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership i. Voice for Crypto is a group of blockchain and cryptocurrency professionals and enthusiasts. We represent local and global blockchain businesses, exchanges, brokers, miners, traders, lawyers, accountants, and other individuals who are passionate about blockchain. ii. This document has been compiled as a group and all views expressed are the authors’ personal views. iii. Our purpose is to provide guidance and education in order to influence the way that blockchains, distributed ledgers and their tokens are governed and regulated in New Zealand. iv. We believe that New Zealand needs sensible taxation for blockchain products, acceptance by banks, and support for innovation. v. We are concerned that regulators view blockchain technology as a barrier or impediment. This is underlined by the Submissions Background Paper, which states that “Blockchain technologies and the use of cryptocurrencies ... could undermine third-party reporting and withholding of tax.” 1 vi. However, blockchain technologies can provide low-cost and efficient ways of complying with tax obligations. Reviewing their tax treatment and governance represents a significant commercial and social opportunity for New Zealand. 2 vii. Voice for Crypto is committed to working with regulators: together we can make New Zealand an innovative hub for the emerging blockchain and crypto-economy, which we believe will form the backbone of the future digital economy. viii. We are willing to meet with the Tax Working Group (the Group) to further discuss this submission. Please contact Fin Mountfort at .

We believe that blockchain and distributed ledger technology represent a change to the economy and society that will have an impact on a scale similar to the invention of the internet. ii. Our submission is relevant to many of the Group’s focus areas, 3 including technological change and the different business models that will bring, the changing nature of work, and the impacts of globalisation. iii. We agree with the Group’s view that the New Zealand’s tax system has many strengths, but it cannot stand still. The current system is not set up to handle the new digital economy. New Zealand should align with international best practice regarding classifying blockchain products. iv. In particular, we recommend as a matter of urgency that Inland Revenue (IR) remove GST from all crypto-tokens, with the exception of some utility tokens. This is discussed further in section 4. v. In terms of individual income tax, we understand that the tax system must be flexible enough to keep collecting revenue, whatever changes come. Voice for Crypto is not opposed to taxing some blockchain transactions. vi. However, it must be understood by regulators that while, until now, crypto-tokens have primarily been used for speculation and acquired for the purposes of disposal, this will not always be the case. Innovative new decentralised applications (dApps) on the horizon will ‘tokenise’ concepts as diverse as attention to advertising (Basic Attention Token), gold (Digix), file storage (Storj), truly private personal data on social media platforms (Akasha), or voting rights (in decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO)). The United Nations is exploring how blockchain can help us meet the Sustainable Development Goals 4 , while communities in Brooklyn New York are using blockchain to exchange peer-to-peer solar energy (Brooklyn Microgrid Project). vii. In short, crypto-tokens can perform many functions and their value is not always monetary. It will not always make sense to classify a crypto- token as property like IR currently suggests. viii. We recommend that IR makes the changes required to the tax system to ensure fair taxation of the different kinds of functions that crypto-tokens can have. Crypto-tokens are discussed further in section 2c. ix. To cope with the rapidly evolving system for now, we recommend two alternative approaches for income tax: “presumed return” taxation on a portfolio basis and like-kind exchange. These approaches are discussed further in section 5. x. Classification of crypto-tokens as property also creates issues for companies wishing to use these tokens to raise capital. In light of the potential for blockchain technology to drive innovation and economic growth, we believe this is an important issue for the Group to consider. xi. In section 6 we recommend that the tax treatment of tokens used to raise capital be based on the tokens’ underlying nature, and that fundraising entities be allowed to allocate these funds over a multi-year period, if appropriate for the project being funded. xii. New Zealand must be prepared for the future of the digital economy and act in a way that fosters innovation. In its current form, our tax system is impacting the human capital (skills and knowledge) available to New Zealand in the emerging digital economy, as described in the Living Standards Framework. 5 Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 4 xiii. The current situation is providing uncertainty to taxpayers, which is increasing the costs of compliance and administration as well as discouraging investment and participation. xiv. We recommend that IR accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for taxes. 6 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57cd3bd059cc6804d1884b86/t/5a39dbbd419202030eebdc18/1513741249608/NZ+ Unlocking+Blockchains+Potential+-+Dec+2017.pdf x v. We recommend that the Government reevaluates its approach to blockchain technology in a way that allows for innovation, and attracts and retains the talent required to make New Zealand prosperous in the future digital economy. xvi. Voice for Crypto supports the points and recommendations made in the paper produced by the Edmund Hillary Fellowship in December 2017, “New Zealand: Unlocking Blockchain’s Potential.” 6 Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 5 2: Overview of blockchain and distributed ledger concepts 2a Summary i. Blockchain is a revolutionary new development that allows information, for example transaction data, to be shared among many parties, without requiring an intermediary to store or verify that information. At its core, a blockchain is a ledger (or record book) that is open for everyone to read, can only be added to by consensus, and ensures that records are unable to be altered. ii. Bitcoin was the first distributed blockchain token and has shown its strength as a store of wealth, a method of transferring value, and also as a way for users to permanently store data on the decentralised database we know as the Bitcoin blockchain. iii. Blockchain tokens today number over 1700, with new tokens released daily. Some are used simply for transferring money cross-border; others are used to perform complex scientific calculation for the likes of SpaceX rocket launches on a distributed scale. The possibilities for blockchain are endless and many have not been imagined yet. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 6 2b Blockchain and other distributed ledgers i. The term “blockchain” refers to a type of database structure, namely a ledger with transactions grouped into “blocks”, which are then linked together in a “chain”. ii. In almost all cases, blockchain ledgers are distributed, meaning that there are multiple copies of the ledger stored across different computers, or “nodes”. iii. This ensures that no single party can modify the contents of the ledger without agreement from the rest of the group of nodes. iv. To reach agreement on new additions to the ledger, nodes run a “consensus mechanism”, which ensures that there is a single canonical state of the ledger at all times. v. Decentralising consensus (i.e. splitting it between many parties) ensures that no single party has to be trusted in order to trust the contents of the ledger. Because of this, blockchain applications are said to be trustless. vi. Blockchains can be permissionless (i.e. anyone can run a node and participate in the consensus mechanism), or permissioned (i.e. only specific identified parties can participate in the consensus mechanism). An example of a permissionless blockchain is Bitcoin, the first ever blockchain. vii. Permissioned blockchains, on the other hand, are generally preferred by enterprise. These iterations of distributed ledger technology provide many of the benefits of permissionless blockchains (such as a degree of decentralisation and trustlessness), but allow participants in the network to control which parties can run nodes and participate in the consensus mechanism, providing more certainty in terms of security parameters and ongoing operating costs. viii. There are different types of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) that can be used for implementing tokens. Blockchain is only one example of a DLT, however it is by far the most common. It’s hard to say if tokens utilising other DLTs could have different tax implications to blockchain tokens in the future. Currently the applications of other DLTs are similar to how blockchain has been used, and can fit under the token classifications in the next section. Some examples of tokens utilising alternative DLTs include Ripple, IOTA and Nano. ix. In this submission we use the phrase “crypto- tokens” as a generic term to encompass all cryptographic assets, including those on blockchains, other DLTs, and similar technologies that may arise in the future. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 7 2c Crypto-tokens 7 For a comprehensive, albeit complex, classification framework see: http://www.untitled-inc.com/the-token-classification- framework-a-multi-dimensional-tool-for-understanding-and-classifying-crypto-tokens/ For an alternative framework, based on technical characteristics see https://bravenewcoin.com/assets/General-Taxonomy/ Downloads/General-Taxonomy-for-Cryptographic-Assets.pdf i. Crypto-tokens, otherwise referred to as “blockchain tokens”, “cryptocurrencies”, “cryptoassets”, or simply “tokens”, are digital representations of value that are commonly stored and transacted on a blockchain or DLT. ii. There are many different types of tokens, and classification of these can be complex. 7 iii. At the most basic level however, tokens can be classified in to two broad groups: those that act solely as a currency, and those that provide the token holder with rights. iv. Rights tokens can then be further classified based on the nature of those rights. The token rights may be ownership in financial products, ownership in non-financial products, or access rights. v. This gives us four primary classifications for crypto-tokens: • Currency tokens - intended to perform the functions of money, i.e. store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. Usually fungible. • Security tokens - digital representations of financial products, e.g. debt securities, equity stakes, options, or derivatives. • Asset-backed tokens - provide token holders with ownership rights in an underlying asset that is not a security, e.g. gold, land titles, or commodities. • Utility tokens - create utility for token owners, e.g. access to a network, voting rights, or a provision of a service such as file storage. Using electricity as an analogy, utility tokens can be the fuel used to power a blockchain network, as well as being used by applications on that network. This is similar to how electricity powers a network and is used by applications on the network, e.g. a microwave. vi. Tokens can also be hybrids of the above, adding complexity to how these should be treated for tax purposes. In general, most rights tokens will be able to be used as a currency token, however, this is not their primary purpose. We recommend that careful consideration be given to how hybrid tokens are classified and taxed. vii. We have attached potential ways to categorise tokens in Appendix One. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 8 2d Why blockchain is important i. We believe that blockchain technology represents a change to the economy and society that will have an impact on a scale similar to the invention of the internet. ii. In terms of the value of cryptocurrency, in the first week of January 2018 the combined global cryptocurrency market cap reached its peak “all time high” of around USD$850 billion (as of April 2018, due to a downturn in the market, the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is an estimated USD$350 billion). By comparison, even at the peak, the combined market cap of all cryptocurrency was less than that of Apple Inc (USD$900 billion). This indicates there is plenty of room for cryptocurrency to grow and become a “global currency”, as many blockchains aspire to. Many speculators are estimating that the growth of Bitcoin alone could reach a market cap of USD$20 trillion by the turn of the decade. iii. Cryptocurrency is just one way to use blockchains and DLTs. Crypto-tokens have potential use cases as wide-ranging as: • reward for participation in a distributed internet/cloud storage array, using everyday computers to store fractions of data for millions or billions of users; • Oyster Protocol’s Shell creates a distributed mesh-net, allowing for anonymous internet access at a fraction of the cost, as well as peer to peer communication ; • tax payments, welfare payments, and other government functions; • digital identities that are owned by you, rather than a centralised entity; • titles to non-fungible digital assets that can be traded or loaned; • Internet of Things (IOT) micropayments; and • community-based electricity generation and sharing. iv. Nurturing the emerging blockchain economy provides New Zealand access to top entrepreneurs, exceptional technology talent, and sustainable capital for internationally scalable blockchain solutions that: • support a wide range of cultural, social and commercial applications; • provide spillover benefits for NZ’s key economic sectors, including agriculture, tourism, science, and technology; • provides opportunity for Kiwis to develop expertise in blockchain technology and related fields, resulting in high-value employment opportunities and more highly skilled workers; and • gives affirmation to New Zealand’s role as a leading innovation hub, while preserving the reputation and integrity of NZ’s financial markets. v. Novel and powerful token-driven applications can promote aspects of sustainability, fairness, democracy, inclusion, and privacy. This is in contrast to many emergent technologies that exclude segments of the community or further concentrate wealth. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 9 3: How blockchain works i. There are many different types of crypto-tokens that all have different uses and properties. The largest technological division is between tokens that run their own independent blockchain and those that operate as a sub-token on another blockchain—effectively using blockchain as a service. 3a Independent Blockchains i. If a token runs its own blockchain that means the blockchain and its transactions are verified by a group of peers known as miners or validators, who also receive a reward for their work. ii. There are different methods for verifying transactions and earning this reward, the main two being Proof of Work (mining) and Proof of Stake (validating). In most cases, the people performing the mining or validating are rewarded in the native token of the blockchain—Bitcoin miners are rewarded in bitcoin, Ethereum miners in ether and so on. iii. Proof of Work uses computing power to secure the network, validate transactions, and earn rewards for doing so. Miners are incentivised to act honestly by the threat of wasting expensive computing power. The more computing power a miner produces, the more chance they have of claiming the next block reward. iv. Proof of Stake uses the native token itself to secure the network, validate transactions, and earn rewards for doing so. Validators are incentivised to act honestly by the threat of losing all or some of their staked tokens. The more native tokens a validator stakes, the more chance they have of claiming the next block reward. v. Masternodes are a system that requires a node to hold a collateral transaction to take part in important network security and stability tasks. The masternode is rewarded for performing these tasks by the miners and is paid in the native token of the network. The purpose of the collateral transaction is to create a barrier to entry for malicious actors wanting to compromise the network’s security or stability, making it too expensive for most attackers to gain a large enough portion of the network to be successful in an attack. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 10 3b Blockchain as a service i. Ethereum is the primary example of a blockchain service provider for sub-tokens. ii. Ethereum is an independent blockchain in its own right and mines its own blocks, but it also validates transactions for tokens that have been generated on its platform. Tokens don’t require mining themselves and do not take part in securing the Ethereum blockchain. iii. Token types and examples are provided in Appendix One. 3c Considerations for tax treatment i. Most tokens, whether they are from an independent blockchain or not, already serve a range of auxiliary functions beyond simple value transfer, and their usefulness is growing every day. ii. Tokens used in Proof of Stake and Masternodes have the clearest and easiest-to-define secondary purpose of securing the network. However, they are not the only tokens that have a clear secondary function. Even independent blockchain tokens that are not used for network security can be used for secondary purposes, for example, lending.. Many cryptocurrency exchanges enable depositors to lend their BTC to traders and gain a percentage return for providing the BTC loan. iii. Even if the independent blockchain token’s only current purpose is to purchase for disposal, the added complexity is that the function of these tokens is not set in stone. As an example, developers can transition a blockchain from using Proof of Work to Proof of Stake as long as the network agrees, thus changing how the token is utilised on the network. Alternatively, a website service similar to BTC lending could spring up for another token and give that token a legitimate secondary function. Another example is Bitcoin cash, which has recently been changed to allow smart contracts. Previously the sole purpose of Bitcoin Cash was as a method of exchange. iv. Blockchain as a service tokens are even harder to apply blanket rules to. The types of tokens that can operate on these platforms are flexible and their utility is as malleable as updating a website. Deciding whether the token has a secondary use case would need to be done on a case by case basis and be re-evaluated if changed. Most tokens have auxiliary uses beyond being a simple store of value and their use cases are generally evolving. v. In accordance with New Zealand’s property taxation laws, tokens that have a secondary purpose should have their earnings taxed as income but not their capital gains. Tokens that have no secondary purpose or were purchased for the sole purpose of disposal should have the capital gain taxed as income. vi. How and when to tax either type of earnings can be a difficult thing to manage. The volatility of cryptocurrency markets, combined with the onerous and lengthy process of turning cryptocurrency into New Zealand dollars (NZD) to pay the tax, make it difficult to fairly tax individuals for the NZD value at the time the earning was generated. vii. For example, participating in Proof of Stake or running a masternode is largely an autonomous process once your computer is setup, and rewards are earned sporadically. If tax is calculated at the point of earning, price fluctuation can mean even the entire reward may not be able to cover the tax owed after converting first to BTC, through USD, and finally to NZD. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 11 viii. Until there are more robust cryptocurrency exchanges and banking integrations available in New Zealand—with the capability to automate the consolidation of tax obligations as earnings are accrued—it is unreasonably onerous and costly to expect realised gain to be calculated at the time of earning. Doing so risks stifling innovation in the emerging and profitable sector of blockchain technology. 3d Recommendation i. Regulators must consider the different tokens types outlined here and in Appendix One and create smart regulation that takes into account technology advancements in blockchain and distributed ledgers. ii. IR should accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for taxes. For those who have tax obligations resulting from their cryptocurrency holdings, it can be difficult to convert cryptocurrencies in to fiat in order to pay those taxes. iii. While not directly relevant to the Group, the finance and banking industries need to make an effort to understand this new technology and the opportunities it can provide to the public and private sector. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 12 4: GST 4a Current tax treatment i. While there has been no formal guidance on the GST treatment of crypto-tokens, the classification of cryptocurrencies as property infers that GST is applicable on domestic exchanges of fiat currency for tokens, and domestic exchanges of tokens for other tokens. ii. Where businesses accept cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, these are seen as a barter transaction and as such GST would apply. 4b Issues with this approach i. The current application of GST to crypto-tokens causes a number of issues, including double taxation, economic inefficiencies, and distortions. The problems arising from this tax treatment differ depending on the nature of the token (refer to Appendix One for potential token classifications). ii. Where tokens have the nature of a currency, the application of GST results in clear double taxation. A consumer will be required to pay GST when they exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, and again when that cryptocurrency is used to purchase goods and services subject to GST. iii. Where tokens have the nature of a security token, they should be exempt from GST (or zero-rated), as per standard treatment of financial services. The current treatment creates an economic distortion whereby blockchain-issued security tokens will be subject to GST, while equivalent securities issued by traditional means do not have GST applicable. iv. Where tokens are asset-backed, they confer equity like usage or ownership rights over underlying assets (such as property), which may subject to GST in their own right. The application of GST to an asset-backed token will result in economic distortion and may also result in double taxation (if the underlying asset is subject to GST). v. Where tokens provide utility rights, GST should apply only where GST would normally be applicable on that utility. For example, purchase of a token that provides the owner with access to file storage would incur GST, whereas a token that provides the owner with voting rights would not. vi. Further, if tokens purchased by New Zealanders from international suppliers do not attract GST (i.e. if these are not considered to be “imported” to New Zealand) then New Zealand suppliers will have a competitive disadvantage compared to overseas operators. For a fungible product, a 15% price differential will be likely to price New Zealand businesses out of the market.

Other jurisdictions have recognised this issue and made amendments to remove the double taxation of cryptocurrencies. Australia and Japan both removed their equivalents of GST from all digital currencies from 1 July 2017. 8 In March 2014, the United Kingdom outlined that no VAT would be due when exchanging Bitcoin for fiat currencies, a position that was supported by a European Union ruling in October 2015. 9 4d Recommendation i. We recommend that all crypto-tokens be classified as not subject to GST, with the exception of those utility tokens where the underlying utility should incur GST. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 14 5: Income tax 5a Current tax treatment i. IR has released some guidance in relation to the taxation of cryptocurrencies. Broadly, IR has concluded that: • cryptocurrencies are to be treated for income tax purposes as property, rather than foreign currency; • most cryptocurrencies are acquired with an intention to dispose, and any gains made on disposal will be taxable. This is similar to revenue account property treatment; • a taxable gain or loss arises when a coin is realised either in cash (NZD or foreign fiat currencies), or sold for another coin; and • from a miner’s perspective, any proceeds are taxable income, and expenditure incurred in the course of mining will be accordingly deductible. ii. IR has explained that the guidance it released is a reflection of how cryptocurrencies would be taxed under current law (which does not cater for cryptocurrencies as a separate asset). Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 15 5b Issues with this approach i. While IR is to be commended for issuing its timely guidance, we consider that the above approach has several problems. ii. The most immediate challenge is the potential for non-compliance in the blockchain community, simply due to either ignorance of the tax framework due to a lack of detailed guidance (IR’s guidance, while commendable, is too generic), or an inability or reluctance to comply due to the onerous nature of the obligations imposed. iii. IR and the Government must provide the community with certainty and an achievable pathway towards tax compliance. iv. If the aim of the Group is to “future-proof” the tax system, and ensure New Zealand remains internationally competitive in this space, IR and the Group must first acknowledge the difficulty in complying with the current tax framework, and engage the community in devising a practical approach to compliance. v. This is crucial to ensure that New Zealand is not left behind as blockchain technology rapidly evolves. vi. The second issue is the difficulty in designing a tax framework that is “future-proof” and does not box New Zealand into any particular model of taxation. This is significantly harder as the potential evolution in the technology in this space is virtually limitless. Whatever tax framework that IR comes up with now, will have to be flexible enough to adapt to the unknown possibilities that blockchain technology presents. vii. For example, if any country adopts a token as its currency, and the use of cryptocurrency becomes widespread (in loans and derivative instruments), there will be significant problems in the application of the financial arrangement rules. viii. From a technical tax perspective, the guidance and current law treats tokens as a homogenous asset class, where tokens are obtained with the likely intention of disposal. Therefore, any gains on the disposal of tokens will be on revenue account, and therefore taxable. ix. This is not necessarily accurate in light of the characterisation of the different types of tokens as per Appendix One. Treating all of them to be held on revenue account is likely to be unfair as some tokens may well be acquired with the purpose of deriving a continuous stream of “dividend” like income or acquired with the purpose of gaining access to certain services (“utility tokens”). x. Putting aside the obvious possible capital/revenue distinction difficulties between different token asset classes, one issue that might arise from the homogenous treatment of tokens is a breakdown of the withholding tax rules, when a holder of a particular token receives “dividend-like” payments of cryptocurrencies by virtue of their holding. While there are some tokens that provide such returns, “forking” and “airdrops” are also a phenomena that produce a similar effect: • Crypto-tokens that maintain their own blockchain are able to have their fundamentals altered (e.g. block time, reward, or total supply) if a majority of the network agrees to the change. Because major changes require a network consensus to be applied, it can lead to a stalemate within the development community where one faction wants to make a change but can not get enough of the network onboard to approve it. Sometimes when this happens, the minority faction will perform what is called a coin split and deploy their change despite the fact it will not be accepted by the main network. This creates two parallel transaction ledgers that have a shared history before the coin split occurred but diverge afterwards, resulting in what people refer to as a “blockchain fork”. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 16 • This has been seen multiple times in the past, with a notable occurrence being when Bitcoin (BTC) split to Bitcoin Cash (BCH). For example, if you had a balance of 10 BTC before the coin split was deployed, you retained your 10 BTC and also had a balance of 10 BCH at the same address after the coin split on the competing blockchain. These types of splits can happen without the holder being aware they are eligible for coins. In some situations, it can also be difficult or impossible to claim the split coins, for example, when tokens are held on an exchange, the account credited with the new tokens will be that of the exchange, not the owner. • Airdrops are used by new start-ups to bootstrap their crypto-token or by services such as exchanges to encourage participation. They are simply deliveries of an amount of a free tokens, typically, but not necessarily, in proportion to the number of coins held in an account. The OMG airdrop, for example, delivered a small number of OMG crypto- tokens in proportion to the amount of ether held in a wallet. xi. Forking and airdrops present a number of problems: • Does such a “fork” produce a “dividend” in the new coin acquired (by virtue of holding the old coin, so in our example, the Bitcoin Cash tokens acquired), or is it more akin to a share split? • Does an “airdrop” represent a dividend in the new coin, gained by virtue of holding the old coin? • If a “fork” or “airdrop” were classed as a dividend, how would the withholding tax rules work? As there is no single entity that pays out such “dividends” (in the case of a fork), rather it is the “community” that pays it out by voting for the fork. Thus there is no one party that can bear the withholding burden. xii. From a practical compliance perspective, the logical conclusion of IR’s claim that cryptocurrencies are often held on revenue account (and therefore the revenue account property rules apply) might also lead to onerous obligations that will disincentivise compliance, or at the very least makes the rules impracticable to comply with. We discuss this below in the context of coin-for-coin trades. xiii. Under current law, as IR has suggested, cryptocurrency holders are not only taxed on realisation into fiat currency, but a coin-for-coin trade will also be a disposal event that triggers a taxable gain/loss. While in principle this is a logical application of the current law (as it is applied in the context of share or other property trades), we consider this to be practically difficult to comply with in the context of cryptocurrencies. xiv. Traders often buy Bitcoin or Ethereum with the intention of using it to buy other alternative coins. Having to mark-to-market the NZD value of the coins at each trade to get the cost base of the particular coin (and therefore calculate the taxable gain/loss on each trade) would become a compliance nightmare for most traders. x v. For example: • On day 1, A buys 2 Bitcoin at NZ$ 1 each. • On day 3, Bitcoin has risen in value to NZ$ 2 each, and A sells 1 Bitcoin to buy 3 Ethereum. • This means that A has derived a taxable gain on the disposal of 1 Bitcoin (making a profit of $1). • The cost base for the 3 Ethereum is now the NZ$ value of the Bitcoin on that day, which is NZ$ 2. • On day 4, when the NZ$ value of A’s remaining Bitcoin is NZ$4, A sells it for another 3 Ethereum. • This means that A has made another taxable gain on her Bitcoin of NZ$3, and the cost base of the 3 Ethereum is NZ$4. • A now holds 3 Ethereum that she bought for NZ$2 and 3 Ethereum that she bought for NZ$4. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 17 • This means that when she sells any of the Ethereum in future, she will have to apply the “first-in-first-out” approach to determine the cost base of those cryptocurrencies she sold to work out her gain/loss on the sale of the Ethereum. This will be practically difficult for the trader, as tokens are fungible. xvi. Because Bitcoin and Ethereum are more easily convertible from fiat currency (e.g. NZD) they are often used as “on-ramps” to alternate coins. Thus, almost all coin-for-coin trades will involve several transactions. Multiply this across the tens/hundreds of trades a trader might make in a year and compliance becomes daunting. Add the difficulty of sourcing a NZD value for each coin, especially in the context of an extremely volatile cryptocurrency market, and it becomes impractical to calculate the gain/loss on each trade. This is further compounded when traders store their cryptocurrencies in multiple “wallets”, use several exchanges (because not all exchanges trade all alternate coins), and transfer their cryptocurrencies between these wallets and exchanges. In these circumstances, the “first-in- first-out” approach becomes very difficult to apply as cryptocurrencies are fungible and the record keeping for such transfers is significantly more onerous than having every trade go through one wallet and one exchange. xvii. From a historical compliance perspective, if a taxpayer was to compile his tax records only after IR has provided the recent guidance, this will likely lead to significant difficulties. This is because the majority of exchanges only express daily historical coin value in USD, potentially leading to wildly inaccurate cost-bases since the value of the coin would have fluctuated significantly within a day and some would have traded to take advantage of the intra-day volatility. The only way to calculate the true gain/loss would have been to record the USD value at the time of transaction. This instantaneous recording is also impractical going forward due to the volatile nature of the crypto-token since token holders often leave buy/sell orders in an exchange that settle when a certain price (expressed in Bitcoin) is hit. It is then impractical and potentially impossible to determine the exact settlement price in USD if the token holder is not there when the order price is hit and the transaction is settled. xviii. While share traders have to undertake the same process as above, there are computer programs that allow for accurate record keeping. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market is more volatile, and the exchange rates between obscure coins and NZD often vary hugely between exchanges. Thus the compliance obligations become significantly more onerous on the cryptocurrency holders. The problem of inter-wallet and inter-exchange transfers of tokens also does not occur with shares. xix. Because coin-for-coin trades are taxable disposal events, a natural consequence of the above is that traders or cryptocurrency holders will potentially be faced with a large cash-flow issue at the end of the financial year if they do not convert their tokens into fiat currency. The cryptocurrency holder may not want to liquidate their cryptocurrency holdings into NZD to satisfy their tax bill, and it will be unfair to force cryptocurrency holders to do so. While again, this is a problem present in share trades, we submit that the larger volatility in the cryptocurrency market (see the appreciation of Bitcoin in 2017) exposes the cryptocurrency holders to much larger cash-flow issues. xx. The current rules will incentivize holders who have tokens in a loss position to sell them on 31 March (or other balance date) and immediately buy them back (through a crypto to crypto transfer), in order to create a tax deduction. The current rules therefore represent a risk to the tax base with no corresponding revenue upside, as holders in a profit position have no incentive to sell. The only additional revenue (over and above a tax on realisation to NZD approach) the current rules may gather is on traders, but due to the practical issues raised around compliance above, traders may not be willing or able to comply. In any event, any revenue gained is likely to be outweighed by the immense compliance costs faced—not to mention administrative auditing costs. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 18 5c International approaches 10 https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-Australia---specifically-bitcoin/ 11 https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance 12 https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/12/28/loophole-allows-tax-free-bitcoin-exchanges-into-2018/#411f816312fa i. Australia has broadly adopted the same approach of treating tokens as property for the purposes of income tax and capital gains tax. The Australian Tax Office has acknowledged the compliance difficulties (especially in the context of coin-for- coin trades) and is actively seeking feedback 10 . ii. In the United States, tokens are also treated as property for income tax and capital gains tax purposes. 11 Due to the capital gains tax regime in the United States, there is added complexity in differentiating between short term and long term holdings. While recent tax legislation has limited the “like-kind” exemption to real estate transactions from 1 January 2018, it used to apply to coin-for-coin swaps. This exemption for coin-for-coin swaps effectively deferred the taxing point to the point where the tokens is realised for fiat cash. 12 iii. Broadly speaking, both the Australian and the US tax regimes for tokens run into the same compliance and record keeping problems as we have outlined, and in fact are worsened by their respective capital gains tax regime. But if New Zealand does eventually end up with a capital gains tax regime, we will have to consider the same issues. Resolving these compliance issues is an opportunity for New Zealand to positively separate itself from the other major jurisdictions. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 19 5d Recommendation i. As discussed above, the biggest immediate challenge for the Group, IR and the Government is to encourage the blockchain community to engage with tax issues and comply accordingly. This cannot be achieved via a “hard-nosed” approach that demands strict compliance with the onerous obligations under the current tax framework. ii. Encouraging compliance should be a major consideration, and failure to deal with this practically might well lead to New Zealand falling behind other jurisdictions in this rapidly-evolving technological arena. iii. IR should accepting cryptocurrency as payment for taxes. This will encourage compliance, as it can be difficult for holders of cryptocurrencies to convert these to fiat in order to pay for any tax liabilities incurred by those cryptocurrencies. iv. There are broadly two technical issues that needs to be addressed (under current law): • the homogenous revenue account treatment of all tokens; and • cash flow and compliance issues stemming from the application of the existing law to cryptocurrencies. v. We have made two suggestions below that attempt to resolve the above two issues to varying degrees: • a “presumed return” approach on a portfolio basis similar to the fair dividend rate (FDR) method for foreign investment funds (FIF) regime (incorporating a “like-kind exchange” exemption for coin-to-coin trades); and/or • a “like-kind exchange” exemption for the trading of tokens for other tokens. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 20 Presumed return vi. We recommend that IR consider a “presumed return” approach, analogous to the fair dividend rate method for foreign investment funds, for crypto-token holders, regardless of the nature of the crypto-token. We have set out the details below. vii. Crypto-token holders are taxed on a portfolio basis, where they are assessed on a “presumed return” percent of their opening portfolio value. If IR was to adapt the FDR method under the FIF regime, then the quick sale adjustment (adapted across for cryptocurrencies) should only apply if the crypto-tokens are being realised in NZD or foreign currency. Coin-for-coin trades ought not to be taken into account to minimise compliance costs. This has the added benefit of providing cryptocurrency holders the certainty over their tax liability from the start of the tax-year, as such a method effectively caps the tax liability (subject to quick sale adjustment) and cash commitment required at the end of the year. viii. As there are already existing rules that set out how the FDR method works in the FIF context, we consider that adapting this regime to crypto- token portfolios will not be particularly onerous. There are already existing anti-avoidance rules and quick-sale adjustment rules under the FDR method and FIF regime that can be adapted to prevent the erosion of the tax base via crypto- tokens. ix. We recommend implementing an “opt-in” process for the above regime, backstopped by consistency requirements. The rationale for an opt-in is that disposal/realisation basis may be more appropriate for some holder/traders, for example: • small-time investors who are holding low-value crypto-token portfolios and not trading their assets. For these individuals an FDR approach would add unnecessarily onerous reporting and compliance obligations; and • businesses that receive payment in cryptocurrency or hold these as inventory. In a future state where currency tokens are truly operating as a medium of exchange and not expected to appreciate in value, a portfolio basis tax approach would effectively erode the value of an asset that has no income associated with it. This would be analogous to a business with USD holdings and taxing the value of these holdings irrespective of any realised or unrealised gains. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 21 Like-kind exchange x. We also recommend a “like-kind exchange” exemption (explained further below) to complement this “presumed return” approach. The token portfolio is effectively seen as a “black- box” that is taxed at a fixed and capped rate. A “quick-sale adjustment” (under our proposed approach) should only be made if there is a realisation of any part of the portfolio into NZD or foreign fiat currencies. xi. This suggested approach resolves the issues raised with the current approach discussed above: • IR will not have to devise a bespoke regime just to fit the different classes of crypto-tokens, and therefore it will avoid the capital/revenue classification problem of the thousands of tokens with differing properties; • following from above, this approach “future- proofs” the taxation of tokens, ensuring New Zealand is forward-looking with this innovative and dynamic technology. By disregarding the individual properties of whatever new token might bring (where holders/traders might exploit classifications to evade tax) and just taxing a trader/holder on a portfolio basis, this will significantly reduce the risk of tax-base erosion and encourage compliance; • there is no need for withholding by the payer(s) of dividends, since the portfolio is taxed on a fixed rate basis, and there is also no need to classify rapidly emerging new concepts such as forks and airdrops; and • crypto-token holders/traders will not have to account for income tax/gain for each coin- for-coin trade (reducing the compliance and record keeping issues), and this method smooths out the cash-flow issue by capping the tax liability at a certain percent. This will go a long way towards encouraging compliance among the cryptocurrency investing community, rather than outright evasion. xii. If IR is not ready to go ahead with such a radical proposal as the suggested FIF/FDR approach, we recommend a “like-kind exchange” provision. This provision should exempt trades between tokens from taxation under the current “disposal/ realisation” approach (that taxes coin-for-coin trades) and defer the taxing point to when the token is realised into NZD or foreign fiat currency. xiii. This has the obvious advantage of minimising compliance costs on traders who make hundreds of trades (between tokens) in a year, as it removes the need to do the onerous mark-to-market exercise for every trade. xiv. It also reduces the cash flow problem (so holders are not required to liquidate their holdings at the end of the year at unfavourable rates just to pay tax) because traders/holders are effectively only taxed on a realisation into NZD or equivalent basis. x v. While IR may understandably be reluctant to accord special treatment for tokens (as compared to share-trading), this is a quick method of encouraging tax compliance within a community that is ill-equipped or reluctant to comply with the onerous obligations imposed under the current tax rules. xvi. This is an understandable problem since the industry is relatively young and there is little official guidance on the multitude of new issues that might arise as the technology continuously evolves at a rapid pace. The current tax framework is simply struggling to cope with such new technology, and this approach will provide the certainty and the “on-ramp” for the community to tax compliance and engagement with IR. Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 22 6: Capital raising 6a Current tax treatment 13 https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-much-raised-icos-2017-tokendata-2017-2018-1 i. Over the last few years, sales of crypto-tokens to raise funds for business ventures have become increasingly commonplace. In 2017, US$5.6 billion was raised through token sales by blockchain startups. 13 These sales have similar characteristics to Initial Public Offerings and crowdfunding, but in relation to crypto-tokens they are known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), Token Generating Events (TGE), and Security Token Offerings (STO). ii. Based on current guidance from IR, blockchain tokens are property and treated differently than cash infusions for an equity investment. iii. When it comes to taxation, the tokens or coins generated by a company in an ICO will be taxed in accordance with property received at the standard corporate tax rates. In contrast, traditional equity raising is treated as a basis infusion into the business, resides on the balance sheet, and is not treated as revenue raised by the business. iv. Given that the purpose of most ICOs, TGEs, and STOs are to raise funds for development of the underlying blockchain business, this treatment is not appropriate and disadvantages blockchain- based business compared to their traditional counterparts. 6b Recommendation i. As discussed in section 2c, there are four distinct crypto-token types. The tax treatment for fundraising using each token type should be specific to the characteristics of that token. ii. Currency tokens are issued to encourage the adoption and usage of the crypto currency. Funds raised will be invested into currency development to enable wide scale adoption and ensure that the functionality is attractive to users by enhancing features such as security, operability, and integrations into non-blockchain software applications. Traditionally, the raise has been carried out by a foundation or not for profit trust with a board of advisors overseeing the investment of proceeds raised. As the currency is being utilised as a medium of exchange, no revenue will be generated from the deployment of tokens to a platform. iii. Security tokens represent a security, and token holders have rights attached to the underlying asset. In general terms, we believe that the tax treatment should be akin to the underlying Voice for Crypto Tax Working Group Submission 23 asset and treated as a security. Where an ICO is undertaken, it should be considered as traditional debt or an equity fundraise. iv. Asset-backed tokens represent ownership of an underlying asset that is not a financial product. In general terms, we believe that the tax treatment should be akin to the underlying asset. v. Utility tokens give the opportunity for a user to utilise the token it has purchased in the ICO at a later date. vi. Generally most traditional companies raise funds in order to invest into a project to enable it to generate revenue. In most cases, an ICO issuer will have no or very little revenue and will be raising capital to build out a platform to enable the platform to generate network value through use of a token in the platform. The issuing entity is effectively crowd funding a community project. In most cases, investors receive tokens in the network, which could be akin to rewards on Kickstarter type crowdfunding project. Tokens typically do not contain any rights outside the platform. vii. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of the deployment of the tokens issued and the requirement to invest in the platform to further encourage token holders to deploy the tokens they have purchased, it is recommended that the proceeds from the TGE, ICO or STO be taxed as follows: • for utility tokens, treat the funds raised as deferred revenue for tax purposes and only tax the token proceeds when the token holder deploys the token to utilise the services of the platform or purchase a good within the ecosystem; and • for other token types, allow the ICO funds raised to be allocated across the number of years it is contemplated to develop the platform to an economically viable state, to enable the company to operate the platform without significant investment. viii. Taxing 100% of proceeds generated by an ICO company upfront significantly lowers the attractiveness of New Zealand as an economically feasible jurisdiction to issue a token for an ICO company. ix. Allowing the allocation of funds across multiple years of the platform buildout will make New Zealand an attractive destination for companies to base an ICO, increasing the number of international and New Zealand based companies looking to raise significant funds to invest into R&D of blockchain platform technology in New Zealand.

Adapted from Edmund Hillary Fellowship “New Zealand: Unlocking Blockchain’s Potential”: 14 Token typeDescriptionExample Currency tokens Currency tokensA currency token is any token (or coin) that: • represents value and that can be digitally traded by agreement within a community of users; and • functions as a medium of exchange, and/or a unit of account and/or a store of value. Bitcoin Rights tokens Security tokensA security token is any token that meets the definition of a “financial product” in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. In summary, this means that the token must give the holder a right or entitlement: • to financial payment (of interest, to be repaid, to profits); • to an ownership stake in a central entity; • to receive financial benefits generated by the network or a central entity; or • to an option to acquire the above (or otherwise meet the definition of a ‘derivative’).

Based on Robert Greer’s paper “What is an asset class anyway”: 15 • Capital assets (CA) - Provide and ongoing source of value and can be priced on the basis of the net present value of its expected returns; e.g. equities, bonds, and income producing real estate. • Consumable/Transformable Assets (C/T) - Raw material/building blocks that serve as inputs into finished products and have economic value but do not yield an ongoing income stream; e.g. commodities and precious metals. • Store of Value assets (SOV) - Cannot be consumed, nor can it generate income. Nevertheless it has value as a store of value asset; e.g. precious metals, currency, and fine art. Crypto assets can be classified into two core categories with two sub-categories: • Category 1 - General Cryptographic Assets Programmable value that can be used freely by anyone as capital, transformable/consumable or a store of value asset. These also form the foundation where protocol tokens are created, issued and operated. • Category 2 - Protocol Tokens Represent a claim to a capital, transformable/consumable or a store of value asset. As they can only capture a specific market segment limited to the application itself, this limits their use as a store of value.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP – TE AWHEAWHE TAKE This submission is filed for Waikato-Tainui by: Te Whakakitenga o Waikato Incorporated PO Box 648 Hamilton 3240 Page 1 WAIKATO-TAINUI SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP 1. Te Whakakitenga o Waikato Incorporated (Te Whakakitenga) makes this submission to the Tax Working Group – Te Awheawhe Taake (TWG) on behalf of the Waikato-Tainui iwi and its various entities that represent and work for our iwi. 2. Te Whakakitenga welcomes the TWG’s invitation to make this submission and strongly supports the TWG’s focus on hearing and listening to Maaori voices, and on understanding and taking into account Te Ao Maaori as part of the review. 3. This submission for Waikato-Tainui comprises the following parts: (a) Part 1 provides a summary of the key submission points from Waikato- Tainui. (b) Part 2 explains who we are and our perspective on the New Zealand tax system and the TWG review. (c) Part 3 discusses key aspects of the current tax system affecting Waikato- Tainui entities, with a particular focus on the tax framework for charities that enables Waikato-Tainui entities to work for the benefit of our iwi. (d) Part 4 sets out Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on asset/wealth taxes, including any capital gains tax (CGT) or land tax, with a particular focus on the exclusion of Waikato-Tainui whenua and other taonga, and all raupatu and other Tiriti settlement assets, from any such taxes. (e) Part 5 discusses Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on environmental taxes. (f) Part 6 addresses key aspects of the tax system and the review from the perspective of our iwi members and whaanau. 4. Where appropriate, the submission cross-references relevant aspects of the TWG’s Terms of Reference, the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper (Background Paper) and the TWG’s letter inviting Waikato-Tainui to make this submission. 5. Waikato-Tainui would also welcome the opportunity to speak to this submission, and to clarify any aspect of the submission for the TWG. Page 2 Part 1: Summary of Waikato-Tainui’s key submission points 1. Key aspects of the current tax system impacting on Waikato-Tainui: (a) The current tax framework for charities is appropriate and enables Waikato-Tainui entities to work for the benefit of our iwi. Tax charity income tax exemptions, including the current business income exemption, must be maintained. (b) The Maaori Authority income tax regime is also an important regime for Maaori entities, but aspects of the regime need to be reviewed. In particular, the current eligibility criteria for entities to access the regime are too restrictive. 2. Waikato-Tainui’s position on asset/wealth taxes, including CGT and land tax: (a) Any new asset/wealth taxes, including any CGT or land tax, must exclude Waikato-Tainui whenua and other taonga, and all raupatu and other Tiriti settlement (including right of first refusal (RFR)) assets, regardless of how Waikato-Tainui chooses to hold and manage such assets and put them to use for the benefit of our iwi. (b) For Waikato-Tainui, this may be achieved by way of an appropriate charity exemption, but an exemption for the whenua and other taonga of an iwi and Tiriti settlement assets would be preferable, to address the position of all iwi. 3. Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on environmental taxes: (a) Water assets within our rohe, including the Waikato and Waipaa Rivers, are taonga. Waikato-Tainui consumption/use of such assets must not be taxed and Waikato-Tainui rangatiratanga must be respected. (b) However, Waikato-Tainui would support the use of effective tax measures to disincentivise water pollution and the hypothecation of relevant tax revenue for environmental purposes. . (c) Waikato-Tainui would also support the use of effective tax measures to incentivise positive environmental actions and outcomes, such as credits or offsets for riparian planting, forestry, and the like. 4. Key aspects of the tax system and the review for iwi members and whaanau: (a) Getting the tax base mix right is critical, with iwi members’ earnings largely limited to taxable income, not untaxed gains, and payment of GST a disproportionate burden. (b) More needs to be done in relation to housing affordability, which is a critical issue for our people. Community housing entity tax changes and tax incentives for developers who commit to delivering affordable housing (not just social/community housing) should be considered by the TWG. (c) The health and well-being of our iwi is vital, but Waikato-Tainui does not see merit in exempting fruit/vegetables from GST. Effective tax measures to disincentivise unhealthy living, e.g. sugar consumption, would be preferable, with hypothecation of relevant tax revenue for health or recreational purposes. Page 3 Part 2: Who we are and our perspective on the tax system and the TWG review Waikato-Tainui and the Waikato rohe 1. Waikato-Tainui are the tangata whenua of the Waikato rohe. 2. Our iwi comprises more than 73,000 registered members who affiliate to Waikato- Tainui, connected to 33 Waikato hapuu and represented by 68 marae, as shown in the map below. 3. The rohe (tribal region) of Waikato-Tainui is bounded by Auckland in the north and Te Rohe Potae (King Country) in the south, and extends from the west coast to the mountain ranges of Hapuakohe and Kaimai in the east. 4. Significant landmarks within the rohe of Waikato include the Waikato and Waipaa Rivers, the sacred mountains of Taupiri, Karioi, Pirongia and Maungatautari, and the west coast of Whaaingaroa (Raglan), Manukau, Aotea and Kawhia moana. 5. The recent history of our iwi has been shaped by the raupatu (confiscations) that occurred in the 1860s and other Tiriti breaches by the Crown. 6. Through Tiriti settlements and related processes, and the work of Te Whakakitenga and other Waikato-Tainui entities, our iwi has been progressively working to redress the economic, political, social and cultural deprivations suffered by our people as a result of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches and has re-built an asset base. 7. However, there is ongoing mahi to be done, for present and future generations, and Waikato-Tainui members remain overrepresented in the lower quartile for various socio-economic and health measures. Page 4 The entities that represent and work for Waikato-Tainui 8. The Waikato-Tainui entities that represent and work for our iwi hold and exercise kaitiakitanga (stewardship) of our whenua and other taonga and assets that provide the foundations for the economic, political, social and cultural well-being of the iwi. 9. Many of these assets have been returned to Waikato-Tainui through Tiriti settlements and related processes (eg, RFR processes), in recognition of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches and the associated economic, political, social and cultural deprivations suffered by our people. 10. The principal entities that represent and work for our iwi, and hold and exercise stewardship of our assets, which are shown in the diagram below, are as follows: (a) Te Whakakitenga is the umbrella entity for the iwi. Its objectives include protecting, advancing, developing and unifying the interests of our iwi, and it is the sole trustee of Waikato-Tainui’s two raupatu settlement trusts. (b) The two raupatu settlement trusts established as post-settlement governance entities for Waikato-Tainui are: (i) Waikato Raupatu Lands Trust (Lands Trust), established for the purpose of the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims Settlement Act 1995; and (ii) Waikato Raupatu River Trust (River Trust), established for the purpose of the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims (Waikato River) Settlement Act 2010. These entities hold land (in the case of the Lands Trust), rights in respect of the Waikato River (in the case of the River Trust), and settlement monies received from the Crown, on trust, to redress the economic and wider deprivations suffered by our people as a result of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches. (c) Tainui Group Holdings Limited (TGH) is owned by Te Whakakitenga and oversees Waikato-Tainui’s commercial arm. Waikato-Tainui’s commercial arm seeks to generate a financial return from appropriate assets in order to further the purposes of the Lands Trust for the benefit of the iwi. 11. Additional entities work underneath or alongside these principal entities to deliver or undertake particular activities or projects for the benefit of the iwi. 12. Our overall structure is shown in the following diagram. Page 5 WAIKATO-TAINUI Our perspective on the New Zealand tax system and the TWG review 13. Key aspects of Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on the New Zealand tax system and the TWG review of the tax system are as follows: (a) Current tax settings appropriately reflect that we are still in a phase of redressing the economic, political, social and cultural deprivations suffered by our people, and by other iwi and hapuu, as a result of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches, and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. (b) The settlements of Waikato-Tainui's Tiriti claims have recognised that the raupatu - including the confiscation of land in our rohe and the related invasion, hostilities, war, loss of life, destruction of taonga and property, and consequent suffering, distress and deprivation of our iwi - was a Te Whakakitenga o Waikato Inc. Raupatu Settlement Trusts: 1. Lands Trust 2. River Trust Tainui Group Holdings Ltd Commercial Arm Trustee Shareholder Profits Delivery of projects/services/distributions for the benefit of iwi, hapuu, marae and tribal members Application of appropriate assets to generate a financial return for Lands Trust purposes Page 6 violation and grave injustice against our people, our rohe and our ancestral river, and against our rights under Te Tiriti, and had a crippling effect on the welfare, economy and potential development of our iwi. The settlements also recognise that our Tiriti rights - including our rangatiratanga and mana whakaere over our rohe and taonga - are not diminished or in any way affected. They are ongoing. The settlements began a process of healing and a new age of cooperation with the Crown, but that process of healing, and the process of regenerating and advancing the welfare, economy and development of our iwi, is ongoing. (c) Any changes to the tax system must not erode the value of Tiriti settlements, nor risk creating new breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, in particular in relation to our rangatiratanga over our whenua and other taonga, including rivers, mountains and harbours, within the Waikato rohe, into the future. Our mana whakahaere and stewardship of such assets for the long-term benefit of our whaanau, hapuu and iwi must not be adversely affected. (d) Consistent with our tikanga for our iwi, and for our entities’ operations, the design of the New Zealand tax system: (i) must not be driven purely by economic or financial considerations. In particular, social, cultural and environmental considerations must be taken into account; (ii) must not unduly burden, or create inappropriate incentives or disincentives, for individual iwi members and whaanau trying to get ahead, who are presently disadvantaged by the structure of the tax system; and (iii) must work for both current and future generations, and this means looking many generations into the future, i.e. over at least the next 500 to 600 years, not just at the next few years or decades. 14. Further in contemplating the future of tax in Aotearoa, we want to see a system that recognises Te Ao Maaori, especially as it relates to the potential taxation of our assets and how we use those assets for the benefit of our whaanau, hapuu and iwi. As kaitiaki, or stewards, of our expansive rohe and its taonga and assets our mahi is to preserve, protect and enhance our rich natural environments for future generations. Our stewardship obligation goes to the very core of our world view and our connection with the whenua and our taonga, including our rivers. Sound stewardship of our hard-won commercial assets is also fundamental to our role on behalf of our people. Princess Te Puea said it best when she charged us “kia tupu, kia hua, kia puaawai” – to grow, to prosper, and sustain. 15. A strong, sustainable economic foundation gives us the capacity to manaaki, or care for and respect, our whaanau, hapuu, iwi and community. We do this in many ways, including through educational and vocational opportunities for our people through grants, scholarships and our own institutions and businesses. We are also involved in or considering various other projects that directly benefit our people, including housing projects and healthcare initiatives. As is the case with this submission, our current economic situation allows us to be informed and take action in keys areas that affect our people. A favourable tax framework is vital to the Page 7 sustainability and success of our various initiatives. Success in these areas leads to favourable outcomes for both our iwi and the communities in which they live. 16. Mahitahi and kotahitanga, collaboration and unity, are also relevant to this kaupapa. These values capture our commitment to work together with others to achieve common goals. In that spirit, our submission in centred on our desire to see a tax system that supports all Maaori in growing and sustaining tribal assets consistent with the time-honoured vision inherited from Kiingi Tawhiao, “maaku anoo e hanga I tooku nei whare...” - to build our own house in order to face the challenges of the future. 17. These aspects of Waikato-Tainui’s perspective have influenced the specific submissions set out in Parts 3 to 6 of our submission. Page 8 Part 3: Key aspects of the current tax system impacting on Waikato-Tainui, with a particular focus on the tax framework for charities 18. Waikato-Tainui is concerned that the TWG review may be used by some parties to attack certain aspects of the current tax system that enable Waikato-Tainui entities, and entities for other iwi, to work for the benefit of iwi. 19. In particular, this includes: (a) the current tax framework for charities, referred to at p41 of the Background Paper; and (b) the Maaori authority tax regime, referred to at p12 of the Background Paper. The current tax framework for charities 20. Waikato-Tainui submits that the current tax framework for charities, and in particular the non-business and business income tax exemptions for tax charities, is working as it should to help redress the position of our iwi, and has been the subject of uninformed and undue criticism from some quarters. 21. In particular, Waikato-Tainui submits that: (a) The availability of charitable and tax-exempt status for many Maaori entities, including Waikato-Tainui entities, that work for the benefit of iwi and hapuu, appropriately reflects that we are still in a phase of redressing the economic, political, social and cultural deprivations suffered by our people, and by other iwi and hapuu, as a result of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches. This will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. (b) Tax-exempt status for Waikato-Tainui entities, albeit with reference to the English law construct of “charitable status”, is also consistent with Waikato-Tainui’s rangatiratanga, mana whakahaere and perpetual stewardship over our whenua and other assets, for the benefit of our iwi. In this sense, Waikato-Tainui entities are more akin to the Crown and public authorities that are tax-exempt, than ordinary charities. (c) The income tax exemption for tax charities’ business income, to the extent such income is attributable to charitable purposes in New Zealand, is appropriate and should be maintained. This includes the continued application of the exemption to so-called “unrelated” business income. Criticism of this exemption from some quarters does not give sufficient weight to the benefits of the current exemption. These benefits include: (i) enabling charities to accelerate business growth, whether related or unrelated to the relevant charitable purposes, in order to maximise and sustain revenue to further those charitable purposes; (ii) offsetting constraints that apply to businesses dedicated to charitable purposes in relation to accessing capital; and (iii) keeping charities’ and charitable groups’ arrangements simple, rather than encouraging restructuring and inefficiency by having different treatments for different income streams. Page 9 In the case of Waikato-Tainui entities that utilise the exemption, including TGH, which runs Waikato-Tainui’s commercial arm with the sole objective of furthering the Land Trust’s purposes, the exemption enables such entities to maximise and sustain their contribution towards redressing the consequences of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches for our iwi, as noted above. (d) Current specific legislative clarifications in relation to the scope of the “charitable purposes” concept (e.g. modification of the “public benefit” requirement for charities with beneficiaries identified by blood tie, and recognition of marae as charitable) are appropriate and should be maintained. (e) If the impending review of the Charities Act 2005 raises any proposals regarding the scope of the “charitable purposes” concept or any other matter that may impact on the tax framework for charities, it must take into account the TWG’s review and recommendations and there needs to be full consultation with Waikato-Tainui and other iwi in relation to any such proposals. 22. Waikato-Tainui also considers that the current tax framework for charities could be enhanced. This could include the following, related matters: (a) Revisiting streaming and refundability of imputation credits, with a view to imputation credits attached to company dividends derived by charities becoming refundable. This has previously been dismissed on fiscal cost grounds, but changes to the tax base mix would allow this to be revisited. (b) Ensuring there is flexibility for tax-exempt charities to innovate and pursue new forms of “social enterprise” in a tax-efficient manner, in particular where such enterprise would benefit from equity investment from non- exempt partners or investors. While there are existing structuring options, a specific structure to facilitate social enterprise may be warranted. The Maaori Authority tax regime 23. Waikato-Tainui understands that the reference to the Maaori authority tax regime in the Background Paper specifically relates to the “Maaori authority” rules under the Income Tax Act 2007, not to any wider conception of “Maaori authorities”, and comments accordingly. 24. Waikato-Tainui supports the continuation of the current Maaori Authority income tax regime, as it is an important regime for Maaori entities and key features of the regime such as the 17.5% tax rate and Maaori authority distribution rules (including the refundability of Maaori authority credits) work well and are appropriate in this context. 25. However, Waikato-Tainui submits that the current eligibility criteria for entities to access the regime (section HF 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007) are too restrictive, in particular in relation to wholly-owned or wholly-controlled subsidiaries of eligible entities. 26. Waikato-Tainui, and no doubt other iwi, would welcome the opportunity to provide input into reviewing and refining the regime to address these concerns. Page 10 Part 4: Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on asset/wealth taxes, including any CGT or land tax 27. The TWG has specifically sought Maaori feedback and submissions on: (a) the possible impacts of a CGT on Maaori assets, and an appropriate framework to use when exploring the impacts of a CGT on Maaori, at p48 of the Background Paper; and (b) what the appropriate treatment of Maaori land might be for land tax purposes when the land is a taonga asset, at p48 of the Background Paper. 28. Waikato-Tainui’s position on any new asset/wealth taxes, including CGT and land tax, is clear and unequivocal: (a) Any new asset/wealth taxes, including any CGT or land tax, must exclude: (i) all Waikato-Tainui whenua and other taonga; and (ii) all raupatu and other Tiriti settlement assets (including post- settlement right of first refusal assets acquired from the Crown), whether or not they fall within or are connected with our rohe. (b) This applies regardless of how Waikato-Tainui chooses to hold and manage such assets and put them to use for the benefit of our iwi. For example, from a Te Ao Maaori perspective, whenua is taonga of itself and its value to Maaori is not determined by the commercial use (if any) to which that whenua is put, or may be put. (c) We note that the TWG discusses taonga assets without attempting any definition of that concept. We would like the TWG to understand that a very wide view is required from a Te Ao Maaori perspective. 29. From Waikato-Tainui’s perspective the imposition of asset/wealth taxes, including any CGT or land tax, in respect of the Waikato-Tainui’s tribal asset base as described above would: (a) cut across Waikato-Tainui’s rangatiratanga, mana whakahaere and stewardship over our assets, for the benefit of our iwi; (b) erode the value of Waikato-Tainui’s Tiriti settlements with the Crown, and/or risk creating new breaches of our rights under Te Tiriti, in particular in relation to our rangatiratanga over our whenua and other taonga. As noted above, the manner in which we hold our whenua and other taonga, while fitting within the English law construct of charity, can also be compared with the manner in which the Crown and tax-exempt public authorities hold core Crown assets such as the conservation estate; (c) increase the cost of holding whenua in trust for future generations of our people; (d) fail to reflect that we are still in the phase of redressing the economic, political, social and cultural deprivations suffered by our people as a result of raupatu and other Tiriti breaches by the Crown, and will be for the foreseeable future; and Page 11 (e) fail to recognise the economic contribution made to New Zealand via the use and exploitation of raupatu assets by non-iwi, during the significant time period from raupatu being imposed until the return of those assets to iwi. 30. If any new asset/wealth tax, including any CGT or land tax, were to be recommended by the TWG, further consultation would be required with Waikato- Tainui and other iwi to ensure that the exclusion of Maaori land and other assets is appropriately designed. 31. In principle, however, from Waikato-Tainui’s perspective an appropriate exclusion may be achieved by way of either: (a) a charity exemption, along the lines of the current income tax regime for charities (but this would not necessarily address the position of all iwi); or (b) an exemption for the whenua and other taonga of an iwi, and any other Tiriti settlement assets (which would address the position of all iwi). Page 12 Part 5: Waikato-Tainui’s perspective on environmental taxes 32. The Background Paper acknowledges the impact of climate change and the importance of New Zealand’s indigenous flora and fauna and ecosystems, at pp14 to 15, and the value of protecting New Zealand’s natural capital base, at pp41 to 42, and touches on use of the tax system to achieve positive environmental outcomes, at pp49 to 50. 33. The focus on using the tax system to achieve positive environmental, and ecological, outcomes is aligned with our tikanga. 34. In relation to the matters covered in these parts of the Background Paper, Waikato- Tainui submits as follows: (a) Any TWG consideration of royalties on the extraction of natural resources or any other resource-related tax, such as a resource rent tax (as referred to at p41 of the Background Paper) must acknowledge and take into account our rights under Te Tiriti. (b) In relation to water resources: (i) All water resources within our rohe, including the Waikato and Waipaa Rivers, are taonga. Waikato-Tainui use of such assets must not be taxed, and Waikato-Tainui rangatiratanga and mana whakahaere must be respected. (ii) The Waikato River is a single indivisible being and a tupuna (ancestor) of Waikato-Tainui. It has mana (prestige) and in turn represents the mana and mauri (life force) of our iwi. For Waikato-Tainui, our relationship with, and respect for, the Waikato river lies at the heart of our spiritual and physical wellbeing, and the identity and culture of the iwi. (iii) Respect for te mana o te awa (the spiritual authority, protective power and prestige of the Waikato River), covering both the river and its ecosystems, is at the heart of the relationship between our iwi and the river. Waikato-Tainui asserts mana whakahaere in respect of the river, and has responsibilities to protect the mana and mauri of the river, according to our tikanga. We have a duty as katiaki of our rohe to protect and restore the health and strength of the Waikato River for current and future generations. (iv) Accordingly, kaitiaki of our water resources is critical to our iwi and Waikato-Tainui would support the use of effective tax measures to disincentivise water pollution, including by agriculture, and the hypothecation of relevant tax revenue for environmental or water management purposes. (c) It is noted that while there is currently no federal water pollution tax in Australia, various Australian states impose fees or levies for pollution of water. The amount of fee or levy payable is generally dependent on the type of effluent (or other contaminant) and the measured or estimated quantity of effluent (or another contaminant). These regimes may provide a basis for a water pollution tax regime that may be adopted in New Zealand. Page 13 (d) While supporting in principle some form or taxation on water pollution, Waikato-Tainui submits that any such regime should be coupled with effective measures to incentivise positive environmental actions and outcomes, such as credits or offsets against the water pollution tax for riparian planting, forestry and the like, undertaken by the polluter or a related entity of the polluter. (e) In addition, Waikato-Tainui submits that the model for hypothecation of a water pollution related tax should recognise Waikato-Tainui's rangatiratanga, mana whakaere and role as kaitiaki of our rohe and the Waikato river. Such taxes collected within our rohe should be dedicated to our rohe and the river, and Waikato-Tainui should have a central role in governing the application of such funds for environmental and water management purposes. Page 14 Part 6: Key aspects of the tax system and the review impacting on iwi members and whaanau 35. Waikato-Tainui has sought to identify and focus on the most important aspects, not every aspect, of the tax system and the review impacting on our iwi members and whaanau. 36. Waikato-Tainui considers that this includes: (a) getting the tax base mix right, as referred to at pp5 and 23 to 25 of the Background Paper; (b) looking at all tax options for addressing or mitigating the issue of housing affordability, referred to at pp7 and 46 to 47 of the Background Paper; (c) considering tax measures to incentivise healthy living, or to disincentivise unhealthy living; and (d) considering tax measures to encourage and boost savings, referred to at pp5 to 6, 26 and 49 to 50 of the Background Paper. Getting the tax base mix right 37. Getting the tax base mix right is critical for our iwi and whaanau, particularly to address the stark income and standard of living inequalities existing and being perpetuated in New Zealand despite Article 3 of Te Tiriti. 38. Iwi member earnings are largely limited to taxable employment or self-employment income, not untaxed gains, and GST is a disproportionate burden for our people. 39. From a Te Ao Maaori perspective, the current tax base does not adequately recognise that Maaori living arrangements often include intergenerational living, extended whaanau living and funding arrangements, and the associated combining of incomes, often now effected to afford childcare and housing. 40. Waikato-Tainui notes the exclusion of any increase to any income tax rate or the rate of GST from the review under the Terms of Reference, and considers it important that the income tax and GST burden on iwi members and whaanau is not increased, and ideally should be decreased. 41. Waikato-Tainui also notes the exclusion of “the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system” (including Working for Families) from the review under the Terms of Reference, but in any event submits that: (a) the income threshold at which the top personal tax rate kicks in should be lifted, so that those who earn what are now relatively low incomes (especially relative to house prices) are not subject to the top rate; and (b) income-splitting or similar measures should be considered for intergenerational households/extended whaanau, not just couples or nuclear families, to lower the income tax burden for households/whaanau operating as an interdependent unit. 42. Changes to the tax base mix would allow such measures to be implemented. Page 15 Looking at all tax options impacting on housing affordability 43. Waikato-Tainui considers that more needs to be done, urgently, in relation to housing affordability. 44. This is a critical issue for our iwi members and whaanau, on account of rising house prices, and rents, relative to incomes, both within and outside our rohe. This is a headline issue in Hamilton, not just in the cities referred to at p47 of the Background Paper, and elsewhere in our rohe. 45. The Background Paper also appropriately acknowledges at p11 that this is a critical issue for Maaori in general, not just our iwi. 46. In addition to other tax measures that may impact on housing affordability by affecting housing demand, Waikato-Tainui submits that the TWG should consider recommending: (a) changes to the “Community Housing Entity” tax exemption, and in particular a relaxation of the restrictive beneficiary/client requirements under that exemption, to provide greater scope for the tax-exempt delivery of affordable housing (adopting realistic measures for this purpose), not just lower end social or community housing; and (b) introducing effective tax incentives for private developers who commit to delivering affordable housing, not just social or community housing, as part of market housing developments. It is increasingly well understood that high or increasing urban land values, coupled with high development and construction costs, make it extremely difficult for private developers economically to deliver affordable housing as part of a market housing project. Waikato-Tainui has first-hand experience of this in negotiations with developers in connection with potential tribal housing projects. Consideration should be given to a tax related incentive in this area, e.g. a level of tax relief on the taxable margin on market housing units where the same development includes a sufficient percentage of affordable housing units, with affordability realistically measured by reference to mean household incomes or other metrics appropriate to the relevant geographical area. 47. These are tax measures that should be considered because they may positively impact on housing affordability by affecting housing supply, rather than demand. Encouraging healthy living 48. The health and well-being of our iwi is vital, and Waikato-Tainui sees merit in considering tax measures to incentivise healthy living and/or to disincentivise unhealthy living. 49. Waikato-Tainui does not, however, see any merit in zero-rating (or exempting) GST on fruit/vegetables or other healthy foods. Waikato-Tainui recognises the advantages of New Zealand’s simple and broad-based GST regime and notes inefficiencies in overseas value-added tax regimes that incorporate provisions of this nature. It also questions whether any, let alone all, of the benefit of a zero- rating or exemption regime for particular food products would necessarily be passed on by retailers to consumers via a proportionate retail price reduction. Page 16 50. Waikato-Tainui sees greater merit in: (a) effective tax measures to disincentivise unhealthy living, such as sugar consumption, as referred to at p26 of the Background Paper; and (b) hypothecating the relevant tax revenue for public health (including recreational) purposes, as referred to at p45 of the Background Paper (and noting that in this context, there would be no issue of this limiting more spending in other areas, given the high priority of public health spending). 51. Waikato-Tainui submits that in order to be effective a sugar-related tax would need to be imposed at a sufficiently high rate to affect the spending decisions of iwi and other members of the public. Experience in New Zealand and overseas with excise duty and similar taxes on tobacco products tends to indicate that such measures can induce behavioural change if they impact materially on cost. 52. The United Kingdom’s recently introduced sugary drink levy (in force under the Soft Drinks Industry Levy Regulations 2018) may provide a workable framework for a sugary drink-related tax in New Zealand. The United Kingdom levy is imposed at two per litre rates based on the percentage sugar content of the beverage. It is collected by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the revenue raised is to be used by the Department of Education to fund primary school sports activities. There are exemptions for pure fruit juices and those with a high milk content. Similarly to the regime for excise duty on alcohol in New Zealand, the levy is payable by the person who packages the relevant beverage at the earlier of the point of the beverage being available for sale and it being dispatched from the packaging facility (with a deferral if the beverage is stored in a licenced warehouse pending further distribution). 53. Given the similarity of the United Kingdom regime to the existing excise regime in New Zealand, if a comparable imposition were to be adopted here, as an administrative matter it would seem to fall within the province of the New Zealand Customs Service rather than Inland Revenue. Encouraging savings 54. The taxation of savings and in particular retirement savings, noted at pp5, 6 and 26 of the Background Paper, is also an issue for iwi members and whaanau, and Waikato-Tainui would support effective tax measures to increase members’ savings, e.g. tax-exempt employee/employer contributions to KiwiSaver. 55. However, Waikato-Tainui considers that non-tax measures are likely to be more important for our iwi members and whaanau, e.g. increased employer KiwiSaver contributions, addressing the issue of default/conservative KiwiSaver schemes, more flexible access to “locked in” savings (e.g. for first home and education purposes), and access to savings before age 65. It is noted that the minimum age of 65 for most withdrawals from KiwiSaver does not recognise the lower life expectancies of Maaori and other ethnicities relative to average life expectancies in New Zealand.

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax Name: Michelle Frost Occupation: Child & Youth Mortality Reviewer Affiliation (if any): Waitemata CYMRG Date: 25/04/2018 Email: Phone:  I am aware that my submission will be released on this website, with my email address withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply. I do not wish to speak to my submission before the Tax Working Group. This submission on the Future of Tax from the Waitemata Child and Youth Mortality Review Group solely reflects the view of the CYMRG Group and does not represent an official position of any of the employing organisations of the members of the Group. The twenty-eight members of the Waitemata CYMRG support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders because information gathered from Waitemata Child and Youth Mortality Reviews identifies alcohol-harm to be associated with a large number of deaths amongst 15 – 24-year-olds. Local Child and Youth Mortality Review Groups were set up in New Zealand with the purpose of reviewing deaths in their area of children and youth aged 28 days to 24 years with the aim of ensuring important high-quality data is collected and analysed, so that lessons are learned from these reviews and wherever possible, any process or system improvements are identified which may prevent similar deaths from occurring in the future. Child and Youth Mortality review is authorised under the New Zealand Health and Disability Act (2000) through the Minister of Health. Data analysis of Waitemata DHB mortality data for the 5 year period from 2011 to 2015 shows the associated harm of alcohol intoxication. Below provides the supporting data from death reviews. Suicide & Fatal Assaults on young people aged 10 years of age to 24yrs of age: 62 deaths - Excessive alcohol consumption was found in 24% of these deaths. Transport-related deaths of young people aged 10 years of age to 24yrs of age: 28 deaths - Excessive alcohol consumption was found in 39% of these deaths. A large body of literature and research has established that alcohol pricing and taxes are inversely related to drinking and subsequent alcohol-harm. We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity, and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to addressed • Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been. \[1\]\[1\] • New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. • Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). • People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following: • Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%. • Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers). • Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not the volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. • It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. • Alcohol excise tax revenue should be allocated to the funding of the current underfunded national mental health and addiction services. These recommendations are fair as low-income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also is implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the fairest as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. We would also like to take the opportunity to extend our gratitude for your time in considering our correspondence and appreciate your commitment to safer communities.

The Western Bay of Plenty District Council wishes to provide comment on the following issues for your consideration on the future of taxation in New Zealand. We wish to support LGNZ’s submission. We particularly note that taxation in New Zealand is the primary mechanism for funding for both central and local government, and that a holistic consideration to taxation should be taken. A pressing matter we would like addressed is the removal of GST from local government rates. The current situation is inherently wrong. The levying of this is essentially a tax on a tax, where a tax on consumption (GST) is charged on a tax on property (local government rates). The removal of this would contribute to the local affordability of living costs (including flow—on effects to renting costs). In a similar vein, we continue to request that consideration be given to a review of the thresholds and abatement gradient for DIA’s Rates Rebate Scheme. This is the methodology by which central government determines who receives a partial exemption to taxation on property through local government rates. The rebate has not kept pace with changes experienced. Over the past three years average rates in New Zealand have risen by 12.8%, however the maximum level of the rebate available only rose by 2.5%. A review is necessary to ensure the rebate scheme meets its objectives and to determine if further limits (for example on property value) should be included. Again the issue of affordability in our local communities is paramount. $ LIBRARY & SERVICE CENTRES v WAlHl BEACH ~ KATIKATI ­ OMOKOROA ­ TE PUKE  “   7: xN������n��\`�B�����n���   r. > I TE KAUNIHERA A ROHE MAI I NGA KURI­A­WHAREl Kl OTAMARAKAU KI TE URU \[1\] \[1\] Housing is of national concern and is explicitly considered through this review. Addressing housing affordability requires a multi­pronged approach, with multiple work streams and parties being involved. Amending taxation to enable the delivery of more affordable housing is an important aspect, as is supporting the operation of social housing already available. Utilising revenue received through general taxation to support social housing provides an essential level of support. To better deliver on this outcome, we wish to see the Income Related Rent Subsidy (IRRS) expanded to enable local government to access financial support to deliver social housing. Currently this is limited to registered Community Housing Providers, with local government explicitly denied access to this funding. This has led to Council owned social housing portfolios across the country constrained by underinvestment and being sold to third­parties. With the increased revenue available form the IRRS local government can take a more active role in delivering affordable living to those in need.

WELLINGTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE | BUSINESS CENTRAL | EXPORTNZ CENTRAL SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF TAX APRIL 2018 Introduction This submission is made of behalf of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Business Central, and Export New Zealand Central. Our organisation is a business membership association, representing 3,400 members and their interests throughout central New Zealand from Taranaki across to Gisborne and down to Nelson. We represent three brands, Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Business Central, and Export New Zealand Central. As this submission is made on behalf of these three membership groups we expect that this submission should be weighted accordingly, rather than for each membership group to put in their own repetitious version.  The Wellington Chamber of Commerce has been the voice of business in the Wellington region for 162 years since 1856 and advocates for policies that reflect the interest of Wellington’s business community, in both the city and region, and the development of the Wellington economy as a whole, with over 3,500 member businesses. The Chamber has a strong focus on trade and “NZ Inc” issues. The Chamber acts as secretariat for the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, a network of 29 chambers from across New Zealand.  Business Central is one of the four regional organisations comprising New Zealand’s peak business advocacy group, BusinessNZ and represents employers throughout the Central region. Business Central is a recognised leader in employment advice, consultancy and training – regarded as the authority in the fields of employee relations, occupational health and safety, and people management.  Our organisation also delivers ExportNZ to Wellington, the Hawke’s Bay and the wider Central region. ExportNZ is the national industry association representing a diverse range of exporters throughout New Zealand. We have exporting members, ranging from emerging exporters to the largest exporters in New Zealand. Our organisation write in support of Business New Zealand’s submission to the Woking Group. We wholly endorses the comments made. We appreciate the opportunity and we look forward to continuing to engage with political leaders, policy-makers and decision makers in the period ahead. We would like to congratulate the Government on setting up a TWG with direct input from the private sector. As part of our wider Business New Zealand family, we strongly supported the 2009/2010 Tax Working Group and since then have advocated for another broad examination of New Zealand’s tax system, particularly in regard to recent international pressures and settings. 2 We also appreciate the TWG’s difficult task in having terms of reference that mean there are significant no-go areas we believe also require examination. We would point out that with any broad examination of a complex and wide ranging system, there will be parts of the business community that invariably agrees - or disagrees - with the recommendations put forward. So it is important to identify those options that have the business community’s broadest support. This is the position BusinessNZ, together with its member organisations (encompassing its regional associations and major companies and affiliated industries groups) has taken in relation to the TWG’s work. Topics outside the Scope of the TWG As noted above, we would point out that while the TWG process covers a number of tax policy areas, we have been disappointed to find certain areas outside its scope. These include income tax and GST changes, as well as tax applying to the family home. In essence, this hampers the ability of both the TWG and submitters to examine the full tax system and see where trade-offs can be made. To that end, the recent results of the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey 1 show how the business community can provide a more nuanced response when presented with different scenarios. For instance, of the 575 businesses completing the survey, table 1 shows 76% did not support an increase in the highest personal marginal tax rate, while 18% said yes with 6% unsure. Figure 1 However, table 2 shows these percentages moved when businesses were also asked about the use of the additional tax revenue raised from the increase to fund specific areas, such as social investment or transport infrastructure. Figure 2 1 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0006/129345/Deloitte-BusinessNZ-Election- Survey-2017.pdf 3 We hope that once submissions for the Future of Tax Paper have been received, these matters can be addressed more fully to ensure the interim report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue provides enough specificity for submitters to provide their preferences etc. when it comes to potential taxation changes. Questions for Submitters The Background Paper outlines 20 broad questions relating to the future of New Zealand’s tax system. In relation to the point made above, overall, our submission is not as detailed as the submission we would have provided had not the TWG’s terms of reference essentially prevented a comprehensive analysis of the tax system as a whole. Instead, what we have outlined below is our general taxation position and thoughts developed over many years in consultation with our membership across various industries and sizes of business. Chapter 2: The future environment 1. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to-long-term? Which of these are most important? Overall, we believe that following the major reforms of the 1980s, New Zealand’s tax system has generally worked well in meeting the overall needs of the economy. In no small part this has been due to ongoing collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors to ensure the system remains internationally competitive. However, this does not mean improvements cannot be made. Also, future technology changes, offshore developments and the changing face of New Zealand life may dictate the use of different levers to ensure the continuing competence of the New Zealand tax system. The most obvious risk is that of a sudden decrease in key tax takings placing pressure on areas of government expenditure. Equally, however, we would be concerned if new taxes, popular with some members of the public, were introduced but were poorly thought through from a public policy perspective. As history shows, it is relatively easy to tax something, but whether it should be taxed in the first place and what unintended consequences will stem from taxing it need to be taken into account. 4 Also, we would not want to see taxes collected for specific purposes, become, to all intents and purposes, general taxation and morph into a slush fund for projects unrelated to what was originally intended. We believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently competitive and that the full suite of taxes, on both individuals and business, is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has the best chance of improving economic growth. The main concern for New Zealand’s tax system is that it continues to be broad-based and low-rate, collects taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creates minimal disruption for the general population. 2. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? One of the key ways in which all three issues above can be achieved is by examining the issue of base- broadening. This would address some of the existing biases in the tax system, improving its efficiency and sustainability. Base-broadening to maintain tax revenue levels would also be required if certain tax rates were to be reduced. Often, examining each base-broadening and revenue-raising option by itself, without looking at where it would sit in terms of the overall package, can result in no change. We would also like to point out in regard to maintaining tax revenue levels, that due to its terms of reference, the TWG has only looked at one half of the broader issue. The balance of revenue neutrality means the group has no opportunity to look at where government expenditure might be reduced to free up revenue for further tax changes. In this regard, we note that in 2018 the Government is expected to collect around $86b in tax revenue, leading us to ask how this could be used more efficiently if spending decisions were properly reviewed. Overall, we would want the Government to make a more concentrated effort to find ways to lower unnecessary expenditure so additional revenue can be passed back to taxpayers via lower tax rates, while revenue required for spending is used in a productive and efficient manner. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future focused tax system? While we have no substantive comment on this question, we would point out that the tax system should not adversely affect or favour any ethnicity, however defined. Within the business taxation context, we would expect all businesses, no matter who they are owned by, to adhere to the same tax rules and structures. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system 5 Principles for assessment 3. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? We believe that page 19 of the paper provides a useful summary of the criteria required for examining the purpose and principles of a good tax system, namely:  Efficiency  Equity and fairness  Revenue integrity  Fiscal adequacy  Compliance and administration costs  Coherence We note the paper’s statement that these are the established criteria used in past reviews both domestically and overseas. Therefore, we see very little reason to change the criteria while any new criteria or adjustments would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. Defining ‘fairness’ 4. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? The term ‘fairness” is very subjective and is not readily defined in the tax system context. In a business context, we suggest the tax system should ensure an optimal outcome for all businesses, particularly in relation to their size. Comparing small with large businesses across not only the tax system but other regulatory systems, there needs to be a pragmatic acknowledgement of the differences in tax compliance responsibilities between small and large businesses. Research over time, including by BusinessNZ, shows small businesses (SMEs) traditionally have much higher compliance costs per employee compared with larger enterprises. And there is a gap in the business capability of small firms versus large firms when dealing with tax compliance issues. Any compliance ‘jolts’ introduced are more likely to be heavier for smaller firms, as their ability to deal with new or changed regulations is relatively lesser than that of large businesses. The latter often have staff that can be allocated the task of understanding how and when compliance is required. This highlights to us how policies that minimise tax compliance costs for smaller firms can help to minimise any deadweight cost to the economy. Last, when examining the points above, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the fact that any optimal outcome for smaller sized businesses should accept that close enough is good enough. A drive towards total precision in the tax system creates complexity. Therefore, a more pragmatic view around trying to collect the last dollar of revenue, would help minimise any compliance jolts. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks 6 5. New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking ahead to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? We believe this is still the best approach for the country and will continue to support a broad-based low- rate (BBLR) framework. A BBLR system is simpler to administer and is fairer, as more people contribute towards the cost of the services available to everyone. As with our view of the principles relating to the tax system’s performance, any move away from the BBLR framework would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. Taxes and behaviour 6. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? We believe that any taxes introduced to modify behaviour would need to go through a rigorous government policy process to ascertain whether they were required in the first place. This would include establishing whether substantive international evidence shows such taxes having a significant positive effect on behaviour without creating significant distortionary effects elsewhere in the tax system. Retirement savings 7. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Page 26 of the background paper provides a succinct summary of the New Zealand relationship between taxation and retirement savings compared with most other OECD countries. It is certainly true that in comparison with many other countries, New Zealand’s retirement savings are highly taxed, as we have a Taxed-Taxed-Exempt (TTE) approach, compared with the Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (EET) approach of most OECD countries - where savings instruments are taxed neither at the investment nor the earning stage but at the withdrawal stage. However, as the background paper rightly points out, the Government provides material support to those in retirement through universal superannuation that is not means tested. Therefore, any switch to a system where income earned on the investment was not taxed would involve a significant fiscal cost. In addition, KiwiSaver, which is little more than 10 years old, is considered by many to be a key policy helping New Zealanders save for their retirement, while the establishment of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) also contributes to retirement savings. Overall, from our and the wider BusinessNZ family’s point of view, any proposals for change raise questions as to whether the cost of further tax incentives for retirement saving would be affordable and the extent to which they would see retirement savings increase. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system 7 Fairness and balance 8. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? We do not have any substantive comments on these questions. Tax and business 9. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? One of the principles of good taxation, mentioned above, involves taking into account compliance and administration costs. Taxpayers are often faced with a variety of compliance costs, with the business community having to administer and pass on a wide range of taxes. As discussed in question 4 above, it is important to recognise that tax compliance costs for businesses fall disproportionately more on SMEs than on larger businesses, particularly when viewed from an FTE measure. From our perspective, it is difficult to respond to the question of whether the tax system is currently doing enough to minimise costs for business. IRD is the key Government Department taking the lead in finding ways to reduce compliance costs. With that in view, the IRD is currently going through an extensive Business Transformation (BT) process, which includes mechanisms to reduce compliance costs on business. At this stage, the introduction of the Accounting Income Method (AIM) and the general move towards electronic filing – if set up correctly – has the potential to reduce tax compliance costs for many businesses. Related initiatives, such as the introduction of the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), also have the potential to not only reduce tax compliance costs, but costs across the many government departments business deals with on a day-to-day basis. However, such policies need time to bed down in order to ascertain how successful or otherwise they have been. While we are strongly supportive of IRD’s BT process, our primary concern is that costs could simply be moved from government to business. We have stated to the IRD on many occasions that the process should end up having an overall significant net benefit to the business community by way of reducing tax compliance costs – particularly for the SME sector. To that end, we note that later this year IRD will again conduct its SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey, run roughly every four years. The survey provides a useful quantitative and qualitative assessment of compliance costs for various areas of the tax system. Last, if we were to look at the larger end of the business community, BusinessNZ and Deloitte conducted a tax survey of New Zealand’s largest companies in May 2017 2 . The purpose of the survey was to identify what fine-tuning was required to make sure New Zealand is performing optimally – both in global competitiveness and tax administration. 2 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0010/129187/170816-Major-companies-tax- survey-2017.pdf 8 Ten themes were identified, namely: a) Provide certainty: The ability to make business decisions with certain knowledge of the tax implications is important for business. We urge government to consider tax changes with a commercial lens, balancing the integrity of the tax system with long- term certainty for business. b) Eliminate black hole expenditure: Businesses should be able to claim a tax deduction for all business expenditure, either immediately or over time. Currently there are a number of gaps in the law where legitimate business expenditure is not deductible at all – this is known as “black hole” expenditure. The cost of raising capital is a common example. c) Help to strengthen buildings: If government does not compensate for the regulatory taking imposed on building-owners, then the tax system should not add a further barrier. d) Restore depreciation for industrial buildings: As mentioned below, government should restore depreciation deductions for this building class, reversing the 2010 decision to put industrial buildings in the same category as commercial and residential properties given clear differences between their use and long-term utility. e) Maintain an internationally competitive rate: Corporate tax rates around the globe are on a downward trend, with the OECD average now just over 22 percent. While it is important for companies to pay their fair of share of tax, in a world where capital is mobile it is also critical that our headline corporate rate doesn’t become uncompetitive – at least compared to our closest competitors such as Australia. f) Encourage research and development: The majority of major companies would support tax policies to further encourage research & development (“R&D”). A lack of NZ business investment in R&D risks our Intellectual Property being developed offshore and skilled labour transferring overseas. g) Put New Zealand’s interests first: The Government should develop tax policy that takes into account New Zealand’s best interests, based on New Zealand principles, not on what is in other countries’ best interests. h) Allow taxpayers some flexibility: In a world where technology will play a greater role in assessing taxpayers, the government should allow the IRD to accept some flexibility, rather than require absolute precision from taxpayers, introducing more safe harbour and de minimis discretions. i) Treat commercial information like personal information: Major companies regularly supply Inland Revenue with commercially sensitive information – the obligation to keep this confidential is fundamental to the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. j) Determine policy based on realities: There is a general perception across society that multinational companies are not paying their “fair share” when compared with regular taxpayers but this is not always an informed view. The Government should take a careful approach to the taxation of multinational companies to ensure any reforms are measured and justified, in the same way other matters of policy are approached. Obviously, these themes cross-over with other questions asked in the background paper. Together, they provide clear ways for government to pull the significant levers major businesses would like to see pulled, thereby helping to make New Zealand’s tax system competitive, efficient to run and of the highest integrity. 10. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? 9 Given the complex nature of this issue and the multitude of factors at play, we have no substantive comments on this question. 11. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? While we have no substantive comments to make on this question, it is important for the TWG to recognise that a number of ownership structures exist in New Zealand in order to reduce the impact of tax on decision making, Also, we believe any significant or excessive deductions benefitting one type of business structure over others would already be clearly identified by IRD’s ongoing tax policy programme and therefore already part of its work agenda. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system 12. What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these gaps are most important to address? Broadly speaking, we agree there is the potential for challenges to New Zealand’s tax revenue base, as well as issues over technology disruption that will have implications for tax revenue collection in the medium to longer term. Improved technology options mean transactions can be carried out that either circumvent the usual tax collection process, or through greater efficiency, result in less tax collected by traditional means. For instance, recent discussions about cryptocurrencies highlight the need for further work on these issues. Overall, New Zealand needs to be cognisant of both the risks and opportunities when examining the tax base and the inconsistencies that may appear. 13. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? The background paper mentions a number of taxes eliminated over time under the BBLR tax system. These include sales tax, land tax, estate duty and gift duty. In addition, we do not levy stamp duties, financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes and a capital gains tax. While we are not against the introduction of new taxes per se, this does not mean we simply support the introduction of a new tax or the reintroduction of a tax for the sake of it. Such taxes would need to meet the principles discussed above, as well as fit within the BBLR framework. Whether any taxes were reduced with the introduction of new taxes, we would expect any overall changes in the tax system to be revenue neutral in order not to increase the burden on taxpayers. Regarding specific tax reductions, we believe an overall reduction in the company tax rate would be a positive step forward in supporting firms. In addition, other tax mechanisms could be examined to 10 ensure New Zealand’s tax system is as efficient and effective as possible for the business community. These include: Loss continuity rules Currently, our wider BusinessNZ family have been formally collaborating with a number of interested business groups to advocate for a change in New Zealand’s loss continuity rules. In short, we would like to see an amendment to the law that currently disadvantages many fast growing and innovative companies. Specifically, the proposal is to amend the current rule relating to the carry forward of tax losses by enacting a "same or similar business" test as an alternative to the existing 49% continuity of ownership requirement. Such a change would bring New Zealand's rules into line with those of many comparable jurisdictions, reduce compliance costs, and further the potential for business growth. Building depreciation deductions We are interested - with a view to where this could be expanded - in knowing how the current range of tax deductible measures for businesses in New Zealand compares with offshore arrangements. To that end (and noted in question 9 above) in 2010 the Government of the day removed tax depreciation on buildings. In our submission to the 2009/10 TWG which examined the issue, we pointed out that any decisions made in the area would most likely have significant effects, not only in terms of taxpayer funds saved, but also on associated residential property investment. While our wider BusinessNZ family did not have a strong view on removing depreciation on residential buildings, we strongly rejected any moves towards extending the removal of tax depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Such buildings typically depreciate over time as the specific requirements of the building can rapidly change due to new technology or a shift in focus involving business operations. We also believed care needs to be taken in differentiating between residential and commercial buildings if there is to be any ring fencing. We would therefore welcome the TWG again considering the reintroduction of depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability 14. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? We would again be very wary of using the tax system to improve affordability for owners and renters. Within the context of housing affordability, it is important to note the tax areas outside the scope of the TWG (namely any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or land under it), as well as the issue of capital gains tax discussed below. From our perspective, the only way we see the tax system assisting potential homeowners through a BBLR framework is by reducing personal tax rates and/or thresholds, so buyers have a greater amount of net income at their disposal to pay rent or save for/pay a mortgage. 11 More importantly, we see housing affordability as essentially a supply side issue. Changes in the tax system could become a moot point if supply side policies instead assisted homeowners and potential homeowners by way of freeing up land for residential purposes. Capital gains tax 15. Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? We do not have a formal position on a capital gains tax, as it would depend on the detail of any CGT regime chosen, such as who it would include, who it would affect and how it would be implemented. In essence, the devil would be in the detail of whatever might be proposed. By way of example, if we again highlight some results from the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey below, figures 3 and 4 show a capital gains tax would likely receive more support from the business community if accompanied by a corresponding reduction in personal tax rates. Figures 3 & 4 That any capital gains tax, if introduced, automatically should exclude the family home, would erode the comprehensive nature of the tax. Once a tax is eroded by exclusions, its effectiveness in terms of efficiency and revenue collection is called into question. 12 Moreover, as outlined in question 14 above, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the ability of a CGT to improve housing supply and affordability. To achieve this goal, we would recommend actions to free up land supply for housing construction. Land tax 16. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Again, we believe there is an issue of balance. First, we note that a land tax is nothing new. New Zealand had a land tax up until 1992, but the exemptions were considerable and it therefore affected only a small group of taxpayers. We also currently have a form of land tax via the rates charged by Local Government. Despite the previous use of a land tax, one of our main concerns with its re-introduction is its potential use for other, future, revenue-raising purposes, moving away from the reason for its introduction. The reasons why taxes such as a land tax are introduced are often easily forgotten, and subsequent administrations sometimes use such a tool for other purposes. For example, a future Government might need additional revenue for some elements of social spending, and therefore increase the land tax rate. Alternatively, changes to a land tax could be made by relating the rate paid to the income of the individual/family. It could be argued that in such circumstance existing taxes can also be changed but additional taxes mean there is a greater scope to do so - not the way to ensure government’s fiscal prudence. In addition, land is typically the principle form of equity held by banks to support lending to businesses for use in productive activities. A land tax could therefore undermine banks’ security and also their ability to lend to the business community. Last, like a CGT and previous land taxes in New Zealand, the opportunity over time to introduce exemptions is often politically hard to resist, thereby undermining the policy’s original intent. From our wider BusinessNZ family’s point of view, unless a land tax means a significant reduction in the company tax rate and/or a much lower/flatter tax structure, we will not support its introduction. Environmental taxation 17. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? It is extremely difficult to respond to this question in the absence of a compelling case or problem that would inform such a response. In their absence, any response would be guesswork at best. Key to any response is the nature and extent of the externalities to which such a tax might be applied, and an assessment of the gap unaddressed by the application of the emissions trading scheme. Progressive company tax 18. Should the tax system do more to support small firms? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? 13 In general, we support taking steps to assist small businesses through the tax system, whether by lowering compliance costs (as mentioned above) or through lower tax rates. However, we have never supported the concept of a progressive company tax system, whereby smaller businesses pay a lower rate. This would move New Zealand away from the BBLR system we support, and in our view would create a number of unintended consequences. For instance, businesses on the lower rate would have a natural ceiling barrier to growth with the possibility of some undertaking actions to ensure they stayed under the threshold given the natural disincentive to business expansion. As well, businesses just above the threshold would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Last, any threshold – however defined – would be subjective and create winners and losers, thereby curbing productivity and growth. As mentioned above, beyond a reduction in tax compliance costs for small businesses, other levers to assist such businesses include a reduction in the company and top personal tax rates (given many SMEs are on the top personal rate), together with an examination of how the current range of tax deductible measures for New Zealand businesses compares with offshore arrangements and how this could be expanded. GST exemptions for particular goods 19. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from the Goods and Services Tax? If so, what should be excluded? – and what else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? We strongly support the continuation of a no exemptions policy for GST, which we view as world- leading. We have long held the view that GST should remain a broad-based tax with few if any exemptions. Overseas evidence has consistently shown exemptions lead to gaming and the diverting of resources better used more productively. Looking more widely, on balance ourselves and the wider BusinessNZ family believes that of the various options for raising revenue and ensuring cost neutrality, increasing the GST rate should be viewed as a primary mechanism. Not only does GST reduce the taxation bias against savings and investment, it also means changes made are part of the existing tax structure, with no need to create another level of complexity in the system. 14

SUBMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF TAX To: Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON 6140 Details of Submitter: WellSouth Primary Health Network Address: Level 1, 333 Princes Street PO Box 218 Dunedin 9054 Contact Person: Brittani Beavis Health Promotion Specialist Date: 30 April 2018 Introduction This submission was developed by the Health Promotion Team at WellSouth Primary Health Network (WellSouth). WellSouth is a charitable trust funded by the Southern District Health Board to provide primary health care services to residents enrolled with general practices in Otago and Southland. These services include first contact support to restore people’s health when they are unwell, as well as range of programmes to improve access to health care services to promote and maintain good health. The health promotion programme facilitates the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. One aspect of health promotion is to advocate for healthy social, cultural and physical environments. \[1\] \[1\] Comments WellSouth thanks the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to comment on the future of tax in New Zealand, and commends the NZ Government for undertaking this review. WellSouth would like to respond to “the issues of income inequality, GST on fruits and vegetables, tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol tax, and Smokefree Aotearoa 2025. 1. What does the future of tax look like to you? WellSouth supports the belief that a review of our tax system is needed to reduce inequities faced by our population. As stated by Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc, our tax structure needs to incorporate all incomes, wealth, and businesses, ensure it is fair to all, is socially responsible, and helps to reduce inequality 1 . Research shows that significant income inequality causes negatives health, economic, and social outcomes 2,3,4 . Over the past 30 years income inequality has worsened 5 and in 2015 more than one in four children live in poverty, and this is even worse for Māori and Pacific children (1 in 3) 6 . Income inequality has a significant effect on people’s access to the social determinants of health, such as healthcare, transport, and housing 7 . To improve the overall health and wellbeing of the New Zealand people, WellSouth recommends there is a review of the New Zealand tax system, including benefits, to ensure there is greater income equality for all people. 5. What tax issues matter most to you? WellSouth recommends that food costs be continuously monitored 8 , and GST be removed from fruit and vegetables. This is to allow equal access, by all people, to healthy, nutritious kai. WellSouth recommends that, in accordance with the World Health Organisations recommendations, manufacturers and importers of sugary drinks should pay a per unit tax on all beverages with a sugar content exceeding 5g/100ml 9,10 . Harmful use of alcohol has been identified as a key health issue for Southern Region (Otago and Southland) residents. The Southern DHB, alongside other South Island DHBs, adopted a position 1 Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand. 2018.

Accessed from: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250131/1/9789241511247-eng.pdf?ua=1 statement in 2012 acknowledging alcohol misuse as a significant, preventable cause of illness and injury in the area. 11 According to the 2011/2012 New Zealand Health Survey, a quarter of Southern Region residents are hazardous drinkers. We have the highest prevalence of hazardous drinking among all DHB regions, and a statistically significantly higher prevalence than the national average (25.1% versus 17.0%). Evidence shows that, imposing a minimum price per standard drink of alcohol could reduce harmful alcohol consumption, especially in our younger populations 12 . Therefore, WellSouth recommends the Government implement a minimum price per standard drink for all alcoholic beverages in New Zealand, and that there be an increase in tax on alcohol. Tobacco smoking causes cancer in multiple sites of the body, and passive smoking is a cause of lung cancer in non-smokers 13 . Therefore, WellSouth supports the Aspire 2025 Action plan for Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 14 . This recommends the Government establish an action plan to achieve the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 including the following: minimal retail prices for cigarettes, and increase tobacco excise tax by 20% annually for the next 3 years. WellSouth recommends all revenue generated by tax associated with negative health outcomes should be earmarked for and cessation services, and reducing health inequities. Summary Health is central to cultural, economic, environmental and social wellbeing. The state of people’s health affects their productivity and ability to participate in social interactions, work, education, cultural events and other activities. Given this, WellSouth advocates for health to be a primary consideration in the development of all policies and strategies. WellSouth Recommendations:  A more equitable tax system for those on low-incomes to enable access to the social determinants of health  Food costs be continuously monitored  Remove GST on fruits and vegetables  Include a tax on sugar sweetened beverages in line with World Health Organisation guidelines  Minimum pricing and increased tax on alcoholic beverages  The Government implement an action plan to achieve the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 goal  Minimum pricing and increased tax on cigarettes WellSouth is happy to be contacted by the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to discuss the submission. 11 Southern District Health Board. 2012.

Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Re: Future of Tax - Submissions Background Paper The Wood Processors and Manufacturers’ Association (WPMA) advocates on behalf of a broad membership spanning the whole of New Zealand’s wood supply chain. WPMA represents one of New Zealand’s largest manufacturing sectors, employing over 20,500 people directly in the regions and is the third biggest export sector currently valued at NZ$2.5 billion per annum. WPMA members handle in excess of 85% of the wood processed in New Zealand. Members produce pulp, paper, sawn lumber, panels, laminated products, mouldings, bio-chemical and bio-composites for export and for the domestic market. Lack of security of raw material (log) supply has become an acute problem for the industry in recent years. Overseas buyers (mainly from Asia) are acquiring forests, cutting rights or logs with the benefit of subsidies and incentives that deny local mills the opportunity to compete fairly. The number of overseas buyers is increasing and this is driving up log prices to the extent that it is now having an upward effect on domestic timber prices with consequential inflationary effects on domestic construction costs. WPMA has carried out a legal examination of the main subsidy regimes currently in existence in competitor countries and tested their legal consistency with the WTO. We have found that the manufacturing subsidy systems in many of these countries are in breach of international trade law and are thus extremely unfair to New Zealand producers competing against them in the global, processed-wood market place. Our trade lawyers advise that this on-shore competition for logs is causing the New Zealand wood industry to suffer nullification and impairment of benefits expected to accrue to the New Zealand industry from existing trade agreements under Article XXIII of the GATT 1994. The existence of a distorted market caused by WTO-prohibited subsidies, we believe, provides a strong case for putting in place trade remedies, such as taxation measures, to address injury to New Zealand wood processors and manufacturers in the domestic log market. 2 GST and Log Exports WPMA’s investigations show that New Zealand’s trading partners can and have acted to bolster the value to their economy of domestic processing of imported logs by selective application of domestic taxes including VAT, sales and similar taxes. These taxation regimes undoubtedly augment the competitiveness of their domestic wood processing sectors. MFAT’s stated view is that variability in the rates of VAT charged domestically on different products in some of the countries with which NZ trades is outside the scope of bilateral and multilateral trading agreements. WPMA’s view is, nonetheless, that the effect of differential VAT rates acts to divert logs from the domestic market and favours the export of logs from New Zealand instead. With the need to address significant trade injury, we urge the TWG to review New Zealand’s capacity to selectively apply GST to the domestic log market where that is shown to be in the overall interest of NZ and can be achieved without transgressing applicable trade agreements. Arguments offered in support of countervailing tax-based interventions include meeting the government’s policy objectives for greater regional development, local employment and adding export value to returns otherwise limited to the commodity value of exported logs. It is clear that countries importing raw logs from New Zealand recognise the environmental benefits of their standing forests as well as the employment and other benefits of a thriving domestic processing sector. We observe that log importing countries are making extensive use of non-tariff measures (including taxation regimes) to facilitate the import of raw logs from other parts of the world to achieve this. Recommendation: The TWG is encouraged to consider the value to New Zealand of the statutory power of selective application of domestic taxes. In particular, the TWG is asked to consider recommending the use of selective rates of GST be applied as a countervailing measure to the use of selective tax rates (employed as a non-tariff trade barrier) in New Zealand’s export markets. Whether differential rates are warranted could be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account New Zealand’s overall best interests, including trade balances, regional development etc. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment.

We lead the New Zealand, Australian, and United Kingdom cloud accounting markets,  employing a team of more than 2,00 people in 20 offices around the world.     Our cloud-based accounting software connects people with the right numbers anytime, anywhere, on  any device. We’re proud to be helping over 1 million subscribers worldwide transform the way they do  business.     Forbes identified Xero as the World’s Most Innovative Growth Company in 2014 and 2015. Among  other recent awards, Xero won Product of the Year at the British Accountancy Awards 2017 in the UK,  and was rated by Canstar Blue as Australia’s best accounting software three consecutive years from  2015-2017.     Xero has more than 270,000 small business customers in New Zealand. Our ongoing market research  and data analysis gives us a unique insight into the small business economy in New Zealand. It is with  this focus on innovation that Xero provides comments on features we would like to see in New            Zealand’s future tax system.       Xero’s submission is as follows:-    Frameworks  We support the current broad-based, low rate system and believe that it will continue to benefit New  Zealand in the future. The current approach is generally consistent enough to allow for long term  planning by small businesses and for small businesses to adequately forecast tax impacts.    Progressive company tax  The concept of a progressive tax rate for small businesses has some appeal. A progressive tax rate  offers the prospect of cost effective support for small or medium sized enterprises (SMEs). However,  consideration of any progressive tax regime for small businesses should consider the possibility that  the regime may add some administrative complexity to the tax system.   The first possible complexity is in the definition of a small business. In our experience a small or  medium enterprise can have a mix of attributes such as turnover level, number of employees, or  complexity of systems. Any one of these attributes on its own is too blunt an instrument to define a  SME, whereas together they add considerable complexity in determining what a SME actually looks  like.   The second possible complexity is that this approach may encourage some artificial business  structures created solely for the purpose of capturing the lower SME tax rate. Medium size businesses  may artificially break up into a number of smaller businesses that qualify for the lower tax rate. This  action would introduce costs to the economy that are not born by those artificial SMEs but are borne  externally. For instance, suppliers would have the complexity of multiple entities, and Inland Revenue  would have more tax entities to deal with.    GST exemptions for particular goods  We support the Government aim of assisting people with low incomes.             The Tax Working Group will be aware of the experiences of other jurisdictions showing that  introducing exemptions (usually on foodstuffs) introduces complexity and uncertainty into the  application of GST. For instance, GST may be exempted from fresh food, but this raises the question  of when does food cross the boundary from fresh to cooked? One instance of this is that retailers  would have different GST rules for hot chicken and cold uncooked chicken. At what point does a  chicken cross the threshold from raw to cooked? Would a green salad served in a restaurant be  regarded as fresh food, and therefore be exempt from GST? These types of uncertainties mean more  complexity for all participants in the supply chain.  GST exemptions also benefit all consumers, not just low income consumers. Thus GST exemptions  are a very blunt instrument when it comes to assistance for low-income people. A tax-free income  threshold or targeted assistance through Working For Families may be better ways of getting the  assistance where it is needed.  GENERAL ISSUES RAISED IN THE ISSUES PAPER  Cash Basis Accounting For Small Businesses  In the spirit of simplification of the tax system, we support the removal of the requirement for small  business to prepare tax financial statements on an accrual basis. For the sake of simplicity, the  threshold for cash basis tax reporting should be aligned with the GST cash basis threshold.  Cash basis tax reporting would significantly simplify the end-of -year process for many New Zealand  SMEs. There would be a timing difference in tax payments as some tax revenue may be deferred to  future periods. However timing differences will eventually work their way out of the tax system.    GST On Low Value Imported Goods  Our response on this issue assumes that this problem is large enough to need solving.  A technological solution could provide a cost effective way of identifying the intended recipient,  notifying them by text message or email, and collecting GST via credit card payment through a mobile  phone app. Effective use of technology could allow a broad based approach where all imported  goods are subject to GST, with very few exemptions.             This submission is not intended to be a full system description, however we believe that this problem  is best solved by collecting the GST from the recipient (as Customs presently do with higher value  items), rather than from the sender (as the Australian model intends to do).  Collecting GST on imported low value goods also has the advantage of helping to level the  competitive playing field for many NZ businesses.    Alignment Of Company Rate, Trustee Rate And Top Individual Rate   We support the alignment of the top individual marginal rate of income tax with the current company  tax rate and the trustee tax rate. Alignment of these tax rates would simplify tax planning and reduce  the use of artificial structures designed purely to arbitrage the difference in tax rates. Alignment also  contributes to the redirection of economic activity from tax minimisation toward productive  economic uses.      \*​\*\*   Thank you for the opportunity to submit on these matters. As part of this consultation process, we  would like engage with Officials to discuss the points raised in this submission. I look forward to  hearing from you to arrange this.      Yours faithfully        Grant Anderson  Head of Government Relations    Xero Limited    \[1\]

Young IFA Network 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington Dear Secretariat Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper We were grateful for the opportunity to present to the Tax Working Group (TWG) earlier this year about intergenerational fairness, environmental taxes and other tax policy issues as representatives of the Young International Fiscal Association Network. Our submission therefore focuses on selected other issues that are of significant interest to our membership. The submissions in this letter represent the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of IFA or of each author's employer. Our comments are set out in five appendixes: 1. The role of the tax system in supporting saving for retirement. 2. The role of the tax system in promoting housing affordability. 3. Design aspects of a capital gains tax. 4. The merits of introducing a land tax. 5. The opportunities for environmental taxation. We would welcome the opportunity to make an oral submission to the TWG on the contents of this submission. Kind regards Young IFA Committee (Jeremy Beckham, Polina Belykh, Elizabeth Elvy, Elena Kong, Jai Nario, Matt Woolley) Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 2 Appendix 1: The role of the tax system in supporting saving for retirement Question from submissions background paper: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 1.1. The TWG has asked about the role of the tax system in encouraging saving for retirement. We welcome the TWG’s review of this area and are supportive of measures delivered through the tax system that are designed to encourage retirement savings. We consider that New Zealand’s current approach to the taxation of retirement savings is at risk of undermining intergenerational fairness and is in need of revision. Tax disparity between savings types 1.2. New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings is out of step with international norms. As noted in the ‘Future of Tax’ Submissions Background Paper (at page 26), concessions offered in most other OECD countries mean that contributions to retirement savings are made out of income that is not taxed. Investment earnings on retirement savings are also often exempt. The relevant taxing point is instead when funds are withdrawn (referred to as EET or Exempt- Exempt-Taxed). 1.3. In line with our broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) framework, our comprehensive income tax in New Zealand ensures that contributions to retirement savings are made out of income that is taxed. Income earned from investment earnings is also taxed. Savings however are not taxed again when withdrawn (referred to as TTE or Taxed-Taxed-Exempt). 1.4. It could be argued that our current approach of relying on our comprehensive income tax (or TTE approach) ensures that economic distortions to save in a retirement account instead of through other savings are minimised. However, we note that our BBLR framework already fails to deliver neutrality between different forms of savings. Owner-occupied and rental housing are significantly undertaxed relative to other assets (supported by figure 21, page 40 of the Submissions Background Paper). 1.5. The impact of disparate marginal effective tax rates of savings types on wealth inequality in New Zealand is a key concern for us. Generally, there is a greater concentration of wealth among older age cohorts as most people tend to accumulate wealth over their working lives. Housing, as a significant form of wealth is of particular concern as issues with housing affordability mean this type of savings is inaccessible to many (and has wider social impacts). We believe that maintaining the current range of effective marginal tax rates for savings could be worsening inequality in New Zealand. As wealth becomes increasingly inherited and not earned, the risk is that any impact on inequality will also become entrenched into future generations. 1.6. We accept that the Terms of Reference for the TWG specifically exclude any recommended changes to the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. However, it should be recognised that investment in housing (owner-occupied and rental properties) is increasingly viewed and accepted as a form of retirement saving. Given that housing is also tax preferred, we would encourage the TWG to consider how alternative measures can be delivered through the tax system to encourage retirement savings that are accessible to all. Ageing population and fiscal pressures 1.7. The pressures on our tax and transfer system are set to increase in the future as New Zealand adjusts to an ageing population. From a fairness perspective, it is important to note that our tax and transfer system operates under an implied intergenerational contract. This contract assumes Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 3 that people generally pay most taxes during their working lives, but less at the beginning and the end of their life where they are more likely to receive benefits funded by taxpayers. In particular, this contract underpins the approach of funding NZ Super from current taxes, which (with the welcome exception of the NZ Superannuation Fund) is largely run on pay-as-you-go principles. 1.8. We are concerned about the sustainability of this intergenerational contract. Long-term fiscal projections published by the Treasury suggest that some combination of increased taxes or a reduction in spending on transfers and other publicly provided goods and services is inevitable for the tax system to support a sustainable revenue base in the future to fund Government expenditure. The Government may well need to consider means-testing NZ Super and moving away from the current pay-as-you-go approach and towards a save-as-you-go system. We note that, if this eventuates, then there will be a transitionary period where one generation will continue to fund NZ Super and cannot reasonably expect to receive the same entitlement in return. 1.9. The Submissions Background Paper (at page 10) also concludes that change is needed to support our ageing population. It is likely that the cost of this change will fall to future generations. There is a case for considering these issues now and for using the tax system as a vehicle to pre-empt this shift and lessen the burden on future generations by incentivising retirement savings (most likely on an individual rather than communal basis). We believe the opportunity should be taken to plan now for a managed transition. Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 4 Appendix 2: The role of the tax system in promoting housing affordability Question from submissions background paper: How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 2.1. The problem of New Zealand housing affordability is well known and has been widely discussed. The nationwide median house price rose 6.9% year-on-year to $530,000 in February 2017 according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand. Auckland has the country’s most expensive housing with the median price of $858,000. New Zealand housing was rated as “seriously & severely unaffordable” according to the 14th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey 2018 (examining the nine developed nations, including Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong), Ireland, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States). 2.2. On average, New Zealand households are spending more than 30% of their income on housing. Currently, an average young couple in Auckland spends 47% of their household income on mortgage payments. Home ownership rates are also dropping – nationwide, only 63.2% of people today live in their own homes - the lowest rate since the 1951 Census and lower than home ownership rates in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. 2.3. House prices are influenced by a number of factors, such as the fundamental demand and supply (in terms of both quantum and speed), migration swings, fiscal and monetary policies. We consider the taxation of property transactions combined with broader taxation framework settings also play an influential role. The following aspects and influences are of particular importance: • Capital gains on housing disposals are generally not subject to tax. This increases the attractiveness of investing in housing (over financial assets, for example) and, consequently, impacts its affordability. • The issue of negative gearing - at present, investors bear short-term tax subsidised losses on their rental properties (as nominal interest (exceeding real borrowing costs) for which a full tax deduction is currently available outweighs rental returns) with the expectation of ultimately making a tax-free capital gain in the long-term. While increasing house prices, arguably, this should put downward pressure on rents being charged. • Equity-funded investments in owner-occupied housing are favoured as no tax is imposed on imputed rental values. Additionally, the existing main home exclusion from the bright-line test and proposed family home / land under the family home exclusions from any potential capital gains tax / land tax regimes (as per the TWG – Terms of reference) further compound the tax environment distortions impacting the New Zealand housing market. • Local authorities impose rates by reference to the rateable value of the land, being the annual value, the capital value or the land value. While this should somewhat level the playing field by effectively acting as a tax on property ownership, we do not consider this impact is significant. 2.4. In terms of the first two items (capital gains and negative gearing), we are supportive of the recent bright-line test extension to 5 years. We are also supportive of the Government’s intention to address the existing problem of negative gearing through the proposed ring-fencing rental losses measures. Both of these issues were previously highlighted by us at the Future of Tax Profession symposium hosted by the University of Auckland. 2.5. In terms of the broader question concerning the effect of the tax system on housing affordability, in our view, while correlation undoubtedly exists, the exact dependencies are difficult to quantify. Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 5 The increase in house prices will in part be due to a number of factors other than the tax treatment of housing. 2.6. International literature suggests that the presence or absence of a capital gains tax is not a decisive factor in explaining house price behaviours. For example, the Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey notes that most of the “unaffordable” housing jurisdictions have capital gains tax regimes, however, the same issues persist. Additionally, modelling for the previous 2010 TWG suggested that a capital gains tax of 20% (with an exemption for owner- occupied housing) would only have a modest impact on the New Zealand housing prices. As such, we recommend the TWG consider the issues surrounding housing more broadly than just in the context of a capital gains tax. 2.7. The taxation framework alone will not solve the problem of housing affordability due to a range of other policies and influences having a more pronounced impact on the housing market. However, in our view, certain property focused tax measures (similar to ring-fencing of rental losses and extension of the bright line test) should be considered to the extent they improve the coherence, integrity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. If designed well, such measures will likely increase tax revenue and, consequently, provide scope for a potential reduction in other taxes. Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 6 Appendix 3: Design aspects of a capital gains tax Question from submissions background paper: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Design issues with a capital gains tax 3.1. In designing a capital gains tax, the TWG has an opportunity to create a coherent, fair and relatively simple regime for taxing capital income. The design of a capital gains tax will also inform the potential distributional impact of the tax system, including the intergenerational impact. Our submission does not express a general view on a capital gains tax, but rather highlights a few design considerations for the TWG. Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised? 3.2. We would like the TWG to also consider a third or "hybrid" approach. A hybrid approach consists of taxing on realisation those assets where valuation and/or cash flow are a problem, and taxing other assets on an accrual basis. We acknowledge that different approaches for different asset types could create additional distortions (as is the case with the tax treatment of savings vehicles). For example, if publically listed shares are taxed on accrual and unlisted shares on realisation, there will be a tax created incentive for companies to delist. Nonetheless, the benefit of considering a hybrid approach is that some of the issues created by taxing gains on a realisation basis can be removed for some assets. The most prevalent problem with taxing gains on realisation is that it creates a strong incentive to hold onto appreciated assets to avoid the tax – the so-called "lock-in effect". Should the CGT include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? 3.3. One of the common criticisms of the existing income tax base is that it arbitrarily taxes some capital gains but not others – a capital gains tax with a narrow base is likely to face the same criticisms and contribute little to perceptions of fairness in the tax system. Further, a narrow base CGT is likely to increase compliance costs and Government administration costs, while potentially sacrificing simplicity (by giving rise to uncertainty and enforcement concerns for issues at the boundaries), all the while raising little additional revenue to offset these additional costs. We therefore recommend that in designing a CGT, the TWG carefully weigh up any additional costs of allowing exemptions to the CGT, which are likely to increase administrative costs for Government and diminish the effectiveness of the tax for revenue collection. Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? 3.4. Regardless of whether a CGT is a separate tax to income tax, the TWG should consider how the existing tax administration rules and processes might apply. An attractive feature of the New Zealand tax system is that the common disputes procedures, penalties, and taxpayer responsibilities are the same for a range of taxes. The TWG should keep those rules in mind when designing a CGT as the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration rules can impact perceptions of fairness in the tax system just as much as the rules defining when CGT applies. Further, we strongly advise against the use of misaligned rates of tax on capital gains versus income earnings. New Zealand has first-hand experience of the raft of problems that can arise when tax rates are misaligned on transferable or substitutable earnings; and while a lower rate of tax on capital gains may have appeal (whether political, or in comparison to precedent from Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 7 overseas jurisdictions), we consider that misaligned rates of tax will both add another layer of administrative complexity and erode tax system efficiency as the current incentive to invest in capital is maintained. Administrative solutions to support CGT 3.5. It is not controversial to suggest that a comprehensive CGT with no exceptions is the best way to remove the distortion in our current system, as it ensures a broad base for the CGT. However, given the clear terms of reference have expressly removed the possibility of taxation of the family home or the land under it, we consider that the TWG should carefully consider designing alternative solutions to buttress the narrower base CGT to ensure that efficiency in administration is maintained notwithstanding this significant exemption. 3.6. Examples of such solutions could include an administrative mechanism to mandate the need to record the determination that something is the “family homes” and of purchasers’ IRD numbers upon purchase, to prevent taxpayers from claiming multiple “family homes” and to aid Inland Revenue in tracking purchasing behaviour. 3.7. To overcome the “lock-in” effect, a monetary threshold could be introduced, so that a family home that triggers a capital gain over a certain amount (for example +$1m capital gain) could immediately be brought into the rules irrespective of the family home exception. While such a rule does clearly tax the “family home”, it may nevertheless be a plausible recommendation as a reasonably high threshold would still exclude the majority of New Zealand home owners who are unlikely to make such large gains. Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 8 Appendix 4: The merits of introducing a land tax Question from submissions background paper: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Design issues 4.1. A land tax imposes an annual tax liability on landowners, calculated by reference to the value of land owned by them. As there is a fixed supply of land, a universal land tax is generally seen as efficient with low administration and compliance costs. Given the immobile nature of land, it can be a reliable source of tax revenue. However, a land tax may be perceived as unfair as it targets a single type of natural capital asset, affecting those that hold land. This would result in a wealth loss for landowners (if the tax cannot be passed on to others) compared to holding other capital assets and would have a disproportionate impact on taxpayers that hold land. In addition, the intended outcome of improving housing affordability is unlikely to be realised due to the exclusion of owner-occupied housing. 4.2. Consistent with the BBLR framework for the New Zealand tax system, a land tax should be low- rate and comprehensive to be most efficient and generate the most revenue (if that is in fact the purpose of introducing a land tax). While the terms of reference exclude land under the family home, that exclusion will result in less tax revenue as this land forms a significant share of the land tax base. Further exclusions that have previously been raised in the context of land tax that may be considered, such as land for public use, conservation and Māori land, will also have the same impact of reducing tax revenue. 4.3. A question arises as to whether a land tax should be calculated by reference to the value of the land, with reference to expected annual rent or expected sales value. Most jurisdictions that have land taxes have used the expected sales value approach. While local authorities have a land valuation system for imposing rates, this is not updated annually. It would therefore be an additional cost for the Government to obtain annual property valuations to enable tax on the current property values, increasing the compliance costs of administering a land tax. Further, the property valuations can be arbitrary and will not necessarily represent the actual market value of the land. For these reasons, we consider that adopting an expected sales value approach (consistent with most other jurisdictions) would be preferable. Drop in land and property values and impact on housing affordability 4.4. The introduction of a land tax would likely result in a one-off drop in property values and be borne by those who hold land at the time the land tax is introduced. Work done for the 2010 TWG suggested a 1% land tax could result in a fall of anywhere between 16.7% and 26.4% in affected land values (with Inland Revenue concluding at the time the lower estimate could be optimistic) 1 . The devaluation of land is likely to create a significant economic shock. Potential purchasers of land are likely to price in the ongoing land tax cost in future purchases of land. These flow on effects should be taken into account in considering whether land tax should be introduced in New Zealand. 1 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-taxation-of-capital-gains- ird\_treasury.pdf Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 9 Appendix 5: The opportunities for environmental taxation Question from submissions background paper: What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? 5.1. New Zealand currently collects little revenue from environmental taxes relative to other OECD countries as illustrated in the graph included in the ‘Future of Tax’ Submissions Background Paper (figure 22, page 50). We are supportive of the TWG considering environmental issues and potential environmental taxes. 5.2. The Submissions Background Paper refers to the TWG’s use of Treasury’s Living Standards Framework to measure well-being and the impact of potential changes to taxation in a more comprehensive manner than simply looking at income. We consider the use of this framework to be an important way to assess the impact the overuse of New Zealand’s natural resources has on well-being and the impact current policy settings as well as any new taxes could have. The overlay of the traditional criteria that underpin a tax system (coherence; integrity; fairness) is also important when considering the case for environmental taxes, in particular the impact on intergenerational fairness of the current limited use of environmental taxes. 5.3. Environmental challenges and seeking to address these challenges is a key concern for us. Future generations are likely to bear a greater burden of environmental degradation and the associated costs to address environmental restoration. 5.4. It seems that short-term personal/business interests often take prevalence over longer-term environmental concerns as the benefits that can be received from the use of the environment (despite potential degradation occurring as a side-effect) currently outweigh the perceived costs of preventing environmental degradation. This discrepancy creates a challenge to intergenerational fairness as the costs of today’s actions are carried by future generations. 5.5. Given the current disregard for environmental impacts in favour of personal benefits, some form of incentive is likely required to facilitate change in behaviours. 5.6. We recommend broadening the current use of environmental taxation to: • Place emphasis on the areas of environmental change that are seen to be of key importance to New Zealanders; • Trigger a change in society’s perception and behaviour regarding environmental issues; and • Generate additional tax revenue. However, we do not consider direct hypothecation or ring- fencing of the revenue generated by any additional taxes as beneficial as this could unfairly limit the level of funds attributed to correcting environmental challenges and disregards the fact that the environmental damage caused by certain economic activities often has spill-over effects which reach far wider than the immediate location of the activity. Taxes vs regulations 5.7. New Zealand already utilises regulation to assist with aspects of environmental protection. Where behavioural taxes could be helpful is where they will actively reach a wider portion of society as well as operating as a type of education campaign. There are benefits and disadvantages to using behavioural taxes, which would need to be considered in the context of the particular environmental issues to be addressed. Young IFA Network Tax Working Group Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 10 5.8. Behavioural taxes could be of benefit as they encourage change in individual behaviours through price signalling and assist the public to understand the need and benefit of the tax. Disadvantages are that the taxes can be expensive if poorly targeted, and they can increase the overall tax burden on taxpayers if there is no reduction in other taxes in proportion to the behavioural tax introduced or if the good or service taxed has few alternatives. Where behavioural taxes are used to incentivise changes in behaviour, longevity of the tax revenues raised cannot be expected. 5.9. Environmental taxes do not need to be considered in isolation. Taxes introduced to address other aspects of the tax system could also help address environmental challenges. One example could be a land or other resource tax, which while designed primarily to address equity in the tax system could also be designed to collect taxes on an environmental basis with the tax level based on the level of resource usage or level of degradation expected by the activity. Further Government wide policy reform could also assist in this regard, for example the introduction of stronger waste regulation and banning of single-use-disposable plastics. 5.10. Another key opportunity for taxation is to incentivise innovation towards more environmentally friendly technologies and processes to limit future environmental impacts. In this regard, we recommend considering taxes to challenge certain behaviours and raise tax revenue, but also considering the use of tax benefits that could incentivise taxpayers to change their processes. Some examples may be the recently announced R&D Tax Incentive or accelerated depreciation deductions for environmentally friendly technologies. 5.11. We are supportive of the TWG’s consideration of environmental taxes. We recommend that the introduction of behavioural taxes is considered to address specific environmental concerns and consideration is given to widening of other taxes to incorporate a portion of environment taxation.

Submission to the TAX WORKING GROUP Tania Scott 30 th Apr 2018 Health Promoter Ashburton Alcohol and Drug Service (ACADS) ACADS is a community based NGO established in 1998 by a group of local community members concerned about the lack of Alcohol & Drug Services in the Ashburton district. ACADS is governed by a voluntary community board of directors who are elected at the ACADS AGM. ACADS purpose is to provide services that empower individuals and groups in our community to increase their knowledge and control over the quality of their physical health, mental health and social well-being by reducing the harms caused by alcohol consumption. We achieve this by being responsive to both individual and community needs, and by providing quality, current, and evidence-based health interventions. Our services include clinical support to individuals as well as health promotion, with both a regulatory officer and a cultural change officer. My role within ACADS is to promote healthy drinking cultures through community action and networking strategies. I do not wish to speak to my submission before the committee We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well- being of all New Zealanders. We appreciate that such interventions have a significant impact on lifestyle choices and can only be undertaken at a national level. We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand in not fair for the majority of New Zealanders and does not reflect the efforts being made at a community level. We strongly believe that increasing the price of alcohol will lead to a reduction in consumption and that the increase in revenue should be used to offset the social and personal harm that alcohol causes. The most effective way to do this would be to increase the excise tax and increase the amount of funding for prevention and treatment services. Our community puts significant effort into reducing and controlling the amount of harm alcohol causes; we fund and run community action campaigns focused on reducing alcohol harm for individuals, we have a Local Alcohol Policy and we have bylaws restricting the use of alcohol in public places. Historically, the Ashburton community has supported policies that reduce the consumption of alcohol. We had a forty five year ban on the sale of alcohol in our district and then fought for fifteen years to keep alcohol out of our local supermarkets. The Ashburton District Council Residents Survey consistently shows that the over accessibility of alcohol is a concern to the people who live in our community. Our local health and wellbeing service providers continue to highlight hazardous drinking as an underlying cause of harm for individuals and their families. National and International research is emerging on the causative link between alcohol consumption and the chronic preventable illnesses that are such a cost for our nation. We recommend that the tax working group support New Zealand community efforts to control the over consumption of alcohol by increasing alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products. In addition, we recommend that the alcohol excise levy to the Health Promotion Agency be increased to allow for more local alcohol research to be undertaken. This will lead to better informed policy decisions and more consistent public health interventions. Yours Sincerely Tania Scott Health Promoter ASHBURTON Alcohol and Drug Service \[1\]

To: Tax Working Group submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission on: Future of Tax Date: 30 April 2018 Submitter: Mark Ross Chief Executive Agcarm – representing NZ’s animal medicine and crop protection industries 111 The Terrace Wellington \[1\] 2 Submission on: Future of Tax 1. Introduction 1.1 Agcarm welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Future of Tax discussion document. 1.2 As an industry association operating within the Agriculture sector, our main focus relates to the Environment, as outlined on pages 40-42. Much of our comment is reflective and supportive of the Federated Farmers submission. 1.3 Agcarm is supportive of the tax principles outlined on page 19 of the paper, namely:  Efficiency  Equity and fairness  Revenue integrity  Fiscal adequacy  Compliance and administration costs  Coherence 1.4 We note the paper’s statement that these are the established criteria used in past reviews both domestically and overseas. Therefore, we are supportive of these principles being used as guidance by the Tax Working Group (TWG). 2. General Comments Tax and the Environment 2.1 Without detail it is difficult to provide an informed response on tax and the environment. However, like Federated Farmers, Agcarm believes that it is inappropriate to consider tax as ‘the solution’ to environmental issues. Like the environment itself, consideration of how to care for the environment is complex and has a number of layers to it. Further, a number of environmental aspects, including those discussed in the background paper are already being dealt with by other policy and regulation. 2.2 We question whether the Tax Working Group (TWG), which solely has a focus on tax, is the most appropriate group to be considering environment and tax issues. However, we do acknowledge the TWG’s mandate. 2.3 Agcarm believes that if the Government wishes to further consider environmental issues it should first identify the problem or problems, and then should prioritise these. This would then allow for full consideration, in the context of the wider economic environment and existing frameworks, of the range of potential solutions. Taxation might be one, and regulation another. 2.4 Agcarm submits that there are also industry-led initiatives, such as Agrecovery for example, which is funded by Agcarm members. Agrecovery is leading New Zealand in the recycling of plastic containers manufactured by our members, and is a great example of where industry has taken the lead with environmental stewardship. 2.5 Agrecovery has increased its collection volumes of plastic from 50,000 kgs in 2007, to 370,000 kgs in 2017. All of this is voluntary, and is funded solely by industry. 2.6 We suggest that the use of tax to encourage better environmental behaviour may be inappropriate because it puts a price on the non-complying behaviour which some taxpayers may simply accept. 3 2.8 This is not to say that taxation might not have a role, it is just that the wider questions need to be considered before solutions (which may or may not include tax) can be prioritised and considered. In some cases, a combination of carrots and sticks may be appropriate. For example, regulation requires farmers to plant alongside fenced waterways, and the current tax rules incentivise a lot of this expenditure. 2.9 We note that over the last few years, agriculture has been subject to a considerable amount of regulation, a lot of it in the environmental space. For example, dairy farms are subject to strict regulations imposed at a regional level concerning dairy shed effluent and its disposal. For a number of farmers this requirement caused significant costs. However, almost all dairy farmers accepted and met their obligations because they were properly marketed and were regionally targeted. 2.10 The fundamental point is New Zealand already has existing regulatory frameworks and industry led initiatives for addressing sustainable management of identified environmental issues. These frameworks are iterative and constantly changing, as details around threats to the environment, or new information/practices aimed at protecting these environmental goods, emerge. These frameworks are able to adapt to, and are better targeted to, addressing issues at a local level in response to specific ecosystems and issues. A taxation approach, particularly one developed at a national level, would be nowhere near as adaptable. 2.11 Taxation is a blunt tool that will not address these nuanced needs. The fact these issues are emerging/still issues is not because of any great failure in legislative/regulatory frameworks, more it is the fact we are playing catch up and the understanding of often complex and interacting environmental functions has lagged. 3. Conclusion 3.1 Agcarm is concerned about the narrow definition of “environmental tax” that the TWG is using. This is “a charge levied on a tax base that has a proven, specific, negative impact on the environment.” Tax concessions that support the environment (the carrot), such as immediate deductibility for riparian planting, are not included within this definition. Thankfully the TWG mandate in this space and some of the detail in Chapter 7 of the Paper indicates that this is not a limitation. 3.2 Agcarm encourages the TWG to investigate the range of industry led stewardship programmes that already exist in the agricultural sector, prior to progressing with any environmental tax proposals. The TWG may be ‘surprised’ by the number of initiatives already in place, and how these are ensuring that our environment is already being preserved for future generations. 4.

ALEXANDER TURNBULL LIBRARY ENDOWMENT TRUST PO BOX 12 349, WELLINGTON 30 April 2018 Sir Michael Cullen Tax Working Group PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Dear Sir Michael, This is a submission from the Alexander Turnbull Library Endowment Trust to let you know some of the tax topics that interest it. As a Charitable Trust, ATLET supports the continuation of existing tax treatment for charities. 1. This means for genuine charities (those organisations who work for the greater good that goes beyond private benefit) there are strong reasons for their earnings to remain outside the system that taxes revenue when that revenue is spent on charitable purposes; and 2. There are strong reasons for rebates for donations to genuine charities to remain uncapped as this it is a way for all New Zealanders to support organisations like ATLET whose objectives are to achieve outcomes for the wider public good. ATLET would like the Tax Working Group to go one step further and consider tax provisions such as those available in Australia to provide an incentive to New Zealanders to share their cultural and heritage assets, following the example of Alexander Turnbull 100 years ago. With 110,000 not-for-profits in New Zealand (and nearly 100,000 of them sporting bodies) who, amongst other things can offer benefits such as stadium advertising, the donations space in New Zealand is highly competitive. The Australian tax treatment of culture and heritage is a way of balancing this. ATLET believes this model could be adapted for the New Zealand cultural heritage environment. The attached appendix provides details of the Australian model. Thank-you for the opportunity to provide this submission. ATLET would be happy to discuss this aspect further with members of the Tax Working Group. Warm regards, John Meads Chair, ATLET contact@turnbulltrust.org.nz \[1\] https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Gifts-and-fundraising/Claiming-tax-deductions/Gift-types,- requirements-and-valuation-rules/Cultural-gifts-program/ Cultural Gifts Program To encourage people to donate cultural items to public art galleries, museums, libraries and archives in Australia, the Cultural Gifts Program offers tax incentives to donors. Donors can be an individual, company, trust or other type of taxpayer. The Cultural Gifts Program has no special rules for gifts of trading stock. This program is administered by the Department of Communication and the Arts. On this page: • What types of property can I donate? • Who can I donate my property to? • How much can I claim? See also: • Cultural Gifts ProgramExternal Link • Trading stock What types of property can I donate? You can donate property, other than an estate, interest in land or interest in a building or part of a building. Examples of tax deductible gifts which qualify under the Cultural Gifts Program include: • Indigenous arts • cultural artefacts • natural and scientific materials • film and social history pieces • paintings • manuscripts • books • antiques • jewellery. Who can I donate my property to? Under the Cultural Gifts Program you can donate property to: • the Australiana Fund • a public library in Australia • a public museum in Australia • a public art gallery in Australia • an institution in Australia consisting of a public library, a public museum and a public art gallery or of any two of them • the Australian Government for Artbank. With the exception of the Australiana Fund and Artbank, the recipient of the gift must be a DGR. The DGR must ensure the gift is included in a collection it is maintaining or establishing. How much can I claim? You will need to get a valuation of the property you are donating. The general rule is that the amount you can claim as a deduction is the average of two or more written valuations made by valuers approved by the Arts Secretary. However, different arrangements apply if the property was: • acquired for the purpose of donating it • acquired subject to an arrangement that it would be donated, or • acquired (except by inheritance) less than one year before donating it. In these circumstances, the valuation of the gift is the lesser of the: • amount you paid for the property • average of the written valuations. Different arrangements also apply if no amount is included in your assessable income for the gift, and an amount would have been included if the property had been sold rather than donated. In this circumstance, a written valuation is not required. One example is property purchased with the intention to make a profit that the donor later disposed of as a gift. The valuation of the gift is either: • the amount paid for the property • if the property had been manufactured or created, the amount allowable as a tax deduction if it had been sold by the donor. Your tax deduction will be reduced, by a reasonable amount, if you donate property to a DGR without the DGR actually receiving: • immediate custody and control • unconditional right to retain custody and control in perpetuity • unencumbered legal and equitable title. Your tax deduction may also be reduced if you place any conditions on donation of the property. If you are registered for GST (or required to be registered) these amounts may need to be adjusted. Property donated under the program is exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Gifts-and-fundraising/Claiming-tax-deductions/Gift-types,- requirements-and-valuation-rules/Heritage-gifts/ Heritage gifts You may be able to claim a tax deduction if: • you donate a heritage gift to a National Trust organisation, and • the Trust accepts the gift to preserve it for the benefit of the public. On this page: • What is a heritage gift? • Who can I donate to? • Partial donations • How much can I claim? What is a heritage gift? Heritage gifts are places of: • outstanding natural, Indigenous or historic heritage value to the nation • significant natural, Indigenous or historic heritage value owned or controlled by the Australian Government • significant natural, Indigenous or historic heritage value throughout Australia. You can find lists of heritage places: • The Commonwealth Heritage List is a list of natural, Indigenous and historic heritage places owned or controlled by the Australian Government. • The National Heritage List is Australia’s list of natural, historic and Indigenous places of outstanding significance to the nation. See also: • National Heritage ListExternal Link • Commonwealth Heritage ListExternal Link Who can I donate to? You can only donate heritage gifts to the following DGRs: • the Australian Council of National Trusts • the National Trust of Australia (New South Wales) • the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) • the National Trust of Queensland • the National Trust of South Australia • the National Trust of Australia (WA) • the National Trust of Australia (Tasmania) • the National Trust of Australia (Northern Territory) • the National Trust of Australia (ACT). These DGRs must accept the gift to preserve it for the benefit of the public. Partial donations The making of a gift to a DGR involves the transfer of property to that DGR. For there to be a transfer, the property that belonged to the donor must become the property of the DGR. However, an exception is provided for heritage gifts. If the terms and conditions of the gift of the property are such that the DGR does not have immediate custody and control of, or full legal title to, the donated property, the donor can claim a reduced tax deduction. The reduced amount should reflect the benefit the donor received from retaining some rights or custody and enjoyment of the donated property. Example Winston owns and resides in a house in Sydney that has significant heritage value. Winston decides to donate the property to the National Trust of Australia (New South Wales) in the current year for inclusion on the National Heritage List. The conditions of the donation stipulate that Winston will be able to continue to reside in the property until his death. The amount of Winston's tax deduction would need to be reduced by the value of the benefit Winston receives by continuing to reside in the property. End of example How much can I claim?

Future of Tax Submission on behalf of: The Alliance Party Submitted by: Kay Murray Role: Co convenor The Alliance Party Address: Email: Pho ne: Preamble We have purposely started our submission by answering the second question “What is the purpose of tax?,” because we believe this is at the essence of all tax policy. Once the purpose is established all other decisions will flow from there. We question the underlying assumption of the working party that continued economic growth is a given. We strongly believe that the growth model is fatally flawed. “Anyone who thinks we can have infinite growth on a finite planet is either a madman or an economist,” David Attenborough Infinite growth militates against the measures needed to combat climate change and inequality. The future relies on us collectively reducing consumption and sharing the wealth we already possess much more equitably. In addition we question the assumption that low taxes on profits, especially in the corporate sector, promotes economic growth. Given the explosion of very high executive salaries it is reasonable to deduce that low taxes on profits simply creates very wealthy executives and shareholders and actually lowers the incentive to plough (pre-tax) profits back into the business via innovation or improving staff wages and working conditions. What Is the Purpose Of Tax One of the purposes of taxation is to give revenue to the government to redistribute for the good of all. (There are other ways well worth exploring to supplement taxation, outside the scope of this review) But this is not the only purpose. Tax policies, regardless of the income they provide to the government, give a very clear indication of how we want society to function. A progressive taxation structure gives the message that excessively high incomes are undesirable, that we seek a more equal society. A high tax on excessive profits gives businesses the same \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] message i.e. that consumers, workers and the environment should not be exploited for the sake of profit. Long time Alliance spokesperson on taxation, Professor Jim Flynn often said “even if I didn't need the money, I would still want a high top tax rate because it’s the right thing to do” A carbon tax gives the message that emissions must be reduced. A capital gains tax gives tells everyone that property is to be used for a productive or social purpose not a way to get rich quickly. Houses are meant to be homes to live in. We are committed to progressive taxation as a means to help deliver a more equitable society and ensure that everyone’s basic human rights are respected – a warm dry home, a liveable income, free education and healthcare and a healthy safe environment. What does the future of tax look like? The future of tax is progressive. The future of tax is in helping to make sure that wealth and resources are shared equitably. Ideally the future of tax should see a return to the rates pre -1970s when top tax rates of 67% were seen as acceptable for those on high incomes. The defining factor is not the amount of tax paid per say, but the amount of income left over for personal spending once tax is paid. Someone with an income of, for example, $1 million dollars will still have in excess of $300,000 to spend per year even if they pay a marginal tax rate of 67% tax rate. What they have left over is at least five times the average wage. The future of tax should see the end of GST – a regressive tax that hits those on lowest incomes hardest. GST could be replaced by a very small financial transactions tax – as low as 2 cents per $100 – on withdrawals only. This would capture all transactions including financial services, online purchases made from overseas companies and informal small scale online trading by individuals e.g. trade me. Online trading in many different shapes and forms will become much prevalent in the future and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to apply GST to. A financial transactions tax would also capture some revenue from cash trading since it would be applied to cash withdrawals from bank accounts . Removing GST would also simplify paying taxes for small businesses. Paying GST is time consuming and often nerve wracking for small businesses. The future of tax will hopefully see progressive taxation on profits for businesses and trusts that parallels tax rates on income. This would send a clear message that excessive profiteering is undesirable. There is no reason why overseas companies who do business here should not pay taxes here on their profits. In an ideal world there would be cooperation between countries around multinational company’s tax but the reality is that tax havens are probably going to be around for some time yet. So New Zealand must take a stand to protect local industries and ensure that overseas companies do not take advantage of our infrastructure without helping to pay for its upkeep. Taxing corporate profits is particularly important with increasing mechanization of the means of production and the proliferation of high tech companies that generate huge amounts of income/ profit for their owners but employ relatively few workers such as facebook, google, etc. As income taxes from workers shrink, corporate taxes must rise. The future of tax should see a carbon tax on polluting companies instead of a carbon trading scheme which will almost certainly turn into another money -making scheme for speculative investors, rather than do anything to reduce emissions. Let’s not make the same mistakes as have been made with housing. To combat the effects of increased prices resulting from a carbon tax, one suggestion worth considering is to give the revenue from this tax back to all New Zealanders, sharing it equally in the form of a universal dividend. The future of tax will see a capital gains tax on all but the family home, an inheritance tax on amounts over a preestablished limit e.g. $1,000,000 and a land tax tailored to discourage land banking and the accumulation of land for speculative rather than productive purposes. Are we taxing the right things? In the main yes but not progressively enough. The exception being GST which could be replaced by an all -encompassing but very small financial transactions tax on all withdrawals of funds from banks/ financial institutions. Taxes should also be introduced to discourage land banking and speculation, and to encourage producers to reduce carbon emissions. Can tax make houses more affordable? On its own tax cannot make houses more affordable. Tax can make speculation on housing undesirable. A land tax can play a part in stopping the inflation of land prices which is the main factor behind the rise in house prices. However, policies are also needed on who can buy houses that they don’t intend to live in and how many they can buy. And the state and local government need to maintain a substantial stock of housing for rent at affordable prices to drive demand for private rentals, and thus rents, down. House prices are too high and will need to drop to be affordable unless wages go up substantially. The government will need to anticipate this and ensure that people on low and middle incomes who are heavily mortgaged do not lose out when this happens. What tax issues matter the most? The message matters the most. Tax should give the message that we are all in this together. We are interdependent. We alone do not generate our own wealth. The present and the future are predicated on the efforts of many, many generations past. And the generosity of the planet in providing resources. We agree to share our wealth and resources for the common good. “Tax is love” Shamubeel Eaqub As such, tax revenue is to be respected. It is not to be squandered in frivolous spending. Tax should be given willingly by each according to their ability. And spent wisely for the benefit of all.

As part of the AMP group we share a history that dates back to 1849, and today AMP Capital globally manages over A$187 billion (as at 31 December 2017) on behalf of clients through a network of offices in developed and emerging markets around the world. As a majority owned subsidiary of AMP, we operate independently with a pure investment focus but benefit from the resources of our parent company. AMP Capital has over 70 years’ experience managing investments for Australian, New Zealand and international investors. During this time it has evolved from a traditional funds management organisation to a broad-based investment management company, providing services to all sectors of the financial services industry. In New Zealand AMP Capital has approximately 65 staff and operates in both Auckland and Wellington, with its head office located in Wellington. Our organisation is committed to the New Zealand market and we are proud to provide investment management services to a range of New Zealand entities, including superannuation schemes, corporates, KiwiSaver providers, charities, iwi, insurance providers, life insurers, family trusts, councils, membership and incorporated societies. Currently we have around $21.2 billion funds under management and manage funds on behalf of 100 institutional clients. INTRODUCTION > The New Zealand economy has strong macro-economic foundations. We are an easy country to do business with, corruption is low and we have a stable government. However we suffer from relatively low rates of total factor productivity growth which is a constraint on improvements in economic well-being. > The New Zealand tax system is generally sound and relatively distortion free. One distortion that is a significant constraint on our long-term well-being is the different tax-treatment of property and retirement savings. > An assessment of the country’s future tax needs should not be considered in isolation to the quantity and quality of government spending. > The New Zealand tax system will be increasingly challenged by globalisation and the free movement of labour and capital. This will necessitate the shift over time to the taxation of less mobile assets. > Corporate tax rates are in a “race to the bottom” as countries seek to maintain their global competitiveness and attract investment. > Like many western democracies we are also facing the challenges presented by demographics, particularly our ageing population. PURPOSES OF TAXATION > The primary purpose of taxation is to raise the revenue to fund government’s activities. > The tax system is also used to achieve the Government’s desired income redistribution outcomes. > Taxes can be used to discourage certain activities that are determined to be harmful (e.g. tobacco consumption). ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS > Tax policy inevitably involves trade-offs between efficiency and equity. > A tax system designed for maximum economic efficiency may not deliver the desired social outcome with respect to equity and fairness. Equally a tax system designed to maximise fairness and equity will be sub-optimal in terms of maximising economic growth and aggregate national prosperity. > For example a highly progressive income tax scale may be seen as fairer, while a lower, flatter income tax regime combined with consumption taxes is likely to contribute to higher economic growth. PRINCIPLES OF A SOUND TAX SYSTEM > Taxes should be simple, easy and low cost to comply with, > Taxes should be levied on the beneficiary of the activity being taxed, > Taxes should be broad-based and low rate, SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NZ) LIMITED2 > Taxes should be stable and predictable to allow businesses and other tax payers to plan for the future, > The taxes should be raised in a manner that minimises tax-created distortions and economic costs, > The tax system should not impede global competitiveness. SPECIFIC COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1 Personal Income Taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST) > Efficiency and equity trade-offs are most sensitive in respect to income tax levied on personal income earned and expenditure tax (GST). > Income tax has an economic cost while GST is regressive and not effective in terms of redistributing income. Therefore reducing the share of tax revenue from income would support productivity and economic growth. Offsetting this with higher GST would be regressive. > New Zealand has a relatively flat income tax structure (four steps of 10.5%, 17.5%, 30% and 33%) combined with a broad-based goods and services tax of 15%. We believe this structure provides a good balance between efficiency and equity. > The tax/benefit interface continues to generate high effective marginal tax rates that are a barrier to transition to work and are negative for labour force participation, productivity and economic growth. > Where there is scope for lower taxes in the future that should be centred on reducing income taxes. Any need for increased revenue should be raised through GST. > Imposition of GST should remain universal in order to maximise simplicity and minimise compliance costs. > There are GST boundary issues in particular, around the financial services definitions and the arranging boundary. Falling within or outside these boundaries can create complex issues for taxpayers and create additional costs of GST that cascade for that taxpayer and/or the ultimate end user. > In particular, the proposed GST treatment of outsourced services obtained by a Fund Manager in comparison to the GST treatment of functions provided by employees of a Fund Manager. The current GST treatment proposal will create an in source bias as no or nil GST applies to salary and wage of employees, whereas GST would be attracted to services provided by third party providers. A review of the GST boundaries and the financial services definition would be appropriate. 2 Corporate Tax > With respect to corporate taxation, consideration needs to be given to where the tax burden falls. Corporate’s pay tax on profits, which means the shareholders are the ultimate taxpayer. > Corporate tax rates are under downward pressure around the world as countries vie for international competitiveness. New Zealand’s corporate tax rate needs to competitive with other counties, Australia in particular. > When comparing corporate tax rates across different jurisdictions, it needs to be remembered that most jurisdictions do not have imputation or franking systems. This means both the company and shareholder pay tax whereas in New Zealand the shareholders tax is generally offset by imputation credits. When comparing corporate tax rates between jurisdictions both the entities tax and shareholder tax positions should be considered. > New Zealand’s current corporate tax rate of 28% is higher than the G7 average of 21.5%. Australia’s corporate tax rate is 27.5% for base rate entities or 30% otherwise. > A progressive regime for corporate tax: > If lower or progressive rates are introduced than consideration of the universal imputation credit system for all corporates needs to be made. > Further consideration will need to be given to the double tax issue of the entity/company and the shareholder. > A key consideration is the need to avoid a significant gap between the corporate tax rate and the top personal tax rate so as not to encourage structuring of individual’s tax positions to maximise their tax efficiencies. That gap is already 5 percentage points. > International pressure to lower the corporate tax rate is constrained by the progressivity of personal income taxes. > While the gap between the two rates would be costly to close, consideration needs to be given to the cost/benefit of lower the corporate tax rate further if it were to open up a more significant gap. SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NZ) LIMITED3 3 Capital Gains Tax and Housing > As pressure grows to maintain revenue as the population ages, a broadening of the tax base will be required. > Introduction of a broad-based capital gains tax is the obvious missing component of our tax system when we compare ourselves with overseas jurisdictions. > There are arguments for and against a Capital Gains Tax. > Arguments for include: > Prima facie a level playing field or consistency from a tax perspective across all types of assets or investment types e.g. fixed interest securities, equities, real estate etc. assuming there are no or very limited exemptions. > Arguments against include: > Any exemptions or special exclusions from any Capital Gains Tax regime will create an uneven playing field or a fairness issue from a tax perspective. > Potential double taxation if other rules or regimes are not removed or changed on the introduction of Capital Gains Tax regime. > The cost of foregone revenue due to Capital Gains Tax regimes being on a realisation basis, whereas the Fair Dividend Rate (FDR) income method under the Foreign Investment Fund rules is on an straight five percent of the market value which includes an unrealised portion. > New Zealand has elements of a Capital Gains Tax (the bright-line test for residential property, the Fair Dividend Rate method under the Foreign Investment Fund rules, and the Financial Arrangement Rules), but the piece-meal approach adds complexity, confusion and avoidance. > Given that the family home has been excluded from the Group’s Terms of Reference, introduction of a Capital Gains Tax would not meet the criteria of a comprehensive CGT and would open it up to avoidance and non-compliance, the policing of which would more than outweigh the benefits (efficiency gains) of the tax. > The lack of any tax on the imputed rental value of owner occupied housing continues to contribute to over-investment in housing and under-investment in more productive assets. > Consideration would need to be given to the implications on or for Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and whether exemptions for this type of entity would be appropriate. 4 Taxation of retirement savings > A significant distortion in the New Zealand tax system exists between the tax treatment of housing and retirement savings. > Accepting the non-viability of a broad-based capital gains tax doesn’t preclude the need to level the playing field between property and retirement savings. > Having ruled out a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax and in the absence of a tax on the imputed rental of owner occupied housing the rebalancing should be achieved through a change to the tax treatment of retirement savings. > The tax treatment of housing is that home owners buy their home (pay off their mortgage) using after tax income. However neither the imputed rents nor the capital gains are taxed. This equates to a tax-exempt-exempt regime. > The tax treatment of retirement savings is that contributions are from after tax income, investment earnings are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-exempt. This is described as “TTE” > A levelling of the playing field would be assisted by the transition to an “EET” for retirement savings. Under an EET regime, contributions are made out of gross income, investment earnings would be tax exempt but withdrawals would be taxed. > We acknowledge that the transition would be fiscally challenging but such a move would leave the country in a stronger position long term. > If New Zealand superannuation had an EET approach this would be out of step with Australia, which currently has an TTE approach to its superannuation. > The ability to transfer superannuation between New Zealand and Australia for individuals could be complex and difficult, if there are different approaches to superannuation. > There will be tax complexities for a more mobile labour force that works in both New Zealand and Australia if there are different approaches to superannuation between the jurisdictions. > We would be competing from the same standpoint for investment assets as the European superannuation funds (EET approach). > We need to create options and/or products that provide the appropriate tax outcomes for individual taxpayers once they exit KiwiSaver or its equivalent under the EET approach. SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NZ) LIMITED4 > We need consistency of tax outcomes for investors when saving via a structure (superannuation scheme) versus investing directly. This could be achieved through: > Removing the threshold for individuals before the Foreign Investment Fund rules apply > Requiring all tax payers e.g. individuals and companies to apply the same rules to all assets for calculating their income that is the Foreign Investment Fund Fair Dividend Rate method (like PIEs) for offshore equities > Removing the revenue/capital issues i.e. are they a trader for individuals investing in equities. > Consideration needs to be given to the consistency of tax outcomes between the different types of investors. In particular, the tax outcomes for employed individuals, self-employed individuals, charities, children etc. There are inconsistencies such as currently charities are unable to utilise tax credits allocated to them. In the future, they could be compensated for their inability to utilise tax credits such as imputation credits allocated them. > There should be a consistency of tax outcomes across all types of investments such as shares, fixed income and property/real estate. This would mean: > no or very limited exemptions to ensure the fairness criteria is met; > the same or similar treatments of deductions or costs e.g. depreciation is claimable on all business asset types and this includes property used for commercial purposes; > all of these assets are taxed on the same basis such as a realisation basis; and > the same or very similar tax outcomes are reached, no matter the structure or not around the assets. > The impact of the digital economy on saving for retirement including; > more people with less regularity of sources of income e.g. people have 2 or 3 part time jobs that are equivalent of a full time job; > they may not be part of the employer deductions process depending on the types of jobs they have so they will fall into the self-employed person’s category; > it may be appropriate to have some sort of the withholding process that could include a retirement savings contributions for these types of persons. > More self-employed persons need to be encouraged to contribute towards their retirement savings > As they are not regular contributors as given they are removed from the employer deductions process, > The regularity or not of their cash flows can cause lumpy contributions, > Consideration needs to be made on whether targeted incentives or concessions would encourage these persons to save for their retirement. > Introduce an ability for the Government to easily introduce concessions to assist retirement savings for targeted parts of the population e.g. self-employed persons, > To encourage self-employed persons to contribute more regularly, > To assist children and or minors to form savings habits through say applying a lower or zero PIE tax rate to any PIE income they receive. > To fix some of the current issues encountered around structures such as trusts and unit trusts that are not recognised in all parts of the world, consideration needs to be given to introducing a widely held look-through company that could tax shareholders appropriately like the PIE regime. 5 Land Tax > Another option for base-broadening is a property or land tax. > New Zealand had a land tax prior to 1992, but there were considerable exemptions and the tax only affected a small number of taxpayers. > If a land tax were subject to the same constraints as a capital gains tax i.e. excluding the family home, it would not meet the criteria for a comprehensive tax which would encourage avoidance and undermine the intent of the policy. > New Zealand already has a form of land tax levied as rates by local and regional government agencies. SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NZ) LIMITED5 6 Other Non-residents working in New Zealand > Currently there is an onerous on New Zealand taxpayers and employers to deduct and return the appropriate amounts of tax or withholdings when employing or utilising non-resident persons. > Increasingly it appears that labour will continue to be more mobile which results in more compliance obligations, which will be increasing more complex for New Zealand taxpayers to administer. > As a whole Government knows more about non-resident persons than those New Zealand entities paying them. > Consideration should be given to introducing a regime where deductions from income or revenue earned whist in New Zealand is administered in the future by the Government through: > Immigration identifying non-resident person’s entering New Zealand and passing on data to Inland Revenue, > Inland Revenue dealing directly with the non-resident persons on the collection of the appropriate deductions i.e. taxes, PAYE, withholdings, levies etc. from the income or revenue they earn whilst in New Zealand, > As part of the process of collecting the deductions Inland Revenue could direct New Zealand taxpayers to deduct specific taxes from amounts paid on a timely basis, > Before or on leaving New Zealand the non-resident person is required to obtain a digital clearance from Inland Revenue in regards to their tax position including any payment of taxes etc. > Business/taxpayers providing data and information once to Government > Taxpayers are often providing the same of similar data and/or information to different parts of Government including Inland Revenue. > The Government as a whole (departments, regulators, semi or full enterprises) need to understand what information and data they have and share it, as appropriate. > This would result in taxpayers providing data and/or information only once. > For taxpayers this would reduce complexities and costs as the provision and storage of information and data is expensive. COMPLEXITIES AMP Capital is aware that our suggested focus areas and recommendations include some difficulties that would need to be resolved, these are: Transition issues > On changing approaches for retirement savings, consideration needs to be given to > The Period over which transitioned from an TTE to an EET approach > Education of those affected by the changes and in particular what it means to them from a tax perspective by all parties but in particular the appropriate part of Government. In particular, why one approach means no tax liability arises when they make withdrawals whereas the other approach gives rise to a tax liability on withdrawals, > As part introducing changes to the approach introduce a vehicle or structure that is recognised offshore. This would remove comprehensive issues and to allow access to New Zealand managed funds under the Asian passport. > There will be complexities in running two different models i.e. PIE under TTE and the new approach vehicle under EET. > Costs involved including conversion costs incurred in transitioning to a new model, if possible and running both the old and new approaches structures, at the same time. > On introducing new tax regimes such as capital gains tax and land tax, > The valuation of all assets when the regime is introduced including the rules and processes required around this. > The total costs incurred by all, through introducing new tax regimes including for Inland Revenue and all taxpayers. In particular, systems builds and ongoing compliance costs. > Determining exemptions, exclusions, special or specific rules e.g. excluding PIEs from capital gains tax on the investments they manage. > The effect on other current rules e.g. Capital Gains Tax impacts on Foreign Investment Fund rules and PIE exemption on capital gains on NZ and Australian shares. > Potential double taxation in particular under the application of the current Financial Arrangement and Foreign Investment Fund (FDR - Fair Dividend Rate) rules which tax capital amounts and any Capital Gains Tax regime. SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NZ) LIMITED6 Thresholds > The tax impact of changing a threshold level under a progressive tax system, can have a significant economic influence. > There are behaviours that can occur around trying to ensure that a certain threshold level is met or continues to be met under a progressive tax system. Long-term Stability > There needs a stable platform of regulatory and tax rules e.g. infrastructure investments are generally held over 25 or more years, thus tax changes impact the returns which are modelled over the life of the investment and the applicable rules prior to investment being made.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Position Paper on Tax Policy April 2018 Introduction New businesses are one of the most powerful sources of job creation in an economy. 1 High growth start-ups and scale-ups play an even more powerful role in the creation of jobs and socio-economic wellbeing. 2 Angel and early stage investors and the capital they provide are a critical component in the speed and success of venture growth. 2 Governments around the world support the generation high growth start-up companies. When they do so through revenue levers this is about a focus on headline tax rates and tax incentives. When they do so through expenditure, governments provide sponsored venture funds (eg NZ Venture Investment Fund), grants and programmes to support professional development and connections to expertise, customers and capital (eg accelerators and incubators). 3 Given the impact on social and economic wellbeing, Government policy should create the most conducive environment possible for entrepreneurs, start-up companies and their investors and supporters; an environment supporting risk, allowing and encouraging failure, addressing information asymmetry and supporting connectivity and professional development. 4 Angel Association NZ believes it is not about picking the single most powerful intervention but ensuring the creation of a design-led set of policies to cater for the fact every start-up and founder has a different path to success. It’s about acknowledging picking winners is notoriously difficult and that there is a degree of luck and timing inherent in the success of every “Xero”. 5 With respect to incentivising venture investment through tax policy specifically it’s about: • governments not “picking winners” themselves; • addressing investor risk aversion; • designing policies to remove distortions to behaviour and to incentivise quality investments and the quantity of investments to ensure the generation of a big enough portfolio to surface the winners; • ensuring awareness and stability so investors know about and can rely on policies being consistently in place; and • monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of incentives to ensure the requisite impact and learning. 6 While there is a lack of definitive evidence of a causal relationship between tax incentives and better venture and angel investment outcomes, a 2017 EU Commission report concluded there is compelling enough anecdotal evidence from tax experts and surveys of investors to be able to say tax incentives do have a significant impact on investment decisions. 3 7 This brief position paper provides an early stage investment perspective on relevant tax policies already in place in New Zealand, touches on policies we would like to see adopted and makes some observations on the lack of a capital gains tax. 1 http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/the-economic-impact-of-high-growth-startups 2 http://www.scaleupinstitute.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ScaleUpInstitute\_SME\_Finance\_Monitor\_2017\_MID\_RES.pdf 3 https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/sites/taxation/files/final\_report\_2017\_taxud\_venture-capital\_business-angels.pdf 2 Tax policies in place 8 Research and development tax loss credits –AANZ provided comments on the R&D tax loss credit regime which allows business losses from eligible expenditure to be cashed out instead of being carried forward at the time of its drafting. 4 Our submission made the following key points about its deficiencies: • Encouraging the commercialisation of innovation through support for R&D is only one small component of commercialisation. The key component is finding markets for the outcomes of the R&D; • The regime has a minimal impact on cash flow constraints because R&D expenditure is incurred before the tax losses can be cashed out and most start-ups do not have the cash to spend on the R&D in the first place; • Some start-ups are not building products and services which fall within the legislation’s NZ IAS 38 definition of R&D and in other instances advisors struggle to apply the R&D definitions in the innovation context; • The wage intensity test dis-incentivises market development and capital-intensive R&D; • The screening process for claimants is overly complex given the maximum cash benefit is low and the funding is a loan not a grant. 9 That said, the tax loss credits can work well for start-up companies with experienced advisors. The cash received from the IRD is non-dilutive and without the conditions attached to equity funding. The IRD is also to be commended for paying out tax loss credits within 4-10 weeks of returns being filed. The credit is of course “a loan” and given the high failure rate of start-ups the ‘credit risk’ is with IRD; just as it is with angels and early stage investors when they provide equity funding. It will typically take a start-up company 5-10 years to generate a liquidity event at which point the repayment to IRD can be factored into the price. 10 Taxation of employee share schemes – In 2015 the IRD embarked on work to reform the tax treatment of employee share schemes as the existing legislation is 50 years old, complex and out of date. 5 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced to Parliament in April 2017. It had its first reading in mid-2017 and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and passed into legislation at the end of March 2018. 11 Inland Revenue policy work on a deferral regime for tax on employee share schemes for start-up companies is ongoing. AANZ met with IRD a number of times during the course of the review and provided several submissions. 6 The key points made include: • Tax treatment of start-ups, particularly high growth start-ups, merits differential attention; • The use of employee share schemes in high growth start-ups is far less about remuneration than it is about creating alignment to drive up the value of the venture. The irrelevance of remuneration being the driver for the ESOP in a start-up is reflected in the illiquid nature of start-up equity and the prospect that the equity will be worthless as a high proportion of start- ups fail; • ESOP regimes put in place very soon after a start-up’s inception deserve to have any resultant (and rare) upside treated in the same way as the founder’s equity as these early employees are more akin to investors, ie., the upside should be treated as held on capital account and not as taxable income; • With reference to constant cash flow concerns in a start-up, any taxation event should only occur on exercise when the economic gain or loss is real; • We support simplifying and clarifying the rules so there is less creative interpretation and uncertainty; • We recognise defining a start-up is challenging in a tax policy context to ensure the right incentives for value creation and economic outcomes, but it is not impossible. • Some countries have specific exemptions and lower tax rates for ESOPs issued by start-ups (eg Canada, Australia, UK) but these countries also have capital gains regimes. See our comment below on the tax treatment of capital gains in a start-up investment context. What we would like 12 The AANZ recognises the importance and rationale for a “broad base, low rate” tax system and supports the IRD’s focus on removing distortions to behaviour so that economically rational decisions can be 4 https://www.angelassociation.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KPMG-Angel-Association-of-NZ-RD-submission.pdf 5 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-ris-areiirm-bill/employee-share-schemes 6 https://www.angelassociation.co.nz/resources/reports/ 3 made. We are very grateful for the constructive and collaborative working relationship we have with IRD officials. All those we have engaged with have worked to genuinely understand the unique set of circumstances and environment in which early stage, high growth company investors and founders work, and to understand the risks and challenges they face. While we appreciate the reticence and wariness surrounding the introduction of tax incentives we would like to set out some thinking on why some inroads might be made for high-growth start-ups. 13 Incentives for investors – The rationale for incentivising venture capital and angel investment is that it offsets the extremely risky nature of these investments and at the same time supports the positive outcomes resulting from increasing the pipeline of deals and thereby improving the odds of success. This source of capital, in a venture’s early stages of growth brings much needed expertise, experience and connections. So there are three points at which tax policy can incentivise investment in high growth start-ups. On the: • initial investment; • receipt of investment income – although investment income (dividends etc) is uncommon in start-ups; • disposal of the investment – this might be negative (when the start-up fails) or positive (typically when a trade sale or IPO occurs). 14 As the EU study referenced above points out, the literature on the relative merits of tax incentives at each of these stages is sparse. 15 Tax incentives or tax relief granted on initial investment has two key policy design implications: • It addresses investor risk aversion by in effect subsidising the cost of the investment, which increases the amount the value of the investment would have to fall by before a loss is made; • It rewards new capital, rather than creating windfall gains for existing investors. 16 Granting tax relief on initial investment is less likely to generate alignment of interests between the investor and investee. In the absence of tax relief on disposal of the investment investors are less incentivised to support the development and growth of the investee firm. This reduces the economic benefits the incentive should deliver, such as growth, job creation and productive innovation with the consequent spill-over effects to the wider economy. 17 The provision of loss relief on disposal compensates the investor for the excessive downside risk associated with investing in start-ups. Loss relief also incentivises ‘fast failure’ and thereby liberates capital and capability for those ventures which are performing. This is about shifting the incentive from the business to the investor where the insight and value/risk trade-off is more credible and powerful. 18 There is then the issue of qualifying criteria for the tax relief. This can be done via the: • Business: the recipient of investment can be targeted in terms of age, size and sector; • Investor: the investor can be targeted in terms of wealth or connection with the recipient of investment (eg use of Financial Markets Conduct Act exemptions); • Investment: the investment can be targeted in terms of size, investment through venture capital funds or angel network (eg use of NZVIF accredited partners); and • Duration: the minimum length of time qualifying investments must be held in order to attract tax relief. 19 In assessing tax incentive regimes in 36 countries against clarity of scope, qualifying criteria and administrative ease the 2017 EU Commission study found the United Kingdom’s Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) was the best. Evidence collected in assessments of the EIS found the scheme had a positive impact on a range of measures including labour productivity in investee companies. 7 The effect was greatest for smaller companies regardless of age. 20 Same business test for carrying tax losses forward - Tax losses incurred by a company have value to the extent they are able to be carried forward and offset against future income. Forfeiting these losses has a cost to the company. Innovative companies, early-stage companies and rapidly growing companies are more likely than other companies to incur tax losses at certain stages in their life. 21 Current New Zealand law requires a minimum 49% continuity of ownership for a company to carry forward tax losses. Changes of ownership, including as a result of capital injections by new investors to fund growth and development can result in forfeiture of tax losses. Other countries supplement their continuity of ownership test with a "same business" test which allows a company to carry forward tax losses despite changes of ownership, provided the company carries on the same type of business. 7 http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/16270/1/from\_funding\_gaps\_to\_thin\_markets.pdf 4 22 The absence of a same business test in New Zealand results in punitive tax outcomes, distorts decision- making and disincentivises innovation, growth and risk-taking. Introducing a same business test would remove a barrier to growth and innovation in New Zealand, bring New Zealand law into line with international norms and most likely be fiscally positive. 23 AANZ is working with Business New Zealand, NZVCA, the Corporate Tax Payers Group and Bell Gully to lobby Government to amend the legislation to bring New Zealand into line with current international practice and recently met with new Revenue Minister, Stuart Nash. He was receptive to the points made and the next step is to bring other relevant Ministers up to speed. 24 Simple R&D tax credit regime – While not specifically targeted at angel investors, an R&D tax credit regime would be beneficial to high growth start-ups. Given the pressure on start-up resources (both labour and capital) any new regime needs to be clear in its scope, simple to access, simple to apply for and simple to receive. 25 A 2014 EU Commission study examined over 80 schemes in 31 countries. 8 The majority of tax incentives apply to corporate income taxes. In some countries, the benefit is also set against social contributions and/or wage taxes. R&D tax credits are the most popular type of R&D tax incentive, followed by enhanced allowances for expenditure on R&D and accelerated depreciation. R&D tax incentives applied to the total R&D expenditure (known as volume-based schemes) are more common than tax benefits only applied to the increment of R&D expenditure (incremental schemes). 26 Many jurisdictions target the scale of any tax credit to the size of the company. The AANZ also supports targeting to offer more generous tax advantages to high growth start-ups. This limits the cost to government and sends a clear signal about the value of such ventures. We would like to see a straight forward, online application procedure and a one-stop agency for approval of R&D tax credits. Capital gains tax 27 Given the risk profile of high growth start-ups, investment in the equity of these companies generally makes up a very small component (5-10%) of any individual angel’s investment portfolio or net wealth. With a portfolio of 20 ventures, 30% of angels will experience a negative internal rate of return. To put it another way, 90% of the returns from an angel venture portfolio come from just 10% of the ventures. 28 A common criticism of the lack of a capital gains tax in New Zealand is that it distorts and diminishes the income tax base. The current statutory definition of income bears little relation to actual or comprehensive income. So for example there is no attempt in the Income Tax Act 2007 to measure the change in an individual’s net wealth or level of consumption over the taxable period. Instead the Act taxes income by reference to the concept of “ordinary income”. It defines specific forms of ordinary income, which may be either revenue or capital in nature. 9 Very broadly, income from revenue is taxed, income from capital is not. 29 While there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand there is a distinct lack of clarity for angel investors regarding the tax treatment of their investment in high growth start-ups. Individuals who are angel investors in the true sense of the definition, are not “in the business” or generating income from angel investment given the illiquidity of start-up shares, the high failure rate of these ventures and the small component these investments form of their net wealth. Early stage venture capital fund managers, despite the fact they are in the same boat as individual angels when it comes to the paucity of returns on a deal by deal basis, for the sake of certainty tend to operate on revenue account. 30 To clarify the concept of ordinary income, the Income Act contains extensive definitions of most types of income falling within the concept of ordinary income (i.e. on revenue account). An obvious example is income derived from employment (e.g. salary and wages), which is clearly revenue and taxable as ordinary income. A less obvious example is share gains. Whether or not realised share gains are taxable depends on whether the seller of the share held that share on capital or revenue account. This lack of clarity impacts on the extensive range and confusion around the taxation of employee share ownership schemes, particularly in high growth start- ups. 31 Determining whether shares are held on revenue or capital account turns on whether the dominant purpose of acquisition was for resale. Angel investors freely acknowledge that to be sustainable, angel investment has to generate returns. But they are also motivated by a wider purpose; to grow their local economy, to ‘give back’ and to be involved with cutting edge technology and business development. 8 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/28-taxud-study\_on\_rnd\_tax\_incentives\_-\_2014.pdf 9 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-taxation-of-capital-gains-ird\_treasury.pdf 5 32 A well -designed capital gains tax policy, which includes property, together with a carefully defined and described high growth start-up ecosystem and its ventures, would see resources channelled more efficiently and purposefully to support the success of these high risk, but high impact ventures. A capital gains tax, and a corresponding offset for capital losses, would allow early stage investors some respite from the inevitable failure of early stage investments. Conclusion 33 Generating returns from inspirational high-growth, start-up companies is critical for New Zealand. These companies are our future economic powerhouses. But investing in them is an extremely high-risk endeavour and is not for the faint hearted. On a deal-by-deal basis, an investor in a high growth start-up is more likely to lose their money than not. 34 Raising enough high growth start-ups to generate a unicorn worth a billion dollars and generating thousands of jobs takes a whole country. Given the risk/return profile there is therefore a compelling rationale for differential treatment and support for early stage investors – be they individuals or early stage venture funds. 35 Angel Association New Zealand and our members want to generate an impact that goes beyond the financial return on investment to see a thriving New Zealand and New Zealanders making the world a better place . We are therefore very willing to dedicate time and resources to assist with any work to advance the thinking for a tax framework supporting these outcomes. Suse Reynolds AANZ Executive Director \[1\] 6 Appendix Explanation of early stage investment in New Zealand As a formally recognized endeavor in New Zealand, early stage or start-up investment in high-growth ventures is about a decade old. The catchall term is “angel investment”. Strictly speaking, an angel is an individual who invests his or her own money but the term ‘angel investment’ is also used to refer to more broadly supported early stage funds. The Angel Association New Zealand (AANZ) was incorporated in 2008 to promote the growth of angel investment. Today there are 12 angel clubs or networks and half a dozen early stage or angel funds in New Zealand. The oldest and most established clubs are based in Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Nelson. Half a dozen new clubs have been established in recent years and two more are in formation. About 650 angels belong to the AANZ member networks. AANZ’s members also include investor-led tech incubators and two of the most prominent equity crowdfunding platforms in New Zealand, Snowball Effect and Equitise. The New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF) established the Seed Co-Investment Fund (SCIF) in 2006 to catalyse a formal early stage investment sector. This $50m fund was set up to co-invest alongside accredited clubs and funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis as a passive investor, up to a maximum of $750,000 in any one deal. To date the fund has backed over 150 ventures and, together with its co-investment partners, invested over $500m. The median age of a SCIF portfolio company is just 3 years old and to date only 21 companies have had a positive exit generating an IRR of just over 9%. More active management and a more flexible mandate for management of this largely nascent portfolio is planned to lift this result. Annual investment in high growth start-ups has exceeded $50m for the last four years and grown by an average in excess of $5m per annum to reach $86m in 2017. Only a quarter of this capital is being invested in new deals with the bulk being directed to follow on funding for existing ventures. This is a sign of a maturing market as investors double down on their higher performing portfolio companies. New Zealand angels have a preference for software (40%) and life sciences (15%) companies. A typical New Zealand angel invests between $5,000-30,000 per deal; 20% of our community are leading deals and sitting on angel-backed company boards; the average portfolio size is 13 companies and angels typically commit 29 days a year to mentoring and supporting the ventures they have backed. Angel investors must be accredited investors as defined by the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2014. In terms of deal size and company valuations, on average a New Zealand angel round is circa $700,000 and angels are backing companies valued at around $1.2m. About a fifth of our companies have received offshore investment. A portfolio approach to angel investment is vital. The right sized portfolio, managed by focused skilled people, together with the right timing will deliver an IRR of 20-40% or 10-30x their money back to an angel investor. Not to be lightly dismissed, angels are also motivated by the belief their investment generates social and economic returns; the belief they are building and inspiring their community’s future wealth generators and jobs. The aim is to create value as quickly as possible and set these ventures on a path making them irresistible to potential acquirers or public equity markets. The value is in the demonstration and proof of product/market fit. A deep understanding of capital strategy is required as it impacts directly on the ability to scale value quickly and generate the necessary returns. A high growth capital strategy is typically agile and deploys capital super efficiently. 7 Bibliography of URLs referenced https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/28-taxud-study\_on\_rnd\_tax\_incentives\_-\_2014.pdf R&D tax incentives paper – comprehensive explanation of the rationale, role and application of R&D tax credits http://www.ird.govt.nz/research-development/overview/what-is-rdltc/ https://www2.deloitte.com/nz/en/pages/tax-alerts/articles/r-d-tax-credits-reflections-from-nz-and-australia.html NZ scheme explained for R&D loss tax credit... from the IRD and Deloitte https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/tax/pdf/pwc-global-r-and-d-brochure-april-2017.pdf a really useful summary of all the tax regimes used around the world to incentivise R&D https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2017/08/emea-rd-incentives-guide-web-08012017.pdf same thing but from KPMG http://www.ey.com/nz/en/services/tax/ey-tax-watch-november-2017-research-and-development-tax-credit-to-be- reinstated EY explain the difference between the tax loss credit and Labour’s plans https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/sites/taxation/files/final\_report\_2017\_taxud\_venture-capital\_business- angels.pdf A really terrific explanation of a range of tax incentives (including EU and a number of OECD countries) and includes a series of tables comparing jurisdictions https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Tax-incentives-for-innovation/In-detail/Tax-incentives-for-early-stage- investors/#Calculatingtheearlystageinvestortaxoffse a good explanation of the Auzzie tax incentives for angel investments... essentially 20% credit up to a maximum rebate of $AU200,000 http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/16270/1/from\_funding\_gaps\_to\_thin\_markets.pdf the most often quoted 2009 study of the impact of the UK’s EIS and SEIS tax relief schemes for investment into start-ups https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-taxation-of-capital-gains- ird\_treasury.pdf a neat summary of the issues and implications of a capital gains tax for NZ which also explores different CGT regimes

The Tax Working Group – Submission Arthritis New Zealand is a not for profit organisation that has represented the interests of New Zealanders with arthritis for more than 50 years. Our Mission is to improve the life of every person affected by arthritis. We welcome the opportunity to provide a submission to this taxation review. Arthritis New Zealand supports a tax system that is equitable and fair. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to long-term? Decisions made on taxes now and in the future should take account that not everyone is able to undertake full time work. For many people with arthritis this is simply not possible – many people can only work part time. Arthritis is a painful, long term condition which has a substantial impact on quality of life. Severe pain can have a debilitating impact on someone’s ability to work. The Fit for Work? Musculoskeletal Disorders and the New Zealand Labour Market highlighted that having a significant proportion of the working age population either temporarily or permanently unable to work due to chronic disease – even in a favourable economic climate – can reduce the aggregate level of labour productivity in an economy and damage the competitiveness and effectiveness of private and public sector employing organisations. People with musculoskeletal conditions are less likely to be employed than people in good health, and more likely to retire early. The impact of people leaving the workforce early is significant in terms of:  Taxation foregone by government  Additional social security payments  Decrease in personal incomes – often meaning people living many years in poverty  Associated impacts on savings and lifetime living standards Lost productivity is the largest cost of Arthritis. 1 There were 25,000 New Zealanders who did not work in 2010 due to arthritis, costing around $1.48 billion in lost productivity. 2 The potential tax revenue forgone in 2010, due to people with arthritis working less or leaving the workforce, was $330.3 million. 3 Of this $253.7 million (76.8%) is forgone personal income tax and the remaining $76.6 million (23.2%) is forgone indirect tax. We hope the working group will examine options for improving health outcomes through the tax system. 1 https://www.arthritis.org.nz/pdfs/fitforwork.pdf 2 https://www.arthritis.org.nz/pdfs/economic-cost-of-arthritis-in-new-zealand-final-print.pdf 3 https://www.arthritis.org.nz/pdfs/economic-cost-of-arthritis-in-new-zealand-final-print.pdf The Future Arthritis currently affects over 647,000 New Zealanders and is a leading cause of disability in New Zealand. The number of people with arthritis is growing - by 2050 the number of New Zealanders with arthritis will rise to around 780,000. 4 Half of people affected by arthritis are of working age. Due to living longer, reduced physical activity, increasing obesity and lack of access to timely health care, the burden of arthritis is increasing. New Zealand has the third highest adult obesity rate in the OECD, and our rates are rising; now affecting 31.6% of adults. 5 Obesity significantly increases a person’s risk of developing arthritis. The Health Loss in New Zealand 1990-2013 report highlights the burden faced not only by people with arthritis. For all forms of arthritis managing weight is key to better outcomes, and risk of developing many forms of arthritis increases with excess weight. There are significant costs associated with arthritis. They will only rise as the population ages and more people are diagnosed with arthritis. Health spending of $1,310 per person per year with arthritis was identified by Access Economics in 2010. Full costs can be seen in Access Economics: The economic cost of arthritis in New Zealand in 2010. Equity There are significant costs associated with treatments, medications and the management of a long term condition. The tax system must be equitable for all those in it. Individuals are the bearers of the largest costs associated with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. 6 The Disability Resource Centre in 2010 estimated the weekly costs of a physical disability, between $639 for a moderate disability, ranging to $2284 for high needs. 7 The Benefits System We note the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system is out of scope as part of this review. The rules and processes for combining benefits and earnings, which are both of course subject to tax, must be revised so that they work effectively and sustainably for those affected and support people as they re-enter the paid workforce. The amount which can be earned before benefits are severely reduced or stopped completely must also be raised substantially. We have many members that have shared their experiences, many of who tell us their benefit fails to cover the cost of living. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? The burden should not fall on those at the lower end of the scale and the impact on people as a whole system approach should be considered. We also recommend that the possibility of money raised through tax levies (for example a tax on sugary drinks) be ring-fenced or earmarked to be reinvested into improving health outcomes to lessen the burden imposed by long term conditions, such as arthritis, ideally through preventative action. 4 https://www.arthritis.org.nz/pdfs/economic-cost-of-arthritis-in-new-zealand-final-print.pdf 5 https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/annual-update-key-results-2016-17-new-zealand-health-survey 6 https://www.arthritis.org.nz/pdfs/fitforwork.pdf 7 http://carers.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2010Cost-of-Disability-Report.doc

SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP This submission focuses on tobacco taxation From ASPIRE 2025, ASH New Zealand, Hāpai te Hauora and the Cancer Society of New Zealand April 2018, Wellington, New Zealand Tobacco is a unique product for taxation purposes. It is highly addictive, thus although most smokers want to quit smoking, they have substantial difficulty doing so. Reducing tobacco affordability through taxation is one of the most proven and effective uses of fiscal policy for health purposes. Taxation should be an important component of a comprehensive strategy to achieve New Zealand’s Smokefree 2025 goal. Tobacco taxation reduces smoking uptake, prompts quitting, and hence reduces smoking prevalence. The tobacco industry fears fully effective taxation policies.\[1 2\] While there has been an policy of 10% annual tobacco tax increases since 2010, tobacco industry activity erodes the effectiveness of the policy. This review is an opportunity for advice to government on a fairer approach. We suggest, as a foundation policy principle for tobacco taxation policy, that it should be explicitly driven by health needs, with the goal of the policy being to maximise positive health impacts rather than raising revenue.\[3\] Many smokers support tobacco tax increases, particularly if the additional income is used to help create a supportive context for quitting. At a population level, tobacco taxation provides much larger health gains for Māori compared to non-Māori. These benefits would be even greater if some tobacco tax revenue was dedicated to supporting quitting (for example, by funding high impact media campaigns). Currently, the tobacco industry manipulates prices and brands to reduce the impact of tobacco tax rises in New Zealand whilst maximising their profits; for example, by minimising the impact of tobacco excise tax increases on budget brands and raising prices for premium brands by more than the tobacco tax-related increases. Since 2014 there has been a rapid increase in the the market share of the cheapest ‘budget’ cigarette brands. A maximum price before tax and a government mandated retail price would: (i) prevent tobacco marketing based on prices; (ii) enable government to better address externalities imposed on society by the tobacco industry; and (iii) enable government to limit industry profits. There is also evidence that loose tobacco provides a lower priced means to continue smoking, with many smokers (particularly Māori and young people) rolling thinner roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes to minimise cost. A further differential tax increase for RYO tobacco (the last such increase was in 2010) would help remove this price incentive. We recommend Government mandated tobacco retail prices: The use of mandated retail prices and maximum prices before tax provide options for Government to reduce smoking prevalence, remove price marketing and increase revenue.\[4-7\] Dedicated tax: Until 2025, the dedication of at least $100m (currently about 5%) of tobacco tax revenue annually to creating a stronger environment that minimises smoking uptake and better supports smokers to quit. Tobacco tax rises: Continuing to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence, as long as a proportion of tobacco tax revenue is dedicated for tobacco control, and smokefree policy changes make it easier for smokers to quit. Differential increase in loose tobacco tax: Ensure that RYO cigarettes are not a cheaper alternative to factory made cigarettes and do not encourage smokers to switch between products as an alternative to quitting. This can be done by implementing a differentially greater increase in loose tobacco (RYO) taxation, monitoring the impact and repeating as necessary. SUMMARY 1 1 2 3 4 Tobacco is a unique product for taxation purposes. \[8\] ‘The fundamental social issue with tobacco is the product itself’\[9\] which has a need for a high degree of regulatory and policy measures.\[10\] It is highly addictive, thus although most smokers want to quit smoking,\[11-15\] they have substantial difficulty doing so.\[16\] In New Zealand, tobacco use will continue to require considerable policy attention, due to the extent of harm from tobacco use and the resulting health inequalities.\[17 18\] Since 2010 there has been an policy of 10% annual tobacco tax increases. However, tobacco industry activity erodes the effectiveness of the policy,\[19-22\] and the Tax Working Group review is an opportunity for advice to government on a fairer approach. BACKGROUND Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness Tobacco tax increases are one of the most extensively researched public health interventions. There is overwhelming evidence that price and price increases reduce smoking prevalence and uptake, especially among young people, those who have less education, and those experiencing greater deprivation.\[23\] \[24\] p.150 This intervention will improve population health and reduce health inequalities. For example, in Europe, recent research indicates that higher tobacco prices are associated with reduced infant mortality.\[25\] The tobacco industry has always been concerned that in the long term tobacco taxation will reduce its markets. \[1 2\] A recent review of industry strategies in relation to tax found ‘tobacco tax increases are the most effective and inexpensive way of reducing tobacco smoking prevalence, consumption, initiation and inequalities in smoking.’\[19\] Recent New Zealand research found that historically ‘increasing price was strongly associated with reducing regular smoking prevalence in NZ adolescents, which remained significant even when adjusting for demographic factors and established individual predictors.’\[26\] New Zealand modelling research has found increased tobacco prices produce further health gains, reduce health inequalities and generate health system cost-savings.\[27 28\] Research in Auckland ‘socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods ... with large proportions of Māori and Pacific Island people’ indicated that tax-driven price increases increased quit attempts.\[22\] Tobacco taxation in NZ has been one of the most cost-effective health interventions, with major health gain and cost savings within and outside the health sector.\[27\] Tobacco taxation also may have a role in encouraging some smokers who are unable to quit using inhaled nicotine to switch to e-cigarettes. These are likely to be less dangerous than tobacco smoking, although not without dangers.\[29-31\] A complete switch to e-cigarettes could create enable smokers to avoid the adverse financial impacts of tax increases as well as to reduce some of their health risks. Government tax policy could help create an incentive to switch and hence further reduce tobacco smoking prevalence. 2 Taxation as part of the wider policy scene Despite clear evidence of tobacco taxation’s effectiveness, tobacco taxation alone is not sufficient to meet the Government’s 2025 tobacco prevalence goal of 5%. See Figure 1: Figure 1: Projected daily smoking prevalence trends for NZ men\[32\]\* \* Assuming current tobacco policies and prevalence trends 3 Tobacco taxation therefore needs to be seen as part of a comprehensive set of tobacco control policies across many sectors. A synergistic approach is required to get the maximum positive effect from tobacco tax increases. \[33\]p.16 Furthermore, there is an ethical imperative to combine taxation with other policies that promote quitting, to avoid increasing the adverse impacts on smokers who do not give up smoking after tobacco tax increases.\[34\] Such policies include improved mass media campaigns,\[35-38\] enriched Quitline services integrated with policy changes,\[39 40\] policy and other work on tobacco product additive restrictions or reductions in nicotine content,\[41-43\] and enhanced policies (eg, outdoor smokefree environments) that assist smokers to quit. Smoking is not an individual informed choice Tobacco as a widely available product is unique because of the severity of nicotine addiction, the extent of harm from smoking and the lack of informed choice asserted by new users. The fact that new users cannot realistically understand addiction, ahead of becoming addicted, creates a strong ethical justification for implementing measures like tobacco price increases. This is because such increases have been shown to reduce smoking uptake. The severe nature of nicotine addiction means smoking is not a choice and many smokers find quitting difficult. \[16 44\] Rather than having net enjoyment from smoking, nearly all smokers in countries such as New Zealand are discontented because of their addiction and its costs. The vast majority want to quit smoking and regret having started.\[11-13\] Quitting provides smokers with major net welfare gains.\[11\] Smoking uptake since the 1950s is a result of government failures, including insufficient regulation, and insufficiently effectively communicated information about nicotine addiction and the harms caused by tobacco use.\[14 15\] Many users start as children or youth, before they are at an age when they can make a more informed choice. Almost all other smokers start as young adults,\[45\] when true informed choice is very rare because few understand the addictive nature of smoking or fully comprehend or apply to themselves the consequences of starting smoking.\[46 47\] The ethical concerns The current arrangements for tobacco taxation raise many problematic ethical issues. Currently Government applies specific taxes to an addictive and extremely harmful product, which most users started without making a true informed choice. The tax revenue raised is used for general purposes and is not specifically allocated to help smokers to quit or reduce the numbers starting to smoke. Current tax policy does not prevent price marketing of tobacco. In short, tobacco tax policy in New Zealand appears primarily designed to gather revenue, rather than to help smokers quit,\[3\] (even though in the last decade the political rhetoric has particularly focused on health benefits). For those smokers unable to quit, or sufficiently cut down, tobacco tax increases can have adverse financial effects, including increased household poverty. New Zealand qualitative research has indicated that many of those unable to quit ‘felt victimised by a punitive policy system that coerced change without supporting it.’\[48\] Other New Zealand research has found that tobacco spending can have a major effect on households with children. Enabling low income households with smokers and children to be smoker-free would significantly increase the welfare of those households.\[49\] The need for increased justice in the use of tobacco tax revenue is shown by New Zealand smoker’s support for tobacco tax increases if the revenue is used to help smokers quit.\[50 51\] Ethical solutions Government can reduce the ethical tensions by reducing the risk of new smokers starting, creating an environment that supports smokers to quit, and by providing more comprehensive social support for poor households.\[34 49\] Government has a duty of reciprocity to smokers, to use sufficient resources to ensure that they and their children will be tobacco-free. \[52\] A dedicated tobacco tax is discussed below. We suggest that the two commonly used arguments for tobacco taxation increases are not ethically defensible, i.e., • That smokers should pay to cover the negative externalities of tobacco use, such as greater health care costs and harm to others from secondhand smoke. We argue that the tobacco industry is responsible for the externalities,\[53 54\] and that the government failures in tobacco policy erode arguments for smoker responsibility.\[55 56\] • To use tobacco to raise general revenue. Instead, there are two ethically defensible rationales for tobacco taxation: A. To reduce smoking prevalence (increasing quitting and reducing smoking uptake) and hence reduce avoidable ill-health and premature deaths arising from use of a highly addictive and hazardous substance; B. To transfer revenue from the tobacco industry to public funds, so as to provide revenue that can be used to help reduce smoking prevalence. A system of government mandated retail price and maximum price before tax could implement this approach (see recommendations). 4 The need for a dedicated tobacco tax in New Zealand Using tobacco tax revenue to reduce the problem of tobacco use would ease the ethical concerns of tobacco taxation,\[34\] increase support for tobacco taxes amongst New Zealand smokers, \[50 51\] and help reduce the chronic underfunding of the most cost-effective New Zealand Government tobacco control activity.\[57 58\] In 2016-17 ‘over 90% \[of both Māori and non-Māori smokers surveyed\] agreed that Government should use the tax from tobacco to fund programmes that help smokers to quit or reduce young people starting to smoke’.\[50\] The Ministry of Health calculated about $62 million (m) was spent on tobacco control in 2014-15, compared to $1.5 billion (b) in tobacco tax revenue,\[59\] ($1.8b in 2016).\[60\] However, much of this spending was on relatively cost-ineffective individual treatment (including pharmaceuticals at $15m) and less than $4m was spent on highly cost-effective mass media campaigns.\[38 59 61 62\] The recent major US National Cancer Institute (NCI) review of tobacco economics found that: ‘Dedicating part of tobacco tax revenues for comprehensive tobacco control or health promotion programs (i.e., earmarking) increases the public health impact of higher tobacco taxes.’ \[24\]p.189 Dedicated taxes would help: 1. Ensure continuity of funding for tobacco control (the success of Californian dedicated tax indicates this) \[63\] Other examples of successful dedicated tobacco taxes include in Guam,\[64\] and elsewhere.\[65 66\] 2. Provide visible and tangible evidence of government commitment to reduction of social harm 3. Identify clearly, for those who pay tobacco tax, their eligibility for services in return, ie support in improving their health 4. Provide reassurance that the purpose of tobacco tax is primarily for health improvement and achieving a smokefree society 5. Signal, in symbolic but important ways, recognition of the reciprocal duties and relationships inherent in any tax system between state and citizens. Tobacco taxes and equity A 2014 review found ‘strong evidence that increases in tobacco price have a pro-equity effect on socioeconomic disparities in smoking’.\[67\] New Zealand research estimates that taxation increases provide more than four times the health gain for Māori compared to non-Māori (because of the greater % of Māori who are smokers), and such increases are therefore a major way to reduce health inequalities.\[27\] Despite this evidence of strong potential pro-equity impacts, research is needed to assess whether the current excise tax schedule continues to deliver pro-equity outcomes. It is difficult to separate out the effects of tobacco tax rises from other policies that affect smoking and equity. However, over a period when regular above inflation tobacco tax increases occurred, smoking prevalence among the most deprived New Zealand quintile decreased from 30.4% to 26.6% during 2012/13 to 2016/17 (an absolute drop of 3.8%) compared to a drop from 10.8% to 8.2% (an absolute drop of 2.6%) for the least deprived quintile. As a result the absolute difference in prevalence decreased from 19.6% to 18.4%, but the relative difference increased from 2.8 to 3.2.\[68 69\]. The continuing high prevalence among disadvantaged smokers suggest that continued tobacco tax increases, combined with a comprehensive range of additional measures that impact particularly on more deprived smokers, are needed if the Smokefree 2025 goal is to be achieved among this group. 5 Net community benefit Does tobacco tax harm smokers and their families? Across communities, tobacco tax provides more benefit in improved health and longer life when compared to the adverse health effects of financial loss. While some continuing smokers may pay more for tobacco, at a population level a New Zealand analysis found: ‘The estimated harm to life expectancy from tobacco taxation (via financial hardship) is orders of magnitude smaller than the harm from smoking.... Policy makers should be reassured that tobacco taxation is likely to be achieving far more benefit than harm in the general population and in socioeconomically deprived populations.’\[70\] There are real potential adverse financial impacts for continuing smokers, and hence the need for supportive environments that support smokers to quit. However, there are sustained financial benefits among people who quit and among young people who never start. If e-cigarettes are widely available and less expensive than tobacco, these could offer a realistic substitute for some smokers who cannot quit. A complete switch to e-cigarettes (rather than co-use with tobacco) could create enable smokers to avoid the adverse financial impacts of tax increases as well as to reduce some of their health risks.\[29-31\] The costs of tobacco use for individuals, communities and economies The major US NCI report on tobacco economics found that the ‘economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs ... and the lost productivity that results from tobacco- attributable morbidity and mortality.’ ... ‘Tobacco use in poor households exacerbates poverty by increasing health care costs, reducing incomes, and decreasing productivity, as well as diverting limited family resources from basic needs.’ The costs include: ‘illness, disability, premature death, and forgone consumption and investment. ...Substantial economic resources are lost to other uses because of tobacco-related illnesses, premature disability, and death. ... Evidence from household expenditure surveys ... shows that tobacco use displaces household expenditures on education and medical care, which are important investments to improve economic well-being. ... In high-income countries, lifetime health care costs are greater for smokers than for nonsmokers, even after accounting for the shorter lives of smokers.’\[24\] Industry efforts to reduce the effect of NZ tobacco tax rises Tobacco tax increases do not necessarily translate into effective tobacco price changes, as the industry uses differential price increases for budget and premium brands in response to tobacco tax increases They use price as part of the marketing of their products. In 2016, the retail price of 20 cigarettes ranged from $18.90 to $29.90.\[60\] The tobacco industry (including in New Zealand) uses a variety of manipulative tactics to reduce the impact of tobacco tax increases, including smoothing the retail price changes and minimising price increases for budget brands. This increases the use of budget brands, as smokers switche to save costs and reduce the impacts of tax increases.\[19-22\] During 2014-2017, the market share of the new ‘ultra-budget’ brands Club, Choice and West increased from 4% to 24%.\[71 72\] Currently in New Zealand, the retail price of particular tobacco products depends on tobacco industry decisions. RYO tobacco provides another means for smokers to continue to get nicotine for a lower cost than when using factory made (FM) cigarettes. RYO cigarettes can be made with less than half the weight of the tobacco in a FM cigarette. The reported use of RYO tobacco in New Zealand increased during 2007/8 to 2016/17, with 61% of smokers using either RYO exclusively or both RYO and FM, an increase from 52% in 2007/08.\[73\] RYO use is disproportionately concentrated among Māori, lower income and young smokers.\[22 74-76\] Research indicates that RYO use has positive attributes for young New Zealand smokers, apart from price advantages.\[77\] 6 Such marketing by price can be addressed by a fixed or minimum retail price per cigarette or tobacco weight. \[6 7\] A periodically fixed or mandated retail price has an advantage over a minimum price because it removes any ability to market by price. A mandated retail price and a differential increase in RYO tobacco could prevent the industry minimising the impact of tobacco tax increases on smoking prevalence. Combined with a maximum tobacco price before tax, the intervention could help Government deal with the negative externalities that the tobacco industry imposes on Government, society and the environment. By reducing the maximum price before tax, in conjunction with an mandated retail price, Government could increase the tax revenue available to address these negative externalities. This regulated price system would also enable government to limit industry profits.\[6 7\] Risks from tobacco price increases While the tobacco industry and its allies have suggested a substantial illegal tobacco market with increased tobacco prices, existing peer reviewed research in New Zealand suggests that this illegal market is very small,\[78\] and is likely to remain so even with higher prices, because of the difficulties in smuggling or illegal production.\[79\] There is currently considerable media coverage of robberies of dairies and convenience stores, where tobacco and cigarettes are among the items stolen. These crimes have prompted calls to end tobacco tax increases. We lack robust data on both the trends in these robberies and the degree to which these can be attributed to tobacco taxation. However, there is at least a strong perception that these thefts have become more problematic because of tobacco tax increases. Currently, tobacco retailing is an unregistered or licensed activity, with no requirements on the secure storage of products, reporting and recording of thefts, or staff training. The widespread sale of an addictive, dangerous product with few regulations stands in stark contrast to the supply of addictive pharmaceuticals via pharmacies, and creates risks when tobacco prices increase. Rather than stop future tobacco taxation increases, and abandon a highly effective measure to reduce smoking prevalence, we suggest the sale of tobacco at a small number of sites that have legislated requirements for security and training. This approach would have many health and crime prevention benefits.\[80\]pp.11-17 In particular: • Limiting tobacco sales to fewer outlets which have better security would reduce the opportunities for crime;\[81\] • Reducing the number of outlets is likely to reduce smoking uptake, and prompt and support smokers to quit.\[27 82-84\] Taxation and the environmental costs from smoking Other tobaco product related taxes could be used to deal with the environmental externalities from the tobacco industry. These externalities include post-smoker product waste, landfill costs, hazardous waste, and damage to soil, water and marine environments.\[85\] The conseqent policies could include a tax on cellulose butts, which many smokers mistakenly believe lower the health risks of smoking,\[86\] and that have extensive negative environmental effects.\[54 87 88\] Complementary effects from increased alcohol taxation, or a minimum alcohol price There is some evidence that increased effective alcohol prices will reduce tobacco use,\[89-92\] as these two products are typically complementary. Smokers are also much more likely to be heavy drinkers than non- smokers, and young people often begin smoking whilst out drinking with friends. Health Promotion Agency researchers have found that ‘strong links between smoking and drinking... may act as barriers to successful cessation among young late-onset smokers.’\[93\] Because alcohol use adversely affects reasoning and decision- making,\[94\] even small amounts can increase smoking relapse.\[95\] We encourage the Tax Working Group to explore a combined tobacco and alcohol taxation policy to reduce health harm from both tobacco and alcohol. 7 Recommendation 1: Government mandated retail price and maximum price before tax A mandated retail price would mean that all brands would be the same price per cigarette or tobacco weight. A periodically adjusted Government mandated retail tobacco price per cigarette (or tobacco weight), combined with a maximum price before tax, would enable Government to control the effect of tobacco tax rises. It would remove the tobacco industry’s current ability to smooth or minimise the effects of excise tax increase, enable the Government to reduce the profits tobacco companies make from an addictive dangerous product, and prevent potential windfall profits from a mimimum price system alone.\[4-7\] The maximum price before tax would be set at the point tobacco leaves bond, and the importer or manufacturer would have to provide for wholesale and retail margins from that maximum price. The mandated retail price allows the Government to remove any marketing ability based on price. Example: Maximum pack price before tax $5, mandated pack retail price $28 ($23 tax). Tax revenue (and/or a dedicated tax) could be increased by either lowering the maximum price before tax, increasing the mandated retail price, or both. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Example of maximum pack price before tax $5, mandated pack retail price $28 ($23 tax) ‘Maximum price before tax’ systems are widely used when there are private monopolies or restricted markets, as a way to protect communities. For instance, with power, fuel, communications or other networks.\[96 97\] This system would also be suitable for the commercial sale of an addictive dangerous product. Recommendation 2: Dedicated tobacco tax revenue Until 2025, the dedication of at least $100m (currently about 5%) of tobacco tax revenue annually for tobacco control. This funding would support improved mass media campaigns,\[35-38\] enriched Quitline services integrated with policy changes,\[39 40\] policy and other work on tobacco product additive restrictions or reductions in nicotine content ,\[41-43\] and enhanced policies (eg, outdoor smokefree environments) that assist smokers to quit and prevent smoking uptake. Such policies can reduce health inequalities and save health system costs.\[39\] Recommendation 3: Continued tobacco tax rises Continuing to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence and uptake, as long as a proportion of tobacco tax revenue is dedicated for tobacco control, and smokefree policy changes are made to make it easier for smokers to quit. Recommendation 4: Differential increase in loose tobacco tax Ensure that RYO cigarettes are not a cheaper alternative to factory made cigarettes and do not encourage smokers to switch between products as an alternative to quitting. This can be done by implementing a differentially greater increase in loose tobacco (RYO) taxation, monitoring the impact and repeating as necessary.

The increases should be inflation-adjusted – a 20% increase above the normal indexation for Consumer Price Index changes. This is likely to help reduce smoking uptake and increase cessation. The evidence suggests this will have the greatest impact on reducing smoking among Māori, people on low incomes and young people. 9-12 We acknowledge the potential adverse effects on smokers on low incomes and recommend measures are taken to mitigate these impacts, such as increasing smoking cessation support for smokers on low incomes. Action 1.1 will produce an increase in tobacco tax revenue. This is a potential source of funding for enhanced smoking cessation support and other measures recommended in this action plan. Available evidence and monitoring tells us the increases should be timed to maximise impact in prompting people to quit smoking. This action would require new finance legislation. We recommend this be enacted as part of the Budget 2018, with the first tax increase occurring in January 2019 (or as soon as possible). We also recommend ongoing monitoring and review of the impact of tax increases and responses of the tobacco industry. A full three-year review should be completed by July 2021. This will inform decisions about the requirement for further actions to reduce tobacco product affordability in order to reach the 2025 goal. Establish a minimum retail price that must be charged for tobacco products, with effect from December 2020 Tobacco tax rises do not automatically translate to tobacco retail price rises or equivalent increases for different tobacco products. Minimum price regulation is a way to ensure the impacts of the tobacco tax increases aren’t undermined by tobacco industry actions designed to minimise their effect. This is a potential source of funding for enhanced smoking cessation support and other measures recommended in this action plan. An example of industry response in the face of tobacco tax increases is differential price increases so that the price of ‘budget’ brands is kept low while ‘premium’ brand prices increase. This has the effect of shielding many smokers from the tax increases and encourages brand switching as a way to reduce the impact of tobacco tax increases. This action should also include restrictions on price promotions. This action will require new legislation and could be included in the new Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Act. The new legislation for this action should be in force by December 2020. 15 Complementary measures to support actions to make tobacco less affordable The positive impact of the tobacco tax increases should be maximised, and potential adverse effects minimised, using the following complementary measures. 1. Implement concurrent enhanced smoking cessation support and marketing by December 2018. Support for cessation should include targeted support for Māori, Pacific and low-income smokers and increased capacity for the Quitline. Marketing needs to include Quitline advertising and integrated stop-smoking mass media campaigns. This will maximise the positive impact of the tax increases and minimise adverse economic effects on people on low incomes. Mass media campaigns should include specific marketing of the tax increases and addressing the potential unintended consequences – to make it clear to the public that the measure is effective, the benefits outweigh the costs and that, if the retailing of tobacco products is causing security problems, then the industry should take responsibility for security measures (as happens with other high-value products, such as money in banks or jewellery retail). 2. Implement an additional one-off 15% increase in tobacco tax on roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, in addition to the recommended base increase of 20%. This action aims to stop RYO cigarettes from being a cheaper alternative to factory-manufactured cigarettes, which can undermine the beneficial impact of tax increases. We recommend this measure is introduced with finance legislation as part of the Budget 2018, and is started to coincide with the tobacco tax increases in January 2019. 3. End duty-free concessions for tobacco products by 2018. Aotearoa New Zealand still allows duty-free tobacco products to be brought into the country. In 2014 the duty-free personal concession was lowered from 200 cigarettes to 50 cigarettes (or 50 grams of tobacco or cigars or a mixture of all three weighing not more than 50 grams). It is an anomaly to provide any tax incentive for the purchase and consumption of tobacco products, and such a concession undermines the impact of tobacco tax increases. We recommend this concession is ended by introducing legislation as part of the 2018 Budget. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS TAX INCREASES HELP PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES, MĀORI AND PACIFIC PEOPLES, AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO QUIT SMOKING. IT WILL BE VITAL TO SUPPORT SMOKERS ON LOW INCOMES TO QUIT – THROUGH ENHANCED CESSATION SUPPORT, REDUCED RETAIL AVAILABILITY AND PRODUCT CHANGES. $ 16 From: Thornley L, Edwards R, Waa A, et al.

Modelling evidence predicts greater health gain for Māori compared to non- Māori from ongoing annual tax increases. 2 In addition, New Zealand stakeholders strongly supported this policy option. Tax increases are an established measure that attract high public support. There are precedents in other countries for higher tax increases, for example Australia has legislated annual tobacco tax increases that are higher than 10% until the year 2020 (in 2010 they increased tax by 25%). 3 Potential adverse effects need to be considered, particularly the impact on low-income smokers and retailers, but we believe these impacts can be mitigated. Minimum price regulation is a relatively new policy measure internationally, but it is considered promising in the research literature. The measure is used in many US states. In Aotearoa New Zealand, there have been recent increases in the availability and sales of budget brands, and survey evidence indicates that smokers switch to budget brands in response to tobacco tax increases. This suggests minimum price regulation is needed to maximise the impact of tobacco tax increases in promoting smoking cessation.

The 2016 Budget introduced ongoing 10% tax rises for the four years until 2020. We recommend increasing the current annual tobacco excise tax by 20% above inflation annually for three years from 2019-2021, with a review in 2021 to assess the need for continued increases. This is a potential source of funding for enhanced smoking cessation support and other measures recommended in this action plan. Available evidence and monitoring tells us the increases should be timed to maximise impact in prompting people to quit smoking. Evidence on the effectiveness of raising the price of tobacco Our evidence review found compelling evidence that tobacco tax and price interventions are highly effective in reducing tobacco use, preventing children and young people from taking up smoking, and motivating smokers to quit. The evidence is consistent and includes the findings of eight recent systematic reviews (2011-2016). 5-12 Some researchers and expert tobacco control organisations, including the US National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization, point to tax increases as the single most effective tobacco control intervention, compared with all other interventions. 5, 8 The effectiveness of tobacco tax/price increases in reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is supported by a small, but growing, evidence base. 5 Examples of the effect of tobacco prices on smoking prevalence The World Bank estimated that a 10% cigarette price increase results in a 7% decrease in smoking consumption by young people and 4% by adults. 8 One authoritative US review estimated that increasing the unit price for tobacco products by 20% would reduce overall consumption of tobacco products by 10.4%, prevalence of adult tobacco use by 3.6%, and youth initiation of tobacco use by 8.6%. 12 The University of Otago’s Burden of Disease Epidemiology, Equity and Cost-Effectiveness Programme (BODE 3 ) has carried out modelling on the impact of annual 10% and 20% increases in tobacco tax. This work suggests it will have a substantial impact on smoking prevalence, but will be insufficient on its own to achieve the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 goal. 2, 24 This work also showed that tax increases can result in major health gains and cost-savings to the health sector. Tax and price increases are considered the most cost- effective of traditional tobacco control interventions. They cost the least, while raising new revenue, so are politically attractive. 5 Evidence is not yet available to inform the specific size and timing of tax increases. For example, the question of whether to introduce smaller regular increases or a sudden, larger increase at three-yearly intervals. Both approaches have potential merits. For this action plan, we have selected ongoing increases of 20% annually rather than a ‘shock’ increase. Our reasons for this include consistency with the current incremental approach, which is a well-established measure in many settings. 19 20 Effects on equity and reducing disparities Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand and overseas suggests that increasing tobacco tax can help to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking. Consistent research in high-income countries indicates that lower-income populations are more responsive to tobacco tax/price rises, and tax/price increases are associated with reduced income disparities. Our review identified four systematic reviews from 2014-16 to support this finding, 6, 9, 10, 20 as well as Aotearoa New Zealand evidence on the positive effects of tax increases in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. 25 Some research indicates that tax/price interventions can be effective in reducing ethnic disparities. 12 Recent Aotearoa New Zealand evidence suggests that annual tobacco tax increases may have a greater positive impact on reducing Māori and Pacific tobacco use, compared with non-Māori. 26 Modelling evidence also predicts greater gain for Māori, compared to non-Māori, from ongoing annual tax increases. 20 In contrast, another study suggests the 2012 tax increase may have had stronger effects on non-Māori (compared to Māori) quitting behaviour. 22 The study authors noted that Māori participants nonetheless reported more financial pressure to quit. Further research is needed to investigate the effects on ethnic disparities, and the financial hardship experiences of low-income smokers. 21 Any adverse effects should be monitored, as part of the ongoing evaluation of the action plan’s impact, so that appropriate measures to mitigate these impacts can be introduced. Importance of complementary measures It may be argued that tobacco products are already expensive in Aotearoa New Zealand, and that previous tax increases have not yet significantly reduced Māori and Pacific smoking. Our proposal is for a much larger increase than previously (20% instead of 10% annual increases), which we expect to have a greater positive impact. Complementing the tax increases with the other measures in the action plan is likely to enhance effectiveness for Māori and Pacific smokers. Complementary measures include targeted smoking cessation support, enhanced and targeted mass media campaigns, additional increases on roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco (these are smoked much more commonly by Māori) 27 and ensuring that alternative nicotine delivery products (such as electronic cigarettes) are more accessible and affordable than smoked tobacco products. Stakeholder support Consistent with the evidence, stakeholders in our engagement process expressed strong support for increasing the price of tobacco products. The consulted stakeholders strongly agreed that increasing tax/price and reducing retail availability and supply were the two highest priorities of the six intervention areas discussed (see above). An online survey of 32 stakeholders, carried out as part of the engagement process, revealed that 20% annual increases were favoured over two other options (continuation of the current 10% annual increase, and a larger one-off increase of 30% followed by 20% increases annually). Feasibility and public support Drawing on the evidence and expert views of Aotearoa New Zealand stakeholders, we assess the recommended annual tax increase as a highly feasible and acceptable intervention. Increasing tax is an established measure with a long history in Aotearoa New Zealand, which can be implemented simply by amending finance legislation. This could be introduced as part of the Budget in 2018. Aotearoa New Zealand and international evidence suggests the public endorse tax increases, 7, 28, 29 including some evidence of smoker support and among young people. Public and smoker support appears particularly strong if some of the additional revenue raised is allocated to the national tobacco control programme to help support smokers to quit. 30 Possible adverse effects of tobacco price rises Potential impact on low-income smokers We have considered the potential for adverse impacts of tax/price increases – particularly on poorer smokers and on crime affecting tobacco retailers. Low-income smokers who quit as a result of the tax increases will benefit financially. However, some low-income smokers who continue to smoke may be disadvantaged financially as a result. Others who continue to smoke will not be disadvantaged, for example, if they compensate by smoking less tobacco. Some Aotearoa New Zealand research suggests hardship may have increased for some low-income smokers following recent tax increases. 21 In particular, potential negative impacts on the children of smokers will need to be carefully monitored and addressed. For example, addicted smokers, including parents with dependent children, may forgo spending on household essentials in order to buy tobacco. More research is needed. This potential effect should be mitigated by enhancing access to free high-quality services for smoking cessation support targeted to low-income, Māori and Pacific smokers; possibly using dedicated tax revenue to fund this support. Without such supporting interventions to help increase quitting, the adverse financial effects of tax increases are likely to impact disproportionately on low-income smokers who continue to smoke. As noted earlier, close monitoring of the impact of the tax increases should occur so that further mitigation measures can be considered if necessary. Potential impact of tax increases on retail crime Recently, media reports have drawn attention to various crimes targeted at retailers in Aotearoa New Zealand, including the theft of tobacco products and violence against small retailers in dairies and service stations. Such crimes are clearly undesirable and unacceptable. At present, data is not available to confirm whether these crimes are increasing, and if they are, what factors are driving the increase. However, understandable concern and anxiety is being expressed by retailers and others. We believe the response to retail crime should not be to abandon the established, evidence-based policy of tobacco tax increases. This would harm the health of New Zealanders since tobacco price increases are so strongly associated with reducing and preventing tobacco use and prompting smokers to quit. Reversing the tax increases would benefit tobacco manufacturers, who have a vested interest in keeping tobacco products affordable. Finally, the effects of abandoning tax increases on retail crime are unknown. Our view is that implementing a comprehensive action plan for achieving Smokefree Aotearoa by 2025, as in the accompanying action plan, offers the best solution to the issue of tobacco-related retail crime for the following reasons. 1. Large reductions in smoking prevalence that result from implementation of a comprehensive action plan will have an impact on reducing demand for tobacco products, which in turn will reduce an important driver of tobacco-related retail crime. 2. Another objective in our action plan – to greatly reduce the availability of tobacco products – will help reduce tobacco-related retail crime by dramatically reducing the number of tobacco retail outlets. This will decrease the availability of tobacco products for theft and require tobacco to be sold from stores with adequate storage and security arrangements. Potential increase in illicit trade (smuggling) of tobacco Smuggling is unlikely to be a major problem in Aotearoa New Zealand because of geographic isolation, strong border controls, and effective tax administration and enforcement. The risk of illicit trade is probably greatly overstated as a problem and has not been a major issue to date in Aotearoa New Zealand, despite ongoing tax increases. 31 Action 1.2 Establish a minimum retail price that must be charged for tobacco products, with effect from December 2019 Minimum price regulation is a relatively new, but growing, area of tobacco control. Laws to regulate the minimum price of tobacco products are already in place in at least 24 US states and the District of Columbia. 18 As noted in the Achieving a Smokefree Aotearoa by 2025 action plan, the main action plan, the main rationale for regulating the minimum price of tobacco is to counter the tobacco industry’s efforts to keep prices low in response to increases in tax, such as price discounting. Evidence on the effectiveness of minimum price regulation Evidence is emerging on the effects of minimum price laws, so only limited evidence is currently available. A systematic review in 2016 found the most common ‘non- tax’ price interventions were minimum price regulation and restrictions on price promotions. 7 The review noted that these two interventions are seen as promising complements to tobacco taxes, and recommended the use of both interventions. The current literature includes few studies that measured the impact of these interventions on average prices, price dispersion or disparities in tobacco consumption, since much of the literature focuses on policy development and potential legal challenges. 7 Of the three studies in the 2016 review that explicitly measured the effects of minimum price laws on price-related outcomes, two found no evidence that average cigarette prices were higher in places with minimum price laws, and one found no average price impacts of a voluntary, industry-led policy. Three other studies found that policies to restrict price promotions were associated with lower awareness of promotional offers. 7 The review’s authors emphasise there is a need for further research in this area. Aotearoa New Zealand survey research suggests that smokers do switch to cheaper brands of tobacco products in response to increased tobacco taxes, which minimum price regulation would help to deter. One survey revealed that more than a fifth of smokers and recent ex-smokers on low incomes switched from premium to cheaper brands following tobacco tax increases. 25 Analysis of the annual tobacco returns by tobacco manufacturers and importers provides evidence of brand positioning and growth in the availability and sales of budget brands. 32 Stakeholder support Minimum price regulation was not specifically discussed in our stakeholder engagement process, as the focus was on increasing tobacco taxes. 21 Feasibility and acceptability Several papers analysed in a 2016 review of ‘non-tax’ price interventions, including minimum price regulation, found evidence of public support for these types of tobacco pricing policies. 7 No Aotearoa New Zealand evidence on public support for minimum price regulation was located for our review; the current evidence on public support appears focused on tobacco tax increases. 22 Summary of evidence on tax and price interventions Evidence assessment Strong evidence for tobacco tax increases. Newly-emerging limited evidence for minimum price regulation. Effectiveness We assessed increasing tobacco tax as highly effective and minimum price regulation as uncertain (because it is an emerging area with limited evidence available). Equity and reducing disparities We assessed the likely impact on equity and reducing disparities as positive for tobacco tax increases and uncertain for minimum price regulation. The evidence suggests that people on low incomes and young people are more responsive to tobacco tax increases. Some evidence, including from Aotearoa New Zealand, is available to suggest tobacco tax increases can reduce disparities in terms of income and ethnicity. Cost-effectiveness Tobacco tax increases are highly cost-effective, and minimum price regulation is likely to be cost-effective. Unintended impacts We considered three main potential adverse effects: possible impact on smokers on low incomes, impacts on retail crime, and impacts on illicit trade (smuggling) of tobacco products. The first two are important considerations for Aotearoa New Zealand, but can be mitigated, whereas illicit trade is less likely to be a major problem. Technical feasibility We assessed technical feasibility of tobacco tax increases as high – because it is an established measure that can be done by amending finance legislation. Minimum price regulation, as a new measure, is assessed as moderately feasible. Political feasibility Tobacco tax increases are assessed ‘moderate to high’ in terms of political feasibility, and minimum price regulation is assessed as moderately feasible politically. Acceptability / public support We assess acceptability of tobacco tax increases as moderate to high, based on strong international and Aotearoa New Zealand evidence of public and smoker support for tax and price interventions in general, including among young people. (Majority support is found among smokers only if the extra revenue is ear-marked to support smokers to quit). Acceptability of minimum price regulation is assessed as moderate based on overseas evidence of public support. Precedents Tobacco tax increases are standard practice in multiple countries including Aotearoa New Zealand. Acceptability of minimum price regulation is in place in at least 24 US states and the District of Columbia. Integrated mass media campaigns and concurrent enhanced cessation support has been implemented in Iceland, Switzerland and Vietnam.

We were formed in April 1989 to advocate and promote the common industrial and professional interests of our members and we now represent nearly 5,000 members, most of whom are employed by District Health Boards (DHBs) as medical and dental specialists, including physicians, surgeons, anaesthetists, psychiatrists, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and paediatricians. Over 90% of all DHB permanently employed senior doctors and dentists eligible to join the ASMS are in fact members. Although most of our members work in secondary and tertiary care (either as specialists or as non-vocationally registered doctors or dentists) in the public sector, a small but significant and growing number work in primary care and outside DHBs. These members, many of whom are general practitioners, are employed by the New Zealand Family Planning Association, ACC, hospices, community trusts, Iwi health authorities, union health centres and the New Zealand Blood Service. The ASMS promotes improved health care for all New Zealanders and recognition of the professional skills and training of our members, and their important role in health care provision. We are committed to the establishment and maintenance of a high quality, professionally-led public health system throughout New Zealand. The ASMS is an affiliate of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions. Introduction The ASMS welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the debate on taxation with the aim of producing a fairer, progressive tax system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy and an adequate and sustainable revenue base to fund public services. Our submission concentrates specifically on how taxation policy can be improved to benefit New Zealanders’ health and wellbeing, including access to timely health care when it is needed, consistent with the Government’s health policy. It is written in the context of government plans to look beyond the traditional monetary markers to measure economic success and introduce measures of wellbeing. We note and support in particular comments in Treasury’s discussion papers that good public policy enhances the capacity of natural, social, human and financial and physical capital to improve wellbeing for New Zealanders and that this means the capital stocks: 1 2 3 4 • are sustained or enhanced, not eroded by current generations at the expense of future generations (sustainability) • are shared equitably in a way that sustains or enhances the capitals (equity) • allow for a cohesive society, where people and groups respect others’ rights to live the kinds of lives they value (social cohesion) • are resilient to major systemic risks (risk management), and • generate material wellbeing (economic growth). Taxation policy must support these principles for good public policy. With regards to how this may apply to improving New Zealanders’ health and health care services, we focus here on two fundamental aims to which taxation policy can contribute: • To mitigate the causes of ill health, including reducing poverty, improving the quality of housing, encouraging healthy diets and the effects of pollution. • To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the public health system so that good quality health care can be provided as it is needed. 3 Time and resource constraints have not allowed for a submission that deals with these issues to the extent they deserve. Nor have we been able to canvass the views of our members, other than the regional representatives on our National Executive. While our comments on the second point above are based on a well-established policy position, our comments about addressing the determinants of ill health are qualified as they are based on assumptions of what we reasonably believe our membership would support. Our members in dental and public health specialties, for example, have been strongly advocating a sugar tax. We are raising these issues for serious consideration by the Working Group rather than from a formal position of ASMS. (Our members have much to contribute to policy debates such as this. The tight timeframe for submissions on such a critical subject is disappointing and a missed opportunity to gather more valuable insights to inform the policy decisions.) We are aware that some of the points we raise are beyond the scope of the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference (ToR), such as our comments on the Government’s broader fiscal policy. We have included them because (a) the ToR are too narrow to properly consider some issues that are central to the stated purpose of the exercise, to “improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system”; and (b) they are too narrow to take into account the potential impact on the Government’s stated intention of promoting a greater wellbeing-focused policy direction. Taxation to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the public health system Our comments are based on the premise that poor health and wellbeing is a substantial but unacknowledged ‘debt’, socially and economically and, conversely, the compelling evidence that greater investment in the health system, when used wisely, will lead to a healthier economy as well as a healthier population. From this perspective, the essential outcomes of a new taxation policy must be to increase government revenue to enable greater investment in health care and, as discussed later, to contribute to cross-sector illness prevention and health promotion strategies, such as reducing poverty and encouraging healthy eating. This approach also requires a shift from the common perception that containing cost equates to increasing efficiency. In many instances, this is not the case. In practice, arbitrary budget cuts can contain costs ‘successfully’ without having any bearing on cost–effectiveness. The lost opportunity of failing to properly implement proven cost-effective policies such as distributed clinical leadership in DHBs, largely owing to cost constraints, is an example of this. This approach also requires a policy mind-shift from perceiving the health system as a drain on the economy to recognising it as part and parcel of improving health and achieving better economic growth. 5 In short, a taxation policy that enables greater investment in health care, provided through evidence-based polices, would make a positive contribution to GDP and help to reduce the country’s social and economic debt that we leave to future generations. Increasing revenue to invest in health The Government is aware that to address the years of underfunding of health services, substantial incremental injections of funding are required in addition to funding to meet growing health needs. We are aware that other sectors are in a similar position to varying degrees. It is clear to us therefore that more tax revenue is needed. We do not believe the five principles for good public policy and national wellbeing listed above will have any chance of success without it. We note that of the 10 (mostly northern European) countries rated most highly for converting economic growth into wellbeing, reported by the World Economic Forum, all bar one in 2016 had tax 4 revenues above 36% of GDP, with six countries topping 40% of GDP, (New Zealand’s was 32%). There is a similar gap between these countries’ level of government expenditure and that of New Zealand’s. 6 7 The Government’s fiscal policy priority of capping government spending at 30% of GDP in order to reduce government debt appears to seriously undermine the potential for the Government’s vision of wellbeing. Notwithstanding the above, the measure of GDP on its own fails to differentiate between economic activities that add to welfare or wellbeing from those which diminish it, for example, through negative health impacts. Initiatives to remedy this allow the value of mortality reductions to be introduced into national income accounting through ‘full income’ measures. These ‘add’ the ‘full’ value associated with the years of life expectancy gained to the standard measure of GDP growth, reflecting the overall impact of health on societal wellbeing. A study of high-income countries attributed some 30% of the growth in full income to declines in mortality. Another study estimated the monetary worth of recent increases in life expectancy in selected western European countries and showed that between 29% and 38% of notional GDP increases from 1970 to 2003 could be attributed to gains in life expectancy. 8 Clearly these valuations are simplified, but they are nonetheless indicative of the impact of health on wealth, when the importance of non-monetary elements are acknowledged. If only a fraction of life expectancy gains is the result of health interventions, the benefits to the economy are substantial. Further, contrary to the common belief that major health advances are mostly the result of social, environmental and economic progress, recent studies indicate that around half the gains in life expectancy in recent decades stem from improved health care. Further, studies in OECD countries show that up to the age of 75 around 20% of male mortality and over 40% of female mortality may be averted by health care interventions. New Zealand research shows that of 56 conditions or groups of conditions where death is considered avoidable through timely health intervention, 24 were avoidable largely through primary prevention, 16 mainly through secondary prevention, and a further 16 mainly through tertiary prevention. 9 “Health expenditure through health systems and other sectors that impact on health can then be shown to achieve ‘social productivity’ many times greater than that associated with other forms of investment.” 10 - World Health Organisation (Europe) report, 2008. The economic costs of not investing in health, on the other hand, are considerable, as demonstrated in numerous cost-of-illness studies. One British study estimated the economic burden of coronary heart disease in Britain in 1999 was over seven billion pounds (almost 1% of Britain’s GDP in that year). Only a quarter of that cost was for public health services, the rest – the less visible costs – were for informal care and lost productivity. 11 Boosting ‘tax morale’ We recognise that increasing tax revenue has its political challenges, being open to criticism from some quarters that ‘tax and spend’ is bad. However, studies suggest that if the tax system is seen as fair, when the wealthy bear a proportionately higher share of taxes, then ‘tax morale’ is high. That is, people are more inclined to accept a moral obligation to pay taxes as their contribution to society. An international study shows progressive taxation is positively associated with the subjective wellbeing of nations. Respondents living in a nation with more progressive taxation evaluated their lives as closer to the best possible life and reported having more positive and less negative daily experiences than did respondents living in a nation with less progressive taxation. Further, the association between more progressive taxation and higher levels of subjective wellbeing was reinforced by citizens’ satisfaction with public goods. 12 13 5 A critical issue integral to any debate on taxation is regularly providing the information to taxpayers that shows clearly what they are getting for their money. In the health sector – and we suspect the same in other sectors – the information is either not there, or is there but not used. This may be a result of the deck-chair-shifting policy of shifting resources from the ‘back room to the front line’ (which also shifted the backroom work to the front line). In the health sector, for example, no consistent data exist to enable a longitudinal measure of hospital activity. Aside from the fact that this seriously inhibits any sensible assessment of how much to allocate to the Health budget each year, it also means the public cannot see the value of their tax dollars in a large and critical area of spending. Hypothecated tax Dedicating specific tax revenues for particular spending purposes (‘hypothecation’) is worth considering for some potential targeted health-related taxes, where the tax revenue is used for specific health activities or services. For example, revenue from a tax on sugar could be dedicated to supporting dental and/or diabetes services, or healthy eating programmes. Dedicated health taxes could be useful with regards to the above discussion concerning tax system transparency, especially when considering that past surveys on taxation and government spending have shown most New Zealanders (nearly 90%) are willing to pay more tax in order for the Government to increase spending on health and education. 14 The potential downside to hypothecation – that the revenue raised may fall short or may exceed need for the area to which it is dedicated in any particular year – could be overcome in special cases by building in flexibility for topping up or diverting revenue to other areas, as required. Critically, such decisions would need to be fully justified to taxpayers. On more specific aspects of tax related to health and wellbeing and included in the Tax Working Group’s review of the tax system: Integrating targeted health taxes The research indicates combinations of tax measures, supported by complementary policies, are necessary to achieve the best health gain, rather than introducing targeted taxes on their own. For example, a sugar tax on its own risks possible adverse cross-price elasticity effects on consumption of other foods (eg, foods high in saturated fat and salt). Goods and services tax (GST) The evidence from countries where health foods are exempt from GST or its equivalent points to significant health benefits from such exemptions. When certain interests in Australia began advocating for the removal of the GST exemption for foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables in 2013, researchers from the University of Queensland estimated that applying the 10% GST to fresh food would reduce fruit and vegetable consumption by about 5%, and would produce an additional 90,000 cases of heart disease, stroke and cancer in the Australian adult population, with the corresponding savings for the health sector. 15 16 A study in the United Kingdom (UK) suggests lost revenue from GST exemption on healthy foods could be balanced by taxing ‘less-healthy foods’ and is a combination that produces better health benefits, particularly for prevention of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Going further and using tax on unhealthy foods to subsidise healthy foods would produce substantially more benefits. 17 18 Lost revenue from exempting healthy foods from GST could also be balanced by extending GST to financial services of taxing value added in this sector. 6 While we appreciate the downsides to these suggestions are that they can be administratively complex, we believe the potential health benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Tax on unhealthy foods The literature on taxing unhealthy foods tends to look mostly at combinations of taxes on sugar, salt and saturated fats rather than on a single target. The evidence for significant health benefits from these taxes is strong. The main argument against taxing unhealthy foods containing high amounts of sugar, salt or saturated fats is that they disproportionately impact on the poorest families. On the other hand, some argue that this is a major strength of the policy. Those on lower incomes spend a proportionately higher amount on unhealthy foods so the financial disincentive is most potent for poorer families. Because they are more sensitive to changes in price, they respond better and experience larger health gains than the more affluent. 19 An OECD review of obesity prevention interventions concluded that taxes and other fiscal measures are the only interventions that consistently produce larger gains for the poor. This assertion was challenged by some researchers but real-life evidence from Mexico’s sugary drinks tax showed the greatest gains for the poor. Not only did consumption of drinks with high-sugar content decline, mostly among those in the lower socioeconomic groups, but the results also showed an increase in purchases of untaxed beverages, mainly driven by an increase in purchased bottled plain water. While much of the debate on a sugar tax in New Zealand has focused on obesity, the benefits of reduced sugar consumption also apply to conditions such as diabetes and tooth decay. There is also growing evidence suggesting links between sugar consumption and some cancers. 20 21 While taxing unhealthy foods has the greatest potential impact on those with the greatest burden of disease, the literature indicates the success of such taxes depends on the finer detail of how they are implemented, in what combination and with what other complementing policies. The impact of an increased financial burden on lower-income groups would be a critical factor to address. This could be through altering the rates of other taxes and benefits like income tax thresholds, for example. Some countries use the revenue generated by unhealthy food taxes to fund health services targeted at low-income families. Taxing for healthier drinking “There are violent assaults, motor vehicle accidents, some of the trauma that occurs – you see some pretty horrible stuff – and mental illness and overdoses. Some people do some pretty reckless things. They put themselves at risk of serious harm by drinking too much.” – Dr John Bonning, Clinical Director of Waikato Hospital’s Emergency Department. 22 Dr Bonning’s comments were reported after a survey by the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine revealed that one in four patients presented to emergency departments as a result of irresponsible alcohol use. Aside from the drinkers themselves, many others, including partners, families, friends, workmates and random strangers, are reported as being harmed by someone else’s drinking. 23 In hospitals, they also divert time and resources away from other patients. The cost of alcohol abuse (estimated at around $5billion in 2005/06) greatly outweigh the annual tax revenue generated from alcohol excise taxes ($985 million in 2016). 24 The call by Alcohol Healthwatch for a substantial increase in the rate of excise tax on alcohol products is well justified; as is call for the affordability of alcohol to addressed via further increases above the rate of inflation in following years, as with tobacco excise increases. These regular increases are required to address any low-cost alcohol products developed by alcohol producers to 7 mitigate the effects of price increases. We note that tobacco tax was raised by 10% on 1 January 2017 and was the first of four similar increases to come into force on I January each year until 2020. Taxing to reduce poverty We support the Government’s aim to reduce poverty – a major determinant of poor health – and tax policy must support this direction. Progressive taxes are but one way to reduce inequality, and should be promoted together with other policies that could reduce the inequality of pre-tax income and policies that remove the cost barriers to health care for poorer families. As the Council of Trade Unions’ submission points out, taxes impact on benefits and tax credits, and vice-versa. The highest effective marginal tax rates are currently on middle income families receiving Working for Families tax credits. We support the CTU’s call for the Tax Working Group to investigate improvements to the welfare system that can be achieved through the tax system, including at least partially replacing Working for Families with a tax-free threshold on personal income, as in Australia. Taxing for housing affordability Housing can have a considerable impact on a family’s health and wellbeing, whether it is poor physical conditions (due in part to inadequate regulation) or high prices that lead to overcrowding and homelessness. We recognise that there are multiple factors causing housing unaffordability. The contribution that a tax regime can make to addressing the issue must in our view give priority to supporting the poorest families to access health housing. Tax on pollution The potential health impact of pollution and the effects of global warming stemming from pollution are well documented. Polluters should face taxes on their emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, to pay the costs of all significant effects of pollution. We recognise, however, such taxes can create a disproportionate burden for lower income people. In those cases, counteracting measures are needed, such as reduced taxes of other kinds and/or increased income support. As with most if not all of the taxes discussed here, it is important that pollution taxes are treated as part of a package of complementary policies. 8 References 1 A King, G Huseynli, N MacGibbon.

Property Council New Zealand – Submission to the “Future of Tax” review by the Tax Working Group Introduction Property Council New Zealand (“Property Council”) is a member-led, not-for-profit organisation that represents the country’s commercial, industrial and retail property owners, managers, investors, and advisors. Our primary goal is the creation and retention of well designed, functional and sustainably built urban environments that contribute to New Zealand’s overall prosperity. Property Council supports the formulation and implementation of a statutory and regulatory framework that enhances economic growth and development. To achieve these goals, our advocacy and research focus on urban strategy, infrastructure, regulation and compliance, legislation and capital markets. Over the years, Property Council has built and maintained a good rapport with central and local government agencies and is often relied upon for advice, comments and feedback on matters of local, regional and national importance. Our members drive economic and social growth – they are the infrastructure that houses the residential and commercial property sectors. General comments and summary Property Council is pleased to provide input into the “Future of Tax” review by the Tax Working Group. We agree that the tax system plays a vital part in supporting the wellbeing of all New Zealanders and it is important that it functions fairly, efficiently and is sustainable (both politically over time and in raising the required amount of revenue to fund government spending). Simplicity As an overarching comment, Property Council believes that it is highly desirable for New Zealand’s tax system to be as simple as possible for those participating in it to understand and comply with. We believe that the current system, in the main, achieves this objective. Therefore, when considering different reform options (and sets of tax polices), Property Council strongly urges this objective to be kept in mind. Fairness and current inconsistencies On the issue of fairness of the current tax system, we note that this appears to have become shorthand for “does New Zealand need a capital gains tax”? While we have considered whether New Zealand should implement a general capital gains tax (as well as certain other tax base broadening options), we are concerned that this has obscured other tax distortions and inconsistencies in the current system. A key tax distortion, which disproportionately impacts Property Council’s members, was the 2010 removal of tax depreciation on non-residential building structures. That change has resulted in real economic costs for building owners, as there is no tax recognition for economic depreciation on building structure, unlike every other business asset, or for the cost of required capital upgrades – for example, to earthquake strengthen building structures to prevent loss of life or incorporate new building technologies. In relation to the former, it is only since the devastating events in Christchurch that this serious and fundamental tax anomaly, which Inland Revenue officials have conceded exists with the removal of depreciation for the building structure, has come to light. It is therefore deeply concerning that, on present track, it continues to be ignored. Continuing failure to address this anomaly acts as a tax disincentive to earthquake strengthening and prolongs the uncertainty for property owners who are already incurring costs in the expectation of a future legislative fix, while making any fix increasingly retrospective so as to deal with past expenditure. Put simply, it is untenable that commercial property owners can currently claim a tax deduction for a building that collapses as a result of an earthquake (and maybe kills people) but tax law does not take into account the costs of strengthening a building so that it does not collapse (and saves lives). More generally earthquake non-performance of current building stock clearly illustrates that building structures do face obsolescence over time. This is driven by both improvements in building standards but also increased expectations from tenants around health and safety (which will often exceed the minimum standards). Similarly, demand for new building technologies and innovations, particularly “green” building technologies, mean that older stock faces technological obsolesce that requires a substantial outlay to remedy. Without such investment, the capital value of such buildings will be negatively impacted, as tenant demand is reduced. With the Prime Minister publicly stating that “climate change” is the nuclear issue of her generation, the demand for greater environmental sustainability in building design will only grow. The tax system unfortunately does not provide any tax recognition for this additional cost, which contributes to New Zealand’s overall public good. In fact, the current system actively discourages further investment in building structures that enhance the public good by improving building safety and utility. The 2010 changes have also, in Property Council’s view, resulted in unnecessary boundaries (such as what is “fit-out” and the building structure and what is feasibility expenditure and not) which have added to administrative and compliance costs. In our view, this has eroded the coherence of the tax system, as well as resulting in unfairness for commercial property owners in particular. Finally, Property Council believes the 2010 tax change was largely the result of a fiscal balancing exercise by the then Government, rather than for principled tax policy reasons as non-residential building structures clearly do depreciate due to obsolescence and other factors. Therefore, we strongly urge the Tax Working Group to reconsider this current tax policy setting of no tax depreciation for non-residential building structures. To be clear, this recommendation would not provide landlords with a tax incentive. It is simply about reflecting the true economic cost from technical obsolescence, for tax purposes, similar to any other business asset. Other tax bases – capital gains tax, land taxes and stamp duties One of the questions posed in the submissions background document is whether New Zealand needs additional tax bases, including to improve fairness in the system. In principle, Property Council agrees that a comprehensive capital gains tax would improve fairness in the tax system. Our concern (borne out by international experience) is that real world capital gains taxes tend to be sub-optimal, both in terms of their coverage and ability to be a viable and stable revenue source. At the outset, the consideration of a capital gains tax by the Tax Working Group is hamstrung by it not being able to be applied to the family home. This is the most tax advantaged asset, per the Tax Working Group’s own analysis in its submissions background document. This is particularly relevant as one of the key questions asked is whether a capital gains tax would improve housing affordability. Property Council would like to draw a clear distinction between the residential property market and the non-residential (i.e. commercial, industrial and retail) property sector, which our members are engaged in. Addressing the housing affordability objective for the former should not result in a general application of any solution to the latter. This was unfortunately the experience with the 2010 tax changes and we strongly urge the Tax Working Group to take note to avoid a re- occurrence. The practical design issues with a capital gains tax also cannot be extricated from whether a capital gains tax is an appropriate tax reform. In Property Council’s view, key design issues that would need to be resolved are: — over-taxation due to a capital gains tax taxing inflationary gains (particularly relevant for long- lived assets, such as property): — double taxation of shares (in the absence of imputation or similar, to offer relief); — integration with the current Portfolio Investment Tax regime; — reinvestment of capital proceeds triggering tax labilities (which will be the case in the absence of any “rollover relief” in these circumstances); and — potential ring fencing of capital losses (while this is the approach with offshore regimes, this will add to complexity and the unfairness). Property Council does not consider that the trade-offs that would be required to make a general capital gains tax workable justify the fairness objective, which would be incremental at best in our view, or the alternative tax base objective. However, we acknowledge that this will be a balancing exercise for policy makers. Therefore, if a capital gains tax is considered necessary, on balance, to address fairness or other concerns, then its workability is paramount. The key design issues identified above should be clearly addressed. Property Council has also considered other tax base broadening options, such as a land tax or stamp duties. Both of these suffer from similar drawbacks to a capital gains tax that excludes the family home (and the land below it) from the base. They have the added distortion that they would apply to only a single asset class – non-residential land or property – which raises significant fairness concerns. Property Council therefore does not support the introduction of either tax type. Taxation of savings The other area we have focussed on, in our submission, is the current taxation of savings. Property Council members include both NZX-listed and unlisted property vehicles. These give a range of New Zealanders (from institutional investors, such as Kiwi Saver funds, to super annuitants to ordinary “mums” and “dads”) exposure to an asset class that they would not otherwise have access to. It should be noted that many investors, including retirees, typically favour NZ commercial property investment as it provides a relatively low-risk return and a regular income stream (rather than for capital returns, which can be volatile). This is important both for the diversification of their financial risk and New Zealand’s macroeconomic risk from over exposure to housing. We agree with comments in the submissions background document that the current differential tax treatment of different savings should be made more consistent. Property Council strongly supports the current Portfolio Investment Entity (“PIE”) tax regime, in that regard, recognising that this was an attempt at the time to level the tax playing field. We note that the 2012 Savings Working Group concluded that this change did not go far enough. Property Council would support further changes aimed at improving the consistency in the taxation of different savings. Tax Working Group objectives Property Council fully supports the objectives the Tax Working Group has been asked to consider for the New Zealand tax system, including a tax system that promotes long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy, and treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient matter. Housing affordability objective We note that a specific focus of the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference include the tax treatment of residential property, specifically, in the context of housing affordability. The Tax Working Group’s analysis (illustrated in Figure 21 of the submissions background document) also suggests that owner occupied housing and, to a lesser extent, rental housing appear to be tax advantaged relative to other types of savings, including PIE investments. We note that a number of Property Council members operate PIEs and comment later on about the importance of the PIE regime in helping to alleviate current taxation distortions. Property Council does not have a view on whether the current tax treatment of residential property is adversely impacting on New Zealanders’ access to affordable housing. For example, Property Council has not attempted to analyse whether there is a role for a narrowly targeted capital gains tax aimed at improving housing affordability. As that stated objective is not fairness or revenue- based, a capital gains tax that applies only to residential housing may or may not achieve that objective. Similarly, whether a land tax may be effective in reducing “banking” of residential land has not been analysed. Property Council members provide critical infrastructure for “NZ Inc” Property Council members own and/or operate predominantly non-residential buildings (office, retail, other commercial and industrial real-estate). It is important that the dynamics impacting the residential property market are distinguished from those impacting non-residential property, which are business assets. While we are hesitant to use the distinction, Property Council members’ assets comprise the productive sector, providing the infrastructure that supports a range of New Zealand businesses (“NZ Inc”). The reason we raise this is that past tax reforms have tended, for largely opportunistic reasons (discussed in detail later on), to conflate all land and property as being of the same type. This has resulted in non-residential property owners disproportionately, and in Property Council’s view unfairly, bearing the cost of those reforms. We therefore urge the Tax Working Group to be objective in its analysis and bifurcate the issues facing the housing market (which it has specifically been asked to look at) from the wider commercial property market, which includes non-residential land and buildings. Property Council and its members are therefore keen to ensure that any tax proposals that, for example, may be aimed at improving housing affordability, do not cause collateral economic damage to the non-residential property sector, which forms the backbone of NZ business. Frameworks Property Council acknowledges the challenges, risk and opportunities facing New Zealand identified in the submissions background document. These include the impact of changing demographics, the nature of work, technological change, environmental challenges and concerns about inequality. While our submission does not directly address the impact of these issues on the tax system, our members play a vital role in providing the key physical infrastructure affecting the lives of all New Zealanders, be it where the work, study, shop, play or invest. Therefore, a number of these developments (be it changing work styles, greater focus on environmental sustainability, or social interaction) will directly impact the types of buildings and related infrastructure that New Zealanders (and the Government) will demand in future. Property Council strongly supports tools like the New Zealand Treasury’s Living Standards Framework in helping to analyse the trade-offs from different public policy settings, including tax policy. In particular, the acknowledgement that all public policy, including the tax system, is ultimately aimed at improving the wellbeing of New Zealanders, which is wider than just financial outcomes, but also encompasses more holistic concepts, such as New Zealanders mental and physical wellbeing (e.g. safety), a clean environment, and social trust and cohesion (through trust in and between communities, institutions and a strong rule of law). Property Council acknowledges wellbeing, applying these wide factors, can be difficult to measure quantitatively, but agree that their impact should be considered qualitatively. We have outlined below two examples of how our members are responding to and, in some cases, driving these wider changes/challenges in their developments. Earthquake strengthening to address structural obsolescence Following the events of Christchurch in 2011/12, which tragically led to loss of life, and more recently the earthquakes in the Kaikoura/greater Wellington region, resulting in business disruption (which in some cases is still ongoing) there has been a strong drive to upgrade (i.e. earthquake strengthen) building structures. This is needed to address both actual and perceived public safety concerns around building structure performance and potential for injury and loss of life during earthquakes (and other natural disasters). This illustrates, in a very real sense, the obsolescence of building structures, counter to the view that non-residential building structures do not depreciate. The retrofitting required to an existing building will often exceed the regulated new building standard, even accounting for upgrades to this minimum requirement following the Christchurch earthquakes. For example, in the case of the Recovery Plan for Christchurch, building owners were actively encouraged to exceed the code requirements for new buildings and when retrofitting existing buildings. In Property Council members’ experience, tenants are reluctant to renew existing, or enter new, leases unless buildings are retrofitted significantly above the new build standard. This is understandable given recent events and their consequences. At the same time, the ability to reflect these costs in rental returns is extremely limited. This economic cost is exacerbated by the tax system not providing any tax relief for these upgrade costs. This results in the perverse result that property owners can currently claim a tax deduction for a building that collapses as a result of an earthquake (and potentially kills people) but tax law does not take into account the costs of strengthening a building so that it does not collapse (and saves lives). Property Council members take their obligations as landlords extremely seriously. No one wants to see injury or loss of life. The concern is that while there is a clear public good to earthquake strengthening (and to above the minimum regulated standards), the tax system penalises building owners from actively doing so. Driving innovation through “green” building innovations and technologies “\[Climate change\] is my generation's nuclear-free moment, and I am determined that we will tackle it head on” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Labour Party 2017 election campaign launch There is a clear imperative for building owners to innovate in constructing more environmentally sustainable (“green”) buildings. This is typically driven by tenant demand, and the New Zealand Government is a key force in this regard. These developments reflect both societal and Government expectations about New Zealand’s future economic development needing to be more environmentally sustainable. This is not simply a case of being better for the environment, but also more cost efficient for building users (through more efficient use of lighting, heating and space and better amenities for habitants) and ultimately for all New Zealanders. The trend for “green” buildings again demonstrates that existing building structures, without green technologies and innovations, will become obsolete as tenant demand falls. Again, there is both a private and public good element to such building innovation which isn’t appropriately reflected in the return to building owners. And again, Property Council believes that the current tax system plays a role in increasing the overall economic cost by not providing appropriate tax recognition or relief for these additional costs. Applying the Living Standards Framework In Property Council’s view, the application of the Living Standards Framework strongly supports the development of safe, healthy and environmentally friendly buildings and structures. This is because they improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders, not just financially but more holistically. This touches on all Four Capitals of the Living Standards Framework: — Natural capital – by improving the quality of the natural environment, through buildings and structures that are efficient in their energy use and that promote a lower carbon footprint (helping New Zealand to meet its international climate change obligations). — Human capital – by enabling inhabitants (be it when they are at work, at school, or during recreation) to have peace of mind that the buildings they are occupying (in many cases for a large part of their day and lives) are safe and secure. — Social capital – buildings, unlike any other assets, are spaces for community engagement. Having confidence that the building structure is safe and environmentally sound improves not only connections between people (occupiers) but also trust in the “system” (i.e. that the Government and landlords are concerned for the common good). — Physical capital – having buildings that are resilient and economically efficient is ultimately good for “NZ Inc”. It allows Government to manage its risk, from not having to underwrite significant building non-performance in a natural disaster or fund this from existing fiscal baselines or borrowing. Similarly, business (from not having significant business disruption, which will impact their profitability and sustainability) is able to manage its risks. The business disruption as a result of the recent Kaikoura/greater Wellington earthquakes is an example of the potential economic risk. Accordingly, more resilient building stock should have a positive overall impact on NZ’s GDP and economic growth. It enables all New Zealanders to better cope with economic shocks as a result of unforeseen events. Property Council is not suggesting that the types of building expenditure outlined above are deserving of special tax treatment, although the Living Standards Framework would appear to support the case for such. Instead, the key point is that the tax policy framework should not create disincentives and distortions which actively discourages additional investment in building structures that enhance the public good by improving building safety and utility. Applying the traditional tax policy evaluation frameworks Property Council believes that the above conclusion is clear whether the Living Standard Framework, or more conventional criteria, is applied for considering the costs and benefits of a tax policy. That is, if the traditional efficiency, equity, revenue integrity/adequacy, compliance/administrative cost, and coherence axioms are applied. Economic efficiency A tax system that does not reflect the economic deprecation of business assets will not be efficient, as it economically distorts investment away from those types of assets (to less productive, but nevertheless more tax-effective, ones). At the margin, it also means that expenditure that would otherwise be incurred may not be because of the taxation cost. I.e. a non-marginal pre-tax investment becomes marginal post-tax. This is clearly not optimal from a “NZ Inc” perspective. Equity From a fairness perspective, again using depreciation as an example, there is no equity argument for treating different business assets differently. (In fact, the Tax Working Group’s objective is to ensure that all assets are treated fairly.) Property Council is aware of the argument that non-taxation of capital gains provides some support for not allowing depreciation on buildings. However, to apply this argument selectively to one asset class and not others is specious. The argument itself is flawed as other tax regimes operate tax depreciation/amortisation regimes alongside capital gain taxes. Integrity, compliance and administration costs Property Council is also concerned about the integrity of such a tax system, as it incentivises behaviours which are also not optimal from an administration or compliance viewpoint. An example is reclassification of otherwise capital (i.e. non-tax deductible) expenditure to revenue (deductible) expenses. This imposes both costs on Inland Revenue, from policing this boundary, and on taxpayers from seeking complex apportionments and advice to justify claims made. We outline below two examples to illustrate: Prior to removal of tax depreciation on buildings, many Property Council members simply depreciated “fit-out” items at the building rate. Post that change, additional measures (including a legislative definition of “fit out”) needed to be introduced to prevent, as Inland Revenue perceived it, re-characterisation of the building structure into still depreciable fit-out. That change, in Property Council’s view, reduced the integrity of the system as it introduced a new boundary which would never have existed in its absence. A similar issue arises in respect of the deductibility of “feasibility expenditure” 1 . At present, where the expenditure is incurred as part of a project to construct or acquire a building, its non- deductibility (if it is not preliminary enough in the decision making process to be a revenue expense or materially advances a particular project) makes a permanent difference to the tax treatment. Previously, if required to be capitalised, the cost while not immediately deductible would nevertheless have been able to be depreciated over time. Coherence As a matter of principle, Property Council believes that a coherent system should not have material differences in the taxation treatment of different asset classes. However, there is a difference between real and perceived coherence. We use the oft-touted lack of a capital gains tax to illustrate this. As members of the Tax Working Group would be aware, a common misconception is that absence of a capital gains tax means that all such gains are tax-free. This is simply not the case, due to specific provisions in the Income Tax Act which re-characterise capital gains as ordinary income in a number of circumstances. Many Property Council members, for example, will be acutely aware of New Zealand’s extensive rules for taxing certain land-based activities. More recently, the “bright-line” provision taxes residential investment property held for less than (previously two and now five) years. And as the terms of reference clearly point out, any form of taxation of the family home or the land sitting below it is outside the scope of the Tax Working Group’s consideration. In these circumstances, to what extent is the introduction of a general capital gains tax merely a case of “virtue signalling”, rather than a substantive reform. While this may increase perceived coherence, it is not clear that this will actually improve the system overall? Our submission considers the various practical issues of a capital gains tax in greater detail later on as that, in our view, directly affects its desirability. Current tax disincentives The key tax distortion the Property Council would like to highlight is the current tax depreciation treatment of building structures. By way of background, the previous Government removed tax depreciation on all building structures, from the 2011/12 income year. This was part of its implementation of the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group’s (the “2010 Tax Working Group”) reform recommendations. However, the specific recommendation of the 2010 Tax Working Group was: Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain categories of buildings) if empirical evidence demonstrates that they do not depreciate in value over time. (Emphasis added) At the time, Property Council engaged KPMG to carry out a detailed analysis of whether non- residential building structures depreciate (a copy of which is attached as an appendix to this submission). That included a detailed review of the international evidence, including various 1 This follows a NZ Supreme Court decision which narrowed the definition of (deductible) “feasibility expenditure”, which is not a legislatively defined concept. economic studies, and consideration of relevant qualitative factors (such as the impact on valuations of new building innovations including “green” technologies, changing occupant preferences, and technical obsolescence as evidenced by changes to building codes). The KPMG report concluded that international evidence (as well as Inland Revenue’s own analysis in 2004) overwhelmingly suggested that non-residential building structures did depreciate in value. These factors have been supplemented by the evidence of structural obsolescence following the Christchurch and Wellington/Kaikoura earthquakes, which is discussed in greater detail below. The KPMG report also highlighted that New Zealand would be an outlier internationally from removing tax depreciation on the building structure. Property Council also engaged with Inland Revenue and Treasury Officials, at the time, to provide New Zealand empirical evidence on commercial and industrial buildings, in support of the KPMG report findings. Technical obsolescence The technical obsolescence of building structures can be demonstrated by the need for a number of Property Council members to recently undertake significant seismic strengthening projects to ensure the continued economic viability of building assets. By way of an actual example, one of our members experienced first-hand the impact of structural obsolescence in relation to a commercial property located in Palmerston North. The property was assessed at 1-10% of the New Building Standard following the Canterbury earthquakes, with the tenant immediately vacating resulting in a $300,000 per annum rental stream void, and a write- down in the building value of $1.2 million. In order for the tenant to re-occupy, our member had to engage in a 15-month $1.5 million upgrade of the building structure. No tax recognition was able to be claimed for any of these costs and the costs did not increase the value of the property above its pre-seismic assessment value. There are numerous other public examples of commercial property owners having to undertake significant capital projects, and incur millions of dollars in costs, simply to maintain the capital value of their properties. While the previous approach to Officials was not successful, we understand, at least anecdotally, that the rationale for removing non-residential building structure depreciation was due to political/fiscal considerations. That is, it was necessary to partly fund the previous Government’s Budget 2010 company and personal tax changes 2 . In Property Council’s view, the 2011/12 removal of tax depreciation for non-residential building structures was therefore not a principled tax change. Building structures do depreciate. As a key objective of the current Tax Working Group is to consider fairness in the tax system, the removal of tax depreciation is explicitly counter to that objective. A further consequence of removing tax depreciation on building structures is that no tax recognition is given for landlords when faced with the decision of whether to upgrade their buildings for new structural standards (that is, earthquake strengthening). The Inland Revenue’s view is that earthquake strengthening expenditure is a capital expense 3 . This imposes all of the cost on building 2 Removal of building tax depreciation was estimated to result in a fiscal saving of over $1b, of which non- residential buildings comprised more than half. 3 This is despite strong arguments that the effect of earthquake strengthening expenditure is to bring a building to a condition where it can safely be occupied (i.e. back to its original income earning condition), rather than improving the building. This is borne out by the market value of buildings considered to be at risk owners. The capital commitment to upgrade will in the majority of cases be uneconomic, as there will be little to no financial return on the capital outlaid (i.e. it will typically not result in a higher rental stream over time) as evidenced by the example above. Financing the upgrade cost may also be an issue. This is notwithstanding there being strong public good reasons for encouraging this expenditure, let alone tax fairness considerations. Recommendation: Property Council urges the Tax Working Group to recommend the reinstatement of tax depreciation for non-residential building structures. To be clear, this recommendation would not provide landlords with a tax incentive. It is simply about reflecting the true economic cost from technical obsolescence, for tax purposes, similar to any other business asset. Therefore, reinstating tax depreciation for non-residential building structures would not be inconsistent with other reform options the Tax Working Group has been asked to consider, including a capital gains tax. Responses to specific questions in the Tax Working Group’s submissions background document We attempt to address below some of the Tax Working Group’s specific questions in its submissions background document. Please note that we have not attempted to answer all of the Tax Working Group’s questions. While these are important and relevant, we do not confess to be experts in all matters referred to in the submissions background document. Therefore, Property Council has limited its submissions to those areas where it is in a position to offer informed comment. Also, being a member-driven organisation, we are also cognisant of the need to highlight those issues which will directly affect our constituents and their investors, many of whom are ordinary New Zealanders. Question 1: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Property Council accepts that there is a strong equity (fairness) rationale for the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax in New Zealand. This is not a controversial statement. Most of the economic literature would support the inclusion of a capital gains tax, within a modern broad-based tax system. (We note there is an open question about relative taxation rates on capital and labour, from a tax efficiency perspective. However, that discussion is typically around the overall level of taxation of capital and labour, not the relative bases.) 2001 and 2010 Tax Review findings Where the theoretically sound argument for a capital gains tax becomes problematic is the inevitable real-world overlay. We note that this is the challenge that confronted both the McLeod Tax Review in 2001 and the 2010 Tax Working Group. The McLeod Tax Review’s conclusion in its final report of October 2001 4 was: 3.14 Nothing we have received by way of submissions has altered our view expressed in the Issues Paper that New Zealand should not adopt a general realisation-based capital gains tax. We believe that such a tax would not necessarily make our tax system fairer and more efficient, would not lower tax avoidance and would not raise substantial revenue that from a life safety perspective, in the event of an earthquake, being significantly reduced. Earthquake strengthening is required to simply maintain market values. 4 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf could be used to lower tax rates. Instead, any such tax would be more likely to increase the complexity and costs of our system. The experience of other countries (such as Australia, the UK and the US) supports that conclusion (Emphasis added) For completeness, we note that the McLeod Tax Review recommended that the tax system should address savings tax distortions. We note the subsequent PIE and Fair Dividend Rate taxation changes in 2007, the latter being based on the McLeod Tax Review’s Risk Free Return methodology, were an attempt to address some of the savings tax distortions. The 2010 Tax Working Group reached a broadly similar conclusion, albeit framed in the context of practical implementation issues with a capital gains tax, in its January 2010 Final Report – A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future 5 . The most comprehensive option for base-broadening, with respect to the taxation of capital, is for New Zealand to introduce a comprehensive capital gains tax. While the comprehensive nature of this option is seen as attractive and therefore its introduction is supported by some, most members of the TWG are concerned about the practical challenges and efficiency implications of introducing a CGT. These issues include the lock-in effects that can result from a realised CGT and the inherent complexity of a CGT. (Emphasis added) Design issues with a capital gains tax We discuss some of the practical challenges with implementing a capital gains tax below, as the case (or not) for such a tax cannot be separated from its design. Tax base Economists’ version of a capital gains tax is one that is comprehensive. It applies to all asset classes. However, the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference specifically excludes the family home and the land below it (which we refer to in this submission for ease of reference as “owner occupied housing”). The 2001 McLeod Tax Review initially suggested a form of capital taxation of owner occupied housing, but its final report steered well clear of this. The 2010 Tax Working Group, in its considerations, noted that a capital gains tax on owner occupied housing was not politically sustainable. This was another reason for its rejection of a capital gains tax 6 . These practicalities are also illustrated by the Labour Party’s capital gains tax proposal at the time of the 2011 and 2014 general elections, which excluded the family home, personal assets and collectibles, and certain small business assets. While this is not to suggest that those assets should be excluded, it highlights the political realities and likely lobbying for further exclusions. The issue that poses is the risk that the actual base of assets on which a potential capital gains tax can be applied will be significantly reduced. This is the real-world capital gains tax: a relatively narrow tax 5 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 6 A key concern with a CGT is the treatment of owner-occupied housing. If comprehensive base broadening is pursued through the introduction of a CGT, then in principle owner-occupied housing should be within the CGT base. However, the Group recognises that this is unlikely to be the case as evidenced by the exemptions which operate in other jurisdictions. Introducing a CGT that excludes owner-occupied housing would create a new bias in the tax system. (At page 67 of the 2010 Tax Working Group Final Report.) base. This is consistent with international evidence that capital gains taxes simply do not raise significant amounts of revenue. Realisation basis for taxation The economists’ version of a capital gains tax also supports taxing gains on an accrual (i.e. unrealised) basis. This is to address the so-called “lock-in” effect, which incentivises deferral of capital gains that are taxed on realisation. However, Property Council is not aware of any country that has an accruals based capital gains tax. (Ironically, New Zealand’s financial arrangements rules and Foreign Investment Fund regime comes the closest to replicating such a tax.) For practical reasons, therefore, a realised based tax is the norm. At a practical level, it is not clear how a realised capital gains tax could be made to work for multi- rate PIEs, including unlisted property owning investment vehicles and KiwiSaver funds. These are a not insubstantial part of the NZ savings landscape. Multi-rate PIEs are required to attribute their income to investors on a “real time” basis. These entities currently do not have to worry about realisation based taxes but would under a realised capital gains tax. This is one of the many operational issues that would need to be resolved and the answer is not simply to levy tax on an unrealised basis in these circumstances. Other design issues There are a number of other practical aspects of a capital gains tax and its application that are of concern to Property Council. — A capital gains tax will tax both real and nominal (inflationary) gains, unless indexed. For assets that are held for the long term, such as land and buildings, the effective tax rate can be expected to be significant due to taxation of inflationary gains. This will be the case even with relatively low levels of inflation. Therefore, for a capital gains tax to be fair, it should tax the non- inflationary real gain, if any. However, this adds a layer of complexity which is why a number of countries with capital gains taxes either do not index at all (which is unfair) or apply differential (i.e. discounted) tax rates as a form of inflation adjustment. This discounting itself creates potential distortions. (For example, what is the correct discount rate?) — Property Council Submits there will be double taxation if a capital gains tax applies to shares in the absence of an equivalent to the imputation regime or a “final tax” (e.g. PIE-like) regime for capital gains. A number of Property Council members are NZX-listed entities, whose shares are traded regularly, and whose shareholders would be adversely impacted if a capital gains tax that applied to disposal of the entity’s underlying property assets was not creditable at the investor level. Again, this raises questions of fairness, but the trade-off for solving it is additional administrative complexity and compliance costs for shareholders. — The submissions background document asks whether there should be “rollover” relief from a capital gains tax, if the gains are reinvested in similar assets. Property Council submits that, if a capital gains tax is recommended by the Tax Working Group, there needs to be rollover relief if the capital gain amount is not distributed to investors. Economically, that capital gain has not been realised for the benefit of investors/shareholders and should not be taxed at that point. This is particularly important if a mechanism to alleviate double taxation is not feasible and/or there is no indexation of gains, due to complexity. We note that our Property Council members who are NZX-listed entities distribute most, if not all, operating cash flows but do not distribute any realised or unrealised gains. — The submissions background document notes that if capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis, there is a strong theoretical argument for “ring-fencing” of capital losses against capital gains only. This is due to the ability to bring forward realisation of losses, and defer tax on gains. The practical impact however is that it creates an artificial boundary between normal taxable losses (e.g. arising under the current land taxing rules) and capital losses, which could be problematic (particularly if the capital gains tax rate is lower than the normal income tax rate, to adjust for some of the issues noted above, such as lack of indexation). It also results in unfairness, particularly if the prospect of future capital gains is remote (e.g. if only a single capital asset is owned and that is disposed of for a loss). Property Council submits that capital losses should be available without restriction, if a capital gains tax is introduced, for simplicity and fairness reasons. However, if rollover relief is applied, the treatment should be symmetric – i.e. there should be a deferral of capital losses in the same way capital gains are able to be rolled- over. — Finally, we note a common difficulty with a capital gains tax is its implementation. The submissions background document outlines three options: bringing in existing assets at (1) their initial cost; (2) their valuation on the date of introduction; or (3) limiting it to new assets only. There are practical difficulties with all three options. Respectively, these are: (1) over-taxation depending on how long the assets have been held prior to the application date of the tax, (2) requiring arm’s length valuations without a sale or similar event, and (3) creating a class of capital gains tax “preferred” asset. Property Council’s concern is that none of these approaches is particularly principled. Further, they lend themselves to application to assets which are considered easy to value (such as listed shares and property) to the exclusion of other assets which are considered more difficult. This would not be a principled application, in our view. Conclusion In summary, as noted above, the decision on whether or not New Zealand should adopt a “general” capital gains tax cannot be extricated from the design of such a tax. That reality, unfortunately, would appear to be far removed from the theoretical optimum for the reasons outlined above. These are the difficulties that confronted the previous tax reviews, which they were unable to satisfactorily resolve. Property Council believes these are still relevant today. For that reason, Property Council questions the overriding objective for introducing a capital gains tax. If the objective is greater fairness in the tax system, that has to be evaluated against: (1) what will be outside scope, with owner occupied housing likely to be the starting point, not the end point; (2) the complexity of ensuring that a capital gains tax does not over or double tax (i.e. inflationary gains and share gains, respectively); and (3) implementation coverage (recognising that there are no easy options). If the objective is a sustainable alternative future revenue base to fund future government spending or to offset other tax reductions, the international experience is that a capital gains tax is not a dependable revenue source as revenue flows can be highly variable. This is much more so than other tax bases 7 . This is not conducive to Government budgeting, particular if an objective is to raise 30% of New Zealand’s GDP to meet future spending commitments. Property Council therefore does not consider that the trade-offs that would be required to make a capital gains tax workable justify the fairness objective, which would be incremental at best, or the alternative tax base objective. However, Property Council acknowledges that the case for a capital gains tax (and all tax reform options) will be a balancing exercise. Views may diverge on the importance/weighting of different (and conflicting) factors. We would also emphasise the need for any recommendation to be politically sustainable over time. If a capital gains tax is supported, on balance, by the Tax Working Group If, on balance, the Tax Working Group reaches a view that a capital gains tax is an appropriate addition to the New Zealand tax system, then Property Council considers that it is imperative that the above design issues are addressed to make the regime workable. In particular, we highlight the need for: — Rollover relief to ensure that any tax is only levied on actual distribution of capital gains by an entity to its investors. — Any capital gains tax proposal to integrate fully with the current PIE taxation regime. — Capital losses to be able to be offset against ordinary income. Question 2: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? The case, as we understand it, generally put forward for a land tax is economic efficiency. The impact of a land tax is said by economists to be borne only by those who own the land at the time of introduction, with subsequent owners factoring this in by way of a lower purchase price. Note: this assumes the land tax applies on the unimproved value of land only, as applying the tax to improvements introduces inefficiency – i.e. it affects the decision to develop the land or not. A land tax is also suggested as a way of raising significant revenue. However, that assumes a universal land tax base, at low rates. This will not be the case as owner occupied housing is excluded from any potential tax base. Property Council submits this would put pressure on the rate of any land tax, to make up for any lost revenue. New Zealand’s previous experience with a land tax suffered from a narrow base. The most recent version, introduced in the early 1980s, was abolished in 1992 due to various exemptions resulting in the tax being considered uneconomic and inefficient 8 . Another major concern with a land tax is the magnitude of any reduction in the price of affected land at the time of introduction. Work done for the 2010 Tax Working Group suggested a 1% land tax could result in a fall of anywhere between 16.7% and 26.4% in affected land values (with Inland 7 For example see the volatility in Australian net capital gains income (refer Chart 1) in https://static.treasury.gov.au/uploads/sites/1/2017/06/03Clark.pdf . That paper concludes that “Volatility in CGT is a major driver of aggregate revenue volatility and revenue forecasting error”. 8 The McCaw Committee Report on tax reform noted that: In 1982, only five per cent of total land value was taxed, agricultural land being explicitly exempted and residential land effectively exempted by the exemption of $175,000 for all landowners. Revenue concluding at the time the lower estimate could be optimistic) 9 . If correct, this would be a significant de-valuation of existing assets, and is likely to create a significant economic shock. If a land tax is aimed at improving housing affordability, this may end up having a much smaller impact on residential land prices as owner-occupied housing will be excluded, but non-residential land which is not an area of concern will bear the full brunt of the price effects. This reflects the inherent unfairness of a land tax, as it targets a single class of capital asset (and non- residential land at that) and its holders. In this context, Property Council members (and their investors, which include super annuitants as well as ordinary “mums” and “dads”) would be disproportionately impacted by a land tax compared to most other taxpayers. It is unfair that investors in the non-residential property sector should be used as a further “cash cow” to fund other parts of the tax system, particularly when previous tax reforms have resulted in significant costs already being imposed on this sector. Conclusion Property Council strongly rejects the case for introducing a land tax for the reasons outlined above. For completeness we note that there was some support by members of the 2010 Tax Working Group, but this was subject to an important qualifier: a low-rate land tax as a means of funding tax rate reductions and improving the overall efficiency of the tax system. However, \[the TWG noted\] there are concerns over the political sustainability of such a tax. (Emphasis added) Question 3. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? In Chapter 6, the submissions background document notes that in previous reforms, New Zealand has eliminated land tax (considered above), estate duty, gift duty, stamp duty and cheque duty. The question is whether any of these alternative tax bases should be re-considered. Ignoring estate duties (which we understand are outside the remit of the Tax Working Group due to being an inheritance tax), both gift duty and cheque duty were abolished due to their low revenue potential relative to the compliance costs imposed. It is unlikely, in Property Council’s view, that this calculus will have changed since their repeal. Property Council notes that stamp duties are popular overseas as a way of raising tax revenue. In Australia, for example, stamp duties are a key contributor to Australian state coffers. However, a large chunk of Australian stamp duty revenue is from residential properties (approximately three quarters in 2013-14 10 ). A large part of that potential revenue base would not be available in New Zealand due to the carve-out of owner occupied housing from any tax reform. Therefore, the revenue potential (similar to a land tax excluding the land below the family home) is likely to be limited. 9 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-taxation-of-capital-gains- ird\_treasury.pdf 10 https://www.propertycouncil.com.au/Web/Content/Submissions/National/2016/Economic\_impact\_of\_stam p\_duty.aspx At the same time, studies have shown stamp duties to have particularly high economic costs. This is borne out by research conducted by the Property Council of Australia 11 . Conclusion Property Council does not believe that the re-introduction of stamp duty is warranted. Value capture taxes While not covered in the submissions background document, we note that the Government has expressed an interest in “value capture taxes”. We understand the aim of such a tax is to capture that portion of profit (in the form of any increase in value of land/improvements) to private landowners from proximity or access to public investments (such as roading, sewage and other public infrastructure). Property Council is unable to offer a view on the suitability of such a tax base, without any detail on how it may apply. If such taxes are likely to form part of the Tax Working Group’s future thinking, we would appreciate the opportunity to consider our position at the time. Question 4: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? Property Council has considered this question in the context of taxes on savings (we refer the analysis on page 39 of the submissions background document and on “tax and retirement savings” on page 26). Effective tax rate analyses for different savings options One of the questions asked is whether certain businesses are benefiting from low effective tax rates, because of non-taxation of certain types of income. While we consider Figure 21 to be a useful discussion of the different effective tax rates on different types of savings, at present, we are aware some analyses have sought to highlight the effect of the lack of a capital gains tax on property investment and have made leaps in their conclusions as a result. One such analysis claims that NZX-listed property vehicles have considerably lower effective tax rates than the NZ statutory company tax rate (and their non-property NZX-listed peers) due to the lack of a capital gains tax. This is based on fair value revaluations of the underlying properties being “income” for accounting purposes but not tax purposes. Property Council is concerned that such an analysis paints an overly simplistic and misleading picture as fair value gains/(losses) of members would not be taxable, other than in an unrealised capital gains tax world (which no country has). While this results in artificially low effective tax rates in a rising market, during the Global Financial Crisis, for example, the listed property sector had effective tax rates significantly higher than the statutory tax rate (and their NZX-listed peers), applying the same analytical approach, due to large unrealised losses. In both cases, it is incorrect to say that the effective tax rate should be a function of unrealised property gains/(losses), which are not income under any sensible measure. Our concern is such analysis has the potential to abstract from genuine debate about whether different types of savings are over-or -under taxed. 11 Ibid Non-residential property is part of a balanced savings portfolio Commercial and industrial property is an important part of a balanced savings portfolio. Property Council members, which include the NZX-listed property vehicles as well as unlisted property owning vehicles, have a range of investors. These include super annuitants and “mum” and “dad” investors, alongside institutional investors, which include KiwiSaver funds. These investors typically invest for the safe (low-risk) and consistent rental return that non- residential property investment provides, rather than capital returns (which can be volatile). In the absence of collectivised investment options provided by Property Council’s members, many New Zealanders would simply not have access to this asset class, which is important to diversify their portfolio risk (and also for New Zealand’s overall macroeconomic risk, given the overexposure of New Zealand household balance sheets to housing assets). Property Council agrees with the Tax Working Group’s statement that “there is room for improvement to make our current system \[for taxing different types of savings\] more consistent”. And that “consistent treatment should improve both fairness and efficiency”. The importance of the PIE regime to the savings tax landscape Property Council notes that the PIE taxation regime has helped collectivised commercial and industrial property investment to operate on a level tax playing field with other types of collectivised investment. It should be noted that, in the main, the objective of the PIE rules was to remove tax distortions that previously resulted in direct investment being tax advantaged relative to investing through a collective investment vehicle (in property and other assets). The tax disadvantage previously faced by collective investment vehicles included the “claw back” of amounts that would otherwise not be subject to tax at the entity level (e.g. the benefit of tax depreciation claimed) on distribution to investors. This resulted in effective over taxation of investors. Property Council believes the PIE regime is particularly important as New Zealand does not have any special regimes, such as Real Estate Investment Trust rules. (In other jurisdictions, these would allow the income of the REIT to be flowed through to be taxed at the underlying investor’s level.) The key constraint is that the Tax Working Group is unable to change the taxation treatment of owner occupied housing, which results in other forms of savings being relatively tax disadvantaged. The response should not be to further increase this disparity by, for example, reducing or removing the effect of the PIE taxation regime. That tax distortion was considered by the 2010 Savings Working Group in its report – Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities & Barriers to Growth & Prosperity 12 . One of its recommendations was to reduce the inherent over-taxation of savings by, amongst other things, broadening and rationalising the PIE regime (refer page 81 of their report). The Savings Working Group (“SWG”) made the following comment about the PIE regime: While the original justification for the PIE regime was to try to apply investors’ expected personal tax rates on their direct investment income to income from investments held through collective vehicles, from a savings perspective it can be rationalised as a mechanism for reducing tax rates on income from a broad spectrum of saving. The SWG notes the \[2010 12 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2011-02/swg-report-jan11.pdf Tax Working Group\] recommendation that the capped top PIE rate should have been aligned with the top personal marginal rate, but the SWG considers that from a savings context (and absent Nordic and similar rate reductions on savings) the top PIE rate should be maintained at a minimum of 5 percentage points below the top personal marginal rate (and preferably 10 percentage points below). (Emphasis added) Property Council strongly supports the above view of the Savings Working Group in relation to PIE tax rates. The Savings Working Group noted that most other countries apply an “Exempt -Exempt-Tax” model for taxing savings. The current PIE regime, at best, is a “Tax-tax (small t) -Exempt” model. That is, it is not a highly concessionary taxation regime. Conclusion Property Council strongly supports the PIE regime and believes the current PIE policy settings are broadly appropriate. However, per the Savings Working Group recommendations above, there may be a case for further reduction in savings tax rates, including through a reduction in the PIE tax rate.

This analysis is prepared to help answer the question: do buildings (or certain categories of buildings) depreciate? It has been prepared on behalf of the Property Council New Zealand (PCNZ), a not for profit organisation that represents New Zealand’s commercial, industrial, retail, property funds and multi unit residential property owners, managers and investors. PCNZ represents all forms of commercial property and property investment in New Zealand. Its membership ranges from NZX-listed property trusts (“LPTs”) to smaller commercial property investors. The commercial and industrial property sector is an important part of the New Zealand productive sector, providing vital infrastructure for New Zealand businesses (i.e. New Zealand Inc). 2Summary of findings We believe the answer to the question posed by the TWG: do buildings depreciate, is they do depreciate, at least in the context of non-residential buildings (i.e. commercial and industrial property), which is the focus of our analysis. This conclusion is based on: x Our understanding of the international evidence, including the various economic studies since the late 1970s which have concluded that commercial and industrial buildings broadly depreciate at rates of between 2-4% per annum. These studies were noted in an Inland Revenue and Treasury issues paper on tax depreciation, released in 2004, which concluded that buildings do depreciate. x More recent international evidence that supports officials’ 2004 analysis. These studies suggest that rates for commercial and industrial rates could be higher (and the useful lives of buildings appear to be shortening). We have not found any studies that suggest buildings do not depreciate. x Qualitative factors, such as: the high-rates of re-development of commercial buildings (particularly in the Auckland and Wellington CBD areas); changes in building technology (i.e. the need to comply with new building standards); and changing tenant preferences (i.e. “Green” buildings for Government and changes in configuration over time, due to the move from individual offices to open plan) which mean that buildings can and do economically lose value over time. Buildings also move across different segments of the market, over their economic life (a prime building in the 1970s will typically be sub-prime property today, all other things held constant). PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 3  We believe that the economic cost of removing depreciation on buildings will be borne primarily by the New Zealand business sector. This is based on a high-level breakdown of the $1.3 billion revenue estimate for removing depreciation. We understand approximately 70% of this estimate relates to non-residential property depreciation. In our view, property investors will account for a very small fraction of this (e.g. we have estimated the largest four LPTs, which are a fair representation of the New Zealand institutional property investor market, hold around 3 to 4% of the total building capital stock). The flow-on implications, from removing depreciation on buildings, will be lower quality of infrastructure (as there would be lesser incentives to reinvest in capital) or higher rents (as landlords look to recover the lost tax deductions). Neither will be a particularly desirable outcome. New Zealand would be an outlier internationally. We note that the majority of our trading partners, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United States allow depreciation on (some or all) non-residential buildings. In the race to attract and keep capital, New Zealand would be at a significant disadvantage. 3Scope of our analysis The scope of our analysis is limited to the depreciation question around non-residential buildings – broadly commercial and industrial property, such as office buildings, warehousing, manufacturing plant and shopping centres. This reflects the typical asset holdings of PCNZ members. We have not considered whether residential rental properties depreciate in value (note: hotel buildings and other buildings used for commercial residential accommodation would be treated as non-residential buildings under our definition). We note that there are different dynamics in the residential property market, the most significant being the owner-occupier versus rental dynamic, which may mean the results may be different for this sector. Our definition of building is the “shell” or physical structure. It does not encompass any chattels, including those attached to the building (such as lifts). We note that chattels are separately depreciable and would be unaffected by any changes to the depreciation of buildings. This paper also does not explicitly consider the various other property/land-centric taxing options considered by the TWG, such as a land tax or RFRM on residential property investment. The focus of this paper is purely on whether non-residential buildings depreciate, to answer the question posed by the TWG. 4Depreciation for tax purposes Depreciable property is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 as “property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 4  use in \[either\] deriving assessable income; or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving taxable income.” A number of the international studies, which are discussed later on, separate out the depreciation attributable to physical wear and tear (i.e. the deterioration in physical capacity of the building asset) with so-called economic depreciation (which relates to the ageing of an asset and is attributable to factors such as obsolescence). Depending on which type of depreciation is being discussed, the economic profile of loss in value may vary – we note the references to “one hoss- shay”, “straight-line” and “geometric” depreciation profiles in the literature. Similarly, we note that the economic literature discusses a range of available depreciation methods, including the “double declining balance” method, depending on the appropriate economic depreciation profile. The different international studies also use different methodologies – some use asset price models, which consider the price of used assets (estimating depreciation as the change in the price of the asset as it ages), while others use a retirement approach (which estimates retirements and withdrawals from the capital stock and use these to estimate the depreciation pattern and rate). Our definition of depreciation encompasses both the physical deterioration of a building and other environmental factors. As noted above, environmental factors can include changes in building technology, i.e. obsolescence, as well as changes in tenant preferences such as the configuration and internal specification of a building, which will affect a property’s value over time. We believe that our comprehensive definition is consistent with the tax definition. In summary, the value of a building is, broadly speaking, the net present value of the future cash-flows (or rents) that are expected to be derived from a property. Both physical deterioration and environmental factors will impact on this NPV calculation over time. In theory, the cost of repairing or maintaining a building should be treated as a deductible expense in the year such expenditure is incurred. However, if the work adds to or improves the asset, this may constitute capital expenditure, with the cost having to be capitalised and depreciated over future years. The issue of what constitutes repairs and maintenance and what is a capital improvement is, however, a significant area of concern which needs to be clarified. 5Separating buildings from land One popular argument for removing depreciation on buildings is that when combined land and buildings generally appreciate in value; therefore allowing tax depreciation on the structure seems unreasonable. Such an argument is a significant oversimplification. Land is not depreciable property for tax purposes. To suggest that any appreciation in the value of land is somehow a justification for denying depreciation on the structure is wrong, from a policy perspective. The two should be considered as separate issues. We note that officials have previously supported this approach. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 5  6TWG analysis No empirical data on building depreciation rates is presented in the TWG report and there is very little analysis on the costs versus benefits of removing tax depreciation on buildings. We are also unable to find any TWG background papers, prepared by Inland Revenue or Treasury, on this issue. (We discuss in the next section some analysis carried out by officials in 2004.) 6.1The rental housing tax bias The TWG’s depreciation recommendation appears to be linked to a perception by the Group that rental property investment is tax advantaged – we refer to the statement in the TWG report, widely quoted in the media, that: There is ... a very large investment in rental properties, where overall this $200 billion sector of the economy had a negative taxable return of about $500 million in 2008. In our view, the TWG’s building depreciation recommendation appears to be aimed squarely at addressing the perceived shortcomings in the taxation of residential rental housing. As noted earlier, consideration of whether residential rental investment is tax advantaged is outside the scope of our analysis. If there is an issue with the taxation treatment of rental housing, this should be addressed as a specific targeted measure. (We note, for example, that some other jurisdictions differentiate between residential and non-residential buildings, allowing tax depreciation only on the latter.) We believe a clear distinction needs to be drawn between the residential rental sector and the commercial and industrial property sector, which provides the core infrastructure for New Zealand’s businesses. In contrast to residential rental property owners, we understand the commercial and industrial property sector is a net tax payer and contributor to the New Zealand economy. Unfortunately, the perception is that all buildings should be included in the scope of any depreciation change. This is not helped by the fiscal implications being based not only on removing depreciation on residential rental properties, but all buildings – we discuss the costings in greater detail later on. This seems an illogical leap from the “solution” the TWG appears to be recommending to a very narrow problem. This is particularly so, given the various overseas studies which show that buildings do depreciate. We discuss some of this international evidence below. 7Evidence from the 2004 officials’ issues paper on depreciation Our starting point has been to revisit the 2004 Inland Revenue and Treasury officials’ issues paper,Repairs and Maintenance to the Tax Depreciation rules. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 6  The issues paper reviewed the overall coherence of the tax depreciation framework with a focus on ensuring that the overall structure of the depreciation rules is as good as is practicable and that the detailed design of the rules can cope with the complex, real-world issues that arise. Among the issues considered were the competing investment biases created by inflation and depreciation loadings in favour of long-lived and short lived assets, respectively. Chapter 5 of the issues paper considered the tax depreciation treatment of structures. A key constraint was the lack of New Zealand studies on economic depreciation of buildings and/or sufficiently robust New Zealand data for modelling depreciation on building. In the absence of New Zealand data, a number of international studies were relied upon. The key international study relied upon was Hulten and Wykoff (1980) 1 which supports the view that buildings do depreciate. Hulten and Wykoff estimated diminishing value rates of depreciation for various building types, excluding rental housing of: 2.02 percent for retail stores, 2.47 percent for offices, 2.73 percent for warehouses and 3.61 percent for factories. A paper by Fraumeni (1997) 2 is also referenced. It indicated that the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis had estimated economic depreciation rates of 3.14 percent (based on a 31- year economic life) for industrial buildings and 2.47 percent (based on a 36-year economic life) for office buildings. Other international studies considered in the issues paper were a study by Deloitte and Touche (2000) 3 , which estimated economic depreciation rates of between 2.10 and 4.48 percent for different classes of building and a survey of various studies on economic depreciation for buildings by Gravelle (2000) 4 , which concluded that buildings probably depreciate at rates in excess of 2 percent, but probably less than 4 percent. In summary, none of the international studies quoted in the issues paper found that buildings (particularly non-residential structures) do not depreciate. Officials’ conclusion (in Chapter 9 of the issues paper), expressed in the context of removing depreciation on residential rental housing, was that depreciation for buildings should not be removed: 1 The Measurement of Economic Depreciation Using Vintage Asset Prices: An application of the Box-Cox Power Transformation,Hulten, Charles R. and Franck C. Wykoff, Journal of Econometrics 15 No. 8 (April 1981). 2 The measure of depreciation in the US national income and production accounts, Bardara M. Fraumeni, Survey of Current Business, July 1997. 3 Deloitte and Touche, Analysis of the Economic and Tax Depreciation of Structures, Washington DC, June 2000. 4 Depreciation and the Taxation of Real Estate, Gravelle, J. CRS Report to Congress (October 2000). PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 7  Officials do not support the option of denying depreciation deductions for rental housing altogether, as such a measure raises a number of concerns. Property prices are typically made up of land and improvements (the asset – house – on that land and any improvements to that asset or the land itself). Denying depreciation deductions entirely might be suggested because properties often appreciate rather than depreciate, although depreciation deductions are aimed at reflecting changes in the value of improvements over time. If the overall value of a property does not change but improvements depreciate while land appreciates, failure to allow for depreciation deductions will discourage economically efficient investment in new improvements. Buildings are scrapped on occasion, and it is clear that at least these buildings have fully depreciated.The evidence presented in chapter 5 provides a rationale for some reduction to building depreciation rates but not for denying depreciation deductions altogether. \[Our emphasis added\] If the above analysis holds for rental housing, we believe it is no less applicable to non- residential buildings (it is arguably more applicable given the international evidence that commercial, retail and industrial buildings typically have higher rates of economic depreciation than residential property.) We note that concerns that the tax depreciation rate for buildings was too high, based on the international economic literature survey at the time, resulted in the 2005 rate change, from 4% to 3% (on a DV basis) (and 3% to 2% on a straight-line basis). In our view, this should be the extent of any change to the depreciation regime for non-residential buildings. We do not believe that there have been any developments since 2004 which rebut the international findings above on depreciation of buildings. (In the next section we provide some recent research which suggests that the building depreciation rate may in fact be too low in the case of commercial and industrial properties.) One of the ways forward identified in the issues paper was: “...using New Zealand data, if feasible, to test the reasonableness of depreciation rates. One option that is currently being explored is to use New Zealand valuation data on a sample of properties for which no consents for structural improvements have been given. This may be a way of finding how the value of improvements has changed over time without the data being biased as a result of structural improvements to existing properties.” Unfortunately, we note that the data issues that existed at the time of the 2004 review persist today – we discuss these constraints later on. 8Other international evidence In addition to the literature on economic depreciation rates for buildings identified in the 2004 issues paper, we have conducted a new search focusing on non-residential buildings. The results of our review are summarised below: PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 8  8.1Patry, A. (2007) Economic Depreciation and Retirement of Canadian Assets: A Comprehensive Empirical Study. Statistics Canada. Patry provides a comprehensive empirical study of the economic depreciation of a range of Canadian assets, including various types of non-residential buildings. Patry also provides a useful summary of the depreciation rate estimates from the literature (the rates for buildings are outlined in the table below) Table 2.1.1 Depreciation rate estimates from the literature (%) Range Assets/Studies Rate From To Office Buildings Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b, 1996) 2.5 Deloitte and Touche (2000) 3.5 Baum and McElhinney (1997) 1.6 2.9 Tanguay (2005) 5.9 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2002) 7.6 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2007) 7.4 Industrial Buildings Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b, 1996) 3.6 Deloitte and Touche (2000) 2.1 Tanguay (2005) 9.1 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2002) 13.0 Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan (2007) 9.7 Patry’s empirical study of Canadian assets include a breakdown of 25 various types of commercial and institutional buildings, as well as 13 types of industrial buildings. The study estimates that the average ex-ante service life (similar to our estimated useful life concept) is around 32 years for buildings (however, more recently – between 1995 and 2001 – the average service life has fallen from nearly 36 years to 28 years). The ranges of diminishing value depreciation rates for commercial buildings vary from 6.2% to 8.9% with major outliers being a 4.4% rate for religious buildings and 10.6% for post offices. The depreciation rate for industrial buildings vary in range from 7.0% to 12.6% with the major outliers being warehouses at 6.0%, mine buildings at 17.5% and bunkhouses/dormitories and camps estimated at 16.1%. (The full estimated results are available in Annex D of the Patry paper). In summary, the average depreciation rate for office buildings is found to be 5.9%, with 6.4% for shopping centres and 9.9% for manufacturing plants – refer table below. The average depreciation rate for all non-residential buildings was found to be around 7.3%.

The increases are across the board with office buildings and shopping centres depreciating at close to 6.0% per year and manufacturing facilities depreciating close to 10% (compared to 2% and 3%, respectively under the official rates). Patry concludes that a valuation bias in older buildings caused by accumulated improvements may explain the lower economic depreciation rates in the existing literature, including Hulten and Wykoff. The model used to sample the data was similar to the other depreciation literature, including Hulten and Wykoff. 8.2Baum, A. and McElhinney, A. (1997) The Causes and Effects of Depreciation in Office Buildings: a Ten Year Update This paper compares a study undertaken in 1986 by the same authors and estimates depreciation rates in office buildings in Central London ten years later. The 1986 study found that the average rate of rental depreciation of the 125 buildings in the study’s sample set was 1.1% while capital value depreciation was 1.6%. The most significant and important determinant of depreciation in rental value was found to be the configuration of the building, followed by the internal specification and external appearance (i.e. obsolescence related factors). Physical deterioration was found to be the least important. For explaining depreciation in capital value, internal specification and external appearance were most important; deterioration was again least important. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 10  In 1996, the average rental depreciation rate had increased to 2.2% with capital value depreciation increasing to 2.9%. The sample of 128 buildings included 82 buildings in the 1986 study. The highest period of depreciation in the 1996 study was found to be much earlier in the life of a building (ages 7 to 12) than in the 1986 study (ages 17 to 26 and 20 to 29 for rental and capital values, respectively). The study concludes that building lives are getting shorter (falling from around 40-45 years in 1986 to around 25 years in 1996) with depreciation for older property lower than depreciation on new property because older properties are closer to the end of their building lives and therefore close to their site (i.e. land) values. 8.3Gort, M., Greenwood J. and Rupert, P. (1999) Measuring the Rate of Technological Progress in Structures The study analyses the degree of technical progress in structures; it notes that as each decade passes new technology enables advances to be made. The study uses price data to determine the impact of technological change on building rents, the hypothesis being that newer office buildings have new and improved technologies embodied in their structures and should therefore rent for more than old ones, when holding the general physical condition of the building constant (i.e. assuming buildings are continually kept in good repair). The study concludes that the rate of structure-specific technological progress is about 1% per annum. Due to technological progress buildings eventually become obsolete and need to be replaced. Economic depreciation in the model is estimated at 6.6% (compared to 1.9% for physical depreciation). 8.4Gellatly, G., Tanguay, M. and Yan, B. (2002) An Alternative Methodology for Estimating Economic Depreciation: New Results Using a Survival Model This paper develops depreciation profiles and life assets for 8 different types of structures. Gellatly, Tanguay and Yan determine depreciation on office buildings at a rate of approximately 7.6% and industrial buildings at a rate of 13.0%. It is noted that substantial reductions in economic value are apparent early in life for many of the sampled structures. This study differs from Hulten and Wykoff, in that the model has a component included which calculates the ‘survival ratio’ of assets. It therefore incorporates the issue of retired assets, previously addressed as a limitation of Hulten and Wykoff in the work by Gravelle. 8.5Dixon, T., Crosby, N. and Law, V. (1999) A critical review of methodologies for measuring rental depreciation applied to UK commercial real estate This paper provides an analytical review of the methodologies and results of a number of past depreciation studies, including Hulten and Wykoff . The paper provides a breakdown of PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 11  depreciation rates on buildings from the studies examined and show a range of 1.1 to 3.0% for office buildings and 0.52 to 3.3% for industrial buildings. 9Summary of the additional international evidence The additional evidence outlined above confirms the results of the international studies referenced in the 2004 officials’ issues paper – namely that buildings, and specifically commercial and industrial buildings, do depreciate. Importantly, we have not come across any studies which suggest that buildings do not depreciate. While there are differing ranges for depreciation rates (and estimated useful lives) for non- residential buildings, the studies indicate that the current 3% DV rate (and 2% straight-line) rate is broadly appropriate. The recent comprehensive Patry study suggests that depreciation rates for commercial and industrial buildings should be much higher. However, we note that the consensus appears to be around the (lower) Hulten and Wykoff estimates. 10New Zealand evidence and issues One of the key constraints identified in the officials’ issues paper, which persists today is the lack of New Zealand data, or empirical analysis, on building depreciation rates. A potential concern with relying solely on international evidence may be that depreciation profiles for buildings may differ by geographic location (e.g. office buildings in London versus central Auckland or Wellington). However, we do not believe that any geographical differences would be sufficient to justify tax depreciation being removed for New Zealand buildings. This is because the factors underlying tenant (and owner-occupier) demand for non-residential buildings in New Zealand should be the same as in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the United States. We provide some qualitative analysis of the New Zealand commercial property sector below, supporting the international evidence that non-residential buildings do depreciate. This is based on our discussions with various PCNZ members on factors impacting on the New Zealand commercial and industrial property sector. 10.1Higher rates of redevelopment for commercial buildings We note that a clearly observable phenomenon with commercial buildings in New Zealand is the high rates of redevelopment (or capital reinvestment) – note for example, how few office buildings in the Auckland and Wellington CBDs are older than 30 years, let alone ones which have not undergone any significant capital improvements to the building structure. This suggests that the average useful life of a commercial building is likely to be significantly less than the 50 year economic life used to set tax depreciation rates (we note that a number of PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 12  international studies have found the average service life of buildings today to be lower than in, say, the 1980s). More importantly it shows that non-residential buildings are regularly being demolished to make way for newer buildings, when the opportunity cost exceeds the market value of an existing building. This strongly supports the assertion that these buildings depreciate due to obsolescence factors. 10.2Changes in preferences and technology impact on capital values The impact of changes in tenants’ preferences on building values can also be readily observed. By way of example, we understand the New Zealand Government has recently introduced new “Green” (energy efficiency) requirements for office buildings leased by the various Government departments. Compliance with these requirements has required significant capital improvements by commercial landlords (including a majority of the LPTs) to a number of existing buildings. Similarly, the move away from individual offices to an open plan office environment has required reconfiguration of certain structures, to meet occupiers’ needs. In the absence of these improvements, the expected return on these properties will fall significantly (in turn impacting on buildings’ capital values). Drivers of technical obsolescence, in the commercial property sector, include changes to building standards. For example, office buildings constructed in the 1980s will have had significant structural improvements to bring them up to compliance with earthquake standards. Where such improvements are not cost effective, the building would have been demolished and new earthquake standard compliant structures erected instead. In our view, the above are very real examples of the economic depreciation of buildings. 10.3Buildings move between different market segments Buildings also move across different market segments over their economic life, depending on their condition and suitability for use. For example, an office building developed in the 1970s may have been prime real estate at the time. However, if unimproved (but nevertheless reasonably maintained) the same building in 2010 will typically be sub-prime property due to changes in technology and tenants’ preferences. This lower status will be reflected in the much lower rental yields on the property compared to a newer, more technologically advanced, building. This movement of buildings across different segments of the market, over time, means that the analysis of capital values in aggregate (using for example, Quotable Value or Government valuation data) is inappropriate. Instead, the analysis needs to be done on a building by building basis, which we note would be a prohibitive exercise not least of which because the valuation data available does not separate out the value of capital expenditure over the life of a building. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 13  This makes any attempt to draw any conclusions from the changes in capital values inherently dangerous. The PCNZ has discussed in depth with CBRE, the available valuation databases to undertake empirical testing of whether buildings depreciate. Unfortunately, the databases available (i.e. QV, Government valuations, and the PCNZ Property Index) omit a number of key variables necessary to undertake any meaningful analysis. 11Impact if depreciation on non-residential buildings was removed We provide below some analysis of the potential economic impact if tax depreciation on non- residential buildings is removed. We note that a more detailed report on the merits of the TWG’s property tax proposals will be prepared by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research. 11.1Breakdown of the fiscal implications Inland Revenue’s estimate of the additional revenue that would be raised by denying depreciation deductions on buildings is $1.3 billion per annum. We understand that approximately 30% of this revenue estimate relates to denying depreciation on residential properties (i.e. rental housing investment in the tax base). 70%, or approximately $900 million, would be raised by denying depreciation deductions to owners of non-residential buildings, including members of the PCNZ. Applying a 30% tax rate, this suggests that annual depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings amount to approximately $3 billion. We understand that the costing has been constructed using Statistics New Zealand capital stock data and fixed capital formation data for the 2008 year with various assumptions around the proportion of residential and non-residential buildings in the tax base (approximately 20% and 100%, respectively). The net capital stock of residential buildings in 2008, in current prices, was valued at approximately $267 billion, while non-residential buildings comprised approximately $110 billion. We have not seen the detailed costing work, but would assume that the above estimate is likely to (perhaps significantly) overstate the additional revenue from denying depreciation on non- residential buildings. For example, we note that capital stock is valued in current prices, whereas the depreciation base is historical cost (it is unclear whether any adjustment has been made to capital stock to compensate). Also, the assumption that most, if not all, non-residential property is in the tax base discounts significant property holdings by non-taxpayers (including the charitable sector and local and central government). If the revenue impact is unclear, there is a risk of policy decisions being made without the full costs and benefits being understood. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 14  11.2The impact will be felt predominantly by New Zealand businesses The largest 4 LPTs in the New Zealand market, which can be used as a reasonable proxy for institutional investment in commercial property, hold approximately $4.1 billion (excluding land value), or around 3 to 4%, of the total stock of non-residential buildings 5 . In total, these taxpayers have annual depreciation deductions of around $65 to $70 million per annum. This comprises approximately 2% of the $3 billion gross depreciation deduction that would be disallowed under any depreciation change. This leads us to conclude that the majority of the impact from removing depreciation on non- resident buildings will be felt by New Zealand businesses that own their premises. This will result in a real cash-flow cost to these businesses (which may or may not be compensated through other tax changes). We understand that some business owners, particularly in the SME sector, own premises as a form of collateral to secure bank financing for their operations. The loss of tax depreciation could raise the cost of capital to such firms (to the extent the tax benefit of depreciation deductions reduce their net financing costs) or reduce availability of credit. It also possible that removing a tax deduction in one area will simply refocus attention on other areas (e.g. the interest deductibility rules). To the extent gearing can be increased, the same after tax return profile may be able to be achieved. This would not be desirable from an economic perspective. 11.3Impact on cost of, and investment in, commercial property infrastructure Removing depreciation on non-residential buildings will either reduce re-investment in this sector or increase rents for occupiers. Office buildings, manufacturing plant, warehousing, etc, are all part of the infrastructure of New Zealand Inc. Reduced investment in this infrastructure or a higher cost associated with its use will adversely impact on the competitiveness of New Zealand business. 12Tax depreciation treatment in other jurisdictions The appendix to this report compares the tax depreciation treatment of buildings in a number of other countries – based on a survey of KPMG’s international network of member firms on depreciation and other land taxes. We note that, as a general rule, non-residential buildings receive some depreciation tax benefits (either as an explicit tax depreciation deduction or by way of capital allowances). 5 Kiwi Income Property Trust, Goodman Property Trust, AMP NZ Office Trust, ING Property Trust, based on First NZ Capital data. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 15  In particular, we note that the majority of our trading partners, including Australia, Germany, Japan and the United States allow depreciation of (some or all) non-residential buildings. The United Kingdom currently allows depreciation in respect of industrial buildings (called an industrial building allowance); however this is to be abolished from 2011. Removing tax depreciation for non-residential buildings would make New Zealand an outlier from a global taxation perspective. At a time when countries are increasingly competing for internationally mobile capital, the New Zealand tax system needs to provide the right incentives for business to stay in New Zealand and relocate here. Removing tax depreciation, when there is clear international evidence that buildings do depreciate, would be contrary to this objective. 13Pressure on capital/revenue boundary The boundary for what is a capital expense and repairs and maintenance will need to be addressed. While an ongoing issue, currently, if maintenance expenditure (which should be deductible under ordinary principles) is not immediately expensed because it is classified as capital expenditure for tax purposes, it can nevertheless be claimed under the depreciation rules. If depreciation is removed, these amounts will be permanently non-deductible putting significant pressure on the boundary between what is, and is not, repairs and maintenance of a building. For the commercial property sector this is significant given the substantial sums that are spent on refurbishment and maintenance. 14Conclusion The findings of the 2004 officials’ issues paper, and other international research on the tax depreciation of buildings, strongly suggest that buildings do depreciate. This is also supported by various anecdotal evidence on the need to replace and improve buildings. Further we have not found any studies which suggest buildings do not depreciate. We recognise that the Government is constrained fiscally, and any changes to the tax system will need to be self-funding. Removing depreciation on buildings would seem to be an easy (or at least an easier) option, to fund changes to tax rates. We do not dispute the need for reform of the tax system to address the various anomalies in the tax system (including rental housing, if there is a tax bias there). As far as we are aware, tax depreciation on non-residential buildings was not an area of concern for the TWG. There needs to be a compelling reason for change. Removing depreciation on buildings simply to fund other changes in the tax system, when there is considerable evidence that buildings do economically depreciate, is not such a reason.

Does your jurisdiction allow depreciation on non-residential buildings to be claimed for taxation purposes and, if so, are there special rules for depreciating structures? Industrial buildings which are used for qualifying manufacturing activities can claim tax depreciation at a rate of 4% p.a. straight-line. No. Tax depreciation is only allowed for industrial buildings that are used for qualifying activities (e.g. mill, factory, manufacturing, processing, warehousing, etc – this list is defined in the Income Tax Act). Such tax depreciation is known as industrial building allowance or IBA in short. No. Previously, tax relief was available in respect of expenditure on industrial buildings (know as industrial buildings allowance) but this is now being phased out and will be shortly abolished with effect from 6th April 2011. Yes, buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis. Yes, generally, 3% (in case of a building application till 31 March 1985: 4%) or the effective time of usage or declining-balance method (exception for some old cases) Tax allowances in respect of non- residential buildings and/ or structures located in Hong Kong are available under the profits tax regime, but not the property tax regime. In Malaysia, depreciation on buildings is generally not allowable for tax purposes. However industrial building allowances (i.e. a form of tax depreciation) may be claimed on the cost of a building which qualifies as an 'industrial building'. Examples of these include, amongst others, a factory/warehouse associated with a manufacturing activity, and by extension hospitals, hotels, buildings used for research, welfare or living accommodation for workers. Note however that the Minister of Finance is empowered to prescribe a building as an 'industrial building' which will qualify for industrial building allowances and to determine the rate of the allowance as well. In general commercial or residential buildings would not qualify as 'industrial buildings'. Yes - In general, buildings (except temporary/non-durable buildings) are depreciated at the rate of not more than 5% of the acquisition cost for corporate income tax purposes. There are no special rules for depreciating buildings. Non-residential buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 39 years. IRC Section 168(b)(3)(A) Depreciation on most other types of depreciable property is claimed on a double (or in some cases 150%) declining balance method, switching to the straight line method only in the year in which the straight line method will yield a larger deduction. IRC Section 168(b)(1) 2. Does your jurisdiction allow depreciation on residential rental properties? Generally no. We had special incentives which are now being phased out which provide for tax relief on residential property that was located in certain areas No. No. Yes. For buildings used for accommodation (residential rental property), the annual straight-line depreciation rate is 2% (for buildings constructed before 1 January 1925: 2.5%) or effective time of usage. The alternative declining-balance method rates are according to the current tax law: - first 10 years: 4.00% - following 8 years: 2.50% - remaining 32 years: 1.25% The declining-balance method of depreciation is no longer available for buildings used for accommodation if the building was acquired or constructed after 1 January 2006. Residential rental properties in Hong Kong should qualify for commercial building allowances for profits tax purposes. No tax allowance, however, is available for property tax purposes. No. If the residential properties are rented out as part of the company's business, then it should be allowed a deduction for depreciation at the general rate for buildings (5% of the cost value) for the purpose of corporate tax calculations. However, depreciation deductions on residential property for personal use/non- business purpose is not permitted. Yes, residential rental properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 27.5 years. IRC Section 168(b)(3)(B) 3. Is there any restriction on offsetting losses from residential property against other types of taxable income? Rental losses can only be offset against rental income. They cannot be offset against any other type of income. Losses from residential property are generally confined to being set-off against income from residential properties. However if the taxpayer is in the trade of renting both commercial and residential properties, the losses from residential property may be set off against gains from commercial properties For an individual letting property as part of a property business, losses cannot generally be set off against general income. Limited relief is available if the loss includes a capital allowances claim. Capital allowances cannot be claimed, however, in respect of residential property, so the point would not arise. There are baskets that segregate types of income for individual tax purposes. However, generally residential losses can be offset against salary and wages income. For corporations there are no baskets and everything is essentially taxed at the full corporate rate of approximately 42%. Yes, there are restrictions concerning the usage of tax losses in case of special tax models (“Steuerstundungsmodelle”), see Section 15b ITL Besides this special regulation, the general rules are applicable including minimum taxation pursuant to Section 10d ITL, which is applicable for Corporate Income Tax purposes and Trade Tax purposes, too. For profits tax purposes, rental losses arising from residential (and non- residential) property can be offset against other types of taxable income of that taxpayer. However, if a special purpose company is incorporated to hold the property, any income/ loss of that special purpose company cannot be offset against the income/ loss of any other group entities (i.e. there is no group relief available). Losses can be carried forward indefinitely for offset against future assessable profits, but cannot be carried back. There is no restriction in offsetting losses from investments in residential property against other types of taxable income. Losses can in principle be offset against the profit of the previous year as well as the nine following years. In 2009 and 2010 a prolonged carry back facility has been introduced from one to three years. If this facility is used, the carry forward period will be decreased to six years. Generally, losses from residential property would not be available to be set off against other types of taxable income unless viewed as losses arising from a business source (in limited circumstances) Deduction for depreciation of residential property used for business purposes is limited up to the amount of taxable income in that period (loss carry forward for 5 years). Yes, with respect to individuals, estates, trusts, personal services corporations and certain closely held corporation. The passive activity loss rules under IRC Section 469 limit such a taxpayer’s ability to offset other types of income with net passive losses. Any excess loss is carried forward to the following year or years until used, or until deducted in the year such a taxpayer disposes of its entire interest in the activity in a fully taxable transaction Rental real estate is generally considered a passive activity, giving rise to passive income or passive loss, with few exceptions. An individual who actively participates in the rental business may deduct up to $25,000 of rental loss against other income, even though the loss is passive. This deduction is phased out as the individual’s income rises and is subject to various other limitations. No - there are currently no restrictions in place. In the past, there has been various speculation as to whether the 'negative gearing' benefit associated with rental properties should be abolished again (having been abolished briefly in the 1980s and then reinstated shortly thereafter in response to significant political backlash 4. Are there different tax depreciation rates depending on building type and/or use (e.g. different rates for office buildings, factories, warehouses etc.) and, if so , what are the broad categories and rates? As noted above, industrial buildings qualify at a straight-line rate of 4%p.a. unless the office/warehouse is less than 10% of the total sq footage attributed to the industrial building no tax depreciation is available. In certain circumstances, other types may qualify and for ease, I attach a copy of the Revenue publication on this. Please note that a lot of these incentive allowances are being phased out. If the building qualifies for IBA, the taxpayer may claim an initial allowance of 25% of the capital expenditure incurred in the year and an annual allowance of 3% over until the expenditure is written off. No depreciation is available. I will follow up but yes. It doesn't actually differentiate on the use but rather construction method etc. For example concrete steel construction is about 40 years. I will follow up with some details on Monday. See answer to (2) above. According to the official publication of the German fiscal authorities, there exist special depreciation rates for immovable assets (other than buildings), for example: warehouse = 16 years light-metal-designed halls = 14 years silo = 17 - 33 years Buildings or structures are broadly classified into “industrial buildings or structures” and “commercial buildings or structures”, based on their usage. Generally, industrial buildings or structures qualify for an initial allowance of 20% and annual allowances of 4% over 20 years. On the other hand, commercial buildings and structures qualify for an annual allowance of 4% on a straight-line basis, but no initial allowance With regards to industrial building allowances, the rate of initial allowance (broadly given in the year of purchase) is generally 10% of qualifying expenditure and the rate of annual allowance is generally 3%. An initial allowance is claimed in the year the capital expenditure is incurred and the annual allowance is claimed annually until the tax written-down value (TWDV) (which is equal to the cost of the asset less allowances claimed) is nil or the asset is disposed of. Note however that certain specific categories of industrial buildings qualify for increased allowances. Examples of such industrial buildings include, amongst others, a warehouse used solely for the purpose of storage of goods for export/imported goods which are to be processed and distributed/re-exported, buildings used as schools/educational instituions, builidngs used for the provision of living accomodation for individuals employed in the business and etc. There are special rates for factory buildings owned by companies whose fixed assets (excluding land) do not exceed THB 2 million and employs not more than 200 workers to have an initial deduction of 25% of the acquisition cost, with the remaining cost value deducted in accordance with the general rate (i.e., 5%). Not generally. However, certain specified types of real estate may be depreciated more quickly. It is difficult to categorize these exceptions into broad categories or rates. For example, single purpose agricultural or horticultural buildings are depreciated over 10 years, retail motor fuel outlets are depreciated over 15 years, and gas pipelines are generally depreciated over either 7 or 15 years, depending on when placed in service and where located. Other special purpose structures may be depreciated at different rates. IRC Section 168(e)(3) We can provide a more detailed list if requested. Depreciation on such buildings is generally claimed using the double-declining (or 150%) balance method, switching to the straight line method only in the year in which the straight line method will yield a larger deduction. IRC Section 168(b)(1) Refer to summary table 5. How are tax depreciation rates set (e.g. has the tax authority undertaken studies of depreciation rates for buildings, or are rates set by reference to international evidence on building rates or rates for accounting? They are set out in legislation on the above basis. (Answer N/A) N/A The underlying principle is useful life. The rates set for tax are an attempt to estimate the useful life of the building. Hence, for example wooden structures have a much shorter depreciation life than steel and concrete. Whether that is actually correct from a life perspective may be debateable but that is the underlying philosophy. In the case of listed REITs for example they seek to limit depreciation so that they can increase the amount of accounting income. In such a case they typically try and get engineering reports to show that the life is say 50 years and depreciate over the longer of the default tax life or the life detailed in the engineering report. In that case tax would use the longer rate. It is possible for tax to use longer rates as it is increasing taxable income but the limiting factor is accounting. According to our understanding, the tax depreciation rates, set by the German fiscal authorities, are based on experiences during the tax audit of the German fiscal authorities. As the tax allowances for industrial/ commercial buildings or structures have been in place for many years, we are unable to locate the consultation papers, if any, in respect of the determination of the rates of allowances. It is envisaged that further research would be necessary in order to ascertain the basis by which the tax depreciation rates are set by the tax authority. No information - requires further research The depreciation rates, when enacted, were generally intended to match useful life. The Department of the Treasury is charged, under IRC section 168(i)(1) with monitoring and analyzing actual experience with respect to all depreciable assets. We are not, however, aware of the results of such monitoring or analysis (if it has been conducted). We could conduct additional research on this point if requested. The rates are legislated in Australia's Income Tax Assessment Act. 6. Are there rules for recovery of tax depreciation when a building is sold for more that it's depreciated book value? There is a clawback of the tax depreciation claimed up to the original cost of the building and this is taxed at the trading rate (generally 12.5%). Where there is a gain in excess of the cost of the building, this is taxed at a rate of 25%. New rules have been recently introduced to tax windfall gains at 80% that arise as a result of rezoning but I can send you something on this separately if required When a building is sold, a clawback of the allowances claimed will be made N/A The depreciated value becomes the basis for determining the gain on sale. There are no special rules for a recovery of tax depreciation for Corporate and Trade Tax purposes. However, in case of a sale of immovable property that is not used for business purposes, the tax depreciation, deducted in the past, increases the capital gain on the level of the individual for German Income purposes, see Section 23 ITL. If the sales proceeds arising on the disposal of an industrial/ commercial building or structure exceed the tax written down value of the property, the excess amount (limited to the total allowances claimed in prior years) will be clawed back and treated as taxable in the year of disposal. If a building is sold for more than its book value, the profit will be taxable against a CIT rate of 25,5%. It is however, under circumstances, possible to form a reinvestment reserve. In general the reserve needs to be used with the next three years and needs to be used for the purchase of real estate which has the same economic use as the sold real estate. For Malaysian tax purposes, the disposal of a building (for which industrial building allowances have been claimed) to a third party would trigger balancing adjustments depending on the TWDV of the asset and the disposal price/market value, whichever is higher. A balancing allowance arises when the market value or the sale price of the asset exceeds the assets TWDV. A balancing charge arises when the market value or sale price of the asset exceeds the assets TWDV. However the amount of the balancing charge to be imposed will be limited to the amount of allowances claimed on the asset prior to disposal. Any gain that is in excess of original cost may attract Real Property Gains Tax where the period of ownership is less than 5 years. Depreciation recapture (the difference between book value of asset and sale price) treated as taxable income for corporate tax purposes (no separate tax on capital gains). Not generally with respect to many buildings. IRC Section 1250. Note, however, that with respect to individual taxpayers, IRC Section 1(h)(1)(D), taxes any gain realized (the amount realized in excess of the depreciated basis) at a rate 10% higher than the normal long term capital gains rate of 15%. This additional tax may be thought of as a proxy for recapture. Corporations are subject to the same tax rate on capital gains and ordinary income so the entire gain (amount realized in excess of the depreciated basis) will be taxed at the same rate. In addition, for all taxpayers, any depreciation claimed in excess of the straight line method is recaptured and taxed as ordinary income. Such excess depreciation may be claimed in the case of buildings with a useful life (depreciation period) of less than 27.5 years and in some other cases. The disposal of buildings which have been depreciated by an owner will trigger a capital gains tax (“CGT”) event. Broadly, for buildings acquired post 13 May 1997, the building depreciation claimed by the owner will reduce the CGT cost base of the building, thereby increasing the amount of taxable capital gain to effectively recapture building amortisation. There are no such adjustments for buildings acquired pre 13 May 1997. The general rule for calculating the annual depreciation for tax purposes is to take the historical cost price minus the rest value divided by the lifespan of the building. It is not allowed to depreciate on land. As of 1 January 2007, based on Dutch tax law, limited depreciation rules apply on buildings. The limitation entails that depreciation may be taken up to a certain value. For investment properties (such as residential, office and commercial real estate), this minimum depreciation value equals the value established by the municipality under the Valuation of Immovable Property Act (“WOZ”), whereas for properties used as part of one’s own business (business premises), it will equal half the value under the WOZ. It is also possible to depreciate buildings to their lower value in use. It is also possible to depreciate investments in tenancy rights. There is no fixed depreciation rate applicable. This is decided by a case to case approach and is depending on the type of real state, state of maintenance, etc. Generally speaking, the annual depreciation rate is between the 0% and 4% Yes – Australia's income tax rules allow depreciation on both residential and non-residential buildings and structural improvements (referred to as "capital works"). Broadly, the following requirements must be satisfied in order to be eligible: Ɣ the capital works must be used in a deductible way (i.e. used to produce assessable income or carry on R&D activities); Ɣ the general rule is the legal owner of the capital works is entitled to depreciate (although if the costs are incurred by a lessee, the deduction will be available to the lessee); Ɣ the deductions are not available for taxpayers who hold the capital works as trading stock; Ɣ the deductions are not available until the construction of the capital works is complete. The quantum of deductions is based on actual cost (rather than purchase price) and, upon sale, a previous owner is required to provide details regarding capital works to the new owner. Various rules regarding what type of capital expenditure qualify for eligible expenditure. The rates are outlined at Q4. PCNZ Tax Depreciation Analysis 100208.doc 18  7. Does your jurisdiction have a land tax (being an annual tax levied on the value of land)? At present we don’t have a land tax though rates are paid annually to the local county council. There’s property tax in Singapore. This tax is on all immovable properties in Singapore (land and buildings). Its currently at 10% of the annual value of the property. The annual value is the average annual rent that the property can fetch in the market. Local business rates are payable by the occupiers of commercial property (and council tax in respect of residential properties) Yes but they also levy one on the building portion. Every land and building (and apartment) in Japan has what we call a fixed assets tax assessment value. This is the basis for the charge. For land is not necessarily a reflection of the market price as it is done using a benchmark piece of land (which is valued) and adjustments are made based on a prescribed formula. In most cases it will be less than the actual value (for land). For buildings the value is based on the materials used and a rule of thumb is that the value is 70-80% of what it cost to build. This can be a real problem where you have something where the builder went overboard and you buy cheap because the assessment value does not change just because the asset is sold at a price significantly lower than its assessment value. One other thing that is useful to keep in mind in the context of Japan is that buildings (particularly residential but also true of office and other asset classes) have typically not been made to Yes. There is no land tax in Hong Kong. However, rates are charged at a percentage (currently 5%) of the rateable value and, for properties in the certain regions of Hong Kong with Government leases granted on or after 27 May 1985, Government rent calculated at 3% of the rateable value of the properties is also payable. The rates for the first two quarters of the 2009/10 financial year (i.e. the quarters ended 30 June and 30 September 2009) have been waived, subject to a ceiling of HK$1,500 per quarter. Based on Dutch tax law, land tax does not exist. There is however a property tax, based on the above mentioned WOZ value which is annually established by each municipality. In Malaysia there is property tax in the form of assessment rates and quit rent which are levied at varying rates. The amount of assessment tax and classification of properties varies from one local authority to another and the basis for calculating assessment tax may also differ from state to state. The amount of quit rent also varies from state to state. Yes - a House and Land tax is levied at the rate of 12.5% of the assessed rental value of the property. There are also land transfer fees/tax on the transfer of immovable property In the United States, property tax on real estate (an annual tax levied on the value of real estate, including land and buildings) is levied by local government, usually at the municipal or county level. The federal and state governments do not levy property tax. Yes – each Australian State and the Australian Capital Territory imposes annual land tax, payable on the unimproved value of land at certain dates. The rates vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. last. This is changing now but when you buy residential there is in fact a significant discount in most cases for older buildingsIn fact for residential houses the building is often not assigned any value where it is older and people just look at land value. Office too has tended to age very significantly in Japan. In that context it is very different from New Zealand (which I am assuming is like Australia) in that older houses in Japan are typically assigned no value. There are obviously exceptions where for example the building has some historical value but most of the home builders have not built things to last like they do in New Zealand. One of the reasons for this is to keep things turning over and the other is that they tend to spend a lot more money on gadgets in the home than western countries and the gadgets tend to age. The other is simply that the house is more integrated with the various attachments (rather than being more of a shell the inside of which can be updated).

Our analysis 1 shows that these recommendations: (i) Are inconsistent with the ‘good tax policy’ criteria set out by the Tax Working Group. (ii) May work against over-riding government objectives to become more internationally competitive in order to close the income gap with Australia by 2025. Removing depreciation on buildings would raise tax expenses for businesses. It would increase the effective marginal corporate tax rate from 30% to 32%. This is clearly against the Tax Working Group’s “critical concern” that “New Zealand relies heavily on taxes most harmful to growth – particularly corporate and personal taxes on capital.” In addition, depreciation of commercial buildings is common practice in the OECD. Removing depreciation in New Zealand would make us an outlier and reduce our international tax competitiveness. This could hamper already weak foreign direct investment into New Zealand, the health of the local capital market and erode export competitiveness. This is clearly counter to government policy objectives of making New Zealand a more internationally competitive economy and would place us at a further disadvantage to Australia. A land tax would be efficient and fair only if broadly and uniformly applied. New Zealand has a long history of land taxes beginning in the late 1800s. Exemptions and reductions have made land taxes politically unsustainable. They were finally repealed in 1990. We see no reason why a land tax in the future should be any more politically sustainable, particularly given the strong views of key stakeholder groups such as farmers, retirees and Iwi. A land tax would also impact on land prices. This would impact on banks – at least 2/3 of bank lending is to land based and housing segments. This could impact on the cost and availability of capital - and consequently on economic growth – perhaps for a protracted period. Our initial analysis strongly suggests that far more detailed analysis and rigorous debate is required before these ideas progress further. Otherwise potentially damaging policy decisions could be made. 1 Our analysis looks at these policy suggestions in isolation and not in the context of potentially offsetting policies.

Introduction The Property Council of New Zealand (PCNZ) has engaged NZIER to assess the merits of certain policy recommendations by the Tax Working Group (Buckle et al, 2010). We consider the merits of two particular recommendations in this report:  “Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain category of buildings) if empirical evidence shows that they do not depreciate in value.”  “...introduction of a low-rate land tax as a means of funding other tax rate reductions.” 2. Removing tax depreciation on commercial buildings “Removing tax depreciation on buildings (or certain category of buildings) if empirical evidence shows that they do not depreciate in value.” We assume that tax depreciation is removed from commercial property. Our analysis shows that:  depreciation of commercial buildings is common practice among OECD countries  removal of depreciation on commercial buildings would effectively increase the marginal corporate tax rate from 30.0% to 32.1%  to keep the tax bill for businesses the same, the corporate tax rate would have to be cut from 30.0% to 28.0%. The removal of commercial property depreciation would:  raise tax costs, which is clearly against the Tax Working Group’s “critical concern” that “New Zealand relies heavily on taxes most harmful to growth – particularly corporate and personal taxes on capital.”  violate some of the key criteria set out by the TWG, in particular economic efficiency and growth by reducing the incentive to invest  violate one of the key objectives of the Capital Market Development Taskforce (CMD) by effectively raising the cost of capital  violate the spirit and intent of the CMD and 2025 Taskforces by reducing New Zealand’s international competitiveness, by removing depreciation which is commonly in place in the OECD. 2.1 Depreciation of buildings common in the OECD A compilation of OECD country tax practices, summarised in Figures 1 and 2, show that New Zealand is similar to the OECD in the treatment of building tax depreciation. The real divergences appear to be in the absence of a capital gains tax, harmonisation of various tax rates and a higher value added tax. The analysis of OECD countries suggest New Zealand’s current rules on building depreciation are the norm. Removing this depreciation would impose a cost on New Zealand businesses that is not commonly found in the OECD. New Zealand would be less competitive in the global scene, and in particular less attractive relative to our NZIER – Depreciation and land tax 2 closest competitor Australia. New Zealand already allows less depreciation on buildings (2%) than Australia (2.5%-4.0%). This has the potential to weigh on foreign direct investment into New Zealand (which is already low).

The effect of depreciation is to reduce the tax burden (by reducing the taxable income by the depreciation amount) and lift after tax cash income. Removing depreciation on buildings would lift the effective corporate tax rate from 30% to 32%. Removing all depreciation (not just buildings) would lift the effective corporate tax rate to 42%. 2.2.1 Removing building depreciation lifts effective tax rate to 32% We estimate the removal of commercial building depreciation would levy large costs on New Zealand business (around $1 billion in 2008). This equates to effectively increasing the marginal corporate tax rate from 30.0% to 32.1%. Keeping the business tax bill the same would require a corporate tax rate of 28.0%.

While due care has been taken, the estimates are illustrative. We estimate the 2008 building depreciation amount by assuming it is 3% of the market value of non-residential buildings (the statutory rate is 4%, but this applies to historical cost, not market value). All data in Figure 3 relate to all businesses in New Zealand as recorded by Statistics New Zealand in the 2008 Annual Enterprise Survey. 2.2.2 Removing all depreciation lifts effective tax rate to 42% We also analysed a scenario where all depreciation is removed. While this was not a recommendation of the TWG report, it serves to highlight the significant divergences between industries. Capital intense buildings may face marginal tax rates in excess of 50%. Without any depreciation net cash income by businesses in 2008 would be $6b (or 11%) lower. This equates to an increase in the marginal tax rate from 30.0% to 42.2%. Supporting tables can be found in Appendix A. NZIER – Depreciation and land tax 5 2.3 Assessment against criteria Removing depreciation on commercial property does not stack up against the criteria and objectives set out by the TWG, Capital Market Development Taskforce and 2025 Taskforce. We consider the policy in isolation and not in the context of potentially offsetting policies. Figure 4: Stacked against criteria Group and criteria Meet? Comments Tax working group Efficiency and growth N Reduce economic efficiency and growth. Depreciation allowance typically promotes investment in capital. New Zealand’s low productivity growth and demise in economic leader-boards is in part explained by low capital intensity. Policies that discourage investment can be detrimental to economic growth. Equity and fairness N Puts NZ businesses at a disadvantage in an international context, given depreciation of buildings is generally allowed offshore. Fair within a domestic context as it does not discriminate by property type. Revenue integrity Y Removal of depreciation allowance on property would reduce a bias in investment in residential property. Fiscal cost Y Raise revenue by around $1.3b (about $1b from commercial property). Compliance and administration cost Y Would likely reduce compliance and administration. Coherence N Removal of depreciation on commercial property would move NZ away from the 'norm' in the OECD, and importantly Australia. Capital market development workforce Minimise the cost of capital N Removing depreciation would reduce future income from investments in property (due to reduced future income streams) and lower NPV (due to lower cash-flows in early years). This means the required rate of return for a given investment would rise. Capital flows to most valuable uses N This would create an artificial distortion to invest in other forms of assets (such as plant and machinery) relative to property. This is against the intent of a level playing field for all investments. 2025 Taskforce Sharpening private incentives to invest, to save and to work N Removing depreciation reduces the incentive to invest, as it lowers the future stream of income from the asset.

Imposing a low-rate land tax “A land tax is a highly efficient tax mechanism which could be introduced as part of a package of reforms to the New Zealand tax system.” (Policy advice division, IRD and The Treasury, 2009). A land tax is only efficient if it is applied broadly and uniformly. In the event of exemptions, the tax ceases to be efficient and becomes distortionary with economic costs. While it may begin as a broad and exemption-free tax, New Zealand’s long history of land taxes shows (Figure 5) that tinkering and changes are difficult to resist. A land tax would be a burden for the asset-rich-cash-poor segments of society, including farmers, Iwi and retirees. A greater immediate concern would be a loss of land value and its impact on the banking system. At least 2/3 of bank lending is to land based industries and residential property, so the impact on availability and cost of credit and the economy may be large. The land tax only stacks up under very special circumstances. Looking at it objectively against the criteria set out by the TWG, CMD Taskforce and the 2025 Taskforce, it seems unlikely that the main criteria can be satisfied over a reasonable timeframe. 3.1 Long history of land taxes New Zealand has a long history of land taxes. These became smaller through time as other taxes were introduced and exemptions were created. Even if introduced in a efficient fashion now, it is unclear if it can be politically sustainable.

In particular, the policies need to be applied broadly and uniformly. Otherwise, distortions create economic loss. Even if enacted as such in the beginning, it is unclear if it can remain free from political interference in the future. More worrying is the prospect of land value declines and the impact on the banking sector. This could impact on the cost and availability of capital and restrain economic growth for a protracted period of time. Group and criteria Meet? Comments Tax working group Efficiency and growth N A land tax would be efficient only if applied uniformly. This is unlikely over the medium term given vote-sensitive and asset-rich- cash-poor segments such as farms, Iwi and retirees. In the presence of exemptions the tax would be inefficient and distortionary. There could be a large impact on the banking sector, with at least 2/3 of their loans to land based industries and housing. This could raise the cost and availability of capital, weighing on future economic growth. Equity and fairness N It would be equitable and fair only if applied uniformly. However, it would adversely impact on the groups identified above. In the presence of exemptions, as happened historically, the tax would not meet this criterion. Revenue integrity Y If properly implemented revenue integrity should be maintained. Fiscal cost Maybe The impact is ambiguous, as it would depend on the rate of tax, if the tax is a deductible expense and how much land prices fall. There may also be wider financial and economic ramifications which cannot be predicted accurately. Compliance and administration cost Maybe Would likely reduce compliance and administration. Coherence N Only targets one class of wealth and is thus not coherent. Capital market development workforce Minimise the cost of capital N Declines in land prices could impact on the banking sector and thus the cost of capital. Capital flows to most valuable uses N Creates a distorting incentive to hold wealth in assets other than land. 2025 Taskforce Sharpening private incentives to invest, to save and to work N Creates a distorting incentive to hold wealth in assets other than land.

Page 1 of 4 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission: The Future of Tax Organisation background: Active West Coast (AWC) is a network of agencies and groups committed to improving the health of West Coasters through the promotion of healthy lifestyles such as increased physical activity, improved nutrition, living smokefree, youth and older person’s health. While member organisations were involved in preparing this submission, the recommendations in their entirety, do not necessarily reflect the views of each individual agency. In recent years AWC has made submissions to the Law Commission’s Alcohol in Our Lives – Curbing the Harm Report, the Safer Journeys Road Safety Strategy, and the Alcohol Reform Bill. One of our goals is to reduce alcohol-related harm in West Coast communities by creating environments that limit opportunity for such harm. AWC notes the breadth of The Future of Tax discussion paper but will confine our comments to particular matters of current concern to this group. • We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. • We applaud the holistic approach taken to consider The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four capital stocks and associated flows as a public policy direction for considering how taxes might more fairly support these wider wellbeing measures. 1. Regulatory mechanisms that are fair, universal, and drive public good outcomes are the most effective tool for increasing social and economic wellbeing throughout Aotearoa. 2. AWC also notes the success of targeted taxes that act as a behaviour modifier, in particular, on both alcohol and tobacco, where these products cause considerable costs to wider society beyond that borne by the individual consumer. Contact Name: Rosie McGrath Organisation: Active West Coast \[1\] Page 2 of 4 3. A matter of ongoing concern for us on the West Coast is the normalised culture of both heavy and hazardous alcohol consumption as well as the significantly higher number of alcohol outlets in comparison to the rest of New Zealand. This not only leads to negative impacts for individual drinkers, but also wider social/economic costs for whanau, NGO social services, and government agencies. 4. We note also that these costs are unfairly spread across particular cohorts in our West Coast communities, including between Māori and non-Māori. West Coasters have a low median income compared to the rest of New Zealand. We strongly support a continued focus on opportunities to rebalance tax measures that will reduce inequities associated with low wage earnings as well as particular discretionary spending choices to further reduce uptake (tobacco and alcohol). In addition we need to ensure the tax-take on these particular trading activities meets the true related costs of associated harms that unfairly fall upon us all. Alcohol pricing 5. The current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of adult New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with the wider costs to society of alcohol-related harm. The government receives excise tax from alcohol ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). 6. Further, New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). This anomalous situation needs to be addressed. It is the alcohol content that causes the harm. 7. AWC supports the introduction of the World Health Organisation’s policy directives on ending the availability of cheap alcohol as a mechanism to reduce alcohol-related harm. As with tobacco, and all products, price has a direct impact on demand. The Alcohol in Our Lives document 1 notes that alcohol consumption, alcohol-related offences and anti-social behaviour have all increased as alcohol has become more affordable relative to our income. 8. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol- related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Of 1 Alcohol in Our Lives Issues Paper 15 (2009) http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20IP15.p Page 3 of 4 particular concern is the increasing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. 9. Specific measures to target heavy drinkers would significantly reduce inequalities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Further, low income heavy drinkers would benefit the most when the price of alcohol is increased. 10. All alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. AWC believes a Minimum Unit Pricing policy would achieve this aim. AWC recommends the following: 11. That alcohol excise rates are increased by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; 12. That excise tax on alcohol products under 2.5% by volume be removed to promote consumption of low alcohol products. 13. That the excise rates on alcohol are adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); 14. That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%; 15. That a minimum price per standard unit of alcohol be introduced. We believe that introduction of the above measures are achievable and crucial steps to achieving the objectives of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012, as well as necessary to moving us all forward in support of a fairer and more equitable society. Sugary drinks 16. We suggest government gives active consideration to extending the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier and to address the alarming rise of pre- diabetes and current diabetes incidence and associated management costs. We understand these costs will escalate even further if we take no action now as a society to forestall these avoidable impacts on wellbeing, employment capability, and life years lost. Page 4 of 4 AWC recommends the following: 17. That a tax on sugary drinks and other high sugar content products be actively considered. Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback to this issue. We do not seek to speak to the committee in further support our submission.

Page 1 of 4 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission: The Future of Tax Organisation background: Active West Coast (AWC) is a network of agencies and groups committed to improving the health of West Coasters through the promotion of healthy lifestyles such as increased physical activity, improved nutrition, living smokefree, youth and older person’s health. While member organisations were involved in preparing this submission, the recommendations in their entirety, do not necessarily reflect the views of each individual agency. In recent years AWC has made submissions to the Law Commission’s Alcohol in Our Lives – Curbing the Harm Report, the Safer Journeys Road Safety Strategy, and the Alcohol Reform Bill. One of our goals is to reduce alcohol-related harm in West Coast communities by creating environments that limit opportunity for such harm. AWC notes the breadth of The Future of Tax discussion paper but will confine our comments to particular matters of current concern to this group.  We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders.  We applaud the holistic approach taken to consider The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four capital stocks and associated flows as a public policy direction for considering how taxes might more fairly support these wider wellbeing measures. 1. Regulatory mechanisms that are fair, universal, and drive public good outcomes are the most effective tool for increasing social and economic wellbeing throughout Aotearoa. 2. AWC also notes the success of targeted taxes that act as a behaviour modifier, in particular, on both alcohol and tobacco, where these products cause considerable costs to wider society beyond that borne by the individual consumer. Contact Name: Rosie McGrath Organisation: Active West Coast Email: \[1\] Page 2 of 4 3. A matter of ongoing concern for us on the West Coast is the normalised culture of both heavy and hazardous alcohol consumption as well as the significantly higher number of alcohol outlets in comparison to the rest of New Zealand. This not only leads to negative impacts for individual drinkers, but also wider social/economic costs for whanau, NGO social services, and government agencies. 4. We note also that these costs are unfairly spread across particular cohorts in our West Coast communities, including between Māori and non-Māori. West Coasters have a low median income compared to the rest of New Zealand. We strongly support a continued focus on opportunities to rebalance tax measures that will reduce inequities associated with low wage earnings as well as particular discretionary spending choices to further reduce uptake (tobacco and alcohol). In addition we need to ensure the tax-take on these particular trading activities meets the true related costs of associated harms that unfairly fall upon us all. Alcohol pricing 5. The current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of adult New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with the wider costs to society of alcohol-related harm. The government receives excise tax from alcohol ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). 6. Further, New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). This anomalous situation needs to be addressed. It is the alcohol content that causes the harm. 7. AWC supports the introduction of the World Health Organisation’s policy directives on ending the availability of cheap alcohol as a mechanism to reduce alcohol-related harm. As with tobacco, and all products, price has a direct impact on demand. The Alcohol in Our Lives document 1 notes that alcohol consumption, alcohol-related offences and anti-social behaviour have all increased as alcohol has become more affordable relative to our income. 8. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol- related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Of 1 Alcohol in Our Lives Issues Paper 15 (2009) http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20IP15.p Page 3 of 4 particular concern is the increasing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. 9. Specific measures to target heavy drinkers would significantly reduce inequalities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Further, low income heavy drinkers would benefit the most when the price of alcohol is increased. 10. All alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. AWC believes a Minimum Unit Pricing policy would achieve this aim. AWC recommends the following: 11. That alcohol excise rates are increased by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; 12. That excise tax on alcohol products under 2.5% by volume be removed to promote consumption of low alcohol products. 13. That the excise rates on alcohol are adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); 14. That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%; 15. That a minimum price per standard unit of alcohol be introduced. We believe that introduction of the above measures are achievable and crucial steps to achieving the objectives of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012, as well as necessary to moving us all forward in support of a fairer and more equitable society. Sugary drinks 16. We suggest government gives active consideration to extending the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier and to address the alarming rise of pre- diabetes and current diabetes incidence and associated management costs. We understand these costs will escalate even further if we take no action now as a society to forestall these avoidable impacts on wellbeing, employment capability, and life years lost. Page 4 of 4 AWC recommends the following: 17. That a tax on sugary drinks and other high sugar content products be actively considered. Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback to this issue. We do not seek to speak to the committee in further support our submission.

Capital Flow of Investments The current tax system puts too much investment emphasis on horticultural/farming and residential property. New Zealand is a fast growing first world country. Growth has been derived from a number of different sources in recent years. Namely, I.T., Financial Services, Tourism, Pharmaceuticals, and niche primary industry value added products, to name a few. The Tax system needs to encourage investment in these areas to facilitate a faster rate of growth and innovation. This can be facilitated through the reduction or removal of tax breaks to specific sectors mentioned above where the effective tax burden is much less than other alternative investments. E.g. residential investment property vs NZ bonds. ‘Kiwi Ingenuity’ is a term that is frequently used in the media. There is no doubt as a country we try to think outside the square to find solutions and have done so for 170 years pioneering many worlds firsts. This view can further facilitate change by encouraging an entrepreneurial way of thinking backed by a fair and equitable tax system. Investment into some sectors such as residential, horticultural and agricultural property is unfairly encouraged due to the taxable income being low and the expected tax free capital gain being high. This creates an uneven playing field with regard to the allocation of investment capital and encourages perverse investment behaviour which lessens the New Zealand's economic resilience to cyclical shocks. The fair and equitable solution is to introduce a capital gains tax to level the playing field whilst at the same time lessening the burden of middle income earnings shouldering the burden of growth 2. KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is the only integrated instrument available to the New Zealand public as a method of retirement planning (excluding NZ Super). For this reason, the focus of this part of our submission will be on improving KiwiSaver from a tax perspective. The NZ public in general is quite apathetic to KiwiSaver. History has seen the Government place less emphasis on it in terms of incentivising investment. The original Member Tax Credit (MTC) has been halved and the $1,000 kick-start payment has been abolished. What has happened in parallel with these changes is that the cost has been placed on the employer in the form of increased contributions. This approach has had added fuel to the public’s view that KiwiSaver is not something to focus on. The strategy on KiwiSaver needs to refocus on its goal towards retirement planning and social responsibility rather then as an investment solution. A simple remedy would be to net off employee contributions to KiwiSaver in a tax return. This would bring NZ in line with many other OECD countries. The objective is to contribute to the Error!

The current system encourages capping contributions at $1,042.86 to avail of all benefits available. Netting off KiwiSaver contributions against gross income incentivises the KiwiSaver member to exceed the contributions limit which benefits the member and society as a whole. The current system taxes a person under the PAYE framework then treats the contribution as an investment (rather than through a retirement lens) and taxes again under the PIR framework. This does not feel right when planning for retirement. Granted, the revenue from tax will decrease but this needs to be viewed in conjunction with creating an environment whereby residents of this country are protected into their retirement. The vast majority of New Zealand residents do not have the relevant experience to make informed decisions about retirement. As Kiwi's continue to live longer at 1.2 years per decade, Tax policy needs to assist in this area and would greatly assist in an evitable transition from universal State sponsored superannuation to the individual.

Thompson 1 April 2018 1) Introductory comment The Better Public Media Trust appreciates the opportunity to submit some observations on the Future of Tax consultation. The focus of our submission reflects our sphere of interest, namely taxation for the purposes of supporting public media provisions. However, we hope that some of the comments and arguments will help inform the Tax Working Group’s deliberations on more general taxation issues. This submission briefly sets out the policy pretext for expanding public funding support for public interest media, i.e. communications media which function primarily to engage and inform us as citizens, not just entertain us as consumers. It then presents a set of principles and criteria which could guide the formulation and implementation of government funding arrangements for public media. Several funding mechanisms are then outlined, with particular attention paid to the normative and practical arguments for a marginal levy system which would generate funding for public media through a hypothecated tax imposed at a low level across a wide range of commercial media turnovers. 2) The digital media context The rapid proliferation of digital media forms over the past two decades has engendered two dubious assumptions; a) that the digital media market offers an unlimited range of choice, and b) that this obviates the any need for traditional ‘public service’ media provisions. Superficially, it is certainly true that there has been an expansion of online services and new platforms and devices for distributing/ accessing content on-demand. However, that the digital media market continues to under-provide several key genres of content (e.g. local programming for young people, educational content, programming catering for minority communities, etc.). Meanwhile, as competition for audience eyeballs and clicks has intensified across different platforms, the opportunity costs of maintaining a diverse range of content have increased. At the same time, an increasing proportion of advertising revenue is 1 Dr. Peter Thompson is a senior lecturer in media at Victoria University of Wellington and Chair of the Better Public Media Trust. 2 being co-opted by social media and content discovery platforms (notably Facebook and Google) which contribute minimally to production costs. This has weakened the business models of some traditional media, particularly newspapers 2 . A recent series of multi-stakeholder workshops on Civics and Media 3 identified a common concern about the decline of in-depth, investigative news/current affairs and other factual /educational content which is not commercially viable, but which citizens need participate meaningfully in public life. Deregulation, convergence and financialized shareholding have obliged many media operators to re-evaluate their business models. Traditional media platforms are finding that the audience ‘eyeballs’ and advertising revenues which they used to dominate have begun to fragment as new services have emerged. For the private media sector, pressure from offshore shareholders to maintain profits and capital value imposes unprecedented commercial pressures on content producers, increasing their reluctance to take commercial risks or tolerate opportunity costs. Amidst digital plenty, market failures remain evident. Although the commercial news sector has normally been skeptical toward arguments for state subsidies of the media, some are now suggesting that they ought to be eligible for public funding 4 . Non-commercial public media like RNZ or Maori Television Service can more readily absorb the opportunity cost of investing in quality content and catering for a wider range of audience demographics, but their level of public subsidy is low by international standards. Although the new Labour-led coalition government has indicated it intends to increase public media funding, with $38m the figure suggested in pre-election commitments, New Zealand’s per capita spend on public media services will still lag well behind comparable western countries 5 . Previous ministers of broadcasting have often insisted that they simply have insufficient budget allocations to provide additional services, even if they agree these are desirable. Even when governments do recognize the need to commit funding to public media provisions, intra-cabinet wrangling over vote portfolio allocations 6 often results in sub-optimum policy compromises as the archetypical hip operations typically win priority over less tangible cultural and democratic policy 22 Between 2004-2014, the newspaper sector’s share of advertising has almost halved, dropping from $833m (37.2%) in 2005 to $484m (20.3%). 3 Civics & Media Project proceedings (2016) http://www.mcguinnessinstitute.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/02/20170227-Civics-and-Media-Booklet-WEB.pdf See also www.civicsandmediaprojectnz.org 4 The Daily Blog (2015, April 12) Table Talk- Making Sense of the Campbell Live Affair.

There is therefore a particularly strong rationale for considering new models of taxation and finding which would enable public media provisions to be funded adequately and sustainably. 3) Characteristics of effective public media funding mechanisms 7 : This section lists a range of principles which increase the legitimacy, sustainability and efficacy of public media funding mechanisms. No single mechanism would simultaneously satisfy all these criteria, but the list may be helpful in comparing and contrasting alternative funding mechanisms, including taxation/levy models. 1. Clear specification of desired functions and outcomes beyond commercial norm. 2. Sufficient levels proportionate to functions and desired outcomes 3. Transparent and accountable mechanisms, valid performance measures, potentially revocable. 4. Insulation of content production/commissioning decisions from commercial or political pressures. 5. Relevant to the local media ecology and available at the point in the value chain most vulnerable to market failure. 6. Sufficient level of funding to off-set opportunity costs inhibiting provision of desired content forms on a commercial basis. 7. Directed primarily (although not exclusively) towards outputs/outcomes under- provided by private commercial media. 8. Avoids distortion of fair market competition where public media also compete directly for substitutable audiences and commercial revenues with private sector rivals. 9. Legitimacy among stakeholders including public recognition of civic benefits even if they are not consumers of the services funded. 10. Independence from bureaucratic capture and over-proximity/ dependence on clients/beneficiaries for legitimacy/political justification. 11. Subject to periodic review of levels, functionality and proportionality by an independent body. 12. Hypothecation/ringfencing to insulate funding levels from the need for annual budget contestation 13. Fiscal neutrality, i.e. no impact on existing government consolidated funds. 14. Costs incurred by industry transferrable to consumers with minimal transaction costs. 15. Minimal and proportional costs incurred by consumers/end users of media services. 16. Costs incurred by industry are more likely to be accepted if there is scope for the industry to benefit either by direct reinvestment (e.g. contestable content funding or infrastructure development subsidies). 17. Costs incurred by consumers are more acceptable if the consumer perceives that the funding confers at least some personal benefit as well as wider social benefit. 7 See http://www.mch.govt.nz/sites/default/files/MCH-OECD-Funding-Report.pdf and http://www.victoria.ac.nz/seftms/about/staff/peter- thompson/Show\_Me\_the\_Money\_Thompson-SPADA\_2011.pdf 4 4) Characteristics of alternative funding mechanisms to support enhanced public interest media in New Zealand: This section outlines the basic characteristics of six different funding models for public media provisions. The emphasis here is on the generation/procurement of the funding rather than the functions/outcomes to which the funds might be put- that is a much broader public policy debate. A) Government appropriation model (i.e. from regular taxation via the consolidated fund) • Relatively simple to implement as part of the routine Vote allocations to ministerial portfolios. • Can be provided as a direct mechanism to a specified service provider (e.g. Crown funding of the Maori television service) an indirect mechanism through an arm’s-length agency (e.g. NZ On Air funding for RNZ) or as a contestable mechanism through an arm’s-length agency (e.g. NZ On Air and TMP contestable funds). • Passive mechanism that does not require active collection/transaction by public or industry (although the contestable funding option requires applications from those seeking funds). • Levels and periodicity can be determined in annual budget rounds (e.g. appropriations could be committed for a 3-year term to support medium term planning). • Non-hypothecated (ringfenced) and non-statutory appropriations are subject to revision as policy priorities change or new government are elected. B) License fee model • Would entail reintroduction of a fee payable either by households or device- users. Fee could be collected either directly by the PSM provider (BBC model), indirectly by a funding agency (NZ On Air model 1989-99) or ‘piggy backed’ on household rates or utilities billing (see Greek and Turkish models). • Revenue could be disbursed on a contestable basis through a funding agency (NZ On Air model 1989-99) or directly to designated public media provider(s) (original NZBC/BCNZ model). • There is potential for development of new models of license payment for bundles of content (e.g. combination of print/online/broadcast content). • Clear link between the paying public and service provider receiving the funding. • Hypothecation (ringfencing) avoids annual budget negotiations and, if statutory, prevent immediate revocation by incoming government thus allowing longer-term planning. • Public obligation to pay for services in an environment of increasing choice of subscription services for premium content would engender resentment unless the services provided were valued by a majority of the public. Several countries which did have a license fee have discontinued it (including New Zealand). • If a licence fee mechanism also provided access to additional media services valued by the public (e.g. subscriber video on-demand) then it is likely that the 5 proportion of the fee that was allocated to more niche public services would be far less contentious. Put simply, paying a licence fee which provided only niche/minority content would be resented, but a licence fee which, say, provided live sports or movies as well as the niche content would be more acceptable. • A further, speculative option for the licence fee model would operate the mechanism as a form of reverse crowd-funding: Rather than the licence fee being paid by the public, it would be paid to the public in the form of a voucher or credit earmarked for expenditure on designated public interest media 8 (which could include newspapers, magazines, and other media deemed to contribute to cultural and democratic functions). Obviously, this option would require an allocation from the consolidated fund in order to disburse. C) Investment subsidy/ tax rebate model • Provides incentives for investment in certain types of media production by offering a proportional subsidy to production costs A current version of the investment subsidy model can be seen in the NZ Screen Production Grant, administered through the NZ Film Commission, and arguably in the UFB contracts administered. Crown Fibre Holdings • This could be accompanied by a rebate on tax revenue liabilities in return for investment in content/services otherwise under-provided. • The model does not raise tax revenues per se- it is actually a notional cost to the state. However, by off-setting the opportunity costs and risks of capital investment content, services or infrastructure otherwise deemed commercially unattractive in an increasingly competitive digital media market (e.g. high-end local content, investigative journalism), the model enables private investment which would not otherwise be forthcoming. • The mechanism would be hypothecated (ringfenced) but level of subsidy would depend on the criteria of eligibility (which would need to be developed and clearly defined to avoid legal ambiguity). • Likely to be supported by the private/commercial media sector. However, the mechanism could impose contingencies on the government’s fiscal planning obligations. • Would function better for one-off larger scale projects that were pre-approved with a designated ceiling of rebate level to avoid fiscal risk. • Would not be workable for retroactive opportunity cost rebates for smaller scale content provision (not least because opportunity cots vary across genres and between media operators). D) Spectrum/Facilities subsidy • Subsidy or provision of free broadcast spectrum/satellite carriage for public interest media providers and/or regional/commercial media operators providing relevant public interest services. A recent example of this model was the low-cost spectrum allocation to the (not defunct) Kiwi FM which was dedicated to local 8 Compare this with the Pres Patron system in New Zealand which provides a mechanism through which people who want to support journalistic endeavours can make small payments to the news media they find valuable. https://www.presspatron.com/ 6 music. An example of where such provisions might have usefully been applied was the independent public broadcaster Stratos TV which closed down after Kordia imposed commercial rates for digital spectrum access. • The production/distribution facilities of existing public sector could also be made available to non-profit/ public interest media providers to support complementary forms of media content (although this would depend on availability and may require costs to be off-set by other means). • Potential to enhance diversity and viability of regional/non-profit broadcasters and/or help off-set opportunity costs for some other commercial media providers which provide public interest content. • Primarily a complementary funding mechanism alongside others; unlikely to be sufficient on its own to meet mainstream public interest requirements. E) Ringfencing of profits from state sector media • Profits from commercial public sector media operators such as TVNZ and Kordia could be recycled to fund public interest requirements. This could either function through a hypothecation (ringfencing) of dividend payments to the Crown or through being channelled to an agency such as NZ On Air. • Potential to enhance diversity and viability of regional/non-profit broadcasters by using profits from commercial spectrum to subsidise access for non-commercial media. • Alternatively, a variant of this model could differentiate between the operation of TVNZ’s channels making TV One more public service in orientation by recycling the dividend to off-set the opportunity costs (note this would not be sufficient on its own to make TV One non-commercial). • Primarily a complementary funding mechanism alongside others; unlikely to be sufficient on its own to meet mainstream public interest requirements, especially if dividends from TVNZ and Kordia decline. • No effect on private commercial operators; however, the model could reduce the incentive for media operators like TVNZ to maintain profitability if they are not a direct beneficiary of the mechanism. F) Marginal levy model • Small tax (say 1% or 0.5%) on a range of media services potentially including subscription services, telecommunications (phone/mobile/broadband), audio- visual hardware/software, and advertising (including online operations like Google and Facebook which currently benefit from online traffic but do not contribute content production costs). • Potential for a low level of levy to generate relatively substantial revenue if multiple sectors contribute. • Collection and disbursing agent could operate wither though direct allocation to designated public media provider(s) or through a contestable mechanism. • Hypothecated, index-linked and, insofar as the revenue comes from outside the existing consolidated fund, fiscally neutral. With the exception of advertising levy, 7 costs are passed onto the consumer of commercial media at point of purchase transaction. • Commercial media and consumer contribute proportionally across the value chain to compensate for the under-provision of civic and cultural content. The levy is therefore proportional to the commercial sectors’ contribution to market failure. • Passive payment system and low level makes the levy largely invisible from the consumer’s point of view; however, industry could oppose the model unless they were also beneficiaries or exemptions were available (e.g. for smaller/ non- profitable media companies). • There may be some initial technical complexities in implementing the levy in some sectors (e.g. audio-visual retail). 5) A closer look at the marginal levy model As noted above, there are several different mechanisms through which public funds could in theory be generated and distributed, but space precludes a full discussion of the options here However, BPM considers the marginal levy model to be a particularly promising mechanism for raising adequate funding outside the government’s current budget without imposing an unacceptable burden on either industry or the taxpaying public. The marginal levy mechanism would function primarily through the introduction of a small charge added to the price consumers pay for media services (0.5% to 1.0%) across a wide range of media-related goods and service transactions (including phone/internet, advertising, subscription TV/OnDemand services and audio-visual retail goods). A levy is, of course, a form of taxation and inevitably connotes negatively to many people. Some libertarians and Ideological opponents of public service principles dismiss any proposal for taxes or levies to support public media as unacceptable. But such a proposal should not be regarded as ‘nanny state’ interference in what would otherwise be an efficient market. Nor does it presume that the public as consumers don’t know what’s good for them. On the contrary, as citizens, most people will accept that there are gaps in what the market provides and that there is a need for public interest media, especially in-depth news and educational content. The problem is that as consumers, we collectively under-invest in such content (hence we are happy to read the news online for free at the same time as we grumble about the click-bait content and advertising). Given that commercial pressures are the primary reason for the under-supply of this sort of content (i.e. market failure), it is eminently reasonable to suggest that the media market itself be harnessed to help redress matters. A marginal levy of 0.5% to 1% on media-related revenues would gather revenue proportional to media company revenues and consumer expenditure. By including the entire media value-chain in the system (i.e. not just content providers but the means of distribution and reception- including hardware as well as content subscription services), those who benefit most from the commercial media market contribute proportionally to redressing its market failures; this might be characterized 8 as the ‘polluter pays principle’. The levy model would require legislation to implement, but insofar as it would require no additional allocations from the government consolidated fund, it would, in effect, be fiscally neutral. Importantly, this means that it would be hypothecated (ringfenced from other government budgets) and therefore insulated from inter-ministerial budget wrangling. Moreover, it would be index-linked to inflation because the levy would increase (or contract) in line with the overall revenues of the media sector. Applying it to the entire media value chain recognises the increasingly close links between content producers, distribution services and reception technologies in the converged media market (e.g. telecommunication services providers offering subscriber video services and dedicated reception hardware). This also means that if one sector grew at the expense of another (e.g. if mobile phone services or subscriber video-on- demand services increase their subscribers but newspapers decline further) then the levy these sectors respectively pay would adjust accordingly. Although media industries would instinctively oppose any kind of regulation or taxation, it is important to note that the net impact on media operator revenues beyond the costs of collection and administration would in most cases be minimal. The levy is specific to the media sector, but it is not discriminatory because it applies to all media providers across the value chain. The levy would also be predictable as a cost and so would not represent a major source of financial uncertainty. Domestic precedents already exist in the form of the Telecommunications Development Levy and the broadcaster levy for the Broadcasting Standards Authority. Other market sectors are also subject to taxes on particular goods such as tobacco and petrol (with the latter being hypothecated for expenditure on road infrastructure). Sectors which directly bill consumers for goods and services, including telecommunications, subscription services, and audio-visual retail sales could pass on the cost directly onto their customers. Because the levy would apply across the media value chain, no sector is disadvantaged any more than their direct rivals. Although the levy would increase prices, a marginal rate of 1% would add just $1 to a $100 phone/internet/subscriber TV bill, 20 cents to a $20 mobile phone pre-pay card, and $10 to a $1000 television or computer. The price increases for the consumer would less than the rate of inflation and would therefore be unlikely to engender significant opposition (unless opposing commercial media orchestrated it). The levy model also means that (unlike a regressive flat-fee TV license) consumers would contribute proportionally to their overall media consumption. A levy on advertising revenues would have to be implemented on a slightly different set of principles because overall turnover fluctuates in response to economic conditions and a levy on advertising could not be directly passed onto the consumer in the same way as a subscription TV bill. In an important sense, however, the consumer already pays for advertising every time they purchase advertised goods at the supermarket, regardless of whether they make use of the media services it funds. It is therefore not unreasonable to require advertisers to help support the public interest media forms which their own imperative for maximising eyeballs makes scarce. Some media dependent on advertising are struggling, so exceptions may 9 have to be made in cases where the levy would have a disproportionate impact on smaller operators. In contrast, some new online media platforms such as Google and Facebook have co-opted a significant proportion of advertising revenue from the domestic media market while contributing minimally to the provision of infrastructure or content. Offshore media companies like Google have also contributed to the erosion of the tax base in the media sector, although there are now increasing efforts to try and ensure they pay tax at a fair rate. Nevertheless, there is surely a strong case for requiring them contribute to public interest media services and indeed, compensate the media providers upon whose content their business model parasitically depends. 5) Concluding points A break-down of revenues the levy mechanism could potentially raise across 4 main sectors is provided in the table below. The calculations of these figures were based on data used in an earlier BPM report in 2015. Note that subscription TV does not incorporate data for subscriber-video-on-demand services (e.g. Netflix) whose revenues are growing but were not available at the time. The miscellaneous category includes other media like box office receipts and video rentals. These are obviously ball-park figures and may change over time, but they are based on reliable government and industry sources 9 and for the sake of demonstrating the potential viability of the marginal levy model they are valid. Even assuming the lower rate of 0.5%, the levy would potentially generate roughly $80m per year. The discussion of how to prioritise and disburse the funds is an issue that lies outside the remit of the Future of Tax working group and will therefore not be discussed in this document. However, the point that this calculation underlines is that the marginal levy model would make possible a range of significant interventions to secure the provision of public media services in the evolving digital media context. 9 Statistics NZ (2014) Information and Communication Technology Supply Survey: 2014.

Submission to the Tax working group 30 April 2018 Brewers Association of New Zealand Inc., PO Box 25526, Featherston Street, Wellington 6146, New Zealand. 1. Introduction: The Brewers Association of New Zealand 1.1 The Brewers Association represents major brewers with the core purpose to celebrate beer, its contribution to the economy and to social wellbeing through responsible consumption. 1.2 Our members (Lion Pty Ltd and DB Breweries Ltd) produce approximately 82% of the beer brewed in New Zealand. The brewing industry is a major contributor to the ongoing success of the New Zealand economy – the grain to glass value chain was worth $2.3 billion in the year ending March 2017. The brewing industry contributes over $645 million to GDP. There are at least 214 commercial brewing operations throughout New Zealand employing over 1,950 people i . 1.3 The Brewers Association supports the moderate consumption of beer by informed adults. Many people enjoy drinking beer which can be part of a healthy lifestyle when consumed in moderation. The Brewers Association believes where there are instances of misuse or underage consumption, targeted interventions and education are best placed to successfully reduce harm for specific at-risk groups. 1.4 Our core principles are: a) Drinking beer can add to an adult’s enjoyment of life, and as a lower alcohol and natural product, can be part of a healthy lifestyle when enjoyed in moderation. b) Beer plays a positive role in our society and the economy due to its important role in the agricultural, brewing, tourism and hospitality sectors, as well as our culture and heritage. c) We support targeted efforts by industry, government and the community to reduce alcohol misuse. 1.5 The Brewers Association is committed to the promotion of responsible consumption of alcohol. The Brewers Association, together with New Zealand Winegrowers and Spirits New Zealand, formed in 2012 ‘The Tomorrow Project’. Cheers! is a social change initiative under the Tomorrow Project to support New Zealanders to understand the drivers and effects of their drinking behaviour, and to make smarter choices to keep themselves, and the people around them, safe and sociable when they are drinking (www.cheers.org.nz). 1.6 This submission has been prepared on behalf of the Brewers Association of New Zealand by Dylan Firth Executive Director of the Brewers Association. He can be contacted on and \[1\] \[1\] Submission 2. Alcohol consumption in New Zealand in context. 2.1 The majority of New Zealanders drink responsibly. It is important to acknowledge alcohol is a product many New Zealanders enjoy sociably and in ways that do not contribute to harm. 2.2 Per capita alcohol consumption, measured by alcohol available for consumption has fallen from 9.6 litres of pure alcohol per capita (15 years and older) in 2010 to 8.6 litres at the end of 2017 ii 2.3 Harmful consumption (total population) for 15 – 24 year olds has fallen from 34.7% in 2006/7 to 26.1%. in 2015/16. iii 2.4 Harmful consumption (total population) for 45 – 65 year olds has increased for the same time period. ii 2.5 Consumption of 6+ drinks at least once (monthly) has fallen significantly for all measured age groups since 2006/07 as has 6+ drinks at least once (weekly) for most demographics (45+ have increased but not with statistical significance). ii 2.6 Recent figures on alcohol consumption indicate there is no growing trend in alcohol misuse that suggests a crisis. According to the Ministry of Health 2016/17 New Zealand Health Survey 79.3% of New Zealanders had an alcoholic drink in the last 12 months. The Ministry of Health Survey also showed 80.5% of those that did drink, did so light to moderately iv . 2.7 This supports the point that most New Zealanders drink moderately most of the time. Caution must therefore be taken when painting alcohol misuse as a population-wide issue, and to only propose population-wide interventions. The harmful use of alcohol is a complex personal and societal issue that requires targeted coordinated measures and education from many stakeholders to effect behavioural change. 3. Alcohol and the role of excise in New Zealand 3.1 Alcohol excise and duty in New Zealand contributed $985m year ending 30 June 2017 (up from $947m in 2016)v. Currently $11m of this goes the Health Promotion Agency and the rest is distributed to the consolidated Government fund. 3.2 In a Treasury working paper Barker identifies the role of Pigouvian Taxes (in this case alcohol excise) as necessary due to the externalities alcohol creates vi . The industry accepts this and has worked with Government agencies over the years to develop a robust and fair system that is efficient to maximise the revenues received by Government. 3.3 The Tax Working Groups’ Future of Tax background paper poses the question: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? 3.4 We submit strongly that this should not be the case, as price mechanisms to influence consumption patterns are limited in their results and they also disproportionately impact those who do not create harms. This is opposed to the views of others. 3.5 Much is made of fairness when assessing the Tax framework in New Zealand with the working group background paper stating “The tax system should be fair. This involves both horizontal equity (fair treatment of those in similar circumstances) and vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax).” This is an important issue because excises often create an unfair tax on those in similar circumstances but different consumption habits. 3.6 Alcohol excise is necessarily linear in consumption, while harms are exceptionally nonlinear. Low-level through moderate consumption brings strong benefits for consumers via social positives through to health benefits from light drinking over abstaining. 3.7 Wagenaar's metastudy had price responsiveness among heavy drinkers as about 60% of the price responsiveness of light drinkers vii . A United States study by Nelson found changes in beer taxes did not reduce youth and young adult drinking prevalence and bingeing viii , both of these studies reflect the relative inelasticity of demand in relation to alcohol. 3.8 We submit that excise increase may affect heavier drinkers who may otherwise downshift in quality in response to excise changes; it would also affect lower income moderate drinkers. Benefits in reducing harmful drinking among harmful drinkers need be weighed against the costs imposed on moderate lower income drinkers – and especially where moderate drinkers are far more responsive to price hikes than heavier drinkers. 3.9 As highlighted in the working paper ‘Tax incidence is about who ultimately bears the costs of a tax’. A good example is excise tax. While firms that produce alcohol and tobacco are statutorily and administratively liable for excise tax, it is normally assumed that the incidence (that is, who actually bears the cost of the tax) is felt by consumers of these products’. 3.10 This is why increases of excise would disproportionately affect the consumer through the Tax incidence. The demand for alcohol is relatively inelastic as expressed earlier, which means that despite changes in price, the demand for alcohol will remain relatively constant. 3.11 If the point of excise is to internalise external costs at the margin, there is no excise rate that will work. Any linear excise will always overtax moderate and light drinkers while under-taxing the heaviest drinkers relative to external costs. 3.12 This would also be true if seeking to re-coup costs to cover all externalities. If harms were linear, it would be simple. But they're not. All-source mortality risk from drinking follows a J-curve ix ; where light drinking improves health outcomes, the optimal tax may be negative for very light drinking, then rise sharply with consumption beyond about four standard drinks per day. 3.13 We consider it is more effective to address this behaviour at its source, via targeted education, rather than through taxation. This would be a more effective way to achieve the intended purpose. 3.14 With the current broad-based system with current levels of excise, there is fair and broad revenue collection which does not increase tax burdens on those who drink in moderation. 3.15 We do not believe that revenue raising provides a sustainable rationale for narrowly based indirect taxes in the modern-day environment where GST offers an alternative form of consumption taxation. Unlike the excises, GST has the attractive property that its very broad base and single rate makes the revenue it raises independent of how people choose to spend their money. 3.16 Many New Zealanders of modest means will pay as much or more indirect tax via alcohol and tobacco excise and gaming duties as they pay in GST levied on all of their spending. In the context of the efficiency of excise taxes, we consider that differences of this size in indirect tax burdens are very difficult to justify 4. Conclusion 4.1 The relationship between consumption and price is complex, using excise as a means to influence behaviours is a blunt and often ineffective tool. 4.2 The Brewers Association believes focus on broad based tax structure with some excise alleviates the tax burden on those who moderately consume alcohol. 4.3 Finally, that behavioural change is best enacted through targeted interventions to those who create the greatest negative externalities.

Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 16 July 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Dear Tax Working Group Members Re: Tax Working Group – The Future of Tax I am writing to you in regard to the Background Paper released by the Tax Working Group (TWG) entitled “Future of Tax”. First, BusinessNZ would like to congratulate the Government on setting up a TWG with direct input from the private sector. We strongly supported the 2009/2010 Tax Working Group and since then have advocated for another broad examination of New Zealand’s tax system, particularly in regard to recent international pressures and settings. We also appreciate the TWG’s difficult task in having terms of reference that mean there are significant no-go areas we believe also require examination. We would point out that with any broad examination of a complex and wide ranging system, there will be parts of the business community that invariably agrees - or disagrees - with the recommendations put forward. So it is important to identify those options that have the business community’s broadest support. This is the position BusinessNZ, together with its member organisations (encompassing its regional associations and major companies and affiliated industries groups) has taken in relation to the TWG’s work. Topics outside the Scope of the TWG As noted above, BusinessNZ would point out that while the TWG process covers a number of tax policy areas, we have been disappointed to find certain areas outside its scope. These include income tax and GST changes, as well as tax applying to the family home. In essence, this hampers the ability of both the TWG and submitters to examine the full tax system and see where trade-offs can be made. JacksonStone House 3-11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz 2 To that end, the recent results of the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey 1 show how the business community can provide a more nuanced response when presented with different scenarios. For instance, of the 575 businesses completing the survey, table 1 shows 76% did not support an increase in the highest personal marginal tax rate, while 18% said yes with 6% unsure. Figure 1 However, table 2 shows these percentages moved when businesses were also asked about the use of the additional tax revenue raised from the increase to fund specific areas, such as social investment or transport infrastructure. Figure 2 BusinessNZ hopes that once submissions for the Future of Tax Paper have been received, these matters can be addressed more fully to ensure the interim report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue provides enough specificity for submitters to provide their preferences etc. when it comes to potential taxation changes. 1 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0006/129345/Deloitte-BusinessNZ-Election- Survey-2017.pdf 3 Questions for Submitters The Background Paper outlines 20 broad questions relating to the future of New Zealand’s tax system. In relation to the point made above, overall, our submission is not as detailed as the submission we would have provided had not the TWG’s terms of reference essentially prevented a comprehensive analysis of the tax system as a whole. Instead, what we have outlined below is our general taxation position and thoughts developed over many years in consultation with our membership across various industries and sizes of business. Chapter 2: The future environment 1. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to-long-term? Which of these are most important? Overall, BusinessNZ believes that following the major reforms of the 1980s, New Zealand’s tax system has generally worked well in meeting the overall needs of the economy. In no small part this has been due to ongoing collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors to ensure the system remains internationally competitive. However, this does not mean improvements cannot be made. Also, future technology changes, offshore developments and the changing face of New Zealand life may dictate the use of different levers to ensure the continuing competence of the New Zealand tax system. The most obvious risk is that of a sudden decrease in key tax takings placing pressure on areas of government expenditure. Equally, however, BusinessNZ would be concerned if new taxes, popular with some members of the public, were introduced but were poorly thought through from a public policy perspective. As history shows, it is relatively easy to tax something, but whether it should be taxed in the first place and what unintended consequences will stem from taxing it need to be taken into account. Also, we would not want to see taxes collected for specific purposes, become, to all intents and purposes, general taxation and morph into a slush fund for projects unrelated to what was originally intended. We believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently competitive and that the full suite of taxes, on both individuals and business, is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has the best chance of improving economic growth. The main concern for New Zealand’s tax system is that it continues to be broad-based and low-rate, collects taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creates minimal disruption for the general population. 4 2. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? One of the key ways in which all three issues above can be achieved is by examining the issue of base-broadening. This would address some of the existing biases in the tax system, improving its efficiency and sustainability. Base-broadening to maintain tax revenue levels would also be required if certain tax rates were to be reduced. Often, examining each base-broadening and revenue-raising option by itself, without looking at where it would sit in terms of the overall package, can result in no change. We would also like to point out in regard to maintaining tax revenue levels, that due to its terms of reference, the TWG has only looked at one half of the broader issue. The balance of revenue neutrality means the group has no opportunity to look at where government expenditure might be reduced to free up revenue for further tax changes. In this regard, we note that in 2018 the Government is expected to collect around $86b in tax revenue, leading us to ask how this could be used more efficiently if spending decisions were properly reviewed. Overall, we would want the Government to make a more concentrated effort to find ways to lower unnecessary expenditure so additional revenue can be passed back to taxpayers via lower tax rates, while revenue required for spending is used in a productive and efficient manner. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future focused tax system? While BusinessNZ has no substantive comment on this question, we would point out that the tax system should not adversely affect or favour any ethnicity, however defined. Within the business taxation context, we would expect all businesses, no matter who they are owned by, to adhere to the same tax rules and structures. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment 3. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? BusinessNZ believes that page 19 of the paper provides a useful summary of the criteria required for examining the purpose and principles of a good tax system, namely: • Efficiency • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal adequacy • Compliance and administration costs • Coherence We note the paper’s statement that these are the established criteria used in past reviews both domestically and overseas. Therefore, we see very little reason to change 5 the criteria while any new criteria or adjustments would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. Defining ‘fairness’ 4. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? The term ‘fairness” is very subjective and is not readily defined in the tax system context. In a business context, we suggest the tax system should ensure an optimal outcome for all businesses, particularly in relation to their size. Comparing small with large businesses across not only the tax system but other regulatory systems, there needs to be a pragmatic acknowledgement of the differences in tax compliance responsibilities between small and large businesses. Research over time, including by BusinessNZ, shows small businesses (SMEs) traditionally have much higher compliance costs per employee compared with larger enterprises. And there is a gap in the business capability of small firms versus large firms when dealing with tax compliance issues. Any compliance ‘jolts’ introduced are more likely to be heavier for smaller firms, as their ability to deal with new or changed regulations is relatively lesser than that of large businesses. The latter often have staff that can be allocated the task of understanding how and when compliance is required. This highlights to us how policies that minimise tax compliance costs for smaller firms can help to minimise any deadweight cost to the economy. Last, when examining the points above, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the fact that any optimal outcome for smaller sized businesses should accept that close enough is good enough. A drive towards total precision in the tax system creates complexity. Therefore, a more pragmatic view around trying to collect the last dollar of revenue, would help minimise any compliance jolts. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks 5. New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking ahead to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? BusinessNZ believes this is still the best approach for the country and will continue to support a broad-based low-rate (BBLR) framework. A BBLR system is simpler to administer and is fairer, as more people contribute towards the cost of the services available to everyone. As with our view of the principles relating to the tax system’s performance, any move away from the BBLR framework would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. 6 Taxes and behaviour 6. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Given there is often limited evidence to support the notion that taxation has a positive effect on modifying behaviour, BusinessNZ believes any taxes introduced for this purpose would need to go through a rigorous government policy process to ascertain whether they were required in the first place. This would include establishing whether substantive international evidence shows such taxes having a significant positive effect on behaviour without creating significant distortionary effects elsewhere in the tax system, as well as unintended negative behavioural consequences. Retirement savings 7. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Page 26 of the background paper provides a succinct summary of the New Zealand relationship between taxation and retirement savings compared with most other OECD countries. It is certainly true that in comparison with many other countries, New Zealand’s retirement savings are highly taxed, as we have a Taxed-Taxed-Exempt (TTE) approach, compared with the Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (EET) approach of most OECD countries - where savings instruments are taxed neither at the investment nor the earning stage but at the withdrawal stage. However, as the background paper rightly points out, the Government provides material support to those in retirement through universal superannuation that is not means tested. Therefore, any switch to a system where income earned on the investment was not taxed would involve a significant fiscal cost. In addition, KiwiSaver, which is little more than 10 years old, is considered by many to be a key policy helping New Zealanders save for their retirement, while the establishment of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) also contributes to retirement savings. Overall, from BusinessNZ’s point of view, any proposals for change raise questions as to whether the cost of further tax incentives for retirement saving would be affordable and the extent to which they would see retirement savings increase. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance 8. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? BusinessNZ does not have any substantive comments on these questions. 7 Tax and business 9. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? One of the principles of good taxation, mentioned above, involves taking into account compliance and administration costs. Taxpayers are often faced with a variety of compliance costs, with the business community having to administer and pass on a wide range of taxes. As discussed in question 4 above, it is important to recognise that tax compliance costs for businesses fall disproportionately more on SMEs than on larger businesses, particularly when viewed from an FTE measure. From our perspective, it is difficult to respond to the question of whether the tax system is currently doing enough to minimise costs for business. IRD is the key Government Department taking the lead in finding ways to reduce compliance costs. With that in view, the IRD is currently going through an extensive Business Transformation (BT) process, which includes mechanisms to reduce compliance costs on business. At this stage, the introduction of the Accounting Income Method (AIM) and the general move towards electronic filing – if set up correctly – has the potential to reduce tax compliance costs for many businesses. Related initiatives, such as the introduction of the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), also have the potential to not only reduce tax compliance costs, but costs across the many government departments business deals with on a day-to-day basis. However, such policies need time to bed down in order to ascertain how successful or otherwise they have been. While BusinessNZ is strongly supportive of IRD’s BT process, our primary concern is that costs could simply be moved from government to business. We have stated to the IRD on many occasions that the process should end up having an overall significant net benefit to the business community by way of reducing tax compliance costs – particularly for the SME sector. To that end, we note that later this year IRD will again conduct its SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey, run roughly every four years. The survey provides a useful quantitative and qualitative assessment of compliance costs for various areas of the tax system. Last, if we were to look at the larger end of the business community, BusinessNZ and Deloitte conducted a tax survey of New Zealand’s largest companies in May 2017 2 . The purpose of the survey was to identify what fine-tuning was required to make sure New Zealand is performing optimally – both in global competitiveness and tax administration. Ten themes were identified, namely: 2 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0010/129187/170816-Major-companies-tax- survey-2017.pdf 8 a) Provide certainty: The ability to make business decisions with certain knowledge of the tax implications is important for business. We urge government to consider tax changes with a commercial lens, balancing the integrity of the tax system with long- term certainty for business. b) Eliminate black hole expenditure: Businesses should be able to claim a tax deduction for all business expenditure, either immediately or over time. Currently there are a number of gaps in the law where legitimate business expenditure is not deductible at all – this is known as “black hole” expenditure. The cost of raising capital is a common example. c) Help to strengthen buildings: If government does not compensate for the regulatory taking imposed on building-owners, then the tax system should not add a further barrier. d) Restore depreciation for industrial buildings: As mentioned below, government should restore depreciation deductions for this building class, reversing the 2010 decision to put industrial buildings in the same category as commercial and residential properties given clear differences between their use and long-term utility. e) Maintain an internationally competitive rate: Corporate tax rates around the globe are on a downward trend, with the OECD average now just over 22 percent. While it is important for companies to pay their fair of share of tax, in a world where capital is mobile it is also critical that our headline corporate rate doesn’t become uncompetitive – at least compared to our closest competitors such as Australia. f) Encourage research and development: The majority of major companies would support tax policies to further encourage research & development (“R&D”). A lack of NZ business investment in R&D risks our Intellectual Property being developed offshore and skilled labour transferring overseas. g) Put New Zealand’s interests first: The Government should develop tax policy that takes into account New Zealand’s best interests, based on New Zealand principles, not on what is in other countries’ best interests. h) Allow taxpayers some flexibility: In a world where technology will play a greater role in assessing taxpayers, the government should allow the IRD to accept some flexibility, rather than require absolute precision from taxpayers, introducing more safe harbour and de minimis discretions. i) Treat commercial information like personal information: Major companies regularly supply Inland Revenue with commercially sensitive information – the obligation to keep this confidential is fundamental to the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. j) Determine policy based on realities: There is a general perception across society that multinational companies are not paying their “fair share” when compared with regular taxpayers but this is not always an informed view. The Government should take a careful approach to the taxation of multinational companies to ensure any reforms are measured and justified, in the same way other matters of policy are approached. Obviously, these themes cross-over with other questions asked in the background paper. Together, they provide clear ways for government to pull the significant levers major businesses would like to see pulled, thereby helping to make New Zealand’s tax system competitive, efficient to run and of the highest integrity. 9 10. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Given the complex nature of this issue and the multitude of factors at play, BusinessNZ has no substantive comments on this question. 11. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? While BusinessNZ has no substantive comments to make on this question, it is important for the TWG to recognise that a number of ownership structures exist in New Zealand in order to reduce the impact of tax on decision making, Also, we believe any significant or excessive deductions benefitting one type of business structure over others would already be clearly identified by IRD’s ongoing tax policy programme and therefore already part of its work agenda. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system 12. What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these gaps are most important to address? Broadly speaking, BusinessNZ agrees there is the potential for challenges to New Zealand’s tax revenue base, as well as issues over technology disruption that will have implications for tax revenue collection in the medium to longer term. Improved technology options mean transactions can be carried out that either circumvent the usual tax collection process, or through greater efficiency, result in less tax collected by traditional means. For instance, recent discussions about cryptocurrencies highlight the need for further work on these issues. Overall, New Zealand needs to be cognisant of both the risks and opportunities when examining the tax base and the inconsistencies that may appear. 13. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? The background paper mentions a number of taxes eliminated over time under the BBLR tax system. These include sales tax, land tax, estate duty and gift duty. In addition, we do not levy stamp duties, financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes and a capital gains tax. While BusinessNZ is not against the introduction of new taxes per se, this does not mean we simply support the introduction of a new tax or the reintroduction of a tax for the sake of it. Such taxes would need to meet the principles discussed above, as well as fit within the BBLR framework. 10 Whether any taxes were reduced with the introduction of new taxes, we would expect any overall changes in the tax system to be revenue neutral in order not to increase the burden on taxpayers. Regarding specific tax reductions, BusinessNZ believes an overall reduction in the company tax rate would be a positive step forward in supporting firms. In addition, other tax mechanisms could be examined to ensure New Zealand’s tax system is as efficient and effective as possible for the business community. These include: Loss continuity rules Currently, BusinessNZ has been formally collaborating with a number of interested business groups to advocate for a change in New Zealand’s loss continuity rules. In short, we would like to see an amendment to the law that currently disadvantages many fast growing and innovative companies. Specifically, the proposal is to amend the current rule relating to the carry forward of tax losses by enacting a "same or similar business" test as an alternative to the existing 49% continuity of ownership requirement. Such a change would bring New Zealand's rules into line with those of many comparable jurisdictions, reduce compliance costs, and further the potential for business growth. Building depreciation deductions We are interested - with a view to where this could be expanded - in knowing how the current range of tax deductible measures for businesses in New Zealand compares with offshore arrangements. To that end (and noted in question 9 above) in 2010 the Government of the day removed tax depreciation on buildings. In our submission to the 2009/10 TWG which examined the issue, we pointed out that any decisions made in the area would most likely have significant effects, not only in terms of taxpayer funds saved, but also on associated residential property investment. While BusinessNZ did not have a strong view on removing depreciation on residential buildings, we strongly rejected any moves towards extending the removal of tax depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Such buildings typically depreciate over time as the specific requirements of the building can rapidly change due to new technology or a shift in focus involving business operations. We also believed care needs to be taken in differentiating between residential and commercial buildings if there is to be any ring fencing. BusinessNZ would therefore welcome the TWG again considering the reintroduction of depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability 14. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 11 BusinessNZ would again be very wary of using the tax system to improve affordability for owners and renters. Within the context of housing affordability, it is important to note the tax areas outside the scope of the TWG (namely any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or land under it), as well as the issue of capital gains tax discussed below. From our perspective, the only way we see the tax system assisting potential homeowners through a BBLR framework is by reducing personal tax rates and/or thresholds, so buyers have a greater amount of net income at their disposal to pay rent or save for/pay a mortgage. More importantly, BusinessNZ sees housing affordability as essentially a supply side issue. Changes in the tax system could become a moot point if supply side policies instead assisted homeowners and potential homeowners by way of freeing up land for residential purposes. Capital gains tax 15. Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? BusinessNZ does not have a formal position on a capital gains tax, as it would depend on the detail of any CGT regime chosen, such as who it would include, who it would affect and how it would be implemented. In essence, the devil would be in the detail of whatever might be proposed. By way of example, if we again highlight some results from the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey below, figures 3 and 4 show a capital gains tax would likely receive more support from the business community if accompanied by a corresponding reduction in personal tax rates. Figures 3 & 4 12 That any capital gains tax, if introduced, automatically should exclude the family home, would erode the comprehensive nature of the tax. Once a tax is eroded by exclusions, its effectiveness in terms of efficiency and revenue collection is called into question. Moreover, as outlined in question 14 above, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the ability of a CGT to improve housing supply and affordability. To achieve this goal, we would recommend actions to free up land supply for housing construction. Land tax 16. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Again, BusinessNZ believes there is an issue of balance. First, we note that a land tax is nothing new. New Zealand had a land tax up until 1992, but the exemptions were considerable and it therefore affected only a small group of taxpayers. We also currently have a form of land tax via the rates charged by Local Government. Despite the previous use of a land tax, one of our main concerns with its re-introduction is its potential use for other, future, revenue-raising purposes, moving away from the reason for its introduction. The reasons why taxes such as a land tax are introduced are often easily forgotten, and subsequent administrations sometimes use such a tool for other purposes. For example, a future Government might need additional revenue for some elements of social spending, and therefore increase the land tax rate. Alternatively, changes to a land tax could be made by relating the rate paid to the income of the individual/family. It could be argued that in such circumstance existing taxes can also be changed but additional taxes mean there is a greater scope to do so - not the way to ensure government’s fiscal prudence. In addition, land is typically the principle form of equity held by banks to support lending to businesses for use in productive activities. A land tax could therefore undermine banks’ security and also their ability to lend to the business community. Last, like a CGT and previous land taxes in New Zealand, the opportunity over time to introduce exemptions is often politically hard to resist, thereby undermining the policy’s original intent. From BusinessNZ’s point of view, unless a land tax means a significant reduction in the company tax rate and/or a much lower/flatter tax structure, we will not support its introduction. Environmental taxation 17. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? It is extremely difficult to respond to this question in the absence of a compelling case or problem that would inform such a response. In their absence, any response would be guesswork at best. Key to any response is the nature and extent of the externalities to 13 which such a tax might be applied, and an assessment of the gap unaddressed by the application of the emissions trading scheme. Progressive company tax 18. Should the tax system do more to support small firms? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? In general, BusinessNZ supports taking steps to assist small businesses through the tax system, whether by lowering compliance costs (as mentioned above) or through lower tax rates. However, we have never supported the concept of a progressive company tax system, whereby smaller businesses pay a lower rate. This would move New Zealand away from the BBLR system we support, and in our view would create a number of unintended consequences. For instance, businesses on the lower rate would have a natural ceiling barrier to growth with the possibility of some undertaking actions to ensure they stayed under the threshold given the natural disincentive to business expansion. As well, businesses just above the threshold would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Last, any threshold – however defined – would be subjective and create winners and losers, thereby curbing productivity and growth. As mentioned above, beyond a reduction in tax compliance costs for small businesses, other levers to assist such businesses include a reduction in the company and top personal tax rates (given many SMEs are on the top personal rate), together with an examination of how the current range of tax deductible measures for New Zealand businesses compares with offshore arrangements and how this could be expanded. GST exemptions for particular goods 19. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from the Goods and Services Tax? If so, what should be excluded? – and what else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? Given its general efficiency and effectiveness with our taxation system, BusinessNZ supports the continuation of a no exemptions policy for GST, which we view as world- leading. We have long held the view that GST should remain a broad-based tax with few if any exemptions. Overseas evidence has consistently shown exemptions lead to gaming and the diverting of resources better used more productively. In addition, not only does GST reduce the taxation bias against savings and investment, it also means changes made are part of the existing tax structure, with no need to create another level of complexity in the system. Looking more widely, on balance BusinessNZ believes that of the various options for raising revenue and ensuring cost neutrality, increasing the GST rate should be viewed as an option worth further investigation. However, any increase should also be balanced with ensuring low income earners do not find themselves in a worse financial position. This can be achieved through transfers or lower personal tax rates. 14 Thank you again for the opportunity to comment. Kind regards, Va ughan Renner President BusinessNZ \[1\]

First, BusinessNZ would like to congratulate the Government on setting up a TWG with direct input from the private sector. We strongly supported the 2009/2010 Tax Working Group and since then have advocated for another broad examination of New Zealand’s tax system, particularly in regard to recent international pressures and settings. We also appreciate the TWG’s difficult task in having terms of reference that mean there are significant no-go areas we believe also require examination. We would point out that with any broad examination of a complex and wide ranging system, there will be parts of the business community that invariably agrees - or disagrees - with the recommendations put forward. So it is important to identify those options that have the business community’s broadest support. This is the position BusinessNZ, together with its member organisations (encompassing its regional associations and major companies and affiliated industries groups) has taken in relation to the TWG’s work. Topics outside the Scope of the TWG As noted above, BusinessNZ would point out that while the TWG process covers a number of tax policy areas, we have been disappointed to find certain areas outside its scope. These include income tax and GST changes, as well as tax applying to the family home. In essence, this hampers the ability of both the TWG and submitters to examine the full tax system and see where trade-offs can be made. JacksonStone House 3-11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz 2 To that end, the recent results of the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey 1 show how the business community can provide a more nuanced response when presented with different scenarios. For instance, of the 575 businesses completing the survey, table 1 shows 76% did not support an increase in the highest personal marginal tax rate, while 18% said yes with 6% unsure. Figure 1 However, table 2 shows these percentages moved when businesses were also asked about the use of the additional tax revenue raised from the increase to fund specific areas, such as social investment or transport infrastructure. Figure 2 BusinessNZ hopes that once submissions for the Future of Tax Paper have been received, these matters can be addressed more fully to ensure the interim report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue provides enough specificity for submitters to provide their preferences etc. when it comes to potential taxation changes. 1 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0006/129345/Deloitte-BusinessNZ-Election- Survey-2017.pdf 3 Questions for Submitters The Background Paper outlines 20 broad questions relating to the future of New Zealand’s tax system. In relation to the point made above, overall, our submission is not as detailed as the submission we would have provided had not the TWG’s terms of reference essentially prevented a comprehensive analysis of the tax system as a whole. Instead, what we have outlined below is our general taxation position and thoughts developed over many years in consultation with our membership across various industries and sizes of business. Chapter 2: The future environment 1. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium-to-long-term? Which of these are most important? Overall, BusinessNZ believes that following the major reforms of the 1980s, New Zealand’s tax system has generally worked well in meeting the overall needs of the economy. In no small part this has been due to ongoing collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors to ensure the system remains internationally competitive. However, this does not mean improvements cannot be made. Also, future technology changes, offshore developments and the changing face of New Zealand life may dictate the use of different levers to ensure the continuing competence of the New Zealand tax system. The most obvious risk is that of a sudden decrease in key tax takings placing pressure on areas of government expenditure. Equally, however, BusinessNZ would be concerned if new taxes, popular with some members of the public, were introduced but were poorly thought through from a public policy perspective. As history shows, it is relatively easy to tax something, but whether it should be taxed in the first place and what unintended consequences will stem from taxing it need to be taken into account. Also, we would not want to see taxes collected for specific purposes, become, to all intents and purposes, general taxation and morph into a slush fund for projects unrelated to what was originally intended. We believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently competitive and that the full suite of taxes, on both individuals and business, is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has the best chance of improving economic growth. The main concern for New Zealand’s tax system is that it continues to be broad-based and low-rate, collects taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creates minimal disruption for the general population. 4 2. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? One of the key ways in which all three issues above can be achieved is by examining the issue of base-broadening. This would address some of the existing biases in the tax system, improving its efficiency and sustainability. Base-broadening to maintain tax revenue levels would also be required if certain tax rates were to be reduced. Often, examining each base-broadening and revenue-raising option by itself, without looking at where it would sit in terms of the overall package, can result in no change. We would also like to point out in regard to maintaining tax revenue levels, that due to its terms of reference, the TWG has only looked at one half of the broader issue. The balance of revenue neutrality means the group has no opportunity to look at where government expenditure might be reduced to free up revenue for further tax changes. In this regard, we note that in 2018 the Government is expected to collect around $86b in tax revenue, leading us to ask how this could be used more efficiently if spending decisions were properly reviewed. Overall, we would want the Government to make a more concentrated effort to find ways to lower unnecessary expenditure so additional revenue can be passed back to taxpayers via lower tax rates, while revenue required for spending is used in a productive and efficient manner. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future focused tax system? While BusinessNZ has no substantive comment on this question, we would point out that the tax system should not adversely affect or favour any ethnicity, however defined. Within the business taxation context, we would expect all businesses, no matter who they are owned by, to adhere to the same tax rules and structures. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment 3. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? BusinessNZ believes that page 19 of the paper provides a useful summary of the criteria required for examining the purpose and principles of a good tax system, namely:  Efficiency  Equity and fairness  Revenue integrity  Fiscal adequacy  Compliance and administration costs  Coherence We note the paper’s statement that these are the established criteria used in past reviews both domestically and overseas. Therefore, we see very little reason to change 5 the criteria while any new criteria or adjustments would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. Defining ‘fairness’ 4. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? The term ‘fairness” is very subjective and is not readily defined in the tax system context. In a business context, we suggest the tax system should ensure an optimal outcome for all businesses, particularly in relation to their size. Comparing small with large businesses across not only the tax system but other regulatory systems, there needs to be a pragmatic acknowledgement of the differences in tax compliance responsibilities between small and large businesses. Research over time, including by BusinessNZ, shows small businesses (SMEs) traditionally have much higher compliance costs per employee compared with larger enterprises. And there is a gap in the business capability of small firms versus large firms when dealing with tax compliance issues. Any compliance ‘jolts’ introduced are more likely to be heavier for smaller firms, as their ability to deal with new or changed regulations is relatively lesser than that of large businesses. The latter often have staff that can be allocated the task of understanding how and when compliance is required. This highlights to us how policies that minimise tax compliance costs for smaller firms can help to minimise any deadweight cost to the economy. Last, when examining the points above, there needs to be an acknowledgement of the fact that any optimal outcome for smaller sized businesses should accept that close enough is good enough. A drive towards total precision in the tax system creates complexity. Therefore, a more pragmatic view around trying to collect the last dollar of revenue, would help minimise any compliance jolts. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks 5. New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking ahead to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? BusinessNZ believes this is still the best approach for the country and will continue to support a broad-based low-rate (BBLR) framework. A BBLR system is simpler to administer and is fairer, as more people contribute towards the cost of the services available to everyone. As with our view of the principles relating to the tax system’s performance, any move away from the BBLR framework would need to reach a very high threshold to justify change. 6 Taxes and behaviour 6. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Given there is often limited evidence to support the notion that taxation has a positive effect on modifying behaviour, BusinessNZ believes any taxes introduced for this purpose would need to go through a rigorous government policy process to ascertain whether they were required in the first place. This would include establishing whether substantive international evidence shows such taxes having a significant positive effect on behaviour without creating significant distortionary effects elsewhere in the tax system, as well as unintended negative behavioural consequences. Retirement savings 7. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Page 26 of the background paper provides a succinct summary of the New Zealand relationship between taxation and retirement savings compared with most other OECD countries. It is certainly true that in comparison with many other countries, New Zealand’s retirement savings are highly taxed, as we have a Taxed-Taxed-Exempt (TTE) approach, compared with the Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (EET) approach of most OECD countries - where savings instruments are taxed neither at the investment nor the earning stage but at the withdrawal stage. However, as the background paper rightly points out, the Government provides material support to those in retirement through universal superannuation that is not means tested. Therefore, any switch to a system where income earned on the investment was not taxed would involve a significant fiscal cost. In addition, KiwiSaver, which is little more than 10 years old, is considered by many to be a key policy helping New Zealanders save for their retirement, while the establishment of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) also contributes to retirement savings. Overall, from BusinessNZ’s point of view, any proposals for change raise questions as to whether the cost of further tax incentives for retirement saving would be affordable and the extent to which they would see retirement savings increase. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance 8. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? BusinessNZ does not have any substantive comments on these questions. 7 Tax and business 9. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? One of the principles of good taxation, mentioned above, involves taking into account compliance and administration costs. Taxpayers are often faced with a variety of compliance costs, with the business community having to administer and pass on a wide range of taxes. As discussed in question 4 above, it is important to recognise that tax compliance costs for businesses fall disproportionately more on SMEs than on larger businesses, particularly when viewed from an FTE measure. From our perspective, it is difficult to respond to the question of whether the tax system is currently doing enough to minimise costs for business. IRD is the key Government Department taking the lead in finding ways to reduce compliance costs. With that in view, the IRD is currently going through an extensive Business Transformation (BT) process, which includes mechanisms to reduce compliance costs on business. At this stage, the introduction of the Accounting Income Method (AIM) and the general move towards electronic filing – if set up correctly – has the potential to reduce tax compliance costs for many businesses. Related initiatives, such as the introduction of the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), also have the potential to not only reduce tax compliance costs, but costs across the many government departments business deals with on a day-to-day basis. However, such policies need time to bed down in order to ascertain how successful or otherwise they have been. While BusinessNZ is strongly supportive of IRD’s BT process, our primary concern is that costs could simply be moved from government to business. We have stated to the IRD on many occasions that the process should end up having an overall significant net benefit to the business community by way of reducing tax compliance costs – particularly for the SME sector. To that end, we note that later this year IRD will again conduct its SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey, run roughly every four years. The survey provides a useful quantitative and qualitative assessment of compliance costs for various areas of the tax system. Last, if we were to look at the larger end of the business community, BusinessNZ and Deloitte conducted a tax survey of New Zealand’s largest companies in May 2017 2 . The purpose of the survey was to identify what fine-tuning was required to make sure New Zealand is performing optimally – both in global competitiveness and tax administration. Ten themes were identified, namely: 2 https://www.businessnz.org.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0010/129187/170816-Major-companies-tax- survey-2017.pdf 8 a) Provide certainty: The ability to make business decisions with certain knowledge of the tax implications is important for business. We urge government to consider tax changes with a commercial lens, balancing the integrity of the tax system with long- term certainty for business. b) Eliminate black hole expenditure: Businesses should be able to claim a tax deduction for all business expenditure, either immediately or over time. Currently there are a number of gaps in the law where legitimate business expenditure is not deductible at all – this is known as “black hole” expenditure. The cost of raising capital is a common example. c) Help to strengthen buildings: If government does not compensate for the regulatory taking imposed on building-owners, then the tax system should not add a further barrier. d) Restore depreciation for industrial buildings: As mentioned below, government should restore depreciation deductions for this building class, reversing the 2010 decision to put industrial buildings in the same category as commercial and residential properties given clear differences between their use and long-term utility. e) Maintain an internationally competitive rate: Corporate tax rates around the globe are on a downward trend, with the OECD average now just over 22 percent. While it is important for companies to pay their fair of share of tax, in a world where capital is mobile it is also critical that our headline corporate rate doesn’t become uncompetitive – at least compared to our closest competitors such as Australia. f) Encourage research and development: The majority of major companies would support tax policies to further encourage research & development (“R&D”). A lack of NZ business investment in R&D risks our Intellectual Property being developed offshore and skilled labour transferring overseas. g) Put New Zealand’s interests first: The Government should develop tax policy that takes into account New Zealand’s best interests, based on New Zealand principles, not on what is in other countries’ best interests. h) Allow taxpayers some flexibility: In a world where technology will play a greater role in assessing taxpayers, the government should allow the IRD to accept some flexibility, rather than require absolute precision from taxpayers, introducing more safe harbour and de minimis discretions. i) Treat commercial information like personal information: Major companies regularly supply Inland Revenue with commercially sensitive information – the obligation to keep this confidential is fundamental to the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. j) Determine policy based on realities: There is a general perception across society that multinational companies are not paying their “fair share” when compared with regular taxpayers but this is not always an informed view. The Government should take a careful approach to the taxation of multinational companies to ensure any reforms are measured and justified, in the same way other matters of policy are approached. Obviously, these themes cross-over with other questions asked in the background paper. Together, they provide clear ways for government to pull the significant levers major businesses would like to see pulled, thereby helping to make New Zealand’s tax system competitive, efficient to run and of the highest integrity. 9 10. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Given the complex nature of this issue and the multitude of factors at play, BusinessNZ has no substantive comments on this question. 11. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? While BusinessNZ has no substantive comments to make on this question, it is important for the TWG to recognise that a number of ownership structures exist in New Zealand in order to reduce the impact of tax on decision making, Also, we believe any significant or excessive deductions benefitting one type of business structure over others would already be clearly identified by IRD’s ongoing tax policy programme and therefore already part of its work agenda. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system 12. What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these gaps are most important to address? Broadly speaking, BusinessNZ agrees there is the potential for challenges to New Zealand’s tax revenue base, as well as issues over technology disruption that will have implications for tax revenue collection in the medium to longer term. Improved technology options mean transactions can be carried out that either circumvent the usual tax collection process, or through greater efficiency, result in less tax collected by traditional means. For instance, recent discussions about cryptocurrencies highlight the need for further work on these issues. Overall, New Zealand needs to be cognisant of both the risks and opportunities when examining the tax base and the inconsistencies that may appear. 13. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? The background paper mentions a number of taxes eliminated over time under the BBLR tax system. These include sales tax, land tax, estate duty and gift duty. In addition, we do not levy stamp duties, financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes and a capital gains tax. While BusinessNZ is not against the introduction of new taxes per se, this does not mean we simply support the introduction of a new tax or the reintroduction of a tax for the sake of it. Such taxes would need to meet the principles discussed above, as well as fit within the BBLR framework. 10 Whether any taxes were reduced with the introduction of new taxes, we would expect any overall changes in the tax system to be revenue neutral in order not to increase the burden on taxpayers. Regarding specific tax reductions, BusinessNZ believes an overall reduction in the company tax rate would be a positive step forward in supporting firms. In addition, other tax mechanisms could be examined to ensure New Zealand’s tax system is as efficient and effective as possible for the business community. These include: Loss continuity rules Currently, BusinessNZ has been formally collaborating with a number of interested business groups to advocate for a change in New Zealand’s loss continuity rules. In short, we would like to see an amendment to the law that currently disadvantages many fast growing and innovative companies. Specifically, the proposal is to amend the current rule relating to the carry forward of tax losses by enacting a "same or similar business" test as an alternative to the existing 49% continuity of ownership requirement. Such a change would bring New Zealand's rules into line with those of many comparable jurisdictions, reduce compliance costs, and further the potential for business growth. Building depreciation deductions We are interested - with a view to where this could be expanded - in knowing how the current range of tax deductible measures for businesses in New Zealand compares with offshore arrangements. To that end (and noted in question 9 above) in 2010 the Government of the day removed tax depreciation on buildings. In our submission to the 2009/10 TWG which examined the issue, we pointed out that any decisions made in the area would most likely have significant effects, not only in terms of taxpayer funds saved, but also on associated residential property investment. While BusinessNZ did not have a strong view on removing depreciation on residential buildings, we strongly rejected any moves towards extending the removal of tax depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Such buildings typically depreciate over time as the specific requirements of the building can rapidly change due to new technology or a shift in focus involving business operations. We also believed care needs to be taken in differentiating between residential and commercial buildings if there is to be any ring fencing. BusinessNZ would therefore welcome the TWG again considering the reintroduction of depreciation on commercial/industrial buildings. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability 14. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 11 BusinessNZ would again be very wary of using the tax system to improve affordability for owners and renters. Within the context of housing affordability, it is important to note the tax areas outside the scope of the TWG (namely any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or land under it), as well as the issue of capital gains tax discussed below. From our perspective, the only way we see the tax system assisting potential homeowners through a BBLR framework is by reducing personal tax rates and/or thresholds, so buyers have a greater amount of net income at their disposal to pay rent or save for/pay a mortgage. More importantly, BusinessNZ sees housing affordability as essentially a supply side issue. Changes in the tax system could become a moot point if supply side policies instead assisted homeowners and potential homeowners by way of freeing up land for residential purposes. Capital gains tax 15. Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? BusinessNZ does not have a formal position on a capital gains tax, as it would depend on the detail of any CGT regime chosen, such as who it would include, who it would affect and how it would be implemented. In essence, the devil would be in the detail of whatever might be proposed. By way of example, if we again highlight some results from the Deloitte BusinessNZ 2017 Election Survey below, figures 3 and 4 show a capital gains tax would likely receive more support from the business community if accompanied by a corresponding reduction in personal tax rates. Figures 3 & 4 12 That any capital gains tax, if introduced, automatically should exclude the family home, would erode the comprehensive nature of the tax. Once a tax is eroded by exclusions, its effectiveness in terms of efficiency and revenue collection is called into question. Moreover, as outlined in question 14 above, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the ability of a CGT to improve housing supply and affordability. To achieve this goal, we would recommend actions to free up land supply for housing construction. Land tax 16. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Again, BusinessNZ believes there is an issue of balance. First, we note that a land tax is nothing new. New Zealand had a land tax up until 1992, but the exemptions were considerable and it therefore affected only a small group of taxpayers. We also currently have a form of land tax via the rates charged by Local Government. Despite the previous use of a land tax, one of our main concerns with its re-introduction is its potential use for other, future, revenue-raising purposes, moving away from the reason for its introduction. The reasons why taxes such as a land tax are introduced are often easily forgotten, and subsequent administrations sometimes use such a tool for other purposes. For example, a future Government might need additional revenue for some elements of social spending, and therefore increase the land tax rate. Alternatively, changes to a land tax could be made by relating the rate paid to the income of the individual/family. It could be argued that in such circumstance existing taxes can also be changed but additional taxes mean there is a greater scope to do so - not the way to ensure government’s fiscal prudence. In addition, land is typically the principle form of equity held by banks to support lending to businesses for use in productive activities. A land tax could therefore undermine banks’ security and also their ability to lend to the business community. Last, like a CGT and previous land taxes in New Zealand, the opportunity over time to introduce exemptions is often politically hard to resist, thereby undermining the policy’s original intent. From BusinessNZ’s point of view, unless a land tax means a significant reduction in the company tax rate and/or a much lower/flatter tax structure, we will not support its introduction. Environmental taxation 17. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? It is extremely difficult to respond to this question in the absence of a compelling case or problem that would inform such a response. In their absence, any response would be guesswork at best. Key to any response is the nature and extent of the externalities to 13 which such a tax might be applied, and an assessment of the gap unaddressed by the application of the emissions trading scheme. Progressive company tax 18. Should the tax system do more to support small firms? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? In general, BusinessNZ supports taking steps to assist small businesses through the tax system, whether by lowering compliance costs (as mentioned above) or through lower tax rates. However, we have never supported the concept of a progressive company tax system, whereby smaller businesses pay a lower rate. This would move New Zealand away from the BBLR system we support, and in our view would create a number of unintended consequences. For instance, businesses on the lower rate would have a natural ceiling barrier to growth with the possibility of some undertaking actions to ensure they stayed under the threshold given the natural disincentive to business expansion. As well, businesses just above the threshold would find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Last, any threshold – however defined – would be subjective and create winners and losers, thereby curbing productivity and growth. As mentioned above, beyond a reduction in tax compliance costs for small businesses, other levers to assist such businesses include a reduction in the company and top personal tax rates (given many SMEs are on the top personal rate), together with an examination of how the current range of tax deductible measures for New Zealand businesses compares with offshore arrangements and how this could be expanded. GST exemptions for particular goods 19. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from the Goods and Services Tax? If so, what should be excluded? – and what else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? Given its general efficiency and effectiveness with our taxation system, BusinessNZ supports the continuation of a no exemptions policy for GST, which we view as world- leading. We have long held the view that GST should remain a broad-based tax with few if any exemptions. Overseas evidence has consistently shown exemptions lead to gaming and the diverting of resources better used more productively. In addition, not only does GST reduce the taxation bias against savings and investment, it also means changes made are part of the existing tax structure, with no need to create another level of complexity in the system. Looking more widely, on balance BusinessNZ believes that of the various options for raising revenue and ensuring cost neutrality, increasing the GST rate should be viewed as an option worth further investigation. However, any increase should also be balanced with ensuring low income earners do not find themselves in a worse financial position. This can be achieved through transfers or lower personal tax rates. 14 Thank you again for the opportunity to comment. Kind regards, Vaughan Renner President BusinessNZ \[1\]

We have been engaged in discussions with Ministers and officials over the past 18 months about amending a tax law that unfairly disadvantages many fast growing and innovative New Zealand companies. We attach a copy of our letter to the Hon Stuart Nash dated 22 November 2017 which outlines the proposal, summarises the work and discussions that had by that stage already occurred, and attaches a policy paper and economic analysis of the proposal by Alex Duncan of Finology. 2. The proposal is to supplement the current rule requiring 49% continuity of ownership for a company to carry forward tax losses with a rule that losses can be carried forward so long as the company's underlying business remains the same or similar. We are submitting to the Tax Working Group ("TWG") on the proposal as the Government may ask that you consider it. Submission 3. If the TWG is asked to consider the proposal, then we urge the TWG to recommend that the proposal be progressed as part of the Government's Tax Policy Work Programme as: (a) The proposal would complement and enhance outcomes the Government is seeking by introducing R&D tax credits to incentivise the "pre profit" part of the innovation economy. (b) The proposal would help the Government achieve its goal of boosting spending on research and development to 2% of GDP. (c) Inland Revenue officials have already undertaken work in relation to both the substantive proposal and the possible implementation costs. (d) The proposal is relatively straightforward and involves a discrete issue. (e) Implementing the proposal would bring New Zealand into line with the rules in comparable countries. It does not have any consequential flow-on effects to other aspects of the tax system. (f) The proposal is not expected to be affected by other work being undertaken by the TWG. 3505130 v3 2 of 2 (g) The recently released discussion document on R&D tax credits recognises the potential unfairness of a continuity of ownership requirement, albeit in the context of considering requirements for the carry-forward of tax credits (at page 22: "There is a question about whether continuity should be imposed on tax credits that are carried forward. This would prevent subsequent investors in a business, who have not incurred the cost of the R&D expenditure, from getting the benefit of unallocated tax credits. However, it would remove the R&D incentive for the initial investors who undertook the R&D, and is arguably inconsistent with the growth cycle of R&D start-ups – these companies are typically loss making until the initial development work is successful, at which point additional equity investors are usually brought on board."). (h) The potential unfairness of a continuity of ownership requirement will therefore need to be addressed in the context of the proposed R&D tax credit, and within a time-frame that precludes consideration by the TWG. For the TWG to consider the same issue (but in the context of the carry-forward of losses) would not be a good use of resources and could result in less coherent tax policy than if the same or similar business test is considered in parallel to the R&D tax credit proposals. (i) This is a tangible and readily achievable initiative which would immediately benefit the innovation and start-up eco-system in New Zealand. Consideration by the TWG (given the likely timeframes associated with changes recommended by the TWG) could significantly delay the realisation of those benefits and is unnecessary for the reasons set out above. 4. We would be happy to provide further information or meet with the TWG if that would assist, although, as noted, we consider that the best and most efficient outcome is for the Government to continue to consider and progress the proposal as part of its Tax Policy Work Programme.

We are writing regarding a proposal to amend the law that currently disadvantages many fast growing and innovative companies. Specifically, the proposal (as summarised in the Appendix to this letter) is to amend the current rule relating to the carry forward of tax losses by enacting a "same or similar business" test as an alternative to the existing 49% continuity of ownership requirement. Such a change would bring New Zealand's rules into line with those of many comparable jurisdictions, reduce compliance costs, and remove one of the tax impediments for innovative companies seeking to raise capital. We met with former Ministers Collins and Goldsmith earlier this year in relation to the proposal. We also met with policy officials from Inland Revenue and Treasury, who have carried out some preliminary work in relation to the proposal. It was agreed with officials that the proposal would be included on the menu of potential reform proposals to be considered by Ministers for inclusion on the tax policy work programme when it is reset following the election. Enclosed with this letter are the following papers (which were sent to the previous Ministers and officials from Inland Revenue and The Treasury): (a) a Policy Paper outlining issues with the current law and a proposed same or similar business test for New Zealand; and (b) a paper by Alex Duncan of Finology containing an economic impact analysis of the current test and how a same or similar business test could benefit New Zealand. We propose to contact your office in the near future with a view to arranging a meeting with you to discuss this proposal. Many thanks for your consideration of this matter.

Problem definition  Early stage, innovative companies are more likely than other companies to incur tax losses. At the same time, those companies are also likely to have changes of ownership as a result of raising new capital to fund research, development, innovation and growth.  Tax losses have value to a company to the extent they are able to be carried forward and offset against future income. Forfeiture of tax losses erodes value for existing shareholders. The risk of forfeiture can therefore affect decision-making regarding the amount and timing of capital-raising and/or increase the required rate of return before investment is made in new ideas. It can also lead to migration of part or all of the business outside of New Zealand to a jurisdiction that better accommodates the innovation sector.  New Zealand's current tax rules regarding the ability to carry forward tax losses depend solely on maintaining a minimum level of ownership continuity. If the statutory threshold (49%) is breached, tax losses are forfeited. Distortions and inequities  The current loss carry-forward rules create distortions and inequities, which would be addressed by a same business test. For example:  A mature company with other sources of income can immediately use deductions/losses from spending on innovation and new ideas (so the cost is only 72 cents in the dollar). For a company with no other (profitable) business, not only is no real time tax benefit available from the same spending, if losses are forfeited then such spending becomes "black hole" expenditure (so the cost is 100 cents in the dollar), even where the company subsequently becomes profitable.  Similarly, the current rules create a bias against high growth companies with an ongoing need for injections of new capital. Such companies are more likely to forfeit tax losses due to changes in ownership than low growth companies that can be funded by existing shareholders. APPENDIX 3  If a limited partnership or look through company is used then the losses flow up to the investors and so are not at risk of forfeiture. However, the LTC regime is only available for closely held companies and limited partnerships are complex and unwieldy from both a governance/administrative perspective and a tax perspective when compared to a company. Out of step with other countries, including Australia  New Zealand's loss carry-forward rules are out of step with those of other countries, which generally have (as an alternative to continuity of ownership) a continuity of business test. That is, provided the company continues to carry on the same or a similar business, losses may be carried forward notwithstanding changes in ownership.  In December 2015 the Australian Government announced that it would be changing its same business test (in place since 1965), by making it easier to satisfy, in order to further encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and diversification. This announcement followed from recommendations in 2012 by the Business Tax Working Group established by the Australian Treasury.  Extracts from the Australian Treasury report are included in the Annex to this note.  The proposed changes to the Australian law were included in the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 1) Bill 2017. Rule design and fiscal cost  A robust same business test strikes a balance between allowing the carry forward of business losses where changes of ownership occur for genuine commercial reasons and preventing tax-driven "trading" in losses.  A number of elements can potentially be incorporated into the rule to achieve those objectives, eg excluding losses of dormant companies, ring-fencing the use of losses to income from the same business (and not another business carried on by the company), and specific anti-avoidance rules. There is much international precedent to draw on in this regard.  We will work with officials to help design a same business rule for New Zealand that is fit for purpose and maintains the integrity of the tax base. In addition, we can help officials profile the tax loss base to estimate the expected usage of carried forward tax losses should a same business test be implemented.  The proposal would have a fiscal cost only to the extent that the companies in question become profitable and in fact use losses that would otherwise (ie under current law) have been forfeited to offset that profit. Such companies could be expected to be making a broader economic contribution, offsetting the "tax cost". There is no cost to the Government where the tax losses that are carried forward under the proposed new rule are not ultimately used (eg the business fails).  Any loss in tax revenue from an increased use of tax losses should be more than offset by tax and other economic contributions from having more high-growth, innovative companies succeeding in New Zealand. 4 ANNEX Extracts from the Final Report on the Tax Treatment of Losses (2012) (Australian Treasury Business Tax Working Group) "The Working Group's terms of reference focus on reducing taxes on new investment to encourage Australian businesses to undertake innovation and entrepreneurial activity."

A Same Business Loss Carry-Forward Test for New Zealand 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY • Tax losses incurred by a company have value to the extent they are able to be carried forward and offset against future income. Forfeiture of such losses has a cost to the company. • Innovative companies, early-stage companies and rapidly growing companies are more likely than other companies to incur tax losses at certain stages in their life. • Current New Zealand law requires a minimum 49% continuity of ownership for a company to carry forward tax losses. Changes of ownership, including as a result of capital injections by new investors to fund growth and development, can therefore result in forfeiture of tax losses. • Other countries supplement their continuity of ownership test with a "same business" test, which allows a company to carry forward tax losses despite changes of ownership provided the company carries on the same type of business. • The absence of a same business test in New Zealand results in punitive tax outcomes, distorts decision-making and disincentivises innovation, growth and risk-taking. • Introducing a same business test would remove a barrier to growth and innovation in New Zealand, bring New Zealand law into line with international norms and is likely be fiscally positive. 3 1. INTRODUCTION AND CURRENT LOSS UTILISATION RULES FOR COMPANIES 1.1 Companies, like all taxpayers, are required to calculate their taxable income (and therefore their income tax liability) for each "tax year". Where a company has a positive amount of taxable income for a tax year the company has an income tax liability equal to 28% of that taxable income. Where a company has a negative amount of taxable income (ie a "tax loss") for a tax year, no income tax is payable by the company, and except in very limited circumstances 1 the company is not able to "cash out" the value of those losses with the Government by either carrying the loss back and offsetting it against a prior year's taxable income on which tax has been paid (to obtain a refund of that tax) or simply receiving an amount equal to the tax value of those losses to the company. However, the amount of that tax loss may either be: (a) made available to another company in the same group of companies as the company (applying a minimum 66% common ownership threshold), to reduce the amount of taxable income of that other company for the income year; or (b) carried forward to a future tax year, when it may be used to either reduce the amount of the company's taxable income in that tax year or be made available to another group company in that future tax year. 1.2 Accordingly, the ability of a company to realise the value of a tax loss is dependent on that company, or another group company, having taxable income in a future tax year. The reason given for this asymmetric treatment of profits and losses is that an ability to obtain value for tax losses that is not capped by reference to the taxable income of the corporate group would provide a strong incentive for businesses to create artificial tax losses and thereby pose a risk to the tax base. 2 1.3 The ability of a company to carry forward tax losses and have them available for use in future tax years is also dependent on the company satisfying the continuity of ownership requirements in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("Act"). In short, these rules require that at least 49% of the ownership interests in the company are held by the same persons from the time the tax losses arose until the time the company is able to use them. (The lowest percentage ownership interest of each shareholder during the relevant period is used to determine whether the 49% threshold is met.) Where this minimum continuity of ownership requirement is not met (ie there is a more than 51% change in ownership of the company since the losses arose) the tax losses are forfeited. 1.4 The policy rationale behind the minimum continuity of ownership requirement is that the benefit of company tax losses should be derived (at least to the extent of 49%) by those shareholders who incurred those losses and that companies should not be able to "trade" tax losses with unrelated taxpayers. 3 If a loss-making company could effectively trade tax losses with unrelated persons by a combination of asset-stripping and change of ownership, then this would undermine the policy of not allowing the cashing-out of tax losses. 1.5 The remainder of this paper considers the adverse impacts that the current loss carry- forward rules can have on growth, innovation and risk-taking by businesses, and 1 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016 introduced provisions allowing a limited ability to cash out tax losses attributable to research and development expenditure for certain entities. The Act also contains limited other examples of provisions allowing the allocation of deductions or losses to prior years for certain industries (eg sections EJ 14 and IS 5 for petroleum miners). 2 See, for example, Regulatory Impact Statement relating to Cashing-out research and development tax losses (21 March 2014) at pp 3-4. 3 See, for example: (a) Business Tax Policy 1991 (Hon Ruth Richardson and Hon Wyatt Creech) (30 July 1991) at pp 82-3; (b) IRD Taxation Information Bulletin Volume 3, No.2 (August 1991) at 12. 4 proposes that the continuity of ownership test be supplemented by a "same or similar business" test, which is common in other jurisdictions. 2. ISSUES ARISING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CURRENT LOSS CARRY-FORWARD RULES Overview 2.1 Available tax losses are regarded as an asset of a company, in that they provide a valuable benefit in the event they are used to reduce the taxable income, and therefore the tax liability, of that company or another company in the future. However, this "asset" arises only because the company has incurred deductible expenditure that has not been able to be used to reduce a tax liability in the tax year it was incurred (because the company had insufficient income). If those tax losses are forfeited because the continuity of ownership requirements are not met, the asset disappears with the effect that the deductible expenditure incurred by the company that resulted in the tax losses has not reduced, and will never reduce, a tax liability. That is the case even if taxable income is generated in the future as a direct or indirect result of that expenditure. 2.2 Forfeiture of tax losses therefore has a direct cost to a company if and to the extent that taxable income arises in the future that could have otherwise been sheltered by the losses. The potential for this cost to arise imposes a barrier to risk-taking and innovation and affects decision-making by businesses. These adverse consequences, which are summarised below, are also considered in a paper by Alex Duncan entitled Reducing the punitive tax treatment of innovative businesses that choose to grow in New Zealand (October 2016). Disincentive to take risk and innovate 2.3 All business involves risk, including the risk of financial loss. Low-risk businesses will generally be less likely to generate tax losses, and where such losses do arise those losses could be expected to be offset against taxable income sooner rather than later. Higher risk businesses on the other hand are more likely to generate tax losses, and if such losses do arise it may be longer before they are able to be utilised. In addition, higher risk businesses are more likely to have changes in ownership, particularly when tax losses are arising, due to the need to attract capital investment from sources other than the current owners. 2.4 These factors combine to mean that companies that carry on riskier businesses are more likely to forfeit tax losses. As noted above, forfeiture of tax losses results in a direct cost to the company in the event that the company generates taxable income. The fact that this cost is more likely to arise in a riskier business disincentivises investment in such businesses and results in a higher required rate of return for such investment to occur. This runs counter to the Government's Business Growth Agenda, which emphasises the importance of innovation, connectivity and risk-taking. Distortions created by current loss carry-forward rules 2.5 A number of distortions arise as a result of the current loss carry-forward rules. These distortions highlight the punitive consequences for a company if it forfeits tax losses as a result of an ownership change and result in sub-optimal business decisions being made as a result. For example: (a) Where a business is carried on through a partnership (including a limited partnership) or a look-through company ("LTC"), any tax losses generated are available to be used by the partners or shareholders to offset other taxable 5 income. However, there are material barriers to the use of the LTC and limited partnership regimes: (i) A company qualifies to be a LTC only if it has five or fewer "look- through counted owners". Therefore, the regime is only available for closely held companies. (ii) The limited partnership regime is complex from a governance/administrative perspective and a tax perspective when compared to a company, particularly when there are changes of ownership (which trigger a deemed sale and purchase of the underlying assets for tax purposes). Accordingly, neither regime is practical for business that expects to introduce new owners as it grows. (b) If the company carrying on a business that generates tax losses has other sources of income, or is in the same group as a company with taxable income, then the tax losses can be used immediately. On the other hand, a company with no other income sources and no other group companies cannot use the losses immediately and must carry them forward, subject to the risk of forfeiture. Therefore, the value of tax losses arising from a business activity depends on whether the company carrying on that business has other income sources. This means that innovation and risk-taking has different fiscal consequences for a company or corporate group with other income-producing activities than for a new-entrant or start-up. (c) Businesses where the relative timing of income and expenditure is closely matched do not have the same risk of forfeiting losses as businesses where material expenditure is likely to be incurred in advance of revenue being generated. So even though over the life of the business the expected profits are the same, the timing differences give rise to different risks of forfeiture. This incentivises greater investment in short-term projects relative to long-term ones. Consequences for business decision-making 2.6 A principle underlying New Zealand's tax policy framework is that tax distortions should not influence decision-making regarding the allocation of resources. However, the above discussion illustrates how the current loss carry-forward rules for companies: (a) creates a preference for low-risk business activity and disincentivises innovation and risk-taking; (b) creates a preference in favour of established companies with other sources of taxable income; (c) can affect decisions regarding the timing and form of capital-raisings as the cost of forfeiting tax losses needs to be weighed against the benefits of the new capital. 2.7 The last point also raises the issue that the cost of tax loss forfeiture is borne by the existing shareholders, not the new investors, because the price that can be obtained for the investment (or acquisition) is not able to reflect the benefit of tax losses if they are, or are likely to be, forfeited. The inability to realise the value of tax losses on a full or partial sell-down of a company reduces the expected value of any return and so again disincentivises such investment. Where the new investor or purchaser is outside New 6 Zealand this decreases the value that New Zealand obtains for the early stage risk and innovation. 2.8 A related consequence is that the initial investors may be incentivised to locate the business, or at least the intellectual property aspect of the business, outside New Zealand, in a jurisdiction that has more accommodating tax rules. Case studies 2.9 A number of case studies illustrating how the current loss carry-forward rules have resulted in the forfeiture of losses by companies as a result of raising capital in order to fund further investment and development are set out in Appendix One. These case studies reflect actual companies and actual transactions. 3. LOSS CARRY-FORWARD RULES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS 3.1 Most comparable jurisdictions have a form of "same business" test as an alternative to or in substitution for the continuity of ownership test for the purposes of allowing tax losses to be carried forward. A same business test recognises that where a company continues to carry on the business activity that gave rise to the tax losses, any ownership changes are likely to have occurred for commercial reasons rather than to facilitate the trading of, or inappropriate access to, the company's tax losses. In those circumstances there is no policy reason why the losses should not be available to offset future profits of the same business activity. 3.2 Even though the owners of the company at the time the losses are used to offset taxable income may not be the same as the owners at the time the tax losses arose, it is not correct to say that the owners at the time the losses arose will not have benefited from the losses in that case. A same business test allows those owners to benefit by obtaining value for those losses through the sale price where they sell the business, or an interest in the business, to the new owners. Australia 3.3 Australia first introduced a same business test in 1965. In December 2015 the Australian Government announced a proposal to relax its same business test by supplementing it with a more flexible "similar business" test. The reason for the proposed change is that it is considered that the current same business test is too restrictive and is stifling innovation and diversification. That is because a company is deemed to fail the same business test if it derives income from a business activity it did not previously carry on or a type of transaction it had not previously entered into, even if also carries on the same business and/or enters into the same types of transaction it did before. 4 3.4 The proposed new "similar business" test prescribes the following three non-exhaustive factors that must be taken into account in ascertaining whether the company's current business is sufficiently similar to its former business: (a) the extent to which the assets (including goodwill) used in its current business were also used in its former business; (b) the extent to which the sources of income of its current business were also the sources of income of its former business; and 4 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), section 165-210(2). 7 (c) whether any changes to its former business are changes that would reasonably be expected to have been made to a similarly placed business. 3.5 The Explanatory Memorandum that accompanied the draft legislation for the similar business test emphasises that the focus is on the identity and character of the business, and is a question of fact. It is not sufficient, for example, that the current and former businesses are both in the hospitality sector. Instead, the test looks at the commercial operations and activities of the current business and compares them to those of the former business to determine if the businesses are sufficiently similar. Any changes should represent a natural progression or diversification of the former business, including those made in order to grow or rehabilitate the business, such that there remains a clear similarity between the essential character of the former business and the new business. Canada, the UK and the US 3.6 Canada, the UK and the US all have same or similar business tests as an alternative to their continuity of ownership tests: (a) In Canada losses arising from a business carried on by a company may be carried forward and deducted from income arising in future years from that business. 5 (b) In the UK losses arising in a period before a change of ownership (as defined, but generally reflecting a change in control of 50% of the ordinary shares) may not be set off against income if: 6 (i) there has been a major change in the nature or conduct of a trade carried on by the company within three years of the change of ownership; or (ii) prior to the change of ownership the trade activities of the company become small or negligible and there was no significant revival until after the change in ownership. (c) In the US prior-period losses cannot be deducted from future income following an ownership change if the company does not continue the business enterprise at all times during the two year period following the ownership change. 7 For the continuity of business enterprise test to be satisfied the purchasing company must either continue the target company's historic business or use a significant portion of the target company's historic business assets. 8 4. PROPOSED SAME OR SIMILAR BUSINESS TEST FOR NEW ZEALAND Objectives of a same or similar business test 4.1 A same or similar business test should: (a) allow a company carrying on an active business to raise new share capital, or otherwise have a change in shareholding, without resulting in the forfeiture of tax losses; 5 Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985), section 111(5). 6 Corporation Tax Act 2010 (UK), section 673. 7 US Internal Revenue Code § 382(c)(1). 8 US Revenue Code Regulation § 1.368-1(d). 8 (b) but at the same time contain tax base integrity measures that prevent the trading of tax losses between unrelated taxpayers that could otherwise undermine the current policy settings regarding the inability to cash-out tax losses. 4.2 Further, and as the Australian experience shows, the test should be flexible enough to accommodate natural or expected levels of diversification, risk-taking and innovation in products and markets without resulting in a breach of the test. 4.3 Whether a company carries on a same or similar business will inevitably be a factual inquiry, and depend on the particular type of business. It is therefore difficult to legislate a prescriptive and definitive test. However, it would be preferable for the legislation to specify factors that should be taken into account rather than remain silent on what factors are relevant. Suggested factors are as follows: (a) the goods or services produced or supplied by the company in the course of carrying on the business; (b) the assets (including goodwill) used by the company in the course of carrying on the business; and (c) the source and type of income derived by the company from the business. 4.4 A suggested legislative test, reflecting these factors, is set out in Appendix Two. Application to tax losses accumulated prior to enactment 4.5 If a same or similar business test is enacted in New Zealand as an alternative to the continuity of ownership test it will be necessary to consider the extent to which it will apply to tax losses arising in income years prior to enactment. If the test was to apply to losses of a company that had already been forfeited as a result of a change of ownership then the amendment would result in a windfall to the current owners of the relevant company. 4.6 However, there does not appear to be any reason why the amendment should not apply to tax losses arising prior to enactment that have not been forfeited under current law. Indeed, it would be consistent with the rationale behind the introduction of the same or similar business test for the current owners of such companies to be able to make decisions regarding the introduction of capital without having to factor in the cost that would otherwise arise if losses were forfeited. 4.7 Therefore, it is not proposed that the same or similar business test would be restricted in a way that meant it applied only to losses arising after introduction or enactment of the test. 4.8 It is not considered that such an approach would give rise to fiscal risk to the Government. Although the current stock of tax losses is understood to be significant, 9 it is expected that further profiling of those losses would indicate that the vast majority are in dormant entities and could not be utilised under a same business test. If there was a fiscal concern then two potential methods of addressing the concern while still allowing recent losses of active companies to be covered would be: (a) to specifically refer to the extent of any dormant periods as being a factor to take into account when determining whether the company carries on a same or similar business to that carried on when the losses arose; 9 The Officials' Issues Paper R&D Tax Losses (July 2013) states (at paragraph 2.15) that the current stock of losses for all firms was approximately $45 billion in May 2013. 9 (b) to limit the application of the test to losses arising after a particular date (for example 10 years prior to enactment). 4.9 The same or similar business test could also be buttressed by a specific anti-avoidance rule if necessary in order to provide additional protection to the tax base. 10 APPENDIX ONE: CASE STUDIES CASE STUDY ONE: ROCKET LAB LIMITED 1. Rocket Lab Limited was founded in 2006 by Peter Beck with the vision of enabling regular and affordable access to space for the growing global small satellite industry. 2. From 2007 to 2013 Rocket Lab worked on developing is core technology, including a launch vehicle and engine, capable of delivering small satellites into orbit. During this phase the company was funded by its founder and an individual supporter/investor, and was supported in its development through partnerships with US based research agencies. 3. In 2013 Rocket Lab sought further capital in order to fund the next phase of its development. A US venture capital fund (Khosla Ventures) and Sir Stephen Tindall's K1W1 investment fund both invested at this time. In conjunction with this capital-raising a US parent company was incorporated to hold the shares in Rocket Lab Limited and a US head office was established. 4. In 2015 Rocket Lab undertook a further round of capital-raising. Khosla Ventures and K1W1 both participated again, and investments were also made by another US venture capital fund (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lockheed Martin (a large listed US company). 5. Although Rocket Lab is now headquartered (through its parent company) in the US, the majority of its technical staff remain in New Zealand and its intended rocket launch site is in New Zealand (Mahia, on the East Coast). In 2016 MBIE commissioned Sapere Research Group to conduct an economic impact analysis of the development of a rocket industry in New Zealand, with a specific focus on Rocket Lab. Sapere's analysis concluded that the industry could contribute between $600m and $1,150m of value add to New Zealand over a 20 year period. 6. From an employment perspective the Sapere Report noted that: (a) as at 19 September 2016 the company had 68 staff with vacancies for 28, and was hiring 1-2 staff per week; (b) the expected workforce of the company in the commercialisation phase was 200-400. 7. Rocket Lab has test flights scheduled for late 2016 and expects to launch commercial payloads in 2017, with customers having pre-signed commitments for over 30 launches. 8. Rocket Lab is currently (and has been since inception) in a tax loss position, reflecting the fact that the company is not yet launching income-earning payloads, as well as the significant investment it has made in research and development. This investment has been funded by new capital rather than profits. Some of the tax losses generated in early years were forfeited as a result of its capital-raisings. Rocket Lab also has the compliance burden of monitoring the impact of capital-raisings and other ownership changes (including through its employee share plan) on its tax loss position. 11 CASE STUDY TWO: XERO LIMITED 1. Xero Limited was founded in 2006 by Rod Drury and Hamish Edwards. Its vision was to create a global software company from New Zealand based on the delivery over the internet of accounting software for SMEs. 2. Initial capital of $2.8 million was contributed by the founders, directors and initial employees. 3. In May 2007 the company launched an IPO to raise $15 million of new capital. The IPO was conducted at an early stage in the company's life-cycle, however this reflected the limited availability of private venture capital funding for technology companies at the time. More importantly though, it was considered that the added profile and discipline associated with being listed would bring significant credibility from a business perspective, providing confidence to customers (in particular offshore customers) and advancing the execution of the company's business plan. 4. Since 2007 Xero has invested significantly in growth, product-development and expanding into new markets. This investment has been funded by a series of capital- raisings, including: (a) $29 million in 2009 (from strategic investors and existing shareholders); (b) $4 million in 2010 (from a US based investor); (c) $35.6 million in 2012 ($20 million private placement and $15.6 million from existing shareholders); (d) $60 million in late 2012 (from US based investors); (e) $180 million in 2013 (from domestic and US based investors); (f) $147 million in 2015 (from US based investors). 5. Xero has always been (and continues to be) in a tax loss position, reflecting the significant investment it has made in growth and development, which has necessarily been funded by new capital rather than profits. As was the case for Rocket Lab, tax losses generated in early years were forfeited by Xero as a result of its capital-raisings. 6. From a compliance perspective, the company has needed to monitor and track the impact of its various capital-raisings and other off-market share transfers (including in respect of its employee share ownership schemes) on its shareholder continuity position and ability to carry forward losses. This has been a complicated exercise due to the nature and number of capital-raisings that have occurred over the years. 12 CASE STUDY THREE: VC FUND INVESTMENTS Case Study Three summarises three companies into which a New Zealand Venture Capital Fund has made investments. Actual company details have been withheld for the purpose of this summary. Company A: Electronics company 1. Company A was founded in 2003 and operates in the electronics industry. In 2006 a venture fund invested $2m for a 40% interest in the company. The investment was used by Company A to fund further development/advance to the commercialisation stage. At the same time, 20% of Company A's shares were set aside for employees as part of an employee share plan in order for the company to retain those employees and align their interests and rewards with those of the other shareholders. The founder retained a 40% shareholding. 2. This 60% change of ownership resulted in the forfeiture of approximately $4 million of tax losses that had accrued since inception. 3. In 2008 the company expanded into the US market and received an initial capital investment of US$10 million, followed by further capital rounds over the following four years that resulted in a 60% change of shareholding and all tax losses from 2006 to 2009 being forfeited. Company B: Biotech company 4. Company B was founded by two individuals in 1998 and operates in the biotech sector. In 2000 it commenced raising capital from angel investors to fund ongoing efficacy research. In 2005 it received a $1.5 million investment from iGlobe Treasury VIF Fund for a 33% interest. This Fund provided further investment over the following three years until in 2010 the company raised an additional US$4 million from an international biotech company and other investors. As a result of the shareholding changes, $4 million of tax losses from 2000 to November 2006 have been forfeited. The amount of losses forfeited would have been greater, but, at the request of the major incoming investor, and in order to utilise accumulated losses prior to the larger capital raising, the company sold its IP to an offshore associate, with the gain on that sale offset by some of the available losses. Company C: Environmental company 5. Company C was established by three individuals in 2014 and operates in the environmental sector. In 2015 and 2016 it received seed and A round funding totalling US$5.5 million, including US$1 million from an international venture capital fund, as well as funding from other New Zealand-based and offshore angel investors. 6. The Company will require additional B round funding of at least US$10 million in 2017 to continue its research and development. Furthermore, the company will need to raise an additional US$50 million in 2019 to build its first commercial plant and commence revenue generation in 2020. As a result of the shareholding changes arising from the additional B and C funding rounds Company C is likely to forfeit all accrued tax losses, which will exceed US$5 million. This potential loss forfeiture is of significant concern to the current shareholders who are investigating potential ways in which the losses could be preserved. 13 APPENDIX TWO: PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS Section IA 5(1) shall be amended as follows: IA 5(1) GENERAL STATEMENT A company's tax loss component is carried forward in a loss balance only if: (a) the minimum continuity requirements of subsections (2) and (3) are met: (b) the same or similar business requirement in subsection (3A) is met. The tax loss component includes an unused tax loss component carried forward from an earlier income year. New sections IA 5(3A) and IA 5(3B) are inserted as follows: IA 5(3A) SAME OR SIMILAR BUSINESS A tax loss component is carried forward in a loss balance under section IA 3(4) only if the company carries on the same or a similar business for the continuity period. IA 5(3B) WHETHER SAME OR SIMILAR BUSINESS CARRIED ON For the purposes of applying subsection (3A) the following factors must be considered: (a) the extent to which the same type of goods or services are produced or supplied by the business; and (b) the extent to which the same assets (including goodwill) are used in the business; and (c) the extent to which the nature and sources of income from the business are the same; and (d) the extent to which any changes to the business are those that would reasonably be expected to be made to a business of that type; and (e) any other relevant factor. Section IA 5(4) will be amended as follows: IA 5(4) BREACH OF CONTINUITY OF OWNERSHIP IN PERIOD If a tax loss component cannot be carried forward because the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) are not met, and the requirement in subsection (3A) is not met, the company may apply section IP 3 (Continuity breach: tax loss components of companies carried forward) to determine whether some or all of the tax loss component is carried forward in a loss balance. (Consequential requirements would also be required to the provisions in subpart IP dealing with the ability to use losses in respect of a part-year period when a breach occurs part way through a tax year.)

Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. i Introduction Sir Michael Cullen, Secretariat of the Tax Working Group By Email We welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the Tax Working Group on the future of taxation in New Zealand. CA ANZ would like make an oral submission in relation to our submission. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand We are a professional body of over 117,000 Chartered Accountants around the world. We focus on the education and lifelong learning of our members, and on advocacy and thought leadership in areas of public interest and business. General Position In formulating its submissions, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand takes a best practice, public policy perspective. That is, we endeavour to provide comment on a “what is best for New Zealand” basis. We recognise Government’s legitimate right to set tax policy direction. We comment on those policies, and also make comment on their practical implementation. Our public policy perspective means we endeavour to provide comment free from self-interest or sectorial bias. Research confirms that in practice the best tax system is one with a broad tax base and low tax rates. Such an approach restricts the conditions that make tax avoidance attractive. Our guiding principles in formulating this submission are that New Zealand’s tax system must not impede New Zealand’s international competitiveness; growth of the New Zealand economy; and innovation and entrepreneurship.  Recognising there are judgments and trade-offs, taxes should, as far as possible:  be simple in their application;  provide certainty in their application; © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. ii  be perceived as broadly fair;  minimise the costs of compliance and administration;  minimise distortions to the economic behavior of individuals and businesses;  utilise businesses’ own accounting systems as the data source for calculation;  align the obligations with the businesses’ own cash flows; and  be imposed at an overall rate which allows adequate retention of investment funds within businesses. We believe one of the pillars of an effective and efficient tax system is taxpayer certainty. This will increase voluntary compliance, decrease administration costs, and deliver positive economic benefits. Tax legislation must be as clear in its policy intent and application. Further, any identified errors post- enactment should be corrected without delay. In Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s view tax legislation should not be retrospective unless it corrects an anomaly to ensure taxpayers pay no more tax than Parliament intended. Retrospective application dates undermine the principle of taxpayer certainty and the Generic Tax Policy Process. Our Submission and Recommendations Relevant recommendations are included at the end of each section and are summarised in full in chapter 10 of our submission. We have broadly addressed the “Questions for Submitters” throughout the document but for ease of reference, have compiled these in Appendix 1. In addition we have addressed the specific design issues with a capital gains tax which you requested comment on, in Appendix 2. We are happy to discuss our submission further, and any questions can be addressed to .

While we are comfortable with these settings in the sense that we see no need for urgent action or change, the illustrations to the side highlight a potential risk to the tax base that should not be ignored. The risk is the high level of reliance on a small number of individuals who contribute over 60% of the individual tax base – the largest source of the country’s tax revenue. This analysis shows that this bias is increasing. Exposure to the risk of relying heavily on the individual tax base is likely to increase with advances in technology, the continuing growth of the ‘gig’ economy and the trends/changes in the future of work. Going forward, we expect these and other developments will have the potential to reduce the overall tax contribution from individuals. Therefore, we support the Tax Working Group “ Exposure to the risk of relying heavily on the individual tax base is likely to increase with advances in technology ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

New Zealand Sources of Taxation Revenue 2017 Composition of Existing Tax Base 1 Broad Base Low Rate Broad Base Low Rate (BBLR) has been the mantra for the New Zealand tax system for over three decades. Generally, we consider that this approach has served New Zealand well. Sufficient revenue has been raised to support successive governments in providing services and overcoming economic challenges and natural disasters. While BBLR is often referenced, it is important to note that a ‘broad base’ can have two meanings:  first, that there are few tax exemptions or deductions;  second, that tax is collected from a number of sources/bases. 1 Tax Working Group “Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper” 2018 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 3 Each of New Zealand’s three main tax bases (individual income tax, company tax and GST) are broad in themselves but overall the total tax base is relatively narrow compared to that of other countries. Adopting the first meaning, GST is an example of BBLR in its purest sense. There are very limited exemptions from GST and the rate is ‘low’ in comparison with many OECD countries with a consumption tax. Adopting the second meaning, it is arguable that the current tax system is not truly BBLR. This is illustrated in the pie chart above which shows that over 87 percent of New Zealand’s tax take comes from only three sources (individuals, companies and GST). Also, notably absent are additional tax regimes for items such as capital gains, land, wealth and inheritance taxes (noting that a tax on the latter is excluded from the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference). In the last 30 years or so a number of taxes have been abolished – most recently, gift duty in 2011 and cheque duty in 2014. When assessing the current and future New Zealand tax system, it will be important that the Tax Working Group is clear on the definition of BBLR that is being applied. We do not believe that there is a need in the short or medium term to move away from or replace the BBLR approach. Not only has it served New Zealand well to date, we consider that it will continue to do so - it is still relevant to the tax system. However, we note that there may be pressure in the future to widen the tax base as revenue requirements or social and business norms/expectations change. This pressure may influence government and stakeholders’ views on the role of BBLR in the future tax system. Regarding whether the tax system should have a greater role in intentionally modifying behaviour (e.g. to increase savings or to reduce consumption of particular goods or services), we caution against using BBLR to justify such approaches. Other criteria, for example, coherence, fairness, simplicity and efficiency, and the rights and fundamental freedoms enacted in the Bill of Rights Act 1990 must also be considered. Furthermore, the tax system should © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 4 be assessed/reviewed in conjunction with other Government policies that may influence the tax system or effect the administration and collection of tax (for example, child poverty/Working for Families, which we acknowledge is outside the scope of the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference and will be considered by the Welfare Working Group). However we have a preference that Government social goals be achieved outside of the tax base to ensure that the tax system is not overly complicated and avoids distortions that can drive behavior. Generic Tax Policy Process A unique feature of our current tax system is the use of the generic tax policy process (GTPP) to develop tax policy. This involves engagement and consultation between Government, Inland Revenue officials, Treasury officials and the public on tax policy matters. GTPP provides the opportunity for key stakeholders such as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand to provide input at the gestation stage of policy development. GTPP has three key objectives:  to encourage early consultation on technical policy and implementation issues;  to obtain input from the public;  to clarify the responsibilities and accountabilities of the parties involved in the process. There are five stages to GTPP:  strategic – development of economic strategy, fiscal strategy and three-year revenue strategy;  tactical – development of a three-year work programme and annual resource plan to implement the revenue strategy;  operational – detailed policy design and consultation, and gaining Ministerial and Cabinet approval of recommendations;  legislative – inclusion of the tax reforms in a Bill introduced in Parliament; Five stages of GTPP Strategic Development of economic strategy, fiscal strategy and three year revenue strategy; Tactical Development of a three-year work programme and annual resource plan to implement the revenue strategy; Operational Detailed policy design and consultation, and gaining Ministerial and Cabinet approval of recommendations; Legislative Inclusion of the tax reforms in a Bill introduced in Parliament; Post-implementation review A ‘health’ check to assess whether the laws enacted are achieving the policy intent, to identify any operational or administrative issues, and to recommend remedial action/legislation. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 5  post implementation review – a ‘health’ check to assess whether the laws enacted are achieving the policy intent, to identify any operational or administrative issues, and to recommend remedial action/legislation. The ultimate goal of GTPP is to ensure quality and effective tax policy development. This lays a strong foundation for the New Zealand tax system. Since its introduction in 1995 GTPP has become embedded in the tax system. It has also captured the attention of tax policymakers in many other countries and can now be considered a global benchmark for tax policy development. For the most part CA ANZ considers that GTPP has worked well. However, recent reforms (e.g. the Base Erosion Profit Shifting measures on interest limitation) have indicated that the framework is under threat. There have also been situations where GTPP has not been followed in full or in part (e.g. increasing the bright-line threshold from two years to five years via the introduction of a Supplementary Order Paper). In addition, it is not uncommon for the post implementation review phase to be significantly delayed or not actioned due to changing priorities and resource constraints. We believe that GTPP should continue to be the lynch pin in shaping the New Zealand tax system. Tax policy development needs to be an agile process. Tax policies should not be developed in haste. Tax policy positions must be founded on sound principles that are broadly accepted and the rules must be easy to comply with. These objectives would be furthered by, for example, adhering to the principles and goals of the Income Tax Act rewrite project carried out in the period from 1992 - 2007 2 (e.g. eliminating the use of complicated economic 2 “The purpose of rewriting the Income Tax Act was to produce tax law that is clear, written in plain language and is structurally consistent. That makes it easier for users to find what they need, to understand it, and to apply it, which in turn helps them to comply with the law. "Where possible, the language of the law has been made more concise, legalese has been avoided, and archaic terms have been removed or replaced.” (Source: joint press release on 25 October 2007 by Minister of Finance, the Hon Michael Cullen and Minister of Revenue, the Hon Peter Dunne). © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

In our view, the quality of some of the legislative reforms in recent years have been tainted by the failure to fully embrace the GTPP process. It is timely for the Tax Working Group to consider introducing measures to ensure that GTPP is followed and hold the government and policy officials to account if it is not. To achieve this, an independent body similar to the US Joint Committee on Taxation 3 could be established to oversee/enforce the GTPP process and manage concerns parties involved may have with it. Another measure worthy of further investigation is a follow up process after tax legislation has completed the Select Committee stage. CA ANZ and other key stakeholders devote a significant amount of time and resources to GTPP (much of that time is given voluntarily). While we do not expect GTPP to result in consensus on all issues, nonetheless at times it is difficult to understand why a recommendation/submission has been declined by Officials or the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee (FEC). This can lead to negative views of, and doubts about the effectiveness of GTPP. Having an opportunity to discuss these issues post FEC stage may help to ensure continued faith in the system. A related issue is the resources available to follow up on or action recommendations made by the FEC, its advisors and Inland Revenue officials during the submission/consultation process. Once the legislation has been enacted it is not unusual for other recommendations to be shelved or left unactioned. This leaves the job essentially incomplete and will likely give rise to challenges on implementation or downstream difficulties in compliance with the enactments. 3 The Joint Committee on Taxation is a nonpartisan committee of the US Congress established under Revenue legislation. The Joint Committee is comprised of a group of experienced professional staff of PhD economists, lawyers, accountants and other specialists. The Committee is closely involved with every aspect of the tax legislative process from policy formation, development and analysis to drafting of legislation and post-implementation review and enforcement (including recommendations to the Senate on remedial amendments). © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

These criteria are relevant and robust and should continue to be applied. Also relevant are certainty and predictability of both tax law and the Commissioner’s interpretation of tax law. This is critical not only to upholding the integrity of the tax system but also to the performance and success of business and the New Zealand economy. Fairness Fairness is a concept that is often raised or cited when a new tax is being proposed or existing tax rules are being reformed. The Tax Working Group submissions background paper asks submitters how they define “fairness” in the context of the tax system, and what a fair tax system would look like. “ The criteria summarised in the Tax Working Group background paper are relevant, and robust and should continue to be applied ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 9 The concept of “fairness” is subjective and will mean different things to different people. The nature of the issue being considered or addressed and a person’s personal circumstances and experiences will “colour” their view of fairness. Determining what is fair is an art rather than a science; therefore, a blanket definition would be inappropriate. In the context of the tax system it would be helpful if the tax policy framework included a list of criteria that could be applied to measure and assess fairness. For example, the nature and scope of benefits created by the proposal, the group(s) expected to benefit, the associated costs, the group or groups who will bear the costs, concepts of “user pays” and “the greater good”. The weight to be given to each criterion would be determined by the nature of the issue being considered and/or the objectives and outcomes that are sought to be achieved. Ironically, in some situations, fairness in the tax system may be undermined by fairness measures targeted at a particular group. For example, fairness is a common justification for introducing a capital gains tax (CGT). In its purest form, (i.e. a CGT with no exemptions) fairness may be achieved. However, it would not be unusual to have an exemption from CGT on the family home on the grounds of fairness. This exemption could apply to a significant group resulting in the CGT burden falling on a smaller group. Such an outcome challenges the fairness of introducing a CGT in the first place. As this example illustrates, the issue of fairness can lead to circularity. It is critical that safeguards are put in place to minimise the risk of this occurring. Societal Measures A priority of the current coalition government is to look beyond the financial and economic measures and include consideration of the impacts of tax policies on the wellbeing of New Zealanders. The framework that has been developed to do this is the living standards framework (LSF). The LSF comprises four interlocking capital stocks considered to be crucial to intergenerational wellbeing: © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 10  financial and physical capital – infrastructure and other material assets that support income and living conditions;  human capital – people’s skills, knowledge and physical and mental health (what allows us to participate in society)  social capital – the norms and values that define our society;  natural capital – our natural environment. The LSF therefore extends the traditional framework which is focused on financial and physical capital. In some circumstances this can create tension which may be resolved by a tradeoff between each capital stock. If tradeoffs were to occur, such should be explicitly acknowledged and recognised. The LSF is continually evolving. The tax system will need to be agile and flexible to ensure that it operates consistently with the views reflected by the changes arising from the LSF evolution. Other non-financial measures could also be relevant, for example, sustainable development goals and child poverty reduction threshold measures. In some situations, it would also be appropriate to consider these criteria. While it would be admirable to take into account nonfinancial measures in the tax system to achieve a more balanced position, we recommend that caution should prevail. Given the financial nature of tax it would be unlikely in many cases that nonfinancial measures would be relevant to the debate/assessment. This would make it difficult to embrace or seamlessly incorporate nonfinancial measures into the tax system. There is also a risk that using the tax system as the primary means of delivering social and environmental objectives would sacrifice certainty, simplicity, efficiency and coherence. Recommendations  The traditional measures of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence should be retained. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

However, we believe the working group should take advice on whether 30% of GDP is sustainable. New Zealand has an aging population – it is estimated that by 2036 approximately one in four and a half New Zealanders will be aged 65 or over. Thus, it is likely that a smaller working population will support a larger number of retirees. We do not believe that this income can be provided by the current New Zealand superannuation fund and understand that the Government will need further income over the next ten years to fund national superannuation and the increased health costs that will result from an ageing population. Individual income tax is our highest revenue earner at 40.2% of the total tax take. The current tax rules in relation to labour/personal exertion are broadly based on the premise of an employer/employee relationship, one workplace, and separate premises for work and home. This model is unlikely to truly reflect the workplace of the future, as more people embrace different ways of working and move to multiple revenue streams. The current PAYE rules do not apply to independent contractors. At present our tax system taxes the “gig economy” through withholding taxes and is reliant on each individual to get their tax correct. This is a key risk for the New Zealand tax take because of our reliance on individual income tax. The working group should consider whether changes in technology (within Inland Revenue and in business) will be sufficient to achieve the same level of revenue going forward, or whether further change is needed. In our view, the combination of the ageing population and the rise of the gig economy make it likely that New Zealand will need to rely more heavily on business taxation and/or consumption taxes in future. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Household saving has decreased over the last five years and the current level is -2.8% 5 . We believe the Tax Working Group should consider what level of savings is necessary to fund New Zealand’s future and whether the tax treatment of saving should change to incentivise further saving. The previous Labour led Government introduced the Kiwisaver scheme in 2007 to encourage more New Zealanders to save for their retirement. Prior to the scheme’s introduction, extensive changes were made to the taxation of savings. The principal change was the introduction of new tax rules for certain savings vehicles, or Portfolio Investment Entities. The new rules allowed income on savings in the PIE to be taxed at a lower rate than employment income and provided that capital gains derived in the PIE would be tax free. This latter change was made to replicate the tax treatment of a direct investor. However, New Zealand is unusual among OECD countries in that it requires taxpayers to save out of tax-paid income. Other OECD countries allow savings to be taken from pre-tax income. In considering whether we should change to a pre-tax model, we have listed the primary considerations below. Should we change from TTE? Pros Cons A model of EET would increase rate of savings Current model is well understood and works well Other countries have different regimes which result in complex transition rules (e.g., our rules around foreign super) which could be eliminated if our treatment was consistent with international norms Current model does not tax withdrawals. This is arguably “fairer” as it does not tax older people / those on fixed income Aging population – tax base may be more sustainable in future if we tax incomes of those of retirement age, including super 4 The OECD ranked New Zealand 17th out of 33 developed countries in 2015, with a 6 per cent national savings as a proportion of GDP. 5 https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/m6 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 14 The Tax Working Group should consider:  whether the scheme has been successful to date; and  whether a greater rate of saving is required; and, if so,  whether the current tax concessions are sufficient. International Corporate Tax Rate It is often said that international investors look at headline tax rates when deciding where to invest. New Zealand’s corporate tax rate of 28% is in the mid-range of OECD rates. New Zealand needs capital for infrastructure building. The Group should consider whether a lower headline rate would encourage international investment in New Zealand. This raises the question as to how sensitive international investors are to the corporate rate. To evaluate fully the tax imposed an investor should also consider that:  New Zealand has a full imputation system (although this is more relevant for residents)  New Zealand taxes worldwide income for residents but otherwise on a source basis It is also worth noting that most investors will consider the total cost of doing business here, not just the tax rate, and will also look at non-monetary considerations. We favour alignment of tax rates as much as possible to support the overall integrity of the tax system. A large differential between the top corporate, trust and personal rates would result in an increase in avoidance activity, which would then require further legislation. Where the business is owned by New Zealand resident investors, the corporate tax rate is essentially a withholding tax and the income is subject to tax at the shareholder level on pass-through. Country Corporate Tax Rate France 33% Australia 30% New Zealand 28% South Africa 28% United States 21% United Kingdom 19% Switzerland 18% Ireland 12.5% © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 15 If New Zealand needs to lower its headline corporate tax rate in order to remain competitive, we would recommend a lower corporate rate for non- residents only. Previous Tax Working Groups have considered introducing a lower corporate tax rate for non-residents and we believe this should be investigated further. Recommendation We recommend the Tax Working Group investigate the sensitivity of overseas investors to the corporate tax rate as part of any decision to reduce the rate. Permanent Establishment International tax models have traditionally used the permanent establishment as the taxing model for business. The OECD has retained the requirement for a physical presence as a necessary condition for determining the existence of a PE. The changing nature of business models means that a PE is no longer a reliable proxy for where an entity should pay its tax. Distance selling has allowed business to operate from low-tax jurisdictions and sell into high-tax jurisdictions. Thus it may be the case that high tax jurisdictions have lost some of their right to tax businesses operating in their country and low-tax jurisdictions have increased tax revenue as a result. To date the OECD BEPS project has not addressed the issue of how the international tax pie should be divided, i.e. whether a country’s “right to tax” should be determined on profit or revenue. This question is growing in importance with the exponential growth of the digital economy where businesses sell goods and services worldwide without the need for a physical presence in the country where its customers are. There are signs that some countries are acting to increase their share of the pie by moving toward a right to tax based on revenue. Examples include: India which imposes a six percent “equalisation tax” on digital advertising sold by Google and Facebook; and in March this year the European Commission proposed two new laws on the taxation of digital activities in the EU: a © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 16 corporate tax on profits generated from a “digital platform”; and an indirect tax on revenues created from selling online advertising space, digital intermediary activities, and selling data generated from user-provided information. The OECD position on taxing digital is still being developed and New Zealand needs to be a part of this international response. New Zealand has a lot to lose. If an OECD solution results in our exporters paying tax on sales in foreign jurisdictions without a corresponding increase in tax take for New Zealand for overseas businesses, any OECD solution may result in a reduction in Government revenue, rather than an increase. Recommendation We recommend that the Tax Working Group consider New Zealand’s revenue needs going forward before any changes are made to domestic tax legislation. In addition, we recommend that New Zealand remain an active participant at OECD level regarding the concept of a PE and a potential solution. Tax Administration Background For any good tax system to be “fair”, it must also be well administered It has been widely written about and agreed that the pillars of tax administration are fairness, transparency, equity and accountability. Inland Revenue’s role is to ensure willing and widespread compliance with the tax laws. Taxpayer’s trust and confidence in the tax system underpins voluntary compliance. Our submission considers:  the dispute process  the role of the tax agent  the role of audits “ We believe New Zealand’s tax system is built on sound principles but taxpayer’s confidence and trust in the system could be improved. ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 17 We believe New Zealand’s tax system is built on sound principles but taxpayer’s confidence and trust in the system could be improved. Dispute Process Disputes between Inland Revenue and taxpayers are unavoidable and are a part of the tax administration process. It has been stated that “the tax dispute process is vital to the health of the New Zealand tax regime. It provides the only method for resolving disagreements over the tax liability of citizens. As such, the procedure must not only be accessible for all taxpayers but manifestly be seen as fair and reasonable. Unfortunately, while the aims of the procedure are laudable, it is widely recognised the current New Zealand procedure has failed.” 6 It has been said “complying with tax liabilities should not be like walking through a minefield where an inadvertent error produces dire consequences. Taxpayers should be able to get on with their affairs while spending as little time and as few resources as possible while consulting the Income Tax Act or Goods and Services Act (GST Act) or seeking tax advice 7 ”. Due to the significant costs involved in the tax dispute process and the length of time it takes, taxpayers are being “burned off” by the process and are choosing not to pursue disputes as a consequence. The disputes process has been at times characterised by the Commissioner taking a position based on expediency rather than principle. The Commissioner should be required to follow her own arguments. At present the Commissioner is bound by any binding rulings but is otherwise free to disagree with herself if and when officials require. There should be further limits on her ability to disagree with herself. For example, Policy reports should be followed. It should not be open to other parts of Inland Revenue to take a different interpretation of the law when the Government intention is clear based on policy reports. 6 Developments in Tax Disputes Procedure – Another Step Backwards; Michael Lennard and Mark Keating 7 Briefing to the Incoming Minister of Revenue 2008 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 18 In our view a free independent Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) should be established. It will protect taxpayers’ rights and promote taxpayers’ confidence in the integrity and accountability of Inland Revenue. Its functions should be to:  assist individual and business taxpayers in resolving problems with Inland Revenue  identify areas in which taxpayers are having problems dealing with Inland Revenue;  propose changes, where possible, in administrative practices of Inland Revenue to mitigate those identified problems; and  identify potential legislative changes that may help mitigate such problems. This role could also be performed by the body having oversight of the GTTP process, rather than having two separate bodies. In our view the key consideration is that the body remains independent and reports to Parliament rather than the Commissioner or a member of Inland Revenue. Role of the Tax Agent Tax agents play a crucial intermediary role between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Tax agents contribute to the smooth functioning of the tax system and facilitate tax compliance. In collecting and collating information tax agents effectively act as an internal auditor, checking that the information is correct and consistent. The OECD has asserted that: “A strategy of positive engagement with tax advisors offers potentially significant benefits to all parties in the tax system. In particular, it can add to revenue bodies’ understanding of tax advisers and the role they play in the tax system, as well as understanding of their clients and broader developments in the economy. This, in turn, should result in improved risk and compliance strategies and better-focused information requests and dialogue with taxpayers, resulting in reduced compliance costs for all.” 8 8 Study into the Role of Tax Intermediaries; OECD 2008, pg. 14 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 19 Many tax agents are concerned that we are moving towards a future where tax compliance obligations will be encapsulated in a self-service system which will eliminate or minimise the need for tax agents. However, in our view it is essential that tax agents continue to be recognised for their contribution to the integrity of the tax system and that their role is not diminished. If taxpayers prepare returns without the oversight of tax agents, it is likely tax revenue would reduce. It should also be noted that tax agents are an invaluable source of knowledge and practical experience which may be drawn upon to develop more effective and efficient tax laws and administrative practice. Role of Audits Risk management is an essential tool for Inland Revenue. The increased amount of data available as a result of Business Transformation will be valuable if it reveals undetected problems. However, public confidence will be eroded if Inland Revenue is unwilling or does not have adequate resources to deal with this data. The OECD 9 suggest that “utilising audits to detect and visibly address and remedy cases of tax evasion is essential not so much for the revenue they generated in individual cases, but to maintain or enhance trust in the tax system”. At present trust in Inland Revenue is being eroded by the lack of commercial knowledge within the investigations area where Inland Revenue staff do not always view errors in a commercial context. In addition unnecessary admin structures and inefficient processing often result in a delayed process, creating uncertainty and frustration for the taxpayer. A trust approach, based on co-operation and persuasion, can increase trust and may lead to voluntary compliance. 9 The Changing Tax Compliance Environment and the Role of Tax Audit; OECD 2017, pg. 38 © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 20 Recommendation As noted above the tax system is built on sound principles but is not operating as effectively as it could. To improve effectiveness we recommend an independent Taxpayer Advocate Service be established; audit be adequately resourced and Inland Revenue continue to support tax agents. Shadow Economy The shadow economy has been defined simply as unreported economic activity. The shadow economy is made up of a broad scope of activities and behaviours including:  Undisclosed or under-reported income  Non-registered businesses  Expense manipulation or inflation including the claiming of private expenditure as a business deduction. Inland Revenue believes the New Zealand shadow economy is made up predominately of cash trade jobs, crimes, wages paid under the table, undeclared property sales and online trading. The Inland Revenue has been given additional funding of $83 million since 2010 to combat the shadow economy. This has proven to be money well spent as Inland Revenue uncovered $159 million in tax in the 2016 year and significant amounts in all years since 2010. Inland Revenue’s main focus has been on the hospitality and construction sectors, as international research has shown these industries to have the most risk of tax evasion. “ When other legal structures available to business are included... the shadow economy is likely to be in the excess of $1 billion per annum. This tax gap must be a focus for the Tax Working Group. ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 21 What is the Size of the New Zealand Shadow Economy? There have been many estimates of the size of the New Zealand shadow economy. However none has provided an appropriate level of analytical analysis or comparison to Inland Revenue business data to give any degree of confidence in their findings. Latest research from Victoria University in conjunction with Inland Revenue suggest that undeclared self-employed business tax is approximately $800 million. When other legal structures available to business are included the amount of undeclared tax from the shadow economy is likely to be in the excess of $1 billion per annum. Given the relative size of this tax gap, the shadow economy should be a focus for the Tax Working Group. OECD Strategies to Combat the Shadow Economy The OECD suggests three pillars for tax administration to deal with the shadow economy:  Educating taxpayers and making compliance simpler  Reducing the opportunities and increasing detection  Reinforcing social norms We agree that these multifaceted strategies and activities are appropriate for dealing with the shadow economy. However none of these strategies will in themselves provide a solution to non-compliance in the shadow economy. They are inter-dependent and will need to form part of a comprehensive cross- government strategy if meaningful change is to be achieved. Taxpayer education and simplicity of compliance The starting point is to make registration and payment of tax easier. The Government and Inland Revenue have made considerable progress in making registration for, and payment of, tax simpler and automatic. However this work needs to continue. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 22 Reducing the Opportunities and Increasing Detection The opportunity to work outside the tax system must be reduced and the chance to be detected increased. While we accept that Inland Revenue audit function is not the total solution to the shadow economy, there is still a need for Inland Revenue to have a strong and visible presence in the shadow economy. They must be appropriately resourced to put the required amount of pressure on those not complying. Inland Revenue’s use of digital information for targeting has increased. We recommend that Inland Revenue be funded appropriately to continue to increase its audit activities to detect and tax non-compliant taxpayers in the shadow economy. Reinforcing Social Norms The tax gap from the shadow economy impacts on the fairness and the integrity of the tax system as a whole. New Zealanders need to believe that the tax system is fair and user friendly and that all sectors pay their share. Any real success in taxing the shadow economy will only happen when there is a change in the community’s attitude to those operating in the shadow economy. There needs to be a shift in public attitude so that:  Undeclared cash jobs are considered not to be okay or just a perk of business  Tax fraud is not a victimless crime and affects all New Zealanders  Trading with those in the shadow economy is not ok. This can be achieved by wider public awareness campaigns (using multiple mediums) that are not just targeted at offenders but include the public as a whole. The message needs to be that the tax evaded by those operating in the shadow economy affects all New Zealanders’ as it limits the government’s ability to provide essential services. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 23 What Could This Additional Tax Do If Collected? If an extra $1 billion a year was collected from the shadow economy we would be able to significantly assist in reducing child poverty in New Zealand. The additional funds could assist in providing; school lunches, shoes and raincoats for children in need. In addition it could contribute to the provision of additional social housing, mental health units and further funding for the health system. The shadow economy’s potential tax gap is equivalent to the amount the government’s Provincial Growth Fund will invest in regional development. Recommendation Tax from the shadow economy is potentially the largest untapped revenue source available to the government. We recommend that additional resources be given to the Inland Revenue to increase their efforts in dealing with the shadow economy. This would ensure that the effect of the shadow economy is minimised and taxation due from this sector is collected. Dealing with the shadow economy and making significant in-roads into the tax gap will require a long term commitment and a multifaceted approach. Most importantly there needs to be a shift in attitude, so that “it’s not ok” for anyone to work in or deal with the shadow economy. This message should also come from the Tax Working Group. Role of Inland Revenue in New Zealand society Many individual taxpayers have no interaction with Inland Revenue at any time because their income is all taxed at source. Many like it that way. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 24 However, there are concerns that New Zealanders are becoming less financially literate and that there is less understanding of how we pay tax, and why. This lack of understanding affects the integrity of the tax system. The automated nature of tax administration means many taxpayers are not aware of the role of Inland Revenue. The Working Group should investigate whether it would be useful for Inland Revenue to have more contact with taxpayers. We suggest sending every taxpayer correspondence at the end of the year. The letter should say how much they have paid in income tax (or received, if net of Working for Families). The message should thank the taxpayer for their contribution and include a prompt to get in touch with Inland Revenue if they have received any other income Māori tax base The Māori business sector is now a significant component of and contributor to the New Zealand economy. The issue for the Tax Working Group is how Māori can help to create a fairer and future-focused tax system. The central question is how future changes in the economy will influence and be influenced by the tax system as the Māori economy continues to grow. At present, a specific regime applies for the taxation of Māori authorities and individuals who derive benefits from those organisations. All eligible persons who elect to be Māori authorities are taxed on income at the rate of 17.5%. The regime includes a credit attribution system similar to the company imputation regime. We understand that the policy rationale for the changes in the early 2000s still holds. This recognised the unique characteristics of the system for administering Māori Iwi assets and we believe requires continuation of a separate tax regime. We do not believe there is any particular need to change © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 25 the taxation of Māori authorities at the present time. However this will need to be monitored as the Māori business environment changes and develops further Recommendation We recommend no change is needed to the taxation of Māori authorities at the present time. However this will need to be monitored as the Māori business environment develops. Small Business Need for Reduction in Compliance, Complexity & Administration There is a need for the reform of small business taxation. Small businesses do not have the resources to comply that larger businesses do and this often results in inadvertent or known non-compliance. Simplification would make it easier for small businesses to voluntarily comply, which is the aim of the tax system. It is well known that complex taxes have a detrimental effect on an economy. In particular they:  reduce voluntary compliance  increase taxpayer and administrator error  increase taxpayers’ perceptions that the tax system is unfair  undermine the integrity of the tax system  increase the economic drag on businesses as they divert resources away from their most productive use Whilst compliance costs affect all businesses, they fall disproportionately on smaller businesses. Focusing on compliance cost reduction for small business will create growth across the small business sector. In our view there are four options for reform of small business taxation: 1. Limiting the application of various tax regimes © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 26 2. Introduce a single business tax 3. Presumptive taxes for very small businesses 4. Reduction of the corporate tax rate Limiting Application of Certain Regimes The “one size fits all” approach to taxation in New Zealand has given rise to complexity creep for smaller businesses. In the micro and small business context, rising complexity means disproportionately rising costs. An example of this was the changes to our fringe benefit tax rules when the multi-rate method of taxing fringe benefits was introduced. We do not believe that one size should always fit all. The Tax Working Group should consider the introduction of de Minimis thresholds for complex tax regimes that are complex to comply with but result in very little revenue for Government. The following are compliance cost intensive but result in disproportionately small adjustments for the taxpayer that do not generate significant Government revenue as a result:  Entertainment regime  Adjusting for private use of business motor vehicles (GST)  Business use of taxpayer home  FBT log books  Mixed use asset regime  Interest deductibility  Interaction of GST and Income tax adjustments  Thresholds for accruals adjustments The impact of compliance costs for each of these issues can be mitigated by either having:  a standard fixed deduction amount set by Inland Revenue;  a fixed adjustment rate; or  setting a small business de Minimis before a regime applies. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 27 A further consideration for start-up or small entities would be to allow losses to be carried back to past years (subject to appropriate size and related tax entity consolidation requirements). Loss continuity rules could be linked to a small business test instead of the present ownership test. The Tax Working Group should consider a suitable threshold for these exemptions but we believe a turnover of $1.2m would be appropriate. Single Business Taxation In 2011, our organisation (in its previous incarnation, as NZICA) researched and developed an alternative tax regime for small business with the aim of simplifying the tax system for those businesses and thus lowering compliance costs. The model would apply for small businesses with turnover of less than $1.2 m and would be based on GST. Our model was based on the “rule of one” – one return every month taking no more than one hour to complete. Criteria Features Turnover less than $1.2m Small business that trades through a company or partnership will be taxed analogously to a sole trader by taxing the entity based on the personal marginal tax rate structure Designed for more established businesses but could also be used for start-ups if desired Transactions such as dividends and salaries between the business entity and its owners are eliminated, as is the need to maintain an imputation credit account Income tax will be calculated on a cash basis on the GST return, as an adjustment to the GST result Income tax and GST will be calculated and paid two monthly on a simplified cash basis Like GST, income tax will be paid every two months: there will be no year-end adjustments, no provisional tax and no fringe benefit tax No balance date and square up issues Trading stock (except for livestock) purchases are deducted on a cash © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 28 basis – no need for stock takes for tax purposes No provisional tax, no fringe benefit tax and no entertainment tax Simplified rules for depreciation Last year the Government introduced the AIM provisional tax method – in part, to address some of the concerns we have raised. In our view, AIM is an example of an over engineered tax change for small business. It should have been a simple system based on “real cash flow” utilising accounting software to calculate provisional tax. What has eventuated is a system with multiple adjustments based on accounting concepts not on real cash flow. Moreover, AIM is a provisional tax option so does not solve the problem of the complexity faced by small businesses in completing income tax returns. AIM should be retained as a provisional tax option. It should be simplified so it mirrors cash flows with a limited number of adjustments and targeted for its intended audience – small business. However, Government needs to address complexity in the system for small businesses and to allow significant simplification for those businesses. Presumptive Taxes for Very Small Businesses At the same time as we developed our “rule of one” concept, we proposed a very simplified basis of taxation for micros business taxpayers. We considered a micro business to be someone who:  is unregistered for GST  has no employees  have a turnover of less than $60,000 at the time of opting to use this model  runs a small business or is in the process of business start up © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 29  is a person earning periodic cash receipts from “under the table” operations The tax paid will substitute for income and fringe benefit taxes (if applicable). More specifically, a final income tax rate of 15 percent will be paid on business turnover (later reduced to 7% for those retailing goods and 14 % for others)  Tax payments made monthly or at any time  No end of year tax returns  The micro tax of 15% includes a component for Accident Compensation levies Income for the purposes of social policy commitments (child support, student loans and working for families tax credits) is 50% of gross income. The income will be transferred to the taxpayer’s summary of earnings and no further income tax will be payable on this business income.  A transitional rule for people who earn cash “under the table” will give a 12 month window for people to enter the tax system without further repercussion for past year’s earnings from undeclared income from these sources provided all tax is correctly accounted for going forward This last point should assist to transition those from the shadow economy into voluntary compliance. At the present time this transition remains difficult. The Tax Working Group should also consider what other measures may encourage voluntary compliance from those in the shadow economy. Reduction of Corporate Tax Rate A lower or progressive tax rate for corporate taxpayers can be a fiscal stimulus for a small business. This would allow more cash to be retained in the business. However, there is a school of thought that says this would incentivise businesses to stay “small”. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 30 Feedback we have received from small businesses is that they are less concerned about the company tax rate than they are about the cost of complying with health and safety rules, costs of employment and managing their businesses cash flow and commercial risks. Thus, we do not believe a reduction in the corporate tax rate for small businesses would necessarily provide the fiscal stimulus required. While New Zealand retains its full imputation system the company tax rate for New Zealand residents it is in effect a withholding tax on future dividends. Under present rules dividends have 33% tax withheld either in the form of imputation credits or Resident withholding tax deducted from the cash dividend. A lower or progressive tax rate will only have a timing benefit for undistributed profits. Most small business profits are distributed as salaries or dividends in the year earned to cover drawings from the company by shareholders. Other Countries’ Experiences/Plans Australia has a number of income tax concessions for small businesses; simplified stock rules, simplified depreciation and immediate deductions for prepaid expenses plus a two-tier company tax rate for companies - a 2.5% concession for 2017/18 years moving to a 5% concession by 2026/27. Hong Kong is also to introduce a progressive business tax. From the 2018/19 year a rate for all businesses (irrespective of size and industry) taxing the first HK$2M of profits (subject to grouping rules) and at half the normal rate. Corporations 8.25%, normal rate 16.5%. Partnerships and sole traders 7.5% normal rate 15%. However, from speaking to Australian colleagues and businesses we understand that a bifurcated rate comes with a significant increase in complexity and compliance costs. Thus, it has not provided the desired fiscal stimulus to the Australian economy. As a result, we do not see a marginal/progressive corporate tax rate as fiscal stimulus to small business. We favour comprehensive changes to small “ We do not see a marginal/progressive corporate tax rate as fiscal stimulus to small business. ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Recommendations  There is a need to simplify tax and tax compliance for small business. Our one size tax system does not fit all. A “close enough is good enough” approach should be acceptable for small business taxation.  A low cost approach is to redesign the tax system for small businesses to allow for certain expense item either as a standard fixed deduction set by Inland Revenue or a fixed adjustment rate or setting appropriate small business de minims before a regime applies.  However, we believe the Tax Working Group should investigate a model where a small business is given the option to move to a single business tax reflecting the marginal tax rate of the shareholders/owners.  In addition, it should investigate introducing a form of presumptive taxation for micro businesses.  We do not see a marginal/progressive corporate tax rate as a fiscal stimulus to small business while the dividend imputation regime exists and do not believe this should be pursued. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 32 Tax on Capital The Tax Working Group has been tasked with reporting to Government on whether the tax system:  Operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth; and  Promotes the right balance between supporting the productive and speculative economies. This will require the Group to consider whether income from labour is overtaxed relative to capital and whether the tax base should be broadened to further tax capital. The taxation of capital has the potential to capture all investment returns, both income from savings/investment and the accretion in value of assets held. Savings are currently taxed as income with debate over the years as to whether it is appropriate to capture inflation within the return. This chapter will consider whether New Zealand should adopt a:  capital gains tax (CGT) and to what extent gains should be brought to tax;  Land tax; or  Wealth tax. It will also consider appropriate settings for the taxation of savings and whether any concessions should be provided to encourage saving for personal retirement. Capital Gains Tax Is a CGT required? In theory, introduction of a comprehensive CGT (inclusive of the family home) should broaden the tax base and facilitate a more efficient and equitable tax system. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 33 Proponents for a CGT argue that its absence supports investment in the speculative economy to the detriment of increased investment in the productive economy, impacting GDP growth and ultimately living standards. In this context the speculative economy has broadly been considered to comprise investment in residential property. Recent public focus has been limited to the investment in residential property for rental. Home ownership is still however an aspiration for most New Zealanders, with 64.8% living in owner occupied accommodation at the time of the 2013 Census. The Tax Working Group terms of reference specifically exclude the family home from a potential CGT. Given the relative level of owner occupied home ownership in New Zealand, this political expedient will limit the effectiveness of a CGT to address horizontal equity concerns (between those that own property and those that do not). The McLeod and Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group reviews of our tax system in 2001 and 2009 respectively both recommended that a CGT (which excludes the family home and is levied on realised gains) not be implemented. Both reviews expressed concerns about the increased complexity and costs associated with a CGT relative to the likely level of revenue that would be raised. Based on the work undertaken for this submission CA ANZ is not convinced that a comprehensive CGT is required or appropriate. Problem definition needed Careful consideration should be given to what the introduction of a CGT is seeking to address with our existing tax system (i.e. is our existing tax system absent a CGT deficient when measured against traditional and living standards frameworks?). Given the complexity and costs of compliance associated with a CGT, are their better alternatives to address any deficiency? The public’s perception of a CGT is limited to property. It is broadly viewed as a tax on the sale of physical assets, with residential rental property (considered “ CA ANZ is not convinced that a comprehensive CGT is required or appropriate ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 34 undertaxed) a proxy for the tax base. The reality of a comprehensive CGT is very different with coverage extending to intangibles, intellectual property rights and the extinguishment of rights. The Australian CGT events framework contained in Div. 104 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 - “CGT events” (whilst not necessarily comprehensive) provides a useful illustration of the breadth of property/dispositions to be covered in the design of a CGT:  \[A\] Disposal of a CGT asset;  \[B\] Use and enjoyment before title passes;  \[C\] End of a CGT asset (loss or destruction, cancellation, surrender etc.);  \[D\] Bringing into existence a CGT asset (creating contractual or other rights, granting an option etc.);  \[E\] Trusts (creating a trust over a CGT asset, transferring a CGT asset, disposal to/by beneficiary etc.);  \[F\] Leases (granting a lease, payments for changing a lease);  \[G\] Shares;  \[H\] Special capital receipts;  \[I\] Australian residency ends;  \[J\] CGT events relating to roll-overs;  \[K\] Other CGT events (CGT asset becomes trading stock, FOREX realisation etc.);  \[L\] Consolidated groups (tax cost base adjustments). A comprehensive CGT has to address all property rights, transfers and realisation events, and deal with valuation, measurement of gains and treatment of losses. Appropriate exemptions/concessions (either to assist compliance or as a compromise to ensure public support) then need to be added to the mix. There are numerous design considerations and tradeoffs. As a result CGT legislation is complex even by tax legislative standards, yet all taxpayers will potentially be affected and required to comply, unless sufficient © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 35 de Minimis exemption thresholds are in place. Specialist guidance would be required, increasing compliance costs. A comprehensive CGT which does not distinguish between income and capital gains does however have the ability to simply other aspects of our existing tax system. While it would not fully remove boundary issues, it would allow for the rationalisation or conversion to timing rules for various gains currently included in our income tax legislation. A CGT (particularly where less comprehensive) would need to be carefully integrated with specific tax regimes contained in our income tax legislation to ensure that the objectives and outcomes of those regimes are not distorted. Interaction with the international tax regime and in particular FDR and the active business exemption represent one such example. A number of countries with a CGT manage the later by having a participation exemption for gains on shares in active businesses. Relevant design issues The Tax Working Group submissions background paper refers to the design of a \[comprehensive\] CGT for Government consideration. A “comprehensive” CGT in reality will be something much less. The family home (a significant asset base) has already been excluded based on the Tax Working Group terms of reference. Other concessions and exclusions will also likely be required and could potentially include a form of roll over relief, de Minimis thresholds and removal of small business sales. Any gains are then likely to be taxed on a realised basis (in line with other countries taxing capital gains) impacting the efficiency of a CGT. While we do not support introduction of a comprehensive CGT, we have responded to your specific queries and provided comment on the relevant design issues with a CGT. Please refer to appendix 2 of our submission – “Capital Gains Tax Evaluation”. We question whether an outright exemption for the family home is appropriate. An alternative approach would be to include a dollar value © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 36 exclusion threshold and only tax gains above this threshold – targeting overcapitalisation. Some jurisdictions have set a specific dollar threshold (i.e. $1m). Regional property valuation variations could however be addressed with a separate threshold set for each region. This would have the risk of adding significant complexity and boundary issues. We also include as Appendix 3 a worked example prepared by our Rural Advisory Committee setting out the potential impacts of a CGT or land tax on a farming operation. The Tax Working Group should also be mindful of wider considerations and unintended consequences when evaluating a CGT:  Given the family home exclusion, introduction of a comprehensive CGT may have limited impact on the desired investment 10 in productive assets;  In the SME space business owners often borrow against their home or second property, using mortgage based financing to fund their business. Again this is often the best form of security to satisfy lenders and provides the best lending rates.  New products are often developed/trialed in New Zealand prior to taking to the main markets offshore. One factor in this equation is that we do not have a CGT. If a CGT is put in place, this development may simply move offshore, close to the ultimate markets, which would have a drastic impact on the ability to attract talent. This would additionally impact the innovative economy. Partial CGT options Partial CGT options include:  Retention of the status quo inclusive of the recently extended (five year) residential bright line test; 10 We note preferences for investment likely to be based on bank lending criteria © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 37  Introduction of a risk free return method (RFRM) on certain asset classes. A RFRM taxes everyone on an “average” return under a standard distribution bell curve plus margin. It uses a smaller asset pool than “all assets” under a wealth tax. The key decision (other than determining the margin) is about what assets to include. New Zealand currently has an RFRM on foreign portfolio shares in the form of the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. Possible extensions of an RFRM could include residential property and/or New Zealand shares. Inclusion of either would require careful consideration of existing income tax provisions and integration (shares - taxation of dividend income and the imputation system, residential property – the land taxing provisions). Pros An RFRM on residential rental properties would reduce/mitigate existing investment distortion and would eliminate any lock in issue associated with a CGT where roll over relief is provided. Cons An RFRM on residential rental property or New Zealand shares has the potential to subject the recipient to tax regardless of how the investment has actually performed. There may be insufficient cash flow to cover the taxes due. Retention of the status quo brings to tax a number of “capital gains” as ordinary income under our Income Tax Act. This currently includes (but is not limited to):  The taxation of property gains under the land taxing provisions;  Financial arrangement income;  Sale of personal property purchased with the intention of resale;  Sale of shares held on revenue account; © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 38  FDR on non-resident portfolio shares;  Various lease related inducements;  Various employment related (entry and exit) inducement payments. The (non) taxation of certain property gains has brought in to question the need for a CGT. Speculative property activity is, however, already subject to tax. Section CB 6 (the purpose and intention test) and the bright line buttress to it (CB 6A - now extended) should adequately address most mischief. In our view Inland Revenue has plenty of tools under the existing land taxing provisions to address speculative behavior and it should use these to greater effect. The arguments for a comprehensive CGT are substantially weakened when the family home is removed. Bank lending and New Zealand’s desire to own their own homes will ensure that housing remains a prominent form of investment savings. Property speculation does not include long term investment in residential property for rental. The speculative economy referred to by the Tax Working Group does, however, include this segment (although owner occupied housing is by far the largest component). If it is determined that gains from sale of properties used for residential rental should be subject to tax, this can be adequately dealt with via extension of the existing land taxing provisions. In our view, there is no need to introduce a comprehensive CGT with all of its complexities if the required practical effect can be achieved more simply on a targeted basis. “ In our view there is no need to introduce a comprehensive CGT with all of its complexities if the required practical effect can be achieved more simply on a targeted basis. ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 39 Recommendation CA ANZ recommends that the status quo be retained and that any extension to the taxation of speculative investments required are included within the Income Tax Act framework. Taxation of Savings If savings are to be tax-neutral (“fairness” criterion), any capital gains tax should apply across all types of savings. At present, housing is said to be tax- preferred. This is because many taxpayers borrow to fund real property investments, but fewer taxpayers borrow to fund equities. A deduction is allowed for the interest on the loan which results in lower taxable income for real property investors. The Government’s new proposals regarding the loss ring-fencing of rental properties may assist to level the playing field – however we believe these proposals will not assist with housing aff0rdability and should be considered only as part of a broader discussion. At present, PIEs do not pay tax on their capital gains. The rationale for this exemption was to replicate the tax treatment for direct investors so that the tax treatment would not be a disincentive for entering Kiwisaver. From a political point of view, any CGT would likely need to exclude PIEs or at least Kiwisaver funds. This suggests a further exemption is likely. In addition, CGT is incredibly complex for direct investment funds (wholesale funds in a fund-of-funds structure). They are required to track buy & sell dates of every investment. Fund managers usually use complex software and require at least one FTE resource to comply with the administration requirements. It is likely that these additional costs would be passed on to savers in the form of increased fund management fees. Thus, if the Government wishes to encourage further saving, it may not wish to impose a tax on the capital gains; or it would need to introduce additional incentives to encourage saving. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 40 Recommendation Any capital gains tax should include an exemption for Kiwisaver funds, and possibly for all savings vehicles. As we have discussed above, the wide range of exemptions that would be needed suggest an extension to existing rules, where required, would be a preferable solution to a comprehensive capital gains tax. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

To fully understand the nature and extent of the changes in this sector we need to peel back the surface and examine the underlying issues. Like Medusa, the issue is complex and multifaceted. It is not just all about robots and machines. Demographics (i.e. the ageing population, increasing life expectancies and falling birth rates) and the evolution of the ‘new world’ economy are also in the mix. Given the high level of reliance on the individual tax base the changes and challenges in the labour force cannot be ignored. Workplace of the Future The current tax rules in relation to labour/personal exertion is broadly based on the premises of an employer/employee relationship, one workplace, and separate places for work and home. This model is unlikely to truly reflect the workplace of the future. International and domestic borders are being eroded not only in relation to trade and commerce but also in the workforce. Studies predict that the number of independent contractors and remote workers will continue to increase. A growing number of these workers will offer and provide their services both domestically and overseas without having to relocate. Many will base themselves at home and may not necessarily have a separate office or designated area in the home from which they carry out their work. This mode of working is also becoming more common in the employer/employee model as more employers agree to flexible working arrangements. This merging of the workplace and home may give rise to difficulties in determining when a person’s activity is work related and when it is private. “ The tax system needs to be agile and flexible to quickly respond to emerging trends and changes in the way people work ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 42 Another developing change is the increasing number of individuals who frequently relocate across countries to perform services on a contract basis. This model will challenge the appropriateness or fairness of the current labour tax rules, for example, the 92-day rule for the taxation of personal services income, the 90-day rule under many of NZ’s DTAs, and the withholding tax rules. It is also predicted that it will become more common for an individual to have multiple jobs at any one time. Furthermore, the individual may be an employee in one job and a contractor in another. This will put pressure on the way in which an individual working multiple jobs or contracts is taxed, how much they are taxed and when they are taxed. The current tax system is slow to adapt to these changes. It often relies on business and taxpayers to identify and draw attention to inadequacies in the legislation or difficulties in compliance due to the new ways of working. In the future legislative responses will need to be made in a timely manner to minimise uncertainty and avoid stifling business confidence. We believe the tax system needs to be agile and flexible to quickly respond to emerging trends and changes in the way people work. It should facilitate and embrace, rather than dictate and constrain, how people work today and in the future. A tax system that supports the workforce and its structure will boost innovation and productivity. Future of Work/Technology Few would have predicted 30 years ago the revolutionary impact of technology on our lives. Things like the internet, social media, smart phones and the sharing economy have transformed not only the way we live but also the way we work. Technology has and will continue to define and redefine what work is, how it is performed, and by whom it is performed. It is imperative that the tax system be able to respond to these changes in a timely manner. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 43 Robots First came the computers. Now it is the rise of the machines – artificial intelligence and robotics. There is much discussion and many studies carried out about the risk and fear of robots taking peoples’ jobs – both blue and white collar jobs. This possible reduction in the labour force is a potential future risk to New Zealand’s tax base. The potential increase in the number of people whose jobs may be displaced by technology has led to suggestions of a ‘robot tax’ (a tax on the use of robots). The rationale of this tax is to slow down automation, help fund retraining of those who have been displaced by automation and/or to fund a universal income. Opponents of a robot tax say that such a tax would have a negative effect on the economy as it would stifle innovation, investment and business growth. It also overlooks the benefits that can be gained from automation, for example, improved efficiencies, increased productivity and cost savings. Furthermore, it ignores the many new jobs and opportunities that the use of technology will create. We believe this to be the better view. Automation is part of the solution to increasing productivity; increasing productivity will be part of the solution to the adverse effects of a reduced workforce. While it is not possible to determine the nature and number of new jobs that will come into existence, it is possible that they will exceed the number of jobs eliminated. If this were to be the case, the potential risk to the tax base from the number of workers displaced may be alleviated. The increased use of robotics and automation raises a number of practical difficulties such as: defining what a robot is (i.e. is it hardware or software), how to determine whether or not a person’s job has been displaced by a robot, and how to identify the point in time when the displacement occurs. In the international context automation may bring challenges to NZ’s tax base. For example, if a robot or other form of machine is imported/based in NZ © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 44 uncertainty may arise regarding whether this presence is sufficient to be a PE in NZ, or whether it is “substantial equipment”. The abovementioned issues only scratch the surface. These and other related issues will need to be worked through carefully and considered together with other wider government policies. Training/Retraining Costs With the probability of new jobs being created in the future, there will be a need for employees to retrain and learn new skills. This raises the question of whether the tax system should be used to ensure people have the right skills to remain employed/employable. Under the current tax system support may be provided by allowing a deduction and/or giving a tax credit. We note that an officials’ issues paper was released in November 2006 seeking feedback on the design of a skills training tax credit. Looking ahead we envisage that the tax treatment of training/education expenditure may require review as the future of work unfolds. Recommendations  Given the high level of reliance on the individual tax base the changes and challenges in the labour force cannot be ignored.  The tax system needs to be agile and flexible to quickly respond to emerging trends and changes in the way people work – it should facilitate and embrace the workplace of the future.  The Tax Working Group should consider the impact, both positive and negative, robots and automation will have on the labour force.  The future of work may require a review of the tax treatment of training/education expenditure. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

They can encourage healthier, safer and less polluting behaviour. A prime example is a “sugar tax” which has recently been the subject of much debate. A sugar tax is a tax or surcharge placed on fattening (unhealthy) foods or beverages with the aim of reducing obesity and improving the health of New Zealanders. Other corrective taxes include excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, as well as environmental taxes. Other tools that are available to the Government to modify behaviour include:  Regulation This involves imposing standards, targets or outright bans. For example, regulation has been used to reduce the harm caused by tobacco by: (1) prohibiting smoking in workplaces and other public areas; (2) prohibiting the promotion and advertising of tobacco products and tobacco sponsorship; and (3) controlling the sale and labelling of tobacco products (e.g. mandatory pictorial health warnings on tobacco products). Banning is also the tool used to prevent or reduce hard drug use.  Anti-product campaigns This involves Government using education and advertising campaigns. For example, there is strong evidence to suggest the use of mass media campaigns for reducing alcohol-impaired driving and alcohol related crashes is effective when implemented in conjunction with other ongoing prevention activities, such as high visibility enforcement. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 46 Our submission specifically considers whether there should be a greater role in the tax system for taxes, such as a sugar tax, that intentionally modify behaviours. Environmental taxes are considered separately below. Should Corrective Taxes be Part of the Tax System? Corrective taxes can be viewed as:  another source of revenue for the Government and used to reduce other taxes or boost spending; and/or  covering costs related to the taxed activity. For example, revenue from a sugar tax could be used to assist individuals in their battle with obesity by subsidising healthy foods and education; and/or  disincentivising behavior that is perceived to be detrimental to society or specific parts of the community and environment. On the other hand, corrective taxes:  are often regressive and people on lower incomes will pay disproportionately more of the tax than people on higher incomes;  impose costs on consumers;  can slow overall economic growth;  can have substantial distributional effects, creating winners and losers (consumers may substitute non-taxed products for taxed products);  reduce the benefits of other policies aimed at the same goal. The success of corrective taxes has been mixed. Denmark introduced a tax on products with a saturated fat above a certain level. It was abolished a year later as it failed to change eating habits, it encouraged cross-border trading, put local jobs at risk and was a bureaucratic nightmare for producers and retailers. “ CA ANZ does not support the use of additional corrective taxes, such as a ‘sugar tax’. The evidence to support the introduction a sugar tax is not compelling ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 47 In addition, it was viewed as another government revenue source rather than a health initiative. On the other hand, the use of corrective taxes to reduce the demand for tobacco and tobacco products and the associated health costs can be seen as a success story. Simply put, due to tax increases, tobacco has been priced out of reach of many. Tax has been a very effective tool in reducing consumption. However, it should be acknowledged that there has been a comprehensive campaign in all spheres of influence - health education, legislation, smoking cessation, and tobacco taxation. It is important to note that the campaign against smoking has been a long term strategy. Behavioural changes cannot be achieved by tax alone. A long term, sustained and adequately resourced campaign is also required. A whole of government approach with community support leads to success. Unfortunately, a by-product of the increase in the cost of tobacco has been an increase in the black market demand and criminal targeting of tobacco retailers. Recently tourism has undergone rapid growth and attention has been directed at the idea of taxing tourists (via a levy) to cover the cost of using our infrastructure (e.g. roads and public facilities) and going toward protecting and enhancing our natural environment. Tourists already contribute revenue through GST (they pay GST on all their purchases and, unlike other countries, GST is not refunded at the border on goods that they take back with them), petrol tax and border clearance levies. In addition, businesses which increase their revenue through tourism end up paying proportionately more tax with the increased economic activity. Recommendation CAANZ does not support the use of a “sugar tax”. The evidence to support the introduction of a sugar tax is not compelling. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 48 CAANZ does not support a tourist levy. The use of infrastructure by tourists varies. It will also often be confined to specific areas. A national levy could deter tourists who are price sensitive and object to being charged for infrastructure they do not use. GST collected from tourists should be sufficient. Targeted levies such as for use of walking in our national parks seem more appropriate. Ignoring environmental activities, we have not identified any additional products or activities where the use of a corrective tax should be used to modify behaviour. Environmental Sustainability Background New Zealand has an abundance of land and water and a temperate climate. It is well suited to a comfortable lifestyle and a range of industries. The world is short of land and freshwater, meaning New Zealand has a strong competitive advantage. In managing these natural resources, we need to balance economic imperative with sustainability. 11 “The Living Standards Framework” (Natural Capital) identifies the following environmental issues that New Zealand is facing:  Fresh water - Population growth, irrigation expansion and climate change are increasing pressure on freshwater quality, with the major risks being agricultural and urban storm water run-off;  Threatened species - More than 3000 of our native species are classified as threatened or at risk with around 800 at risk of extinction and the remainder vulnerable to small changes in the environment. Many of these are unique to New Zealand. Threats to biodiversity have the potential to reduce social and economic capital as well as natural capital 11 Future Inc - Developing a plan for New Zealand’s continued prosperity pg. 17 “ It is important we protect both New Zealand’s environment and economic growth ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 49  Climate change - Growing the economy while meeting emission reduction ambitions requires a focus on productivity, innovation, technology uptake and better environmental management. There are particular opportunities for New Zealand to build on our current strength as a highly efficient global food producer. It is important we protect both New Zealand’s environment and economic growth or at least minimise trade-offs. New Zealand’s largest export is ‘dairy’. It earns over $15 billion a year and is dependent on abundant land and water. Over the last decade dairy farmers have produced 23% more milk. However, it is imperative that we find smarter and more productive ways of using New Zealand’s natural capital while limiting the environmental degradation caused by farming. Good management of land and water is crucial. Damage to the environment can linger for many generations.

Environmental taxes can be classified as:  Cost covering charges – designed to cover the costs of environmental services and abatements;  Incentive taxes – designed to change the behaviour of producers and/or consumers;  Fiscal environmental taxes – designed primarily to raise revenues. Environmental taxes are only one of the possible environmental policy measures. Regulation, economic and suasive instruments are other types of measures that can be used to control activities that affect the environment. Regulation is more prescriptive. It is aimed at directly influencing environmental performance of polluters by regulating processes or products used, by abandoning or limiting the discharge of certain pollutants and/or by restricting activities to certain times, areas through licensing, setting of standards, zoning etc. Economic instruments use pricing to achieve the desired result, leaving producers and consumers free to decide how to respond. Economic instruments include charges, subsidies (designed to provide rewards to reduce negative environmental impacts), deposit refund systems, market creation and financial enforcement incentives. Suasive instruments seek to internalise “environmental awareness and responsibility into individual decision-making by applying pressure and/or persuasion either indirectly or directly. Examples include education and voluntary agreements reached through negotiation between industry and government. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

The ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions with the intention of creating a financial incentive for businesses to invest in technologies and practices that reduce emissions. It also encourages forest planting by allowing eligible foresters to earn New Zealand emission units (NZUs) as their trees grow and absorb carbon dioxide. ETS requires all sectors of New Zealand’s economy to report on their emissions and, with the exception of biological emissions from agriculture, to purchase and surrender emissions units to the Government for those emissions. In 2016-17 ETS entered a review process. Although this review process is still underway it was found the framework and settings are not fit for purpose after 2020. Quota Management System The cornerstone of New Zealand fisheries management is the Quota Management System (QSM). Under the QMS a yearly catch limit is set for every fish stock (a species of fish, shellfish or seaweed from a particular area). By controlling the amount of fish taken from each stock, the QMS helps keep New Zealand fisheries sustainable. Resource Management Act 1991 The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) is New Zealand’s primary piece of legislation that sets out how we should manage our environment. It is based on the principle of sustainable management which involves considering effects our activities have on the environment now and in the future when making resource management decisions. As well as managing air, soil, fresh water and coastal marine areas, the RMA regulates land use and the provision of infrastructure which are integral components of New Zealand’s planning system. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 53 Although the RMA provides an overarching guide on what’s best for our environment, with national direction on significant issues, it allows communities to make decisions on how their own environment is managed through regional and district resource management plans. Decisions on resource consents are made with consideration to these plans, national direction and the objectives in the RMA. This framework means that most decisions on resource management are made by local government which also have a wider planning role in transport, infrastructure and economic development.

In comparison, OECD estimates for New Zealand are 4.2% (2014). In 2013 the incidence of OECD environmentally related taxes was similar to that for New Zealand. Revenue was dominated by taxes on energy products which included motor vehicle fuels (69%) and motor vehicles and transport (28%). Other environmental taxes, such as those on resources and pollution, made up 3%, but unlike New Zealand, the share of these taxes across the OECD is growing. Scope The Tax Working Group has asked: Should current polluters incur the cost of any future financial loss being caused by their activity? Should they also pay for a possible loss in our future quality of life? This ties in with Treasury’s Living Standards Framework and sustainability “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without comprising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs”. Recommendation CAANZ is not convinced current polluters should incur the cost of any future financial loss being caused by their activity or pay for a possible loss in our future quality of life. First, it is not always possible to determine the extent of © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 55 any potential damage or identify the environmentally damaging pollutant or activity. For example, the long term environmental effects of genetically modified organisms is uncertain. Second, the economic problem of comparing costs and benefits is immeasurably more difficult in the area of environmental harm. Because environmental harm, together with any efforts to undo or mitigate the harm, takes place over decades or centuries the weighing of the costs and benefits involves both the current and future generations’ assessments of those costs. In our view the current policy measures in place (taxes and regulation) provide incentives for producers and consumers to change their behaviour towards a more eco-efficient use of resources; to simulate innovation and structural changes. Current measures such as regulation are aimed at minimising or eliminating environmental deterioration. As more environmental problems come to light, the policy response should be tailored to address the specific environmental problem. “ In our view the current policy measures in place provide incentives for producers and consumers to change their behaviour ” © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

GST was designed:  to be borne by the domestic household consumer and overseas visitor;  to be broad based (capture the widest range of goods and services with few exemptions);  to be a single rate but there are zero-rated supplies - e.g. exported goods and services (so that GST does not apply to items consumed outside of NZ), sale of going concern businesses, land (to manage cash flow and fiscal risk on large amounts of GST);  based on the destination principle (which prevents double taxation of goods and services traded between New Zealand and other countries as others apply this principle too);  to operate efficiently and impose the lowest possible compliance and administrative costs on New Zealand;  to reduce the extent to which GST distorts the relative prices that New Zealand businesses are paid for the sale of goods and services, and the relative prices they pay for their purchases. As acknowledged in the “Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper” New Zealand’s GST is amongst the most comprehensive in the world. In fact, the New Zealand GST system is rated as one of the best in the world because of its simplicity. Given that New Zealand has one of the most comprehensive GST regimes in the world we need to consider what changes, if any, should be made. Our submission specifically considers should: 1. the GST rate be changed? 2. the GST base be broadened? © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 57 3. the GST base be narrowed and if so what else should be taxed to make up for lost revenue? GST Rate New Zealand GST collections amount to 31.4% of the total tax collected in 2017 (10% of GDP). Notably, New Zealand has the sixth lowest rate of GST in the OECD. Whilst increasing the rate of GST is outside the scope of the Working Group’s review we make the following observations:  Lowering the rate should not be considered. The Government may need to raise revenue in the future and GST is likely to be the most efficient tax to raise that revenue. Broadening the base Given GST is our most efficient tax, we have considered whether the base should be broader. The measures we have considered are:  Narrowing the exemption for “financial services”, so that it no longer includes “arranging” a financial service;  Including residential property within the GST net; and;  Low value imported goods. Should financial transactions be subject to GST? Generally the supply of a financial service is an exempt supply (there is an exception for those that are zero rated because they are exported or supplied to a fully taxable business). The definition of “financial services” very broadly covers transactions that involve the provision of finance or services relating to finance (for example, the exchange of currency, the issue of a debt, the provision of a life insurance contract). The term also includes agreements to © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 58 carry out any of the defined activities, and arranging any of them, other than advising thereon. During the policy development of GST in 1984-1985, a number of options were considered and evaluated to establish whether financial services could be fully integrated into the GST base. Part of the difficulty with taxing the service component of a financial supply is measuring the payment for services supplied on a transaction-by transaction basis. Financial intermediaries earn income from the margin between the price charged for applying funds and the price charged for receiving funds, as in the case of banking, lending and borrowing. The substantial component of that price will represent interest, which is generally outside the scope of a consumption tax. The treatment of financial services was one such area where the practical difficulties associated with correctly applying the tax could not easily be resolved. Exemption was seen as the best option given these constraints as it included financial services within the GST base but did not have to address the measurement difficulties associated with charging GST on supplies of financial services. However, the New Zealand definition of “financial services” is wider than in many other countries. We have considered whether the base could be broadened by narrowing the definition. “Arranging” One way to narrow the definition would be to remove “arranging” a financial service from the definition of “financial services”. This could be done without encountering valuation problems because “arranging” is generally valued separately from the financial services. In the past, “arranging” has often been remunerated under commission © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 59 arrangements, but regulatory changes have meant that separate fees for financial advisors and other intermediaries are becoming more common. There are other countries that do not include “arranging” within their definition of financial services, such as Australia. It is likely that imposing GST on “arranging” of financial services would create tax “cascades” if the services are charged to financial service providers who cannot claim the GST back. This problem is not as severe as it would first seem however, because:  The GST will be claimable where it is directly attributable to an on-supply of a taxable service;  Financial service providers are able to zero rate supplies to fully taxable businesses, so are able to claim back a greater percentage of their input tax than they were when GST was first introduced. However, the primary difficulty with such a change is that it would create an in-source bias within the financial services industry. Financial services entities would prefer to obtain “arranging” services from within their own organisation so that they ae not required to pay GST, because any GST paid to a separate organisation will not be fully claimable. We do not believe that tax should drive business decisions. Thus, we do not believe any amendment should be made until it is possible to solve the issue of the in-source bias. Residential Property Supplies of residential property are currently exempt from GST. However, commercial property rentals (broadly, short term rents) are subject to GST. We have considered whether residential property should be brought within the GST net. However, the principal issue is that this would leave renters at a © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 60 disadvantage over property owners (who do not pay GST on the cost of mortgage repayments). One of the principal Government aims is to improve housing affordability. The above change would give home owners a significant advantage over those who rent. Therefore, we do not believe the change should be pursued. Low Value Imported Goods The GST base is at some risk as online shopping and the import of low-value goods (under approximately $400) increases. We understand that this has already been referred to and considered by the Tax Working Group. However, we consider that New Zealand needs to address the challenge and implement a strategy to protect the GST base in an efficient and effective way. Narrowing the Base Since the introduction of GST there have been suggestions by the public that the base is too broad and that GST should not be charged on particular “necessities”. We have considered whether GST should be removed from either of the following:  Fruit and vegetables; and/or  Health care costs. Fruit and Vegetables There have been calls for GST on “fresh food” to be removed to encourage the public, especially low income families, to eat more fruit and vegetables to the benefit of their health. Many countries justify reduced rates as a way of not penalising the poorest households who spend more of their income on food and clothing. However, research suggests reduced rates are rarely effective in achieving distributional objectives. The wealthy also benefit from reduced rates and as they consume more, they benefit more. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 61 Other countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK), also have high rates of obesity and low rates of fresh food consumption. However, the difference between New Zealand and the UK is that the UK has food exemptions on VAT. Despite the food exemptions, there is no evidence that food is more affordable and people in the UK are eating better than New Zealanders. In addition, removing GST from “fresh food” will:  result in increased compliance and administrative costs;  add complexity to what is now a relatively simple and efficient tax;  create boundary issues;  not make a difference to food affordability. Prices are mainly driven by elasticity of demand, supply constraints and competition. A reduction in GST is unlikely to be passed on to the consumer.  result in a reduction of GST revenue which must be offset by an increase in GST on other goods or an increase in other taxes. This is not the first time the issue of removing GST from food has been raised. The topic was subject to some debate when the Goods and Services Tax (Exemption of Healthy Food) Amendment Bill 2010 was introduced. The Bill did not receive enough support and did not survive its first reading. CA ANZ does not support removing GST from food. A reduction in GST is not an effective way of providing support to low income families. Targeted assistance should be provided through the social assistance programme. Health Care In New Zealand, health care services are subject to GST at the standard rate. Many other countries which charge a zero rate or exempt health care services. Their rationale for this is generally that health care is a necessity and should not incur an additional tax cost. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 62 However, we do not believe this is something that New Zealand should implement. We have already discussed New Zealand’s ageing population and the associated costs to the Government associated with the change in demographic. In addition, we understand that many elderly people (over the age of 80) are not big consumers. However, they do spend significant sums on health care. It is likely that the Government will need the revenue from GST on health care costs. In addition, we believe that this would create boundary issues that would increase compliance costs within the healthcare industry. Recommendation CA ANZ is of the view that the 2010 Tax Working Group recommendation for GST is still appropriate. GST should continue to apply broadly. There should be no exemptions. Narrowing the base will substantially increase administration and compliance costs and add complexity. CA ANZ also supports expanding the GST regime to include low value imported goods. Consideration should also be given to increasing the GST rate as part of a future package of broader policy measures. 63 Summary of Key Recommendations Current Tax System We do not consider that there is a need for urgent changes to the current tax policy settings. The Tax Working Group should identify strategies to manage or reduce the risk of relying heavily on the individual tax base and other potential risks (e.g. advances in technology) to the broader New Zealand tax base. We do not consider that there is a need in the short or medium term to move away from or replace the BBLR approach. GTPP should continue to be the lynch pin in shaping the New Zealand tax system. The Tax Working Group should consider introducing measures to ensure that GTPP is followed and hold the government and policy officials to account if it is not. Guiding Principles (Framework) The traditional measures of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence should be retained. Certainty and predictability should also be promoted. A blanket definition of “fairness” would be inappropriate. It would be helpful if the tax policy framework included a list of criteria that could be applied to measure and assess fairness. The tax system will need to be agile and flexible to ensure that it operates consistently with the evolving views formed through the living standards framework. Incorporating nonfinancial measures in the tax system should be done with caution. Challenges (Sustainability of the Tax System) The combination of the ageing population and the rise of the gig economy makes it likely that New Zealand will need to rely more heavily on business taxation in future. The Tax Working Group should consider whether the Kiwisaver scheme has been successful to date, whether a greater rate of saving is required and, if so, whether the current tax concessions are sufficient. We recommend the Tax Working Group investigate the sensitivity of overseas investors to the corporate tax rate as part of any decision to reduce the rate. We recommend that New Zealand remain an active participant at OECD level regarding the concept of a PE and a potential solution and that the Tax Working Group consider New Zealand’s revenue needs going forward before any changes are made to domestic tax legislation. The tax administration system is built on sound principles but is not operating as effectively as it could. To improve effectiveness we recommend an independent Taxpayer Advocate Service be established; audit be adequately resourced and Inland Revenue continue to support tax agents. 64 Tax from the shadow economy is potentially the largest untapped revenue source available to the government. Dealing with the shadow economy and making significant in-roads into the tax gap will require a long term commitment and a multifaceted approach. Most importantly there needs to be a shift in attitude. We recommend that every tax payer receives correspondence from Inland Revenue on an annual basis stating the amount of tax paid in the year. We recommend no change is needed to the taxation of Māori authorities at the present time. However this will need to be monitored as the Māori business environment develops. There is a need to simplify tax and tax compliance for small business. Our one size tax system does not fit all. A “close enough is good enough” approach should be acceptable for small business taxation. Tax on Capital CA ANZ recommends that the status quo be retained and that any extension to the taxation of speculative investments required are included within the Income Tax Act framework. Tax on Labour Given the high level of reliance on the individual tax base the changes and challenges in the labour force cannot be ignored. The tax system needs to be agile and flexible to quickly respond to emerging trends and changes in the way people work – it should facilitate and embrace the workplace of the future. The Tax Working Group should consider the impact, both positive and negative, robots and automation will have on the labour force. The future of work may require a review of the tax treatment of training/education expenditure. Given the high level of reliance on the individual tax base the changes and challenges in the labour force cannot be ignored. Corrective Taxes CA ANZ does not support the use of additional corrective taxes, such as a “sugar tax”. The evidence to support the introduction of more corrective taxes is not compelling. The use of a corrective tax to modify behaviour is a blunt tool that affects all consumers and takes away a consumer’s right to choose. CA ANZ does not support a tourist levy. The use of infrastructure by tourists varies. It will also often be confined to specific areas. A national levy could deter tourists who are price sensitive and object to being charged for infrastructure they do not use. GST collected from tourists should be sufficient. Targeted levies such as for use of walking in our national parks seem more appropriate. Environmental Sustainability CA ANZ is not convinced current polluters should incur the cost of any future financial loss being caused by their activity or pay for a possible loss in our future quality of life. First, it is not always possible to determine the extent of any potential damage or identify the environmentally damaging pollutant or activity. For example, the long term environmental effects of genetically modified organisms is uncertain. Second, the economic problem of comparing costs and benefits is immeasurably more difficult in the area of environmental harm. Because 65 environmental harm, together with any efforts to undo or mitigate the harm, takes place over decades or centuries the weighing of the costs and benefits involves both the current and future generations’ assessments of those costs. In our view the current policy measures in place provide incentives for producers and consumers to change their behaviour towards a more eco-efficient use of resources; to simulate innovation and structural changes. GST CA ANZ is of the view that the 2010 Tax Working Group recommendation for GST is still appropriate. GST should continue to apply broadly. There should be no exemptions. Narrowing the base will substantially increase administration and compliance costs and add complexity. CA ANZ also supports expanding the GST regime to include low value imported goods. Consideration should also be given to increasing the GST rate as part of a package of broader policy measures. 66 Appendix 1 In Response to Questions for Submitters The Future of the Environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important?  New Zealand’s ageing population and the rise of the “gig economy” mean New Zealand will be less able to rely on personal income tax in the future  It is possible that our headline corporate tax rate is too high for some international investors – and this sensitivity should be investigated  Potential OECD recommendations may affect New Zealand’s tax base and should be considered carefully before implementation  Our tax administration system is not operating as effectively as it could and we believe more trust in the integrity of the tax system is needed  Tax from businesses in the shadow economy could be a large revenue source for the New Zealand Government but at the present time it remains largely untaxed  There is a need for reform of small business taxation How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified?  The tax system may need to consider ways in which it can broaden the current bases to protect future Government revenue  The Tax Working Group should investigate the sensitivity of international investors to the headline corporate tax rate and should consider reducing the corporate tax rate for non-residents  New Zealand should consider carefully the OECD work on permanent establishments prior to enacting any domestic legislation and, in particular, the implications for New Zealand’s revenue base  The Government should establish an independent body to address taxpayer complaints and to ensure GTPP is being followed. This could be done as two separate bodies or as a single entity.  The Government has a great opportunity to increase tax revenue if it can effectively tax the shadow economy. This will requires a multifaceted approach, changes in societal norms and public acceptance.  The Government should introduce a separate tax regime for small business and presumptive taxes for micro businesses. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and This has not been addressed in our submission 67 kaitiakitanga) help create a more future- focussed tax system? Purposes and Principles of a Good Tax System What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, coherence How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? Fair treatment of those in similar circumstances and of those with differing abilities to pay tax; procedural fairness The Current New Zealand Tax System New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Yes however we believe the mix of taxes will change over the next twenty years and New Zealand will need to become less reliant on personal income tax Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? We have not identified any additional behaviours for which corrective taxes would be appropriate. However, if problems are identified in the future, the policy response, (regulation and/or tax) should be tailored to address the specific problem. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? The Tax Working Group should take advice on whether New Zealanders’ current level of saving is appropriate and, if not, we have suggested changes that could be made The Results of the Current Tax System Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? The Government’s recent tax amendments should go some way towards removing any bias towards speculative investment. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No – especially for small business where compliance costs fall disproportionately on them. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Protecting natural capital is best achieved through a combination of regulation, incentive and taxation. Our tax system has a part to play but we believe regulation is a better tool for behaviour change in the short to medium term. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of We have not addressed any preferential treatment for particular businesses or industries as part of our submission. 68 excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Thinking Outside the Current System What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? The disproportionate compliance costs for small businesses Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? No but we believe that the Government should look to increase tax compliance from those in the shadow economy as we believe this is the greatest untapped revenue source for Government Specific Challenges How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Housing affordability is impacted by multiple factors including; limitations on land supply (RMA impediments and land holding), demand in certain locations exacerbated by high levels of immigration, bank lending criteria. A multifaceted solution is required to address this problem. Taxations settings for property are but one component. Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? CA ANZ is of the view that there is no need to introduce a comprehensive CGT with all of its complexities if the required practical effect can be achieved more simply on a targeted basis. Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? CA ANZ does not recommend the introduction of a land tax that excludes the land under the family home. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? New Zealand currently uses a variety of measures, such as tax, subsidies and regulation, to address environmental issues. Any future measure to control environmental activities, not already covered, should be designed based on the specific facts. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Yes. We favour comprehensive simplification measures for small business tax. We do not see a progressive corporate tax rate as a fiscal stimulus for business. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? New Zealand’s GST system is rate as one of the best in the world and continues to be the best approach for New Zealand now and in the foreseeable future. 69 Appendix 2 Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Evaluation Key Design Considerations Comment a B c 1 Should CGT be a separate tax or part of income tax? Best taxed as part of income tax, holistic and simple rather than a separate Act. This is the most common approach internationally. If the purpose is to ensure that the tax base is broad, different gains should be taxed on the same or similar basis. 2 Should capital gains be taxed on realisation or accrual basis? In an idealistic world gains would be taxed as they accrue. This would tax the real economic income and avoids the distortions that a realisation basis can have. However this approach has not found favour anywhere in the world on implementation. It has clear cash flow impacts. Taxing on a realisation basis akin to transactional tax on asset disposal (issue as to what constitutes disposal), significantly decreases effectiveness of CGT (as do exemptions and concessions discussed below) 3 What assets should be covered? While CAANZ does not support the introduction of a CGT, if a CGT is to be introduced it should be comprehensive, covering not only physical assets but intangible property, rights and extinguishment of rights. However this broad base will increase the complexity. A comprehensive CGT would aid simplicity of design and administration, reducing complexity associated with threshold issues of exemption, exclusion, roll over relief, avoidance, and simplify boundary issues with existing income tax legislation ensuring coherence. The family home is a significant asset base and goes to the heart of the investment in productive assets debate. Its exclusion as a political expedience will significantly impact the effectiveness of a CGT and will likely create further distortions. It discriminates between home owners (especially those mortgage free) and renters. Alternative approaches could be to include the family home but provide a regionally based threshold exemption i.e. first $x to remove more modest houses in full, with balance subject to CGT. This could target over capitalisation or the "Mansion effect". However this will come with its own complexities and boundary issues that will make compliance very difficult. 3a Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be subject to tax? The tax treatment of assets held in these savings schemes should be consistent with assets held independently for retirement / long-term saving. Absent a deliberate concession to such saving, all investment gains would be subject to tax (income/CGT). 70 Key Design Considerations Comment 3b Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? On the basis that NZ residents are subject to income tax on worldwide income, assets held offshore should be subject to CGT (subject to a participation exemption regime for interest in active CFCs to match exiting international tax rules). To avoid double taxation a credit for foreign tax of similar type should be allowed. DTA impact would need to be considered more fully. Real property and land rich companies typically taxed in source country - fine as NZ would not be asserting primary taxing rights, treatment of shares may vary. 3c How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? If a relatively comprehensive CGT is introduced, gambling winnings should be taxed as a capital gain (note subject to rates/design issues it would not matter whether a capital gain or ordinary income - the later would need to be adjusted though to deal with working for families’ entitlements and parental support etc. Consideration would need to be given to a de Minimis to deal with minor Lotto, instant kiwi, school raffle winnings etc. An alternative would be to subject Lottery and TAB winnings to a withholding tax and collect on payment. Gifts would also need to be subject to CGT as an anti-avoidance mechanism but a pragmatic solution could be found with an appropriate de Minimis to exclude smaller personal items. 3d Should there be a de Minimis rule? There should be a de Minimis rule to reduce compliance costs and deal with personal gifts. An appropriate level would need to be established. One option would be to have a bright line annual exclusion. This will result in valuation requirements for items of more substantive value/ close to threshold. Given that CGT is a progressive tax, an annual exclusion could be set at a threshold level that excludes the majority of taxpayers from the CGT net without a large revenue or efficiency cost. 4 CGT events/realisation Further to 3 above a comprehensive CGT needs to address a myriad of CGT events and timing that realisation is triggered in its design. The Roadmap to CGT events in the Australian Legislation (ITAA 1997 Div. 104) provides a useful summary – A. Disposals; B. Use and enjoyment before title passes; C. End of CGT asset; D. Bringing into existence a CGT asset; E. Trusts; 71 Key Design Considerations Comment F. Leases; G. Shares; H. Special capital receipts; I. Australian residency ends; J. CGT events relating to roll-overs; K. Other CGT events; L. Consolidated groups etc. 4a How should matrimonial property settlements be treated? Treatment should be in line with existing relationship property transfers. Specifically a property transfer in these circumstances should be excluded for CGT purposes. This could be achieved via exemption, exclusion as a realisation event, or through some form of roll over relief. 4b How should disposal of assets on death be treated? Under a comprehensive CGT, disposal of assets on death would need to be treated as a CGT disposal/ realisation event and be subject to CGT. However we doubt that this would be politically acceptable. We expect that the treatment would be in line with existing rules on the disposal of assets on death. If death is considered to be a taxable event, it will be important from a design perspective that the transfer on death to an executor of an estate and then subsequently to the beneficiary does not create two disposals for CGT. An allowance or extended de Minimis in the year of death would deal with equity concerns re breach of threshold (bunching) due to a single realisation event i.e. death versus regular gifting over time. 4c How should emigration be handled? Important from an anti-avoidance perspective that people/organisations with large potential CGT liabilities not be able to escape CGT via migration to another country. We would expect that an emigration or cessation of residency is a CGT disposal event. 4d How should immigration be handled? The time at which immigrants enter the CGT taxing net needs to be carefully considered, including whether transitional residence rules extend. Assets will need to be valued either on expiration of the transitional residents’ period, on initial arrival or some combination of the above. Design considerations should take into account that some of our treaty partners preserve their rights to tax former residents for a period of time subsequent to emigration. 72 Key Design Considerations Comment 4e When should non-residents be subject to tax? From a design perspective non-residents should be subject to CGT on realisation of NZ sourced assets. The application of DTAs to CGT will need to be fully considered. It is noted that most conventions apply to substantially similar taxes imposed after the date of signing. NZ treaties typically retain taxing rights in the source country for immovable/real property and the sale of shares in land rich companies. The sale of moveable property/shares in non-land rich companies will however typically only be subject to tax in the non-residents home country. A limited number of treaties preserve a residual source taxing right for capital gains in circumstances where the DTA does not otherwise specifically allocate a taxing right. 4f How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Transfers of assets to or from a family trust should represent a CGT realisation event subject to CGT. If concessions are to apply, concessions provided to individuals should equally apply to a family trust i.e. family home exemption. 5 Should capital losses be ring fenced? If a comprehensive CGT were introduced and gains taxed at normal rates then on a coherent basis capital losses should be offset-able against all income. 6 Should there be roll over relief? Roll over relief will impact the effectiveness of a CGT in terms of revenue raised (i.e. it will generate a deferral) and can have a negative impact in terms of lock in to a particular asset type (i.e. typically based on like for like asset acquisitions). Whether a concession is provided (i.e. in the form of roll over relief) or certain targeted assets are specifically excluded from a CGT are key to design. For NZ business to remain competitive roll over relief should exist where gains are reinvested in similar assets or due to natural events such as earth quakes. From a policy perspective decisions will need to be made on how to address publicly or Iwi owned land. 7 Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? As with the taxation of income on savings there is often the call to only tax real as opposed to nominal gains (i.e. to exclude the effects of inflation). In a capital gains setting this will be more prevalent where either the rate of inflation is higher or the gain is derived over an extended period of time. Mitigating for the effects of inflation via for example indexation result in increased administrative cost/complexity. 73 Key Design Considerations Comment A more pragmatic solution would be to compensate for the effects of inflation via either the rate or rates of CGT imposed or the level of inclusion of capital gain subject to CGT (discussed in more detail below). Additionally it would be possible to differentiate between short and longer term gains with reduced inclusion/rate of CGT applied to the latter. 8 What should the rate of tax on capital gains be? This question should best be addressed in conjunction with the level of capital gain inclusion. There are a number of options: 100% inclusion at a flat rate (say 15%); 100% inclusion at full (normal) rates; 50% inclusion at above rates or marginal rates; or split inclusion or rate depending on the duration of time the asset has been held (i.e. short and long term gains threshold distinction). The main attraction of the first option (100% inclusion at flat rate) is its simplicity. From a tax policy design perspective it is however less progressive than the other options. 100% inclusion at normal rates is likely to bring the greatest integrity and coherence to the tax system as it largely eliminates the capital/revenue distinction. The downside to this option however is that it brings to tax nominal gains inclusive of inflation unless adopted in conjunction with indexation. A possible balance would be to tax at normal rates but provide for a 50% inclusion for long term gains (for example on assets held for 5 years or more). This would partially address inflation concerns. 9 How would a CGT integrate with current tax laws? This question is very much dependant on the level and extent of a CGT ultimately put up for consideration. There will still be a need to include within income all revenue gains/business income. The capital gain derived on sale of property should however be addressed within a CGT (unless the property is held for resale as part of the persons business - i.e. land taxing provisions relating to dealers / developers / builders). Existing cross over extensions taxing capital related gains as income could be removed from income and taxed as capital gains under a comprehensive CGT. There would be boundary issues as to whether certain deemed income gains should be unpicked or left within income i.e. the financial arrangement rules, lease inducements, inducements to take or leave employment etc. 74 Key Design Considerations Comment 10 What administrative implications would there be from a CGT? Administrative and compliance costs and overall complexity are often cited as arguments against the introduction of a CGT especially if the revenue uptake is likely to be modest. Depending on design there will potentially be greater inclusion of taxpayers having to file returns and obtain valuations. Threshold issues, integration with income taxing provisions, and anti-avoidance measures add to complexity. Compliance with CGT legislative requirements would be beyond the majority of average taxpayers necessitating the use of professionals and increasing compliance costs. 11 What rules should govern the transition into a CGT? The options include: assets acquired post introduction (pre CGT assets excluded = lock in effect); market valuation on introduction (fairer as includes all assets but resets value - most common); and all assets at original cost - retrospectively captures gains pre-implementation – not appropriate in general policy terms. Adoption of a valuation based approach removes legislative complexity around countering avoidance by taxpayers trying to shift investments into assets held prior to CGT introduction where pre-CGT assets are excluded (the Australian experience). A clear disadvantage of the valuation approach is that valuation is required. Valuation issues are likely to pose significant problems: cost; regulation of valuer’s; valuation issues/complexity around for example intangibles. There can be winners and losers. Capital losses prior to valuation date may be taxed. Key advantage of the assets acquired approach is that the tax status and the original investment decision making assumptions are preserved. 12 Other matters for consideration The impact on SMEs and innovation needs to be carefully considered in the design of a CGT. 75 Appendix 3 CA ANZ Rural Advisory Committee: Submission to the Tax Working Group This submission focusses on the impacts of additional taxes on parts of the farming sector that do not have sufficient cash flow to service those additional taxes. In particular this submission focuses on the impacts of the following on the farming sector by way of example:  Capital gains tax working on an accrual basis  Capital gains tax working on a realisation basis without roll-over relief  Land tax  Environmental taxes The example uses the Beef and Lamb economic service:  Sheep and beef farm survey results for 2008 to 2018 for North Island hard hill country east coast;  Sheep and Beef on farm inflation 2016 – 2017; This is publicly available information from the Beef and Lamb website. The survey shows the following average profit before:  Current income tax  Drawings for the farming family to live on;  Capital replacement costs in excess of depreciation If we take into account those items missing from the cash flow we estimate it would look like this: Beef + Lamb New Zealand Economic Service20-Mar-18 Sheep and Beef Farm Survey - $ Per Farm AnalysisNotes tab Class 3 N.I.

Generally this has resulted in on-farm capital infrastructure such as buildings and fencing getting older and in dis-repair instead of increases in farm debt. If we include an accrued capital gains tax based on 28% of gains in value of the capital value of the farm excluding homestead in the survey we get the following result: If we replace the capital gains tax with a land tax based on 1.5% of the capital value of the farms in the survey excluding the homestead we get the following result: It is difficult to guess what form environmental taxes will take, be they inclusion of agriculture in the ETS, nutrient taxes, water taxes etc. However, the environmental effects are caused by livestock so as a proxy if we assume a 1% tax on livestock value in the survey we get the following result: Beef + Lamb New Zealand Economic Service20-Mar-18 Sheep and Beef Farm Survey - $ Per Farm AnalysisNotes tab Class 3 N.I.

Examples would include:  Discourage farmers from retiring and allowing the next generation with the energy and enthusiasm to work the farm;  Prevent good farmers from selling existing farms to upscale;  Stop bad farmers from selling the land and letting better farmers work it. The interesting thing about all of these taxes is that because they are not an income tax they will impact those with the worst cash flow the most. If you look at the farm survey’s these are the classes of farm that have the least environmental impact. The only way for these farmers to respond to these increased costs and continue farming is to intensify their farming activities. That is the only way for them to respond is to increase the impact on the environment which is the opposite of what we understand the Government wants.

We work to empower individuals to resolve their problems and to strengthen communities. The person-to-person service provided by over 2,300 Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) volunteers is unique in New Zealand. From 84 locations around New Zealand, the CAB provides individuals with a free, impartial and confidential service of information, advice, advocacy and referral. In the 2016/2017 financial year we had over 520,000 interactions with clients, including over 200,000 in-depth enquiries where we offered information, advice and support across the gamut of issues that affect people in their daily lives. We use our experience with clients to seek socially just policies and services in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our submission Each year many people approach the CAB because they are struggling to make ends meet. Some of these people are in employment, sometimes working several jobs, some of them are clients of Work and Income (Ministry of Social Development), some are students, some are single people, some have families they are also supporting. The common factor for all of these people is insufficient income to meet their costs of living. These people need either more income, or reduced costs. In 1978, the NZ Government ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 11 of this Covenant states: \[1\] Page 2 of 3 Citizens Advice Bureau New Zealand Ngā Pou Whakawhirinaki o Aotearoa PO Box 24249 Level 4, 93 Boulcott St, Wellington 6011 Ph 04 471 2735 www.cab.org.nz policy@cab.org.nz The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. The States Parties will take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right... Ensuring that these basic needs are met for every person living in Aotearoa New Zealand should not be aspirational for our country. Yet it is apparent we do have poverty, homelessness and deprivation in New Zealand today. In 2016/2017, the CAB received over 7,000 enquiries from people who are either in receipt of income support or needing this. In addition to these enquiries, we have received over 5,500 enquiries each year for the past 7 years from people seeking food parcels, information and advice to help them in a situation of financial difficulty (apart from seeking income support) or assistance in situations of debt recovery or repossession. In 2015 we identified that people coming to us in situations of homeless had doubled in 5 years and often we couldn’t find them somewhere to stay for the night. We also identified that very vulnerable people were in this situation including children and pregnant women. Often there was nothing we could offer as there was no emergency housing available. This situation has changed little in the intervening years. We think the Tax Working Group should have as one of its priorities, consideration of how the tax system can be used to support people who are either not able to have their basic needs met or who struggle to do so on a day to day basis. For example - Is there a role for a Universal Basic Income or a threshold of income under which income tax is not paid? As the Working group notes on the Future Environment information sheet; “Taxation plays a major role in redressing inequality. How could it be done better?” One area of great concern is the hardship created by high effective marginal tax rates at the interface between the tax system and the welfare/social assistance system. These high effective marginal tax rates not only reduce the income of those who are already on very low incomes, they are also a cause of anxiety and confusion because of the complexity involved. This can lead to over-payments and debt, fueling further hardship. We strongly recommend that the Tax Working Group looks into this area, with the goal of reducing high effective marginal tax rates. It creates inequity in the tax system and contributes to poverty and deprivation, including for children. It must be addressed. Another area of inequity is GST. The Working Group notes that “lower-income households tend to pay a larger proportion of their income in GST” (Submissions Background Paper, p. 29). We know from our client enquiries that food is often treated as discretionary spending for low income individuals and families, with set costs that come with account obligations such as power and rent covered first. Unexpected or infrequent costs (doctor’s visits, school costs) often mean there is little money left for food. We are not experts on the tax system and the implications of removing GST on food but consider that as a possible mechanism for reducing costs for those experiencing hardship, it is certainly something to be explored.

We encourage the Tax Working Group to test each and every option it is considering against this goal. Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

Cancer Society supports a fair tax system that positively impacts on the wellbeing of all New Zealanders. The Cancer Society of New Zealand is a non-profit organisation which aims to minimise the incidence and impact of cancer on all those living in New Zealand. We work across the cancer continuum with key work areas that include health promotion, supportive care, provision of information and resources, and funding of research. Cancer is the single biggest cause of death in New Zealand(1) Cancer Society New Zealand makes both over-arching and specific recommendations regarding taxes on tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks. These products are associated with or cause cancer. Recommendation: The Cancer Society recommends the use (or increase) of excise tax on known carcinogens, such as tobacco and alcohol to reduce the consumption of carcinogens, and products which are shown to contribute to an increased risk of cancer, such as obesity. This will reduce the incidence of cancer and positively improve population health. 2.Summary: Reducing the incidence of cancer in New Zealand is a key mission of the Cancer Society. As noted on P26 of the Background Paper (BP) some tax systems aim to incentivise certain types of behaviour. Identified as eithertaxes based on externalities (social costs), or an activity that has individual harms or benefits that the individual may not be able or willing to act in their best interests. As noted in the BP currently in New Zealand tobacco and alcohol excise tax are examples of these, with recent calls for additional tax on sugary drinks being made. The Cancer Society is very supportive of a tax system that uses this approach, as it clearly works. TheLancet concludes thatTaxesare: “an underused instrument for the prevention of premature death and disease because they can discourage consumption of products like tobacco, alcohol, and sugary drinks” (2). There is clear evidence that additional taxes on harmful products positively incentivises people to make healthier choices, reducing consumption and uptake of these products, Taxing unhealthy products is supported internationally, and has been effective in New Zealand e.g. reducing smoking rates and reducing alcohol related harm. It can also be applied to unhealthy food and drinks to reduce rates of obesity. 3.The burden of cancer on New Zealand is significant and growing Most New Zealanders will have some experience of cancer, either personally or through a relative or friend(3). According to the most recent statistics from the Ministry of Health, there were 23,149 new cases of cancer in 2015(4) as well as 9615 deaths due to cancer(1). In comparison with other causes of death, cancer deaths represent almost one third of all deaths (approximately 30 %). This makes cancer the biggest killer in New Zealand(1). The cancer burden is not shared equally. In 2015, according to the Ministry of Health, Māori had a cancer registration rate of 420.2 per 100,000 Māori population, which was significantly higher than the rate for non-Māori (322.2 per 100,000 non-Māori population). Māori had a cancer mortality rate of 200.7 per 100,000 Māori population in comparison to the rate of 115.3 per 100,000 non-Māori population(4). As the population ages and more people are diagnosed with cancer earlier there is increasing demand on services to support that population. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer projections, New Zealand is expected to register approximately 34,000 new cancer cases and over 15,000 cancer related deaths in 2035(5). 4.Use of some consumable products is a significant cancer risk: There are products which are also considered carcinogenic in and of themselves, e.g. Tobacco and alcohol. There are also products that contribute to health concerns, such as obesity, which are a risk factor for cancer e.g. foods and drinks high in salt, fats and sugars(6) 5.Taxing harmful products works There is clear evidence that additional taxes on harmful products positively incentivises people to make healthier choices. This approach is supported internationally, and has been effective in New Zealand with regard to reducing smoking rates. It is also applicable to the health issues concerning alcohol consumption and obesity prevention. Due to the maturity of the tobacco control area the approaches undertaken have been well researched, evaluated and provide lessons for other areas of health concern. The World Health Organisation identifiesPrice and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco as a core provision in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control(7). In New Zealand a high excise tax on tobacco increases, as part of a comprehensive suite of tobacco control measures, has seen an overall reduction in adult smoking rates from 25% in 1996/97 to 16% in 2016, though Maori and Pacific rates are still much higher(8). 6.Cancer risk Tobacco, obesity and alcohol are leading risk factors for cancer that can be reduced by additional tax on associated products. Tobacco Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in New Zealand. Every year 5000 people die prematurely in New Zealand from smoking related illness(9). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in NZ, with the most recent report showing 1805 deaths recorded in 2015 (1) As well as being the leading cause of lung cancer, smoking also increases the risk of at least 14 other cancers including cancers of the mouth, pharynx (upper throat), nose and sinuses, larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet or food pipe), liver, pancreas, stomach, kidney, bowel, ovary, bladder, cervix, and some types of leukaemia (10). Every year more than 5000 New Zealand children start smoking, on average at 14 years(11). Obesity Obesity is the single biggest preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and is a significant and growing problem in New Zealand(3). Overweight or obesity are major risk factors for 11 cancers, as well as many other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (12). There is convincing evidence that greater body weight causes cancers of the oesophagus, pancreas, bowel, endometrium, stomach, gallbladder, liver, kidney, ovarian, prostate and breast (in post- menopausal women) (12). New Zealand has the third highest rate of adult obesity and the fourth highest rate of childhood obesity in OECD countries (13). Alcohol Alcohol has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organisations’s International Agency for Research on Cancer since 1988 (14). Drinking alcohol increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx (upper throat), larynx (voice box), oesophagus (food pipe), bowel, breast (in women) and liver (15) Alcohol consumption has been estimated as being responsible for 4.2% of all cancer deaths under 80 years of age in New Zealand (16). 7.Reducing cancer saves money Reducing the incidence of cancer will help reduce future pressure on the government’s health and overall budgets. With an aging population the health system will be continue to be under funding pressures, and as noted earlier New Zealand is expected to register approximately 34,000 new cancer cases and over 15,000 cancer related deaths in 2035. Reducing the burden of cancer on the overall health system, through the proven use of taxation on of tobacco, alcohol, and cancer related makes fiscal sense. 8.Conclusion: Reducing the incidence of cancer in New Zealand is a key mission of the Cancer Society. There is clear evidence that additional taxes on harmful products positively incentivises people to make healthier choices. This approach is supported internationally, and has been effective in New Zealand with regard to reducing smoking rates. It is also applicable to the health issues concerning alcohol consumption and obesity prevention. Acknowledgments: This submission draws upon other submissions.

We are aware that our submission will be released on the Tax Working Groups’ website, with our email withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply. It is noted that the Tax Working Group is looking at the overall framework for the New Zealand Tax System, and not the level or otherwise of specific taxes. However included as an appendix are recommendations for specific additional taxes for the TWG’s consideration or to recommend to further reviews or groups as appropriate. Yours Sincerely Mike Kernaghan Chief Executive \[1\] Appendix 1: Recommendations for specific additional tax to reduce cancer incidence: Tobacco: a.Government mandated tobacco prices: Tobacco tax system should include fixed retail prices and maximum prices before tax, providing an option to increase revenue without increasing the average tobacco price. b.Dedicated tax:Until 2025, the dedication of at least $100m of tobacco tax revenue annually creating an environment which minimises smoking uptake and supports smokers to quit. c.Tobacco tax rises:Continuing to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence,as long asa proportion of tobacco tax revenue is used for tobacco control, and smokefree policy changes are made to make it easier for smokers to quit. d.Loose tobacco:Ensuring that tobacco tax rates per weight of loose tobacco (roll your own - RYO) and factory made cigarettes do not encourage switching between products. Tobacco tax Tobacco tax increases are the most effective way of reducing smoking prevalence, initiation, consumption and inequalities in smoking (17). Continued tax increases are important if we are to achieve Government’s goal of Smokefree 2025 of under 5% of adults smoking. Tobacco taxes can be justified as a tool to reduce consumption and to address negative externalities of tobacco. During New Zealand’s recent period of annual tax increases, smoking prevalence has further declined along with tobacco sales. Tobacco tax rises have saved and will continue to save thousands of lives in Aotearoa. Tax increases help people to quit and remain smokefree. Crucially, tobacco taxes are very effective in helping prevent young people from experimenting with smoking, becoming addicted, and enduring a lifetime of addiction. The ASH year 10 survey shows that in 2016 only 2.2 % of year 10 student smoke daily, compared to 15.2% in 1999 (18). During 2001-2010, tobacco tax only increased in line with inflation. However, since 2010, there have been annual 10 % increases in tobacco tax, in addition to inflation adjustments. These larger increases have contributed to a 23% reduction in tobacco consumption per person (for the period 2010 to 2014) at about double the rate of that during 2000-2010 (19). For Māori, there have been encouraging results. Daily smoking among Māori fell by only 1.5% from 2006/7 to 2011/12 (from 39.2% to 37.7%), but fell by 5.2 per cent between 2011/12 and 2016/17 (from 37.7% to 32.5%)(20). Reducing inequalities There has been some concern expressed about the financial harm to smokers who don’t respond to tobacco tax increases (21). However, if taxation is combined with other comprehensive measures that promote quitting (i.e. mass media campaigns, enhanced support of Quitline, restrictions in nicotine content etc.), then this is likely to avoid increasing adverse effects on smokers who do not give up (21). Minimum tobacco price A minimum tobacco price would help ensure tax increases are even more effective. Currently tobacco companies reduce the effect of tobacco tax increases on smokers by a number of manipulative tactics, including phasing in price increases in stages and loading extra tax onto higher price brands to enable lower priced tobacco to remain at low prices (17, 22, 23). Dedicate tax revenue for prevention and quit services Cancer Society strongly supports revenue from tobacco taxes being dedicated for tobacco prevention and supporting people to quit. Ethically, the only justification for taxing tobacco is for health gain, not general revenue. New Zealanders, including smokers, are far more supportive of tobacco tax increases when they know that tax revenue will be used for tobacco control or supporting people to quit. Alcohol: a.alcohol excise rates to be raised by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% b.excise rates to be adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) c.Rates of excise tax should be calculated on alcohol content, not volume of beverage; If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. d.Alcohol taxes be implemented along with a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. e.The existing level of tax hypothecation should be increased. Costs of alcohol-related harm The estimated cost of alcohol-related harm to NZ society was $5.3 billion in 2005/6 (24). Alcohol use is a major contributor to health costs, lost productivity for businesses and to financial costs to society with crime, police and court time and incarceration. Cancer Society also recognises the harm alcohol has on other people including violent crime and road traffic deaths and injuries. All these problems help justify higher alcohol taxes. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Cancer Society believe that the rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol- related harm to society. Hazardous drinking Hazardous drinking increases the risk of adverse health and social outcomes for the drinker as well as others. The 2011/12 New Zealand Health Survey estimated that 530,000 New Zealanders aged 15 years and over (15 percent of the adult population) are hazardous drinkers (25). There continues to be significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori. Reducing harmful alcohol consumption is an important and under- emphasised strategy that can help to reduce cancer risk and other health and social costs. Raising the tax on alcohol will provide an incentive to reduce consumption and reduce the growing number of hazardous drinkers. Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been. Increasing the tax on alcohol has been widely recommended by health experts and through the comprehensive Law Commission Report (26) Tax alcohol content There is an opportunity to align the level of tax to the alcohol content of beverages rather than the type of drink (e.g. for wine). This would be fairer as currently some beverages are taxed by volume and others by alcohol content. It is the alcohol that causes the harm, not the type of beverage. Reducing Inequities Alcohol tax could particularly help prevent hazardous drinkers in low socio economic communities in New Zealand. This is because “Adult drinkers in the most deprived areas were 1.7 times more likely to be hazardous drinkers than adults in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnic differences” (27). Low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Minimum Unit Pricing Cancer Society also recommends a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to prevent the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Dedicate tax revenue Currently a very small proportion of alcohol tax goes to the Health Promotion Agency for alcohol-related health promotion. Cancer Society strongly supports increasing the tax revenue earmarked for prevention, including public health/ prevention work DHBs and NGOs are undertaking. Sugar sweetened beverages a.A tax on these beverages should be put in place along with other measures to decrease availability and consumption. Sugary Drinks Tax The Government needs to urgently act to prevent the growing obesity epidemic in New Zealand. The Minister of Health is interested in considering a broad tax on sugar in food and drink. The Tax Working Group can introduce a tax on sugary drinks as the first key step to reducing obesity in New Zealand. This would align with the World Health Organisation’s recommendation to tax sugary drinks (28). Revenue generated by a sugary drinks tax could be earmarked for obesity prevention initiatives particularly in low income communities. Why tax sugary drinks? It is well established that excess sugar is a major contributor to weight gain, obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Sugary drinks are the main source of sugar for children and young people. Recent research found there is more sugar in New Zealand drinks compared to Australia, Canada and the UK (29). A sugary drinks tax should be the first food/drink tax in New Zealand as it: ∂has the strongest evidence base ∂is focused on protecting children ( from dental decay, obesity and diabetes in adolescence and cancers in later life) ∂is a product with no nutritional value and empty calories The levy can be targeted at the beverage industry thereby promoting reformulation of the sugar content of drinks. WHO and the World Cancer Research Fund, along with The New Zealand Medical Association, the NZ Dental Association and many other national organisations recommend taxing sugary drinks. More countries are taxing sugary drinks A number of countries and American cities have introduced a tax on sugary drinks to address obesity and diabetes epidemics. Studies from Mexico, Hungary, Berkley, California and Philadephia, USA, all documented significant declines in sugary drinks consumption following introduction of sugary drinks tax. Low income communities, where obesity and diabetes have the highest prevalence, saw the largest declines in sugary drinks consumed (30). The UK recentlyintroduced a “soft drink industry levy”. A number of UK beverage manufacturers reformulated their beverages with a lower sugar content ahead of the sugar tax being implemented on 1 April 2018. One study reported a 10% reduction in sugar content of energy drinks in the UK. Public support sugary drinks tax The majority of the New Zealand public support a tax on sugary drinks with a strong increase in support since February 2014 (31). Public support would be strengthened further if revenue generated from a sugary drinks tax was used to support community wellbeing initiatives e.g. sports facilities in schools, fruit in schools, healthy school lunches, school dental services. Reducing inequalities Young people, especially Māori and Pacific youth, consume the highest amounts of sugary drinks in New Zealand. The WHO recognises that young people and low income consumers get the greatest health benefit from taxes as they are the most influenced by price (32). A tax on sugary drinks provides an evidenced based approach to reduce health inequalities. Source: Ministry of Health Some are concerned about a sugary drinks tax disproportionately impacting on low income communities. However high sugary drink intake, and its negative health consequences, disproportionately impacts on low income communities. Sugary drinks deliver empty calories with little or no nutrition. Evidence from countries that have introduced a sugary drinks tax found a higher decrease in consumption of sugary drinks in low socioeconomic communities. References: 1.Ministry of Health.
