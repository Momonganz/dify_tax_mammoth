\[Interpretation statement IS3175 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in September 2000\] ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION—DEPRECIATION INTRODUCTION This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on whether assets still under construction constitute “depreciable property’, as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and if so how the allowable deduction for depreciation is to be determined under subpart EG. In determining whether or not an asset still under construction can be depreciated for tax purposes, several criteria must be satisfied. Firstly, section EG 1(1) requires that the property in question must be owned by the taxpayer and must constitute “depreciable property”, as that term is defined in section OB 1. Secondly, the property must be used or available for use for some purpose by the taxpayer (section EG 2(1)). These criteria will be considered in this statement. As well, the method for calculating the deduction allowed for depreciation under section EG 2(1) will be addressed. LEGISLATION All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Section OB 1 defines the term “depreciable property as: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,– “Depreciable property”, in relation to any taxpayer,– (a) Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons– (i) In deriving gross income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; but (b) Does not include– (i) Trading stock of the taxpayer: (ii) Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in Schedule 16): (iii) Financial arrangements: (iv) Intangible property other than depreciable intangible property: (v) Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section EG 16: (vi) Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: (vii) Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive compensation for any decline in value on disposition of that property: (viii) Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): (ix) Property that the taxpayer elects under section EG 16A to treat as not depreciable: 1 2 Section EG 1(1) allows a deduction for depreciation: Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year. Section EG 2 prescribes the formula for calculating the allowable deduction for depreciation: (1) Subject to this Act and to subsection (2), the deduction allowed to a taxpayer for any income year on account of depreciation under section EG 1 for any depreciable property shall be the smallest of the following amounts: (a) In the case of property that is not schedule depreciable property, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a x b x c / 12 where– a is the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable in that income year to such property and to the depreciation method used by the taxpayer in respect of the property; and b is– (i) In any case where the diminishing value method is being used, the adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year before any deduction for depreciation in that income year has been made; and (ii) In any case where the straight-line method is being used, the cost of the property to the taxpayer (excluding any expenditure of the taxpayer allowed as a deduction under any provision of this Act other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and EG 18); and c is the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year in which the property is owned by the taxpayer and used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer: (b) In the case of schedule depreciable property, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a x b x c / 365 where– a is the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable in that income year to the property and to the depreciation method used by the taxpayer in respect of the property; and b is– (i) In any case where the diminishing value method is being used, the adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year before any deduction for depreciation in that income year has been made; and (ii) In any case where the straight-line method is being used, the cost of the property to the taxpayer; and c is the number of whole or part days in the income year in which the property is owned by the taxpayer and is used or available for use for the purposes of deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income: 3 (c) The adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year immediately before the deduction of any amount on account of depreciation for that income year: (d) Where the property is a motor vehicle to which section DH 1(3) applies, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: d x e where– d is the amount of the deduction calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of the motor vehicle; and e is the proportion of business use to total use of the vehicle for the income year (expressed as a decimal) calculated in accordance with sections DH 2 to DH 4: (e) where– (i) The property is, at any time during the income year, not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; and (ii) Any use other than in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income is not subject to fringe benefit tax under this Act; and (iii) The property is not a motor vehicle to which section DH 1(3) applies,– an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: d x f / g where– d is the amount of the deduction calculated under paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of the property; and f is the number of days or other appropriate units of measurement (whether relating to time, distance, or otherwise) in the income year (or in such lesser period as that property was owned by the taxpayer in that income year), being days or other appropriate units of measurement for which– (i) The property was physically used or operated to produce gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing gross income; or (ii) Fringe benefit tax was payable in respect of the use of the property; or (iii) The property was not physically used or operated for any purpose whatever but was available for the purpose set out in subparagraph (i); and g is the total number of days or other units of measurement (being the same units of time or other measurement as are used in item f) for which the depreciable property was used or available for use for any purpose in the income year (or in such lesser period as the property was owned by the taxpayer in that income year). ... 2(2A) In this section and in section EG 16, if at any time an asset owned by a taxpayer is temporarily under repair or under inspection, and if immediately before that time the asset was used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, the asset is to be regarded as available for use for either purpose during the period of repair or inspection. APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION 4 Depreciable property Before any asset can be depreciated, section EG 1(1) requires it to constitute “depreciable property” owned by the taxpayer. The term “depreciable property” is defined in section OB 1. According to this definition, an asset under construction by a taxpayer becomes depreciable property of that taxpayer when it is in such a state that it may reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Thus, before calculating the depreciation deduction allowable under section EG 2(1), three criteria must be met. Firstly, the asset under construction must constitute “property”. Secondly, it must be owned by the taxpayer. Thirdly, it must reasonably be expected under normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. These three criteria will be considered in turn. Property Firstly, the assets under construction must constitute “property”. The term “property” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of subpart EG (except that it includes consents granted in or after the 1996-97 income year under the Resource Management Act 1991) (definition of “property” in section OB 1). The ordinary meaning of the term, as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 8th ed., is as follows: 1 a something owned; a possession, esp. a house, land, etc. b Law the right to possession, use, etc. c possessions collectively, esp. real estate ... This gives a wide meaning to the term, with the two aspects of ownership or right to possession being similarly recognised in law, depending upon the context in which the term is used. For example, Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, 5 th ed., (London: Sweet & Maxwell Limited, 1986), at page 2,057, states: “Property” is the generic term for all that a person has dominion over. Its two leading divisions are (1) real, and (2) personal; ... Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary, 4 th ed., (Wellington: Butterworths of New Zealand Ltd, 1995) similarly states: property 1. A thing owned, that over which title is exercised, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal. 2. A title to or right of ownership in goods or other property. In order to determine the meaning of “property”, as that term is used in the definition of “depreciable property”, it is necessary to consider the context in which the term is used. As Nicholls LJ stated at page 953 of Kirby (Inspector of Taxes) v Thorn EMI plc \[1988\] 2 All ER 947: “Property” is not a term of art, but takes its meaning from its context and from its collocation in the document or Act of Parliament in which it is found and from the mischief with which that Act or 5 document is intended to deal: see Lord Porter in Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd \[1940\] 3 All ER 549 at 574 ... Applying the ordinary meaning of “property” to the definition of “depreciable property” in section OB 1, the term is used in the phrase “property of that taxpayer”. In its ordinary meaning, then, this connotes an item that is owned by the taxpayer or which the taxpayer has the right to possess and use. In the light of the wording of section EG 1(1), however, depreciable property not owned by the taxpayer will not qualify for a depreciation deduction. Hence, in the context in which it is used in the definition of “depreciable property” and in section EG 1(1), an asset under construction will constitute “property” according to its ordinary meaning provided it is a possession of the taxpayer; something which the taxpayer owns and has the right to use as desired. The concept of “property” being a thing that the taxpayer owns also fits with the legal sense of the term. Owned by the taxpayer Secondly, as noted above when considering the term “property”, the property consisting of assets under construction must be owned by the taxpayer in order to qualify for a depreciation deduction under section EG 1(1). An interpretation statement on the issue of the Commissioner’s view of what constitutes being “owned or acquired” is being prepared for future publication. Declining in value Thirdly, the assets under construction must reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Since a decline in value must reasonably be expected, the asset will generally have a limited useful life and an asset expected to retain its value or to appreciate in value over time will not meet this criterion. For example, an original work of art will not generally constitute depreciable property since it would not be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income (see the item on this issue in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 10, No 9 (September 1998) at page 12). Additionally, it is considered that in order to meet this criterion the whole or some part of the asset under construction must be able to be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. That is, the whole or part of the asset, as the case may be, must be in such a state that a person, at the point in time that a depreciation deduction is sought, could use it in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Actual use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for this purpose is not necessary to meet this criterion, given that the wording of the definition specifically includes property merely available for use. Nevertheless, whether the property is used, or merely available for use, in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is necessary for the property to be able to be used for this purpose. 6 Example 1 – raw materials Z Limited wishes to build a piece of machinery to use in its manufacturing business. It purchased all the component material in December 1998, but did not complete the machine until June 1999. At no time before its completion was the machine able to be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. No depreciable property exists until June 1999 when the machine is completed since, before completion, it could not be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Thus, since no depreciable property existed until June 1999, depreciation deductions will not be allowed before this time. Depreciation calculation Having determined that an asset under construction constitutes depreciable property, the deduction allowed for depreciation is calculated under section EG 2(1). This section details various formulæ in limbs (a) to (e) with the deduction allowed being the smaller of the values calculated under these limbs. Unlike the definition of “depreciable property”, the formulæ in section EG 2(1) focus on the use or availability for use by the taxpayer. This is an important distinction. Whereas it is conceivable that any piece of equipment, say, could meet the definition of “depreciable property”, no depreciation will be allowed unless the taxpayer will use it or has it available for use. Thus, it is considered that the better view of the wording of the formulæ in section EG 2(1) is that it favours the interpretation that a deduction for depreciation is only allowed when the “depreciable property” is in a state which the taxpayer uses it, or intends to use it for some purpose (i.e. it is available for such use). This is considered further when looking at incomplete assets. For non-schedule depreciable property, limb (a) of section EG 2(1) gives the maximum amount allowed to the taxpayer as a deduction. Limb (a) states that the depreciation deduction allowed to the taxpayer is equal to the annual depreciation rate for the asset being depreciated, multiplied by the cost or adjusted tax value of the depreciable property (depending upon whether the straight-line or diminishing value method is used). The value so obtained is then multiplied by the proportion of the income year (in months) that the depreciable property was owned by the taxpayer and used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer. This limb (or limb (b) in the case of schedule depreciable property) will apply in the case of assets whose construction is complete and which are wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. In this regard, under section EG 2(2A), temporary unavailability of depreciable property, while being repaired or inspected, is treated as a time when the property is being used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business 7 for the purpose of deriving gross income, provided that immediately before this time the depreciable property was so used or available for use. It follows that, given that the repair of assets will often be delayed until appropriate personnel are available to repair it, the legislative intent of section EG 2(2A) is that the provision would also apply when a damaged asset is awaiting repair, provided that immediately before the time the asset was damaged it was used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. This is because the asset would have been inspected after the damage occurred in order to ascertain the extent of the damage and the repair needed. However, in the context of section EG 2(2A), the word “repair” does not apply to reconstruction or the like. “Repair”, as a revenue concept versus a capital one, has been considered in the courts in the context of allowable deductions for income tax purposes. The better view of the use of the term “repair” in section EG 2(2A) is one that fits with the type of work, the cost of which would be an allowable deduction under section BD 2. Example 2 – temporary unavailability Y Limited has built itself a new $2 million factory, completing the construction in April 1999. The depreciation rate for the building is 1% per annum. The company did not shift its business into the new factory until July 1999, and in the meantime the factory stood empty. In June 1999, massive flooding caused damage to the empty factory, making it unusable until repairs were carried out at the end of that month. The company wishes to calculate the deduction allowed for depreciation for the income year ended 31 March 2000. Since the factory was available for use in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, immediately before the flood damage occurred, section EG 2(2A) deems the time that it was unavailable while awaiting repair and being repaired as a time when the property was being used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Hence, after its completion, the factory was at all times during the income year either used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Therefore, limb (a) of section EG 2(1) provides for a deduction for depreciation for the year ended 31 March 2000 of: 0.01 x 2,000,000 x 12 / 12 = $20,000 If the depreciable property is not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, and any other use is not subject to fringe benefit tax, limb (e) will generally apply. The two exceptions are motor vehicles subject to section DH 1(3), which will be subject to limb (d), and schedule depreciable property where limb (b) provides the formula for apportionment. 8 Limb (e) limits the deduction allowed for depreciation by apportioning the amount calculated under limb (a). The apportionment is calculated by determining the time, or other appropriate unit of measurement, in which: • the property is physically used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; or • fringe benefit tax is payable on its use; or • the property is not physically used for any purpose, but is available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, expressed as a fraction of the total time (or other appropriate unit of measurement) that the property is used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer. Regarding assets under construction, in two situations the asset will not be wholly used for deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income: • the asset is complete, but not wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; or • the asset is not yet complete, but nevertheless constitutes depreciable property, i.e. a part of the asset is capable of being used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Asset complete but not wholly used or available for use If an asset is complete, but is not being wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, a straightforward application of the formula in limb (e) is required, with the unit of measurement used being dependent upon the type of asset in consideration. Example 3 – completed asset not wholly used for deriving gross income X, a sole trader, has built a $120,000 house for renting out, completing it on 21 June 1999. The depreciation rate for the house is 2% SL per annum. However, although the owner advertised the availability of the house from the time of its completion until the end of September 1999, he was unable to find a tenant. From 1 October 1999, the owner allowed a refugee family to live in it at no cost for a fixed period of seven months (i.e. until 30 April 2000). On 30 April 2000, the refugee family shifted out and a rent-paying tenant shifted in. The owner wishes to calculate the depreciation deduction allowed for the income year ended 31 March 2000. As the house was used or available for use from its completion on 21 June 1999, the amount calculated under limb (a) of section EG 2(1), is: 0.02 x 120,000 x 10 / 12 = $2,000 9 While the house was occupied by the refugee family at no cost, it was not used nor available for use by X in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Therefore, an apportionment is required under limb (e) of section EG 2(1). The apportionment will be calculated according to the number of days that the house was available for use in deriving gross income (i.e. 22 June 1999 to 30 September 1999, inclusive) expressed as a ratio of the number of days in the income year that it was used or available for use for any purpose (i.e. 22 June 1999 to 31 March 2000, inclusive), giving a deduction of: 2,000 x 101 / 284 = $711.27 Asset incomplete but a part is capable of use An issue arises where an asset’s construction is not yet complete, but a part is capable of being used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. In this situation, as emphasised at the beginning of this discussion on the calculation of depreciation, the use or availability for use of the completed part, which will determine the depreciation deduction allowed, must be that of the taxpayer in question. Because a part of a yet to be completed asset is capable of some use, or could be used by some other person in deriving gross income, does not mean that any deduction is allowed under section EG 2. Bearing this in mind, in this situation the application of limb (e) is also appropriate, since the incomplete asset cannot be wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income (sublimb (i)). However, it is acknowledged that the specific wording of the formula in the limb creates some difficulties in applying it to such a situation. This can be seen from item “f” of the formula which envisages that the depreciable property will be wholly used by the taxpayer but for only some of the time, or for only some of the distance travelled, etc. In the case of an incomplete asset, but where a part is capable of being used by the taxpayer, it is only that part which will be used – the whole cannot be used because it has yet to be completed. However, since the incomplete asset constitutes property owned by the taxpayer that had a cost, and is being used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is considered that in such a situation a court would interpret the wording of the formula broadly in order to allow a depreciation deduction. Therefore, in order to apply the formula to the case of an asset under construction, where a part is used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is necessary to apportion the depreciation deduction allowed under limb (a) by comparing the completed part to the whole asset to be constructed. While the wording of the formula is not ideal to effect this comparison, it is considered that a court would adopt an apportionment reflecting the cost of that part of the asset that is capable of being used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for this 10 purpose (and is not used for another purpose), expressed as a ratio of the cost to date of the asset being constructed. Such an approach is consistent with the statutory interpretation principles outlined by Lord Donovan in Mangin v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 591 at page 594: Thirdly, the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the Legislature it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If therefore a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an interpretation may be adopted. In this regard, the legislative intent of section EG 2(1) was to apportion the deduction for depreciation allowed under limb (a) when depreciable property was not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Except for specific types of property (e.g. schedule depreciable property and motor vehicles), no other limb of section EG 2(1) allows for such an apportionment except for limb (e). Therefore, it is considered that limb (e) was intended by legislature to deal with all other situations where the depreciable property was not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. An apportionment by way of a cost comparison gives a fair result that a court would be likely to adopt. It is acknowledged that this approach requires the costs between the completed part and incomplete parts to be apportioned. In some instances it will be possible to directly attribute certain expenditure to the complete or incomplete parts, as the case may be. For example, wallpapering and carpeting the completed ground floor of a building is directly attributable to that part, whereas a lift servicing the upper floors is directly attributable to those floors and not attributable to a completed ground floor. In other situations, it is necessary to apportion costs between the complete and incomplete portions. For example, since the foundations of a five-storey building equally support all floors, the cost of the foundations could be apportioned equally across the five floors. Whether certain expenditure should be apportioned equally or not, however, will depend upon the particular facts. For example, where the painting costs of the exterior of a four-storey building need to be apportioned, and the ground floor is twice the height of each of the other floors, an equal apportionment would not be appropriate since twice as much paint and painting time would be needed for the ground floor. In these circumstances, an appropriate apportionment of the expenditure on paint and painting would be 2 / 5 for the ground floor and 3 / 5 for the remainder. Example 4 – incomplete asset partly available for use W Limited is building a 10-storey office block to be depreciated at 1% per annum. In July 1999, the bottom floor was completed and available for leasing out as retail space. The space was duly leased in September 1999. The remaining floors were not completed until May 2000, with no part able to be used before that time in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. 11 The company wishes to calculate the depreciation deduction allowed for the income year ended 31 March 2000. At 31 March 2000, a total of $5 million has been spent on the building. Of this total, $650,000 has been spent fitting out the bottom floor. A further $500,000 has been incurred on installing the lift. All other expenditure is considered to be attributable to each floor equally. Following completion of the bottom floor, (i.e. July 1999), the Commissioner considers that the better interpretation of the law is that the entire office block constitutes depreciable property since it was property owned by the company, which was able to be used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, and which would reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while so used or available for use. Hence, subject to section EG 2(1), a deduction for depreciation will be allowed. The amount calculated under limb (a) of section EG 2(1) for the income year ended 31 March 2000 is: 0.01 x 5,000,000 x 9 / 12 = $37,500 Under limb (e) of section EG 2(1), this amount is apportioned according to the cost of the bottom floor as a proportion of the total cost to date for the building. The cost of the bottom floor is as follows: Fitting out the floor 650,000 Lift (considered to be attributable to the upper floors only) - All other costs ( 1 / 10 x (5,000,000 – 650,000 – 500,000)) 385,000 $1,035,000 Applying the formula in limb (e) of section EG 2(1) gives a deduction of: 37,500 x 1,035,000 / 5,000,000 = $7,762.50
\[Interpretation statement IS3229 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in September 2002\] DEDUCTIBILITY OF SPONSORSHIP EXPENDITURE Introduction This interpretation statement contains guidelines that the Commissioner considers relevant in determining whether sponsorship expenditure is deductible under the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This statement replaces the Commissioner’s statement, Deducting sponsorship as advertising expenditure, in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 4 (October 1994) at pages 1 and 2. All legislative references in this statement are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Summary Sponsorship expenditure will be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1) where a nexus exists between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. • There must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity. • This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure. The determination of the taxpayer’s purpose or purposes will require an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure. • In relation to limb (b)(ii), expenditure will be deductible where it is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. • Voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income- earning ends. • In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material to the issue of deductibility. • The fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred does not preclude that expenditure from being deductible. In order for the nexus test to be satisfied, the taxpayer needs to show that he or she intended that the business would be promoted by incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In this regard, the following objective factors will support a taxpayer’s contention that he or she intended that the business be promoted by the expenditure: • The specific terms of the sponsorship arrangement, e.g. Is there a specific requirement for the recipient to promote the taxpayer’s business? What is the extent and prominence of the business exposure specified in the agreement? 1 • The place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy. For example, if a business’s market research has identified that potential customers frequently attend cultural events, then part of its marketing strategy may be to sponsor such events in return for its name and products being promoted during the event. • The relationship between the market or potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. For example, market exposure at a tennis tournament is directly related to the business of a sports equipment retailer. • The relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income derived, i.e. can it be shown that the expenditure resulted in income being derived? For example, the sale of 10 tractors at an agricultural field-day, by a tractor manufacturer sponsoring the event in return for being able to display the tractors, shows a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the derivation of income. Deductibility of the sponsorship expenditure is subject to section BD 2(2), which prohibits deductions for expenditure of a capital or private or domestic nature. From an analysis of case law pertaining to the capital / revenue distinction the following seven tests are identified: • the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure; • whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature; • whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset; • whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of an enduring benefit to the business; • whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit-making process; • whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital; • the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. The indicia developed by the Courts to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure are not necessarily all relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. Of the various indicia analysed, it would appear that the identifiable asset test is the most important. While the enduring advantage test appears relevant, frequently the nature of the enduring benefit resulting from the sponsorship expenditure will not be such as to warrant a capital classification because the benefit is intrinsically linked to the means of exposure. An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the sponsorship expenditure, in whole or part, relates exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature (e.g. private enjoyment) accrues to the recipient of sponsorship expenditure, or to any other person, but this benefit is incidental to the payer’s income-earning or business activity, then the deduction is not prohibited. 2 Section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year to that portion of the sponsorship expenditure which relates to the current income year. Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to goods used in that year in deriving gross income. Where the expenditure relates to a payment for services, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to the amount incurred on services performed in that year. Where the expenditure relates to a chose in action, the deduction is deferred for the portion relating to the unexpired part of the period that the chose is enforceable. If sponsorship expenditure is incurred in relation to depreciable property (as defined in section OB 1), a deduction will be allowed for depreciation as determined under section EG 2. The amount of the deduction is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. What is “sponsorship”? For the purposes of this statement it is first necessary to identify what type of expenditure is being considered, i.e. what type of expenditure constitutes sponsorship expenditure. The term “sponsorship” is used to cover a wide range of situations, with the usage reflecting considerable overlap with the concepts of “advertising”, at one end of a continuum, and “donations” at the other end. At one extreme, the taxpayer’s sole purpose is to “advertise” / promote the business with the amount incurred reflecting market forces and what he or she considers will best achieve the purpose of business promotion. At the other extreme, the taxpayer’s “donation” is for the sole purpose of benefiting the donee and business promotion is not contemplated or is merely incidental to the philanthropic purpose. In between these two extremes, the taxpayer intends to promote his or her business in some manner when incurring the expenditure, but the expenditure made also benefits the recipient (or some other person) in a manner unrelated to the ordinary receipt of income from his or her income-earning activities. This statement does not consider expenditure at the extremes of the continuum, i.e. expenditure made to commercial advertising media, at one end of the continuum, and charitable donations where business promotion is not a purpose, at the other end of the continuum. Instead, the statement focuses on the deductibility of expenditure in the middle of the continuum (referred to in this statement as “sponsorship expenditure”), i.e. where the taxpayer making the expenditure intends that his or her business will be promoted in some way, but that the recipient, or some other person, will also be benefited in some manner other than by the receipt of ordinary income from business or income-earning activities. Legislation Whether or not sponsorship expenditure is an allowable deduction is determined under section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which reads as follows: (1) An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer ... (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss 3 (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or ... (2) An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is (a) of a private or domestic nature, or ... (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or ... Section EF 1 concerns accrual expenditure: (1) Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure– (a) That expenditure is allowed as a deduction when it is incurred in accordance with this Act; and (b) The unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year shall be included in the gross income of the person for that income year and shall be allowed as a deduction in the following income year. ... (5) The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be– (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income:\] (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c) Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. ... (7) In this section– “Goods” means all real or personal property; but does not include choses in action or money: “Services” means anything which is not goods or money or a chose in action. ... General principles The usual approach for determining whether or not expenditure is deductible is first to consider the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1) i.e. whether the expenditure was “incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income” (limb (b)(i)) or whether the expenditure was “necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income” (limb (b)(ii)). Having determined that the expenditure meets the criteria in section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to determine whether or not any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply. For expenditure to be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1), there must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 at p. 61,240; Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 at p. 61,274). This requires a 4 determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure (Buckley & Young at p. 61,274). In this regard, the character of the receipt in the hands of the recipient is not determinative (Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at pp. 350-351). In relation to limb (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1), the function of the term “necessarily” was considered by Dixon CJ in FCT v Snowden & Wilson Proprietary Limited (1958) 99 CLR 431 at p. 436: The word “necessarily” does, however, seem to me to require consideration. Clearly its operation is to place a qualification upon the degree of connection between the expenditure and the carrying on of the business which might suffice in the absence of such a qualification. In The Commonwealth and The Post-Master General v Progress Advertising Agency Co Pty Ltd Higgins J supplied an interpretation of “necessary” as not meaning essentially necessary but as meaning appropriate, plainly adapted to the needs of a department carrying out an Act. That was in another connection but the phrase was availed of by the Court in \[Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47\] as throwing light on the use of the word “necessarily” in s.51 (1). Clearly the expression is used in relation to business. Logical necessity is not a thing to be predicated of business expenditure. What is meant by the qualification is that the expenditure must be dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. \[Emphasis added\] “Necessarily” was also considered in Europa Oil (N.Z.) Limited v CIR (No. 2) (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA). At p. 61,208, Beattie J reiterated that logical necessity was not predicated by business expenditure, i.e. merely because a business expends money does not mean, of itself, that the expenditure was necessarily incurred. McCarthy P at p. 61,196 stated that the determination of whether or not expenditure was necessarily incurred requires “a judgment based on common sense and business realities”, but that the ordinary meaning of “necessarily” connotes that the expenditure will not be the result of an entirely free choice, but will have been dictated by the surrounding circumstances. Richmond J at p. 61,205 noted that while the term “necessarily” has a restrictive sense, it also has a sense of entitlement, in that a taxpayer who has had to incur expenditure in the course of business should be able to claim a deduction for it. Support for the view that the term “necessarily” should be read down to mean that expenditure must be directed toward business ends, as opposed to being absolutely essential, can be found in Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd v Bruce \[1915\] AC 433 at p. 449 and British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1926\] AC 205 at pp. 211-212 which held that voluntary expenditure may be deductible. In the appeal from the Court of Appeal decision in Europa (No. 2), reported at Europa Oil (NZ) Limited v CIR (No. 2); CIR v Europa Oil (NZ) Limited (No. 2) (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 (PC), the majority of the Privy Council at p. 61,071 did not focus specifically on the word “necessarily”, but instead looked at what the taxpayer was legally entitled to as a result of incurring the expenditure, i.e. to use the words in Buckley & Young, it considered the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. As the expenditure in that case had resulted entirely in trading stock, it held that the expenditure was deductible. Significantly, at p. 61,071, the majority of the Privy Council held that the amount of expenditure is not material, i.e. deductibility is not dependent upon the amount of expenditure being “reasonable”, citing Cecil Bros Ltd v FCT (1964) 111 CLR 430. At p. 434, Owen J cited the following statement from Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 at p. 60, which statement was approved by the Judicial Committee in both 5 the Europa Oil cases (\[1971\] NZLR 641 at p. 649 and (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 at p. 61,071): It is not for the Court or the Commissioner to say how much a taxpayer ought to spend in obtaining his income, but only how much he has spent . Thus, expenditure will be necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, where the expenditure is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. Voluntary expenditure may be deductible, provided it is directed to business ends. In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material to the issue of whether or not expenditure is deductible. A key factor in determining whether expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1) is determining the character of the advantage sought. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure (CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 at p. 6,350). In this regard, there is a distinction between purpose and effect. Thus, for example, the fact that no income is ultimately derived does not necessarily mean that it was not made for the purpose of deriving gross income. Ultimately it will be a question of fact what a taxpayer’s subjective purpose or purposes were in incurring the expenditure. In this regard, a taxpayer’s purpose is to be determined by an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure (National Distributors at p. 6,351). The phrase “to the extent that” in limb (b) of section BD 2(1) contemplates apportionment (Buckley & Young at p. 61,274), i.e. where part of the expenditure is incurred for a purpose unrelated to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity, or when a deduction for part of the expenditure is prohibited, then that part will not be deductible. Nevertheless, the fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer does not necessarily preclude that expenditure from being deductible. This was held in Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd, a case which concerned expenditure voluntarily incurred by a brewery company on licensed premises which it leased to publicans, who were tied to the company in that they were required to sell the company’s beer. Although the lessee was obliged to keep the premises in good repair, the brewery company preferred to undertake the repairs and maintenance itself, being able thereby to ensure that the premises were maintained at a high standard. At issue, among other things, was whether or not expenditure incurred to repair the leased premises was “wholly and exclusively expenditure on repairs of premises occupied for the purpose of \[its brewery\] trade”. The Crown contended that the premises were not occupied by the brewery company, being instead occupied by the lessee, and therefore the repair expenditure incurred by the company did not meet the criterion for deductibility. At p. 427, Lord Atkinson held that the expenditure was “wholly and exclusively expenditure on repairs of premises occupied for the purpose of \[the company’s brewery\] trade”, basing his decision on the fact that the licensed premises “were the market place for \[the company’s\] beer and none other”. He stated that the fact that the lessee benefited from the company’s repair expenditure did not preclude the criterion for deductibility being satisfied. 6 In order to reconcile the decisions in Buckley & Young and Usher’s, it is necessary to distinguish between the situation where there are two or more distinct purposes for making the expenditure, not all of which relate to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (apportionment will be required here), and the situation where the third party benefit is incidental to the purpose relating to the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity (no apportionment is required here). Having established that the expenditure is deductible under either limb (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to determine whether or not the deduction is prohibited by section BD 2(2). Relevant prohibitions are those relating to expenditure of a private or domestic nature (limb (a)) and expenditure of a capital nature (limb (e)). Prohibition – capital expenditure Concerning the capital prohibition in limb (e) of section BD 2(2), a number of different tests have been formulated by the Courts. The most commonly used test in New Zealand is derived from the Australian decision of Sun Newspapers Limited and Another v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 317 where Dixon J formulated the following indicia: • the character of the advantage sought (for which the lasting qualities may play a part); • the manner in which the advantage is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed (and in this, and under the former head, recurrence may play its part); and • the means adopted to obtain the advantage, e.g. by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment, or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure further use or enjoyment. The indicia put forward in Sun Newspapers were adopted by the Privy Council in the decision of BP Australia Limited v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 1. The BP Australia formulation was adopted in New Zealand in cases such as CIR v L D Nathan & Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209, Buckley & Young, CIR v McKenzies New Zealand (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233, Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001, and Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. In McKenzies, the Court of Appeal extracted five indicia from the Privy Council decision in BP Australia, which were themselves applied in Christchurch Press. Those five indicia are as follows: • a consideration of the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure (recurrence may play a part here); • whether the sums were paid out of fixed or circulating capital; • whether the payments were of a once and for all nature, producing assets or advantages which were of an enduring benefit; • a consideration of ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and 7 • whether the sums were incurred on the structure, within which the profits were to be earned, or whether they were part of the income earning process. The Court of Appeal in L D Nathan at p. 214 extracted several indicia from the BP Australia case: • recurrence; • whether the expenditure was from fixed or circulating capital; • whether the expenditure related to the business entity or structure (or profit/yielding subject) or whether it related to the process by which such a structure is operated in order to obtain regular returns; • whether the expenditure was made once and for all, with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the trade; • whether the expenditure was ordinary expenditure in the course of the regular income-earning conduct of the business; and • the nature of the asset obtained or sought in which its enduring character may play a part. The most recent New Zealand Privy Council case in this area, Wattie, adopted the same approach as that described in Hallstroms Proprietary Limited v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 at p. 648. The Privy Council also endorsed the approach taken in BP Australia, Regent Oil, British Insulated and Helsby, and McKenzies. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board, the Court of Appeal referred to the approach of BP Australia, Hallstroms, and British Insulated and Helsby. The Court of Appeal in Birkdale endorsed the approach of the Privy Council in Wattie and BP Australia. However, these cases have recognised that although past cases can be useful in assisting with the resolution of a new case, there are dangers involved in this approach. For example, North P in the L D Nathan case at p. 214 stated that where the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure was not clear-cut, the indicia should be weighed up in the context of the whole set of circumstances. This principle was confirmed by Richardson J at p. 5,235 of the McKenzies case, citing BP Australia: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp 264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and agree. That answer: ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process’. 8 per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” \[Emphasis added\] Similar statements were made by Viscount Radcliffe in Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Limited \[1964\] 1 All ER 208 at pp. 212-213, and by Templeman J in Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Limited \[1977\] 3 All ER 865 at p. 869. However, when the latter case was appealed to the House of Lords (reported at Tucker (Inspector of Taxes) v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801), Lord Wilberforce noted at p. 804 that sometimes applying analogies is the only available option: There are a number of tests which have been stated in reported cases which it is useful to apply, but we have been warned more than once not to seek automatically to apply to one case words or formulae which have been found useful in another (see Comr of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd). Nevertheless reported cases are the best tools that we have, even if they may sometimes be blunt instruments. From the various indicia formulated by the Courts, subject to the warning that the whole set of circumstances must be considered, the following tests or indicia may be identified: • the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure: This test considers what prompted or necessitated the taxpayer to incur the expenditure and whether the surrounding circumstances and ultimate objective of the expenditure support a capital or revenue classification. • whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature: This test, which is closely aligned to the previous one, states that recurrent expenditure is often of a revenue nature and that one-off expenditure is often of a capital nature. This test is not determinative, e.g. irregular expenditure may be of a revenue nature. To conclude that recurrent expenditure is of a revenue nature, it is necessary to establish that it is an ordinary incident of carrying on a business. • whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset: This test states that expenditure will be of a capital nature if an identifiable capital asset was acquired by the expenditure. • whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of enduring benefit to the business: This test is similar to the previous one, but instead focuses on whether an enduring advantage was acquired by expending the money. If it was, then the expenditure is likely to be of a capital nature. An enduring benefit can arise from expenditure made to relieve the business of an onerous asset. In this regard, an enduring benefit is to be distinguished from where the expenditure merely relieves the taxpayer from making revenue payments for a period of time. This test is often linked to the test of recurrence, i.e. expenditure made once-for- all with a view to acquiring an advantage of enduring benefit to the business is likely to indicate that the expenditure was of a capital nature. • whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit- making process: This test aims at distinguishing between expenditure which relates to the business’s structure (i.e. assets which are used in order to carry on the business) and the business’s operation (i.e. the means by which the assets are 9 organised in order to carry on the business). In this regard, in some businesses the structure may mainly consist of intangible assets, e.g. goodwill. This test is often linked to the identifiable asset and enduring advantage tests. For example, combining the tests enables to the correct classifications to be made where expenditure is made, as an ordinary incident of the business, to maintain the profit-making structure (likely to be of a revenue nature, despite relating to the profit-making structure), or expenditure is made to enable the business to operate differently (likely to be of a capital nature, despite relating to the profit-making process). • whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital: This test states that expenditure made from fixed capital (i.e. capital on which a return is sought by the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a capital nature, and expenditure made from circulating capital (i.e. capital which returns to the business as a result of the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a revenue nature. The test is not now given much weight by the Courts, as it is easy for a business to choose whether to finance an asset, say, from fixed capital or to finance it from circulating capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. • the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting: How expenditure is classified according to ordinary commercial accounting principles may support the classification made from applying the other indicia. However, this test is not usually determinative, since tax and accounting have different aims and the respective treatments may consequently differ from each other. Many of these indicia overlap and some factors will carry more weight in given circumstances. Therefore, while these indicia are helpful as a starting point, it is nevertheless necessary to make a final judgment of whether the expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature by analysing the facts as a whole, weighing up which factors carry the most weight in the light of these facts. Prohibition – private or domestic expenditure The prohibition of deductions for expenditure of a private or domestic nature (limb (a) of section BD 2(2)) was considered in CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198. This case concerned whether or not contributions to a welfare society, which were required by statute to be made, were deductible (the case related to an income year before deductions were prohibited for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment). At p. 5,207, Richardson J stated: An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. While ordinarily health care is uniquely personal to the individual concerned and affects his private life as well as his work potential, there may be such emphasis under the employment contract in attaining and maintaining a particular standard of fitness (or even grooming) that expenditure directed to that end cannot fairly be characterised as private or domestic or for that matter as other than work-related. That is not this case but it suggests that it is overly simplistic to brand these contributions to this welfare society as inherently of a private rather than an employment character. On the contrary, in the very unusual circumstances of this case I have come to the conclusion, not without hesitation, that the required nexus exists between the expenditure in question and the gaining of the employment income. That expenditure is imposed on the employee by Statute. It reflects a recognition by the employer and the unions endorsed by the Legislature that the availability of the benefits afforded by membership of the welfare society has a perceived if not readily quantifiable impact on the work performance of the 10 employees concerned. It is more than a prerequisite to the earning of income. It is directed to the income earning process itself. Clearly all those immediately concerned in the employment relationship have bona fide regarded that expenditure as work-related being directed to preserving and enhancing the employee’s performance of his duties and in the end I have concluded that we would not be justified in taking a different view. \[Emphasis added\] In coming to this conclusion of the application of the law to the particular facts in question, Richardson J held that expenses properly characterised as consumption (e.g. food, clothing and shelter) are not incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because they are required in order for a person to be able to earn income. In several Taxation Review Authority cases (Case E87 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,455; Case F30 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,704; Case F159 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,358), whether or not expenditure was of a private or domestic nature was determined by ascertaining whether anybody received a benefit of a private or domestic nature. However, by solely focusing on the recipient of the benefit resulting from the expenditure, it would prohibit a deduction for wages paid, for example, where the recipient of the wages used the money received to purchase food and accommodation. It is not considered, therefore, that this is the correct approach. Rather, as Richardson J did in Haenga, it is necessary to determine whether the expenditure, in whole or part, related exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income- earning or business activity of the payer, then it follows from the approach in Usher’s – where expenditure was held to be deductible because the third-party benefit was incidental – that the deduction is not prohibited. In summary, then, an outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity of the payer, then the deduction is not prohibited. Where the private or domestic benefit accrues from a purpose of the taxpayer distinct from the business promotion purpose, then apportionment will be necessary. Apportionment By virtue of the definition of “sponsorship” used in this statement (i.e. benefits contemplated to the taxpayer and to some other party), and because of the inclusion of the phrase “to the extent that” in sections BD 2(1) and BD 2(2), the issue of apportionment must be considered. Apportionment will be required where the expenditure may partly be on revenue account and partly on capital account. Apportionment will also be required where a sponsorship agreement is entered into to achieve more than one end (e.g. income-earning and private) – whether or not the dual purposes are evident on the face of the relevant documentation. It will also be required where part of the sponsorship expenditure is not deductible at all e.g. preliminary expenditure incurred before the business began (Calkin v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,781 at p. 61,786). Merely because it may be difficult under a sponsorship arrangement to determine what part of the expenditure relates to business promotion, or which part is prohibited by virtue of section BD 2(2), this does not preclude the need for apportionment where, in fact, more than one purpose was envisaged by incurring the expenditure (Buckley & Young at p. 61,274). 11 Accrual expenditure Even if a deduction is allowed for expenditure under limb (b) of section BD 2(1), and is not prohibited under section BD 2(2), it needs to be considered whether the expenditure is accrual expenditure such that section EF 1 applies to limit the deduction in any income year. Section EF 1(1) states that “accrual expenditure” is deductible when incurred, but (subject to section EF 1(3)) any “unexpired portion” of it at the end of the income year is included in the taxpayer’s gross income for the year but is allowed as a deduction in the following income year. The term “accrual expenditure” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any expenditure deductible under the Act (with certain exceptions specified in the definition in section OB 1). The “unexpired portion” of an amount of accrual expenditure is defined in section EF 1(5) which reads as follows: The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be– (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income: (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c) Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. Essentially, the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure is that portion of the expenditure which relates to future income years. Depreciation If a deduction is prohibited because of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2), a deduction for depreciation may be allowed under subpart EG. Broadly, for a deduction to be allowed for depreciation the taxpayer must own the “depreciable property” (section EG 1(1)), which is defined in section OB 1 to mean: ... any property of \[the\] taxpayer which might be reasonably expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use ... in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Where there is depreciable property, the amount of the deduction allowed for depreciation is determined under section EG 2 and is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. APPLICATION TO SPONSORSHIP EXPENDITURE Having considered the general principles relating to sections BD 2(1) and BD 2(2), it is necessary to apply these principles in the context of sponsorship expenditure. This will be approached as follows: • is the sponsorship expenditure deductible pursuant to section BD 2(1); 12 • do any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply (the need for apportionment will considered under this head); • if a deduction is prohibited because of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2), is a deduction for depreciation allowed; • does section EF 1 apply to limit the deduction in any given income year. Deductibility under section BD 2(1) Concerning the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1), the following principles were identified: • There must be a nexus or necessary relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income earning activity. • This requires a determination of the character of the advantage sought by the taxpayer in incurring the expenditure. This is a subjective matter, depending upon the taxpayer’s purpose when incurring the expenditure. The determination of the taxpayer’s purpose or purposes will require an objective analysis of surrounding circumstances, including the effect of the expenditure. • In relation to limb (b)(ii), expenditure will be deductible where it is dictated by the business ends to which it is directed, those ends forming part of or being truly incidental to the business. • Voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income- earning ends. • In the absence of associated party or avoidance concerns, the quantum of the expenditure is not material. • The fact that a third party may benefit from the expenditure incurred does not preclude that expenditure from being deductible. For the purposes of this statement, sponsorship expenditure has been defined to mean expenditure where the payer intends that his or her business will thereby be promoted in some way, but that the recipient, or some other person, will also be benefited in some manner other than by the receipt of ordinary income from business or income- earning activities. Expenditure of the type which meets this definition was held to have been incurred in deriving income in the Australian case, Cliffs International, Inc v FCT 85 ATC 4374. In this case, the taxpayer contributed to the annual running of a golf tournament in which the taxpayer’s joint venture partners and key Japanese customers participated. Another case where sponsorship expenditure, as so defined, was held to be incurred in deriving income is the South African case, Income Tax Case No. 696 17 SATC 86. This case concerned a company which dealt in agricultural equipment. It purchased some footballs which it endorsed with words associated with the equipment in which it traded, and then gave them to various school football clubs. It also acquired two silver trophies which it donated to agricultural societies, having engraved them with the company’s name and the names of various pieces of equipment in which it traded. All three members of the Cape Income Tax Special Court held that the expenditure incurred on the footballs was deductible (one member held that the expenditure on the 13 cups was capital in nature). In relation to the expenditure on the footballs, Newton Thompson J put it this way at p. 87: I am satisfied that this expenditure is for advertisement purposes, that it has that effect; that it assists in selling articles in which the appellant deals; that it is incurred in the production of income... Two issues immediately arise from the definition of sponsorship adopted in this statement. Firstly, what evidence supports a taxpayer’s contention that particular expenditure meets this definition? Secondly, what effect does the third-party benefit have upon deductibility? In relation to the first issue, in order for the nexus test to be satisfied, the taxpayer needs to show that he or she intended that the business would be promoted by incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In this regard, the following objective factors will support a taxpayer’s contention that he or she intended that the business be promoted by the expenditure: • The specific terms of the sponsorship arrangement, e.g. is there a specific requirement for the recipient to promote the taxpayer’s business? What is the extent and prominence of the business exposure specified in the agreement? • The place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy. For example, if a business’s market research has identified that potential customers frequently attend cultural events, then part of its marketing strategy may be to sponsor such events in return for its name and products being promoted during the event. • The relationship between the market or potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. For example, market exposure at a tennis tournament is directly related to the business of a sports equipment retailer. • The relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income derived, i.e. can it be shown that the expenditure resulted in income being derived? For example, the sale of 10 tractors at an agricultural field-day, by a tractor manufacturer sponsoring the event in return for being able to display the tractors, shows a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the derivation of income. In Case 696 (SA), the evidentiary support for the expenditure on the cups being deductible was described like this (Mr Galbraith at p. 91): ... the company annually incurs expenditure on advertising the agricultural implements in which it deals. This advertising takes various forms, such as circulating pamphlets, distributing calendars, pocket-books, copper ash-trays, etc. It never takes the form of press advertising because the potential and actual customers of the company are too few to warrant advertising in newspapers. This description illustrates the company’s marketing strategy and the cups and footballs donated fitted within this strategy, being articles on which the names of pieces of equipment were endorsed. Case P16 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,107 illustrates that evidence of a relationship between the potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business is support for the expenditure being deductible, and that the amount of expenditure was not relevant to the determination of whether or not the expenditure was deductible. In 14 response to the company’s contention that the racing promotion was intended to associate the company with speed and efficiency, Keane J stated at p. 4,114: ... the company’s decision was inherently logical from a business perspective, and the related steps taken wholly explicable from that perspective even if the level of expenditure ultimately incurred was greater than was first anticipated. Similarly, in the Australian Board of Review case, Case F67 74 ATC 397, evidence of a relationship between the potential market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business was support for the expenditure being held to be deductible. That case concerned a consulting engineer who also derived commission income as the sole representative of several foreign boat designers in Australia. In order to promote commission sales, the taxpayer had a power boat built to one of the designs for which he was the Australian representative. He had the names of his business and the designer painted on the hull, along with his address and contact telephone number. The boat was then raced. Despite incurring the sponsorship expenditure, no commission sales were made in the income year in question, but this did not preclude deductibility of the revenue expenditure. Nor did the relatively high cost involved stop the Board of Review from finding that the revenue expenditure was deductible. In Cliffs International, sponsorship expenditure was held to be deductible on the basis of evidence showing the place of the sponsorship arrangement in a coherent marketing strategy, and the relationship between the market exposure capable of being reached and the taxpayer’s business. As noted earlier, in this case the taxpayer contributed to the annual running of a golf tournament in which the taxpayer’s joint venture partners and key Japanese customers participated. In finding that the sponsorship expenditure was deductible, Kennedy J stated at p. 4,392: This event was a carefully planned annual function, which was specifically directed to enhancing the relationship between the Robe River joint venture and its customers in Japan, being six of the major steel mills. It was the only formal social function held each year and was carefully adapted to the nature of the Japanese business. It was attended by senior executives from Cliffs, whilst Mitsui & Co. was represented by the highest ranking personnel within its iron ore department, together with one of its corporate executive vice presidents. Each of the mills was represented by its highest ranking purchasing officer and two or three of his subordinates. The day was meticulously planned, so that those whom it was desired to bring together for business reasons were brought together. The day concluded with formal speeches of goodwill and presentations. The issue of the relationship between the expenditure and the resulting income was referred to in Case 696 at p. 92, but in that case the absence of any supporting evidence was given little weight by the majority of the Court: With regard to this expenditure being too remote from the income to be an allowable deduction, I consider that it can fairly be stated that it is normally impossible to connect any particular sales with any particular advertising, though many companies go to considerable lengths in an endeavour to ascertain which media of advertisements produce the best results. The issue of the remoteness of sponsorship expenditure from income derived was also referred to in the Canadian case No 511 v MNR 19 Tax ABC 248, a case concerning a taxpayer in the lumber business which sponsored a local baseball team with the intention of building up its declining sales through promoting its name and products. In that case, as with Case 696, the fact that sponsorship was not direct advertising was not sufficient to preclude deductibility provided there was evidence that the company intended to advertise itself by sponsoring the baseball team. 15 A New Zealand case where there was evidence of a direct relationship between the sponsorship expenditure and the taxpayer’s income was Case P16. The taxpayer in this case was a national courier which had acquired and raced a Jaguar motor car, having marked it with the company’s logo. Evidence that showed that there was a marked increase in turnover as a result of the racing promotion supported the conclusion drawn by Keane J that the related revenue expenditure was deductible. Example 1 Andrew is a sole trader who operates a motor mechanic business. He sponsors the local rugby league team. Under the terms of sponsorship agreement, which covers the year to 31 March, Andrew agrees to pay up-front a sum of $3,000 towards the team’s running costs. In return, the team agrees to display Andrew’s business logo on all rugby uniforms, bags and vehicles used by the team during the year. Is the expenditure incurred by Andrew under the sponsorship agreement deductible? The expenditure incurred by Andrew will be fully deductible. The requirement that the team display his business logo and name on the uniforms etc indicates that the expenditure was incurred to promote his business and is therefore deductible. Example 2 Elizabeth operates a business in Wellington as a sole-trader. She gives $500 to the boarding school which her son attends in Auckland in the name of her business. She makes no stipulations about how the school is to use the money or that her business is to be promoted in return for the payment. Nevertheless, her business’s name subsequently appears in a list of donors on the back page of the school’s annual magazine. In all, there were 20 donors and Elizabeth’s business name is not distinguished in any way from the other 19 donors. It is considered that no deduction under section BD 2 is allowed for the $500 expenditure (although a rebate may be available under section KC 5). There was no stipulation that Elizabeth’s business be promoted. The fact that there was some business promotion in the form of her business’s name appearing in the magazine is not determinative unless Elizabeth can show that such promotion was a purpose of the expenditure. While every case must be considered on its particular facts, it is considered that any marketing exposure resulting from the business name appearing on the back page of an annual school magazine is most likely to be minimal since it one of 20 donors with no prominence given it compared to the names of the other donors. This supports the view that it is incidental to other purposes (e.g. private) of making the payment. As well, the fact that her son’s school is in Auckland is likely to mean that little, if any, increase in revenue would be expected to result to her business since it operates in Wellington. Therefore, based on an objective analysis of the surrounding circumstances, it is considered that the expenditure does not have the requisite nexus with the earning of her business’s income. 16 The second issue which arises from the definition of sponsorship expenditure is the effect on deductibility, if any, of a third-party benefiting from the expenditure. In this regard, as noted earlier in this statement, this fact does not of itself preclude deductibility (Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd at p. 427). Rather, in order to determine whether apportionment is needed, it is necessary to determine whether the third-party benefit resulted from a purpose distinct from the business promotion purpose (apportionment will be required here), or whether the third-party benefit was only incidental to the purpose relating to the taxpayer’s business (no apportionment required). This will be a question of fact. The distinction between incidental purposes and separate purposes will be illustrated by examples following the application of the law relating to the private or domestic expenditure prohibition. Other issues, which may appear relevant to whether or not sponsorship expenditure is deductible, arise where the expenditure is voluntary or where the amount expended is higher than seems reasonable. However, as noted earlier in this statement, the fact that the taxpayer may have voluntarily entered into an agreement whereby someone else is benefited by the expenditure will not, of itself, preclude deductibility since voluntary expenditure is deductible provided it is directed to business or income- earning ends. Nor, of itself, will deductibility be precluded by the fact that the taxpayer expended more than they would have done if the third party benefit were not contemplated. This is because the quantum of the expenditure is not material (Ronpibon Tin at p. 60; Cecil Bros at p. 434; Europa Oil \[1971\] NZLR 641 at p. 649; Europa Oil (1976) 2 NZTC 61,066 at p. 61,071). Case F67, considered earlier in this statement, was a case where relatively high expenditure did not preclude deductibility. If it has been determined that the sponsorship expenditure is prima facie deductible under section BD 2(1), it is then necessary to ascertain whether or not any of the prohibitions in section BD 2(2) apply. The two prohibitions potentially relevant to sponsorship expenditure are the capital prohibition in limb (e) and the prohibition of expenditure of a private or domestic nature in limb (a). Prohibition – capital expenditure From an analysis of case law pertaining to the capital / revenue distinction the following seven tests were identified: • the need or occasion which calls for the expenditure; • whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature; • whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset; • whether the expenditure creates an advantage which is of an enduring benefit to the business; • whether the expenditure is on the profit-making structure or on the profit-making process; • whether the source of the payment is from fixed or circulating capital; • the treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting. 17 In the context of sponsorship expenditure, some of the indicia will be more relevant than others. In relation to a given set of facts, it will be necessary to weigh up the factors in order to determine whether all or part of the sponsorship expenditure is of a capital nature. These factors will now be considered in turn. The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure This test considers the need or occasion calling for the expenditure and whether the surrounding circumstances and ultimate objective of the expenditure support a capital or revenue classification. When considering the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1), the taxpayer’s purpose in incurring the expenditure needed to be ascertained. However, in determining whether or not the capital prohibition applies, it is necessary to consider what prompted or necessitated the taxpayer to incur the expenditure in the first place. In this regard, all the cases analysed when considering the general deductibility provision in section BD 2(1) illustrated that business promotion was the purpose of incurring the sponsorship expenditure. In none of the cases was it held that the underlying reason which prompted or necessitated the expenditure indicated that the expenditure was of a capital nature. It would appear, then, that this test will be of limited use in the context of sponsorship expenditure, although arguably it would be relevant where the facts point to the business promotion being related to establishing a market for a new business. However, in such a case as this, the expenditure is likely to have not even been deductible under section BD 2(1), it being preliminary expenditure which would not have been incurred in the course of carrying on that business (Calkin at p. 61,786). Recurrence As noted earlier in this statement, this test is not determinative as irregular expenditure may be of a revenue nature. To conclude that recurrent expenditure is of a revenue nature, it is necessary to establish that it is an ordinary incident of carrying on the business. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, it is possible for some types of sponsorship expenditure to be once and for all (e.g. a once-only sponsorship of a sports event), and for other types to be recurrent (e.g. regularly sponsoring the sports event). Thus, recurrence, of itself, would not be determinative of the expenditure being of a revenue nature. An example of where recurrence would have supported a finding of sponsorship expenditure being of a revenue nature, had it been at issue, is Cliffs International. Here the golf tournament was held annually. An example of once-only sponsorship expenditure being of a revenue nature is Case 696 (SA) considered earlier in this statement. In that case, the two silver cups constituted a one-off payment. Nevertheless, the majority judgment was that the expenditure incurred on these cups was of a revenue nature. While this finding was principally based on the fact that no enduring asset was acquired by the company, since it divested itself of the ownership of the cups, it nevertheless indicates that recurrence is not determinative. 18 However, while recurrence of itself is not determinative, as noted above, it is also necessary to establishing that expenditure is an ordinary incident of carrying on a business for that expenditure to be of a revenue nature. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, as it is defined in this statement, it is not considered that much weight should be placed on this test. This is because a taxpayer’s business promotion purpose, necessary to establish that the expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1), would appear to be sufficient to show that the expenditure was an ordinary incident of business. That is, whatever third-party benefit may arise from sponsorship expenditure, it would appear that the business promotion purpose is sufficient evidence of the expenditure being an ordinary incident of business. In the Canadian case, No. 608 v MNR 21 Tax ABC 396, at p. 400, Mr Boisvert put it this way: Nowadays business advertising takes on a wide variety of forms and, as long as it can be linked with a business, whether the latter profits from it or not, it is a deductible expense ... Advertising has become a necessity in the business world. \[Emphasis added\] Identifiable asset Where the expenditure results in an identifiable asset owned by the taxpayer, the capital prohibition is likely to apply. The majority decision in Case 696 (SA) is an example of where no identifiable asset being retained by the taxpayer was the basis for finding that the capital prohibition did not apply. Distinguishing cases where an identifiable asset was retained by the taxpayer, and the expenditure incurred to acquire it was held to be of a capital nature (Income Tax Case No. 217 4 SATC 137; Income Tax Case No. 469 11 SATC 261), the majority stated at p. 93: In my opinion this case is clearly distinguishable. Appellant company purchased cups and immediately presented them to agricultural societies, thereby divesting itself of ownership. It had no asset as a result of this advertising expenditure ... \[Emphasis added\] Thus, if the sponsorship expenditure results in an identifiable asset, and the taxpayer does not divest itself of the ownership of the asset, then the capital prohibition will apply. Example 3 Consider the facts in example 1, above. Suppose Andrew also agreed to reimburse the team for the purchase of their van (i.e. the team owns the van) provided his business logo is prominently displayed on the van. Would this expenditure be deductible? Alternatively, what if he instead purchased the van himself, retaining ownership of it, but allowed the team to have full use of it provided his business logo is prominently displayed on it – would the expenditure be deductible? Where Andrew reimburses the team for the purchase of their van, although the van is a capital item it is not considered that the capital prohibition applies since the van is not owned by Andrew, nor was it acquired by him. Therefore, no enduring asset results to Andrew from this expenditure. However, if Andrew purchased the van himself and retained ownership of it, the capital prohibition would apply as the expenditure results in an enduring 19 asset (i.e. the van) owned by him (although a deduction for depreciation may be allowed under section EG 2). Example 4 John Jones runs a sports goods store called Jones’s Sports. Being particularly interested in soccer, John sponsors an annual soccer competition for the three local primary schools, to be named the Jones Competition. He considers that the sponsorship arrangement will result in increased sales. He supplies the necessary sporting equipment to each school (all of which is clearly labelled with his business’s name) as well as a trophy to be presented to the winner of the competition. The trophy is labelled the Jones Competition sponsored by Jones’s Sports, and each year the trophy is engraved with the winner’s name. He incurs a total of $5,000 in the first year of this arrangement. Here there is a relationship between John’s business and the sponsorship, both being related to sport. Therefore, even though it may be impossible to identify what sales, if any, resulted from the sponsorship arrangement, John’s contention that the expenditure was incurred in order to increase sales is reasonable. Therefore, it is considered that the expenditure is deductible under limb (b)(i) of section BD 2(1). As well, the fact that the business name appears on the sporting equipment donated, as well as on the trophy, supports the conclusion that the expenditure would be deductible under limb (b)(ii) of section BD 2(1) being necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on his business. In this light, it is considered that John’s private enjoyment of soccer is incidental and therefore a deduction for the expenditure will not be prohibited by limb (a) of section BD 2(2). Further, although the cup is an enduring asset, it is not owned by John and so the capital prohibition in limb (e) of section BD 2(2) will not apply. This conclusion is consistent with the finding in Income Tax Case 696 17 SATC 86 (South Africa). Enduring advantage This test focuses on whether an enduring advantage of benefit to the business is acquired by expending the money. If it is, then the expenditure is likely to be of a capital nature. Other than cases where an identifiable asset is acquired by expending the money, this test would appear to be the most relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. This test is often linked to the test of recurrence, i.e. expenditure made once and for all with a view to acquiring an advantage of enduring benefit to the business is likely to indicate that the expenditure was of a capital nature. However, in order to determine whether or not an enduring advantage arises such that the capital prohibition would apply, it is first necessary to distinguish between long- term advertising and goodwill / branding that may arise from such advertising. In the case of the former, any expenditure to obtain the long-term advertising merely relieves the taxpayer from making revenue payments for a period of time. It is not considered that this type of “enduring advantage” is of a capital nature (Anglo-Persian at p. 262). However, section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year because part of the expenditure relates to future income years (section EF 1 is considered more fully later in this statement). 20 As to whether the capital prohibition would apply because the expenditure resulted in an enduring advantage of branding or goodwill, it is considered that any “branding / goodwill” advantage gained is intrinsically linked to the business exposure itself. The advantage is not one that results from the business’s prior operation (in contrast to goodwill acquired when the business is purchased, which would be a capital asset). Although the advantage may endure beyond the end of the sponsorship agreement, this is no different from ordinary advertising. In both cases, any “branding” gained will usually dissipate rapidly unless the exposure or advertising is repeated in order to maintain it. For this reason, it is considered that any incremental contribution to long- term goodwill or brand value is properly to be regarded as incidental, as similar increments can be achieved by ordinary advertising, good customer service, product quality, etc. Therefore, it is considered that the expenditure on it is of a revenue nature and the capital prohibition does not apply. This conclusion is in line with the majority judgment in Case 696 (SA): There is little doubt that the benefit of this advertising was not confined to the year of assessment, but the same can probably be said about most advertising except in connection with special “bargain sales”. With regular advertising in various forms it is normally impossible to state when and for how long any benefit may be received and if, to be allowable as a deduction, its effect must be confined to the year of assessment, it appears to me that very little advertising expenditure could be allowed as a deduction. I am of the opinion that all successful advertising must inevitably tend to increase the goodwill of the advertiser or of the merchandise advertised, but I am unable to agree that, therefore, such advertising becomes expenditure of a capital nature. \[Emphasis added\] Profit-making structure or profit-making process This test aims at distinguishing between expenditure which relates to the business’s structure (i.e. assets which are used in order to carry on the business) and the business’s operation (i.e. the means by which the assets are organised in order to carry on the business). As noted earlier in this statement, this test is often linked to the identifiable asset and enduring advantage tests. As such, in the context of sponsorship expenditure, this test would not appear to add anything to the analyses under these heads. In particular, however, it is noted that the business promotion aspect of sponsorship expenditure, as it is defined in this statement, would appear ordinarily to be related to the profit- making process rather than to the profit-making structure. The principal exception would be where an identifiable asset is acquired as a result of expending the money in which case, as noted earlier in this statement when considering the identifiable asset test, the profit-making structure is enhanced by the sponsorship expenditure, and the capital prohibition would apply. The source of the payment This test states that expenditure made from fixed capital (i.e. capital on which a return is sought by the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a capital nature, and expenditure made from circulating capital (i.e. capital which returns to the business as a result of the business’s operation) is more likely to be of a revenue nature. As noted earlier in this statement, the test is not now given much weight by the Courts, as it is easy for a business to choose whether to finance an asset, say, from fixed capital or to finance it from circulating capital, irrespective of the nature of the 21 asset financed. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, also, a business may finance it from either fixed or circulating capital, without thereby changing its inherent nature. Therefore, it is considered that this test is unhelpful. The treatment of the expenditure according to the ordinary principles of commercial accounting How expenditure is classified according to ordinary commercial accounting principles may support the classification made from applying the other indicia. In this regard, sponsorship and promotional expenditure would ordinarily be classified as being of a revenue nature according to generally accepted accounting practice. This supports treating sponsorship expenditure as deductible. However, this test is not usually determinative since tax and accounting have different aims and the respective treatments may consequently differ from each other. Nevertheless, in the context of sponsorship expenditure, if for some reason a taxpayer treated such expenditure as being of a capital nature for accounting purposes, there may be some grounds for analysing whether or not this accounting classification should be followed for tax purposes. Conclusion – capital prohibition The indicia developed by the Courts to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure are not necessarily all relevant in the context of sponsorship expenditure. Of the various indicia analysed, it would appear that the identifiable asset test is the most important. While the enduring advantage test appears relevant, frequently the nature of the enduring benefit resulting from the sponsorship expenditure will not be such as to warrant a capital classification because the benefit is intrinsically linked to the means of exposure. Prohibition – private or domestic expenditure An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit (Haenga at p. 5,207). In particular, expenses properly characterised as consumption (e.g. food, clothing and shelter) are not incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because they are required in order for a person to be able to earn income. In this regard, it is necessary to determine whether the expenditure, in whole or part, relates exclusively to things of a private or domestic nature. Where a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity, then the deduction is not prohibited. In the context of sponsorship expenditure, the key will be to determine whether or not any private or domestic benefit accruing as a result of the sponsorship expenditure is incidental to the business promotion purpose. Where a separate private or domestic purpose is identifiable, then apportionment will be necessary. A number of Taxation Review Authority cases have involved situations where someone (usually an employee of the taxpayer) gained private enjoyment from the 22 sponsorship expenditure. In Case L7, the taxpayer was a radiator manufacture and repair company whose principal was interested in go-kart racing. The company decided to become involved in go-kart racing as a means of promoting the business. The go-kart bore the name of the company, the principal drove the go-kart, the pit crew (company employees) wore company colours, and the company was promoted on a billboard at the racetrack and in the racing program. The issue before the Taxation Review Authority was whether the associated expenditure should be apportioned between business promotion (deductible) and private enjoyment (no deduction allowed). At p. 1,055, Barber DJ concluded that the expenditure was fully deductible, with the private enjoyment being purely incidental: I agree with the submission of Mr Nation, that the fact that Mr S obtained substantial enjoyment from the kart racing is not a significant factor in deciding whether or not the expenses incurred in that activity should be tax deductible. In my view, the issue is whether the expenditure is bona fide advertising expenditure in character, or is wholly or partly expenditure in the pursuance of go kart racing as a sport or recreational pastime. That factual issue pivots on the credibility of the evidence. I accept Mr S as an honest witness. I find that although he enjoyed his involvement in kart racing and had previously been quite strongly interested in racing in general, he made a calculated decision to boost his business enterprise by participating in kart racing with a high business profile. He sought business contacts in the motor trade and work from those contacts and from the general public. I am satisfied that these aims were achieved, and continue to be retained, in a substantial manner. I do not suggest that advertising must have good results to be deductible. I appreciate that, after much consideration, the respondent took the view that there were two equal factors in relation to the advertising expenditure, namely, the obtaining of personal pleasure in go kart racing and the attracting of business from that activity. On the evidence which I have heard, I find on the balance of probability that the business expended money on go-kart racing predominantly to advertise the business and that any private intentions or purposes of Mr S were quite incidental to the predominant objective of business expansion. In other words, I am satisfied that there was a sufficient link between the expenditure and the income earning process of the radiator manufacturing and repair business, with regard to the entire expenditure and not merely to 50% of it. \[Emphasis added\] The same approach was taken in Case P16, where the company’s principal was interested in car racing. In that case, at p. 4,114, Keane J held that he saw no reason to elevate the principal’s private enjoyment of racing the car to the status of a competing purpose. In Case M131 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,850, Bathgate DJ approved of the approach in Case L7. The taxpayer in this case owned a building business that had a substantial connection, both business and private, with the racing industry. To maintain and extend the business relationship, the taxpayer purchased and raced a horse and sponsored several races in return for the business name appearing on the race books of the races sponsored. While the horse was raced under the names of the individual owners, it was soon identified with the company. The percentage of income derived from the racing industry increased following the increased promotional activity. While the deductibility of the sponsorship expenditure was not at issue in this case, in relation to remaining revenue expenditure, Bathgate DJ held that the statutory nexus was satisfied and that the element of private enjoyment was incidental to the main purpose of business promotion. Example 6 Bruce is in business as a sole-trader builder, trading as Bruce Builders. He agrees to build the gymnasium at his daughter’s school in return for an annual 50% discount on his daughter’s school fees for the time she attends the school. 23 The school will provide the materials, but Bruce will supply the labour (himself and three of his employees). While the gymnasium is being built, the school agrees for Bruce to erect signage on the construction site stating that the gymnasium is being built by Bruce Builders. After it is completed, a prominent plaque will be displayed on the front of the gymnasium stating that it was constructed by Bruce Builders. Does the prohibition for expenditure of a private or domestic nature apply to the expenditure Bruce incurs on staff wages in relation to the construction? The expenditure on the wages was not incurred by Bruce in deriving gross income since he derives no income from building the gymnasium (limb (a) of section BD 2(1)). It is arguable, too, that they were not necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on Bruce’s business for the purpose of deriving his gross income since, arguably, he did not need to construct the gymnasium (limb (b) of section BD 2(1)). Even if it were considered that limb (b) of section BD 2(1) applied (because his business was promoted during the construction and after the construction was completed), one purpose of incurring the expenditure was to gain the 50% discount on his daughter’s school fees, i.e. the advantage sought was of a private nature. On the facts presented, it is not considered that this private advantage was just incidental to any business promotion contemplated by Bruce in entering into the arrangement with the school. Therefore, as a minimum, it would be necessary to apportion the expenditure between that which was of a private nature (not deductible), and that which was deductible (if any). In this regard, the burden of proof is on Bruce to show what part of the expenditure was deductible. Example 7 Jenny is in business as a scuba-diving instructor. She enjoys horse riding and watching horse riding competitions. She decides to organise a gymkhana with prizes being given for the winning rider. She arranges for a billboard to be erected at the site of the competition with her business name etc. on it. She expends a total of $2,000 in arranging the competition. Is her expenditure deductible? In this case, Jenny’s scuba-diving instructing business bears no relationship to horse riding. The attendees are not a natural audience for the scuba-diving promotion so as to reasonably form a potential market. This, considered with the fact of Jenny’s private enjoyment of horse riding, strengthens the conclusion that there is no identifiable nexus between the expenditure and her business. While there is some business exposure in the form of a billboard, it is considered that the expenditure on the competition was likely to have been incurred for private enjoyment with any business promotion being incidental to that private enjoyment purpose. On this basis, and in the absence of further evidence as to Jenny’s purpose in incurring the expenditure, it is considered that no deduction would be allowed for expenditure on the competition. Example 8 A firm, AAA Accounting, has entered into an agreement with the national opera company whereby the firm will cover the cost to the opera company of financing the orchestra that accompanies the operas. In return, the opera 24 company will prominently display the words “proudly sponsored by AAA Accounting” on the buildings where the operas are performed and on all programs sold, as well as in all advertisements for the operas. AAA Accounting’s purpose in entering into the agreement was to provide exposure to influential members of the audience, as confirmed in its marketing plan. A survey, which it had commissioned, showed that a significant proportion of opera attendees were individuals from whom the firm sought business, being people who were of high net worth or who were influential in the corporate and government sectors. On the basis of the survey, it considered that the exposure obtained from sponsoring the opera company would attract these people as clients. In the opera company’s annual report, the managing director referred to the agreement with AAA Accounting and noted that two of the three partners in the firm had personally had a long association with opera in the past, being “opera lovers” themselves. Is the expenditure under the agreement deductible to AAA Accounting? In this case, although AAA Accounting is not in a business related to opera, it does obtain business exposure through the agreement. As well, the agreement is part of the firm’s marketing strategy as indicated in the firm’s marketing plan. While the private enjoyment of opera by two of the three partners in the firm may indicate that the expenditure was incurred for private purposes, it is considered that the reasoning given in the marketing plan shows that the expenditure was incurred for business purposes and any private enjoyment will be incidental to the business purpose of incurring the expenditure. Accrual expenditure As noted earlier, section EF 1 may apply to limit the deduction in any income year to that portion of the expenditure which relates to the current income year. Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to goods used in that year in deriving gross income. Where the expenditure relates to a payment for services, the current year deduction is effectively restricted to the amount incurred on services performed in that year. Where the expenditure relates to a chose in action, the deduction is deferred for the portion relating to the unexpired part of the period that the chose is enforceable. Example 9 John owns and operates a restaurant. He enters into a sponsorship agreement with the local brass band whereby he agrees to pay $9,000 up-front towards the band’s running costs for the next three years in return for the name of his restaurant to be displayed prominently on the drums. What effect, if any, does section EF 1 have on the deductibility of the $9,000? In order to determine whether or not section EF 1 applies, it is necessary to determine if there is any “unexpired portion” at the end of the income year. In this regard, limb (d) of section EF 1(5) applies. This is because the expenditure results in John acquiring the chose in action consisting of the right to have his name displayed on the drums. Therefore, the unexpired portion of the expenditure at the end of the income year will be the portion of the $9,000 25 that relates to the unexpired part of the three-year period in relation to which the choses are enforceable. If a full 12 months under the agreement falls within the first income year, the unexpired portion will be $6,000 relating to the two years remaining under the agreement. Example 10 PQR Ltd pays a local trust $3 million toward the cost of construction of a swimming complex in return for naming rights for a 10 year period. PQR pays the $3 million in one lump sum in the current income year. Here, business exposure is obtained by the expenditure in the form of the company’s name appearing on the complex and therefore PQR is allowed a deduction for $3 million when it incurs the expenditure. In this regard, it is considered that any enduring advantage from the expenditure, namely business exposure for a 10 year period, is of the same nature as advertising i.e. of a revenue nature. The fact that the expenditure is made in a lump sum does not change its revenue character, as it merely relieves the company from making revenue payments for the 10 year period (Anglo-Persian at page 262). Hence, it is not considered that the capital prohibition applies in this case. However, the right to this exposure, which lasts for 10 years, is a chose in action and, therefore, section EF 1 applies to require that the unexpired portion of the expenditure be included in PQR’s gross income at the end of the current income year. The amount of the unexpired portion is determined under limb (d) of section EF 1(5), this being the amount of the expenditure which relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. In the absence of any other relevant facts, the unexpired portion at any point in time will be determined by calculating the proportion of the 10 year period remaining and multiplying it by $3 million. For example, if at the end of the current income year, 9½ years remains of the 10 year period, then the unexpired portion will be $2,850,000. This will be included in PQR’s gross income, but will be allowed as a deduction in the next income year. At the end of that year, the unexpired period will be 8½ years and so $2,550,000 must be included in PQR’s gross income in that income year. And so on until the 10 year period is expired. Depreciation If the expenditure was incurred in relation to depreciable property (as defined in section OB 1), a deduction will be allowed for depreciation as determined under section EG 2. The amount of the deduction is dependent upon whether the depreciable property is wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Example 11 Paul owns and operates a plant nursery. He purchases a van on which he displays his business name prominently. He makes the van available to the 26 local garden society on weekends, but retains ownership of it and uses the van for business purposes during the week. Is Paul allowed a deduction for the cost of the van? If not, would he be allowed a deduction for the depreciation of the van? The cost of the van is not deductible by virtue of the capital prohibition. However, a deduction for depreciation may be allowed. In this case, the question which arises is whether or not Paul would be allowed a deduction for the full amount of depreciation on the van calculated pursuant to limb (a) of section EG 2(1) or whether limb (d) of section EG 2(1) would apply. In this regard, it could be thought that when the van was being used by the garden society members, it would not be used or available for use by Paul for business purposes and that, therefore, limb (d) of section EG 2(1) would apply to limit the deduction otherwise available. However, because Paul’s business name is prominently displayed on the van, this provides business exposure. As well, the garden society members are a potential market for his plant nursery business. Hence, it is considered that the van is being used for business purposes, even when it is being used by the garden society members, and that, therefore, limb (d) of section EG 2(1) does not apply to limit the deduction available for depreciation. Example 12 John is a shareholder-employee of ABC Ltd, a marine products supplier. His hobby is to race yachts. ABC purchases a yacht which John races in various yachting competitions. The company’s name and logo is painted on the hull of the boat. Here, a physical asset is acquired by the business and therefore no deduction is allowed by reason of the capital prohibition in section BD 2(2). However, because the company’s name is displayed on the yacht, and ABC’s business of supplying marine products would be potentially promoted in a yachting competition, a deduction for depreciation will be allowed under section EG 2. The fact that John enjoys yachting does not preclude a depreciation deduction being allowed. Monetary remuneration There may be occasions where an employer sponsors an employee to take part in some event such as by paying his or her entry fees. At first glance, this might appear to be another instance of sponsorship expenditure, the deductibility of which would need to be tested in the ways considered so far in this statement. However, where expenditure is on account of an employee, then it will be deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2 by virtue of being monetary remuneration of that employee (the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 includes within it any expenditure on account of an employee). Although there may be an element of “sponsoring” the employee, in that the payment on his or her behalf is over and above what would ordinarily be paid, the expenditure will be deductible for the same reasons that his or her ordinary salary is deductible. 27 28 Example 13 XYZ Ltd pays the entrance fee of one of its employees (Anne) who is going to compete in the local triathlon competition. Anne agrees to display the firm’s name prominently on her T-shirt, bicycle and swimming togs. Here, Anne is the one who enters the race and therefore the payment of the entrance fee is expenditure on account of Anne. Hence, the amount paid is monetary remuneration of an employee and as such is deductible under limb (b) of section BD 2(1).
\[Interpretation statement IS3385 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in November 1998\] TEMPORARY IMPORTS SUCH AS YACHTS—ZERO-RATING FOR GOODS AND SERVICES TAX This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner's interpretation of the application of the zero-rating provisions in section 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) to goods and services supplied to vessels temporarily visiting New Zealand. The subject matter of this item was previously considered in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.3 (September 1994) at page 2 under the heading, "GST - zero-rating and temporary imports such as yachts." This interpretation statement supersedes that earlier statement. Background A number of foreign yachts visit New Zealand every year. The Act provides zero-rating for goods and services supplied in relation to temporary imports, such as yachts and other vessels. Suppliers often ask Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service how they should treat such supplies for GST purposes. Craft, such as yachts, that do not come into New Zealand as cargo but under their own power or under sail, can be described as being imported and as imports. This is because the Customs and Excise Act 1996 definition of "importation" is broad enough to categorise them as imports. This item sets out the Commissioner's interpretation of the provisions dealing with the zero-rating of goods and services supplied to non-residents who bring in temporary imports, especially owners of yachts and other vessels that are in New Zealand on a temporary basis. It also sets out a supplier's obligations when that person provides goods and services to a non-resident in respect of a temporary import. This item deals with the application of the following two paragraphs only of section 11, because the other zero-rating paragraphs of section 11 are unlikely to apply: • section 11(1)(ba) • section 11(2)(ca) However, please note that other paragraphs of section 11 also deal with circumstances in which the benefit of zero-rating may be obtained. Legislation All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise indicated. Goods 1 A supply of goods is zero-rated under section 11(1)(ba) when: The goods have been supplied in the course of repairing, renovating, modifying, or treating any goods to which subsection (2)(ca) of this section applies and the goods supplied- (i) Are wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise form part of those other goods; or (ii) Being consumable goods, become unusable or worthless as a direct result of being used in that repair, renovation, modification, or treatment process. Services A supply of services is zero-rated under section 11(2)(ca) when the services: (i) Are provided directly in connection with – (A) Goods supplied from outside New Zealand and whose destination is outside New Zealand, including stores for craft, provided that those goods are not removed from the ship or aircraft in which they arrived while the ship or aircraft is within New Zealand; or (B) Goods referred to in section 116 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (ii) Are supplied to a person who is not resident in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Application of the Legislation Goods Section 11(1)(ba) applies to goods that are supplied from outside New Zealand and that have a destination outside New Zealand, and goods covered by section 116 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. These goods may be referred to as "temporary imports" as they will be given temporary import status by the New Zealand Customs Service. Goods supplied in relation to these temporary imports may qualify for zero- rating under section 11(1)(ba). The supply of goods will be zero-rated under section 11(1)(ba)(i) if the goods are supplied in the course of repairing, renovating, modifying, or treating a temporary import and they are wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise form part of the temporary import. Goods will qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(ba)(ii) if they are consumable goods supplied in the course of repairing, renovating, modifying, or treating a temporary import and become unusable or worthless as a result of the repair, renovation, modification, or treatment process. The supplier of the goods does not need to perform this work personally. However, it will not be acceptable to zero-rate the supply of goods merely because the recipient is a non-resident. The supplier must be able to produce documentation or other evidence to show that the goods were supplied to a non-resident, and were consumed during the process of repair, etc., or were wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise formed part of the temporary import. 2 Non-consumable goods must be fastened to or become part of the temporary import. Goods that are loose or detachable, such as lifejackets and lifebuoys, are not considered to meet this test, and therefore are not part of a temporary import for the purposes of section 11(1)(ba)(i). Neither are they usually goods that are supplied in the course of repairing, renovating, modifying or treating the craft to which they belong. Examples of goods that satisfy this requirement are engines and cabin fittings that are installed into a vessel. Ropes are an example that may or may not qualify for zero-rating. If they are incorporated into the vessel, such as by becoming part of the rigging, then their supply will be zero-rated. If they are simply stored on board, then they will not be zero-rated. Section 11(1)(d) also provides that zero-rating does not apply where the supplier of the goods is a GST registered person and that person (or an associated person of that person) has claimed a secondhand goods input tax deduction for those goods. Services Under section 11(2)(ca), services will be zero-rated if they are supplied to a person who is a non-resident at the time they are performed and are supplied “directly in connection with” a temporary import. The Commissioner considers that the words “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(ca) require a clear and direct relationship between the services and the temporary import. The relationship must be directly with the import and not with some other person or thing. In the context of section 11(2)(e), the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at page 11,224) indicated that services would not be supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property where the services were a “step” (or more) removed from the property itself. In that case the judge held that the provision of advertising services and space in a newspaper was provided directly in connection with the advertisement but not with the goods advertised. The phrase “directly in connection with” was considered in two other cases. In Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551, the Taxation Review Authority considered that repair services were supplied directly in connection with the vehicles repaired. In Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080, the High Court held that runways, taxiways, and holding bays were provided directly in connection with the transportation of passengers and goods by air, but that the provision of an international terminal was not. The answer to the question of whether there is a direct connection between two things is a matter of fact, degree and impression, and involves a common sense assessment of the factual situation. Taking that approach and bearing in mind the above cases, if services consist of things done to a temporarily imported vessel, such as painting, mechanical work, or hull repairs, those services are supplied directly in connection with the temporary import. The services can be zero-rated, provided that the other requirements of section 11(2)(ca) are satisfied. 3 Furthermore, when a person provides marina space or storage facilities in New Zealand for yachts with temporary import entries, it is considered that the supply is zero-rated, provided that the recipient is not resident in New Zealand. Since holding bays for aircraft are supplied directly in connection with international transportation (as was decided in the Auckland Regional Authority case), the clear implication is that they are also supplied directly in connection with the aircraft themselves. By analogy, marina space and storage facilities for overseas yachts are also supplied directly in connection with the vessels themselves. Evidential requirements Because the supplier is seeking to zero-rate a supply of goods or services, he or she must be able to show that the supply was made to a non-resident in respect of a temporary import. In the case of a claim for zero-rating under section 11(1)(ba)(i), the supplier of goods must be able to show that the goods were wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise formed part of the temporary import. If section 11(1)(ba)(ii) applies to consumable goods, the supplier must show that the goods were consumed in the process of repair, etc. The supplier need not perform this work personally, but must be able to show that the supply was made to a non-resident in respect of a temporary import. Evidence will be required to support a claim for zero-rating. The evidence that is appropriate in any particular case may vary, but could include: • a copy of the recipient’s passport. • a copy of the NZ Customs Service temporary import entry permit. • details of the goods and services supplied (this could be by way of invoices and photographs), and • evidence to show that those goods became part of the temporary import or were consumed in the process. This could simply be an explanation of the work done. Example The New Zealand Customs Service gives temporary import status to a yacht that enters New Zealand waters. The yachtsperson, a non-resident, hires a berth at a marina. She undertakes repairs to the vessel, and installs a new engine which she has purchased. She also buys spare mooring ropes, new life jackets and a lifebuoy. The following GST treatment applies: • Charges to the visiting yachtsperson for any services made directly in connection with the yacht, such as repairs and the berth hire at the marina, can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(ca). 4 5 • Charges to the visitor for consumable items used in the course of repairs, such as motor oil, can be zero-rated under section 11(1)(ba)(ii), provided that the items become unusable or worthless as a result of the repair process. • The supply of the engine to the visitor can be zero-rated, provided the supplier of the engine has kept a copy of: the temporary import entry permit, and/or the visitor's passport, and/or documents that show that the goods have become part of the temporary import (e.g. a photograph or other evidence). • The supply of the life jackets and the lifebuoy is standard-rated. These items do not meet the criteria for zero-rating, as they are not goods fixed or attached in some way to the yacht with a sufficient degree of permanence. Both life jackets and lifebuoys remain loose items that are easily removed from the vessel and are not incorporated into it. They may be stored on the craft or even (in the case of lifebuoys) placed on a suitable carrying bracket, but even where they are supplied in the course of repairing, renovating or modifying the vessel, they are not considered to have been wrought into, affixed to, or attached to the vessel with the degree of annexation that section 11(1)(ba)(i) requires. • Ropes should be standard-rated unless the supplier has evidence or witnessed that they became part of the craft (e.g. by becoming part of the rigging). In this example the ropes are spare mooring ropes. Because they have not been "wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise form part of" the vessel (being merely stored away) they should be standard-rated. • If the visitor had engaged a person to install the new engine, two separate supplies would have occurred. The sale of the engine, which could be zero-rated if the supplier maintained records as indicated above, and the supply of the installation services, which could be zero-rated under section 11(2)(ca) (being services supplied directly in connection with the temporary import). Adequate records to show that the services were supplied to a non-resident in respect of a temporary import would need to be kept.
\[Interpretation statement IS3387 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in September 2002\] GST TREATMENT OF COURT AWARDS AND OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENTS Unless otherwise stated, all references in this interpretation statement are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GSTA”). Summary Out of court settlements or court awards might arise as a result of a dispute regarding an earlier supply, and in some cases a new supply might arise such as a transfer of property in return for payment where ownership is in dispute. For GST to be payable upon a payment arising from a court award or out of court settlement the payment must be consideration for a supply, or an adjustment to consideration for an earlier supply. In order for a supply to be subject to GST, the Commissioner considers that some element of reciprocity should be present to link a consideration to that supply. Whilst the definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the GSTA is broad, the Courts have noted that it does not dispense with the requirement that there is a linkage between the consideration and the supply. In New Zealand Refining v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187, Blanchard J stated that despite the wide definition of consideration, there was a “practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply.” (p. 13,193) In order for a “sufficient connection” to be present, both the High Court and Court of Appeal have in recent cases emphasised the specific need for an element of “reciprocity” between parties in order for a consideration to be linked to a supply. In Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC), Gallen J stated that whilst the statutory definition of consideration in the GSTA was indeed broad, the definition did not remove the requirement for an element of reciprocity within a transaction for a payment to be consideration for a supply: The question arises therefore, whether the definition is so worded that there is no need for an element of reciprocity. With some hesitation I have come to the conclusion it does not. (p. 13,150) In Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 there was a stronger emphasis upon reciprocity. Blanchard J stated that: “the payments were not made pursuant to any covenant by the Crown involving reciprocal obligations enforceable at law”. He then concluded that the Trust in this case was not making a supply (to the Crown or third parties) as there was “an absence of reciprocity in the relationship” (at p.15,079). Tipping J agreed with the judgment of Blanchard J, and additionally stated : When coupled with the definitions of taxable activity and consideration, to which I shall come, and in spite of the width of those definitions, the concept of supplying services has a reciprocal connotation. It is not apt to catch the fulfilment by trustees of their duties as such, albeit that such fulfilment will necessarily, in a direct or indirect way, be of benefit to the beneficiaries and the settlor. (p. 15,081) Subsequent cases (discussed in the item below) have also used a framework based on elements of reciprocity to identify a nexus between a supply and a consideration. 1 In order for a payment to be for a supply pursuant to section 8 of the GSTA, an identifiable supply must have been made (or agreed to) by one party and there must be an element of reciprocity in the obligation by another party to make payment for that supply. Tenuous and unrealistic connections are not sufficient to evidence the link required for a payment to be consideration for a supply. Reciprocity is evidenced by legally enforceable obligations between the payer and supplier which may arise as a result of the agreement of the parties, or be imposed between the parties by a court. Obligations may be legally enforceable via statute, common law or in equity. A payment will therefore only be consideration for a supply where such an element of reciprocity exists, and the payment is for the supply or is an adjustment to the consideration for a previous supply. Payments that relate to a supply, but are not for that supply will not be “consideration”. • If the payment is consideration for a supply, the supplier will be liable to GST if the supply was made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. • If the payment is a variation of the previously agreed consideration and within the scope of section 25 GSTA, a GST adjustment may need to be made by the relevant parties. • If a global award is made by the court and part of the award is payment for a taxable supply, apportionment must be undertaken pursuant to section 10(18) GSTA and the amount properly attributable to the taxable supply ascertained. • If the payment is within the scope of section 20A(4) of the GSTA (being the recovery of a sum expended in determining liability to tax as defined in section 20A(2)) the Act operates to deem the payment to be in return for taxable supplies, and output tax is payable. Background The 1990 TIB item An interpretation statement regarding the GST treatment of damages and out of court settlements was published in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 1, No 11, June 1990. This item stated that whether sums paid in settlement of a claim were GST inclusive was determined by the nature of the award or the underlying transaction. The item raised the following questions and proposed the relevant treatment to be applied: • Where there is an out of Court settlement and all or part of the settlement can be connected back to the original taxable supplies, does GST apply? If so, how is the GST calculated? The proportion of the settlement connected to the supply of the original taxable supplies would be subject to GST. 2 • Where there is an unscheduled global payment in full and final settlement of prior legal proceedings it may not be possible to connect this back to the original supply. Does GST still apply? Details of the facts of each particular case would need to be examined to ascertain whether a GST liability exists. If it is established that part of the payment relates to the original supply an apportionment may be required if the amount relating to the supply is not specified. • Where there were no taxable supplies in the first instance, does GST apply to the settlement? No. There must be a supply of goods or services before GST can apply. The Commissioner decided to review the above item owing to the development of case law since the publication date. This statement replaces the item published in the TIB in June 1990. Legislation Under section 8 of the GSTA GST is charged on supplies made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity: 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. A taxable activity is one that is carried on “continuously or regularly” (section 6(1)(a)). 6 Meaning of term “taxable activity” (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association or club: “Supply” is defined in section 5 of the Act as including “all forms of supply” The definition of consideration is found in section 2 of the Act: 3 2 Interpretation (1) In this Act, other than in section 12, unless the context otherwise requires,— Consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Section 10(2) of the Act defines the “value of supply” and highlights a link between consideration and supply: Subject to this section, the value of the supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,— (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: (b) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is not consideration in money, the open market value of the consideration. Section 10(18) contemplates apportionment of a payment where it only partly relates to a taxable supply: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Section 20A deals with GST incurred in determining liability to tax: (2) Subject to this section, any goods and services acquired by the registered person in connection with— (a) The calculation of the taxable income of the registered person for any income year: (b) The calculation or determination of the goods and services tax payable by the registered person for any taxable period: (c) The preparation, institution, or presentation of an objection or challenge to or an appeal against or in consequence of any determination or assessment made, in respect of the registered person, by the Commissioner under the provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: (d) Any contribution by the registered person towards the expenditure incurred by any other taxpayer or registered person, as the case may be, where— (i) if the expenditure were incurred by the first-mentioned registered person, it would be an allowable deduction in calculating the taxable income of that person or allowable in the calculation or determination of any goods and services tax payable by that person; and (ii) the first-mentioned registered person has objected to or challenged or appealed against an assessment or determination made, in relation to the matter by, the Commissioner under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985,— shall be deemed to be goods and services acquired by the registered person for the principle purpose of making taxable supplies; and the Commissioner shall allow that person to make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of the tax charged thereon. (4) Any amount received by the registered person at any time, whether by way of reimbursement, award of the Court, recovery, or otherwise howsoever in respect of goods and services deemed 4 under this section to be acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, shall be deemed to be supplied by that registered person in the course of their taxable activity in the taxable period in which it is received. Section 25 of the Act deals with credit and debit notes as they relate to adjustments to the nature or consideration for a supply: (1) This section shall apply where, in relation to the supply of goods and services by any registered person,— (a) That supply of goods and services has been cancelled; or (aa) The nature of that supply of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered; or (b) The previously agreed consideration for that supply of goods and services has been altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or (c) The goods and services or part of those goods and services supplied have been returned to the supplier,— and the supplier has— (d) Provided a tax invoice in relation to that supply and as a result of any one or more of the above events, the amount shown thereon as tax charged on that supply is incorrect; or (e) Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period for which output tax on that supply is attributable and, as a result of any one or more of the above events, has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax on that supply. ANALYSIS OF GST LEGISLATION AND PRINCIPLES When is a payment sufficiently connected to a supply Section 8 of the GSTA provides that a tax is to be charged on the supply of goods and services (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand. The supply must be made for a consideration by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The need to identify the “supply” “Supply” in the GSTA is stated to include “all forms of supply”. In order to determine whether a payment is “consideration” in the GST sense, there must be a supply of something for which the payment is consideration pursuant to section 2 of the Act. It follows that if there is no supply the payment can not be consideration. The need to identify the supply was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. The Chatham Islands case involved a payment made by the Crown to a charitable trust that was established by the Crown to provide services and promote the wellbeing of Chatham Islands residents. Tipping J said: While it is clear that the services do not have to be supplied to the person providing the consideration (as defined) for them, it is still necessary for there to be a supply of services within the proper meaning 5 of the phrase. Although services are defined as meaning anything which is not goods, it is still necessary for there to have been a supply of something. (p. 15,081) (emphasis added) A similar comment was made in NZ Refining Co v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,307 (HC), where it was considered whether a series of payments made by the Crown to the refinery pursuant to an agreement to release the Crown from an earlier undertaking were consideration for any supply by the refinery, either to the Crown or to third parties. In order to receive the payments the refinery had to be operational on the date of payment. If the refinery did not meet the condition of being operational the only recourse to the Crown was to withhold the payment. Henry J said: The tax is chargeable against payments which go to make up the value of an identifiable supply which has been made. Payments which are received in the course of a taxable activity are not chargeable unless they also have that additional quality or character, which these do not. GST is a consumer tax on goods and services supplied, not an activity tax on producing goods and providing the means of supplying services. (p. 12,314) (emphasis added) Supply to third parties Whilst it is necessary for there to have been a supply of something, the supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment. In Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 (CA), the GST treatment of payments of school fees by parents of pupils to the proprietors of integrated state schools was analysed. McKay J, referring to the definition of supply, said: It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a “taxable activity” under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. (p. 10,036) When is a payment consideration for a supply? GST is a tax on the supply of goods and services carried on in the course of a taxable activity. It is a transaction based tax: CIR v Databank Systems Ltd \[1989\] 1 NZLR 422. It is not a tax on receipts or turnover: NZ Refining (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at 13,193. Accordingly, not all payments received by a registered person in the course of their taxable activity will be for supplies. As Blanchard J noted in NZ Refining: There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST . (p. 13,193) The Act requires there be consideration for a supply in order for GST to be imposed. Section 2 defines consideration as including any payment made, or any act or forbearance, whether voluntary or involuntary, and made “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of a supply”. 6 A strict contractual analysis does not need to be undertaken in order to link a payment to a supply as noted by McKay J in Turakina. Referring to the definition of consideration in the act, the judge said: It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a “taxable activity” under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. Likewise, the value of the supply is to be measured by the consideration, whether or not the consideration is provided by the person to whom the service is supplied. It is not necessary that there should be a contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as the consideration is “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply” (emphasis added) Further, the statutory definition of consideration has been interpreted in the High Court as wider than the common law meaning: In the context of this matter I am not persuaded that it is helpful or appropriate to reflect upon the ordinary meaning of the word. The statutory definition extends the ordinary meaning and it is the scope of the extended statutory definition which needs to be determined. (per Chisholm J in The Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 at 13,085) However, in Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC), Gallen J stated that whilst the statutory definition of consideration in the GSTA was wider than the contract law meaning, the definition did not remove the contract law requirement for an element of reciprocity to be present within a transaction in order for the payment to be “consideration” for a supply: The question arises therefore, whether the definition is so worded that there is no need for an element of reciprocity. With some hesitation I have come to the conclusion it does not. The use of the term “consideration” imports the specialised meaning given to that term in a legal context, which would tell against a meaning involving a mere handling of the funds. (p. 13,150) (emphasis added) The statutory focus is therefore on establishing a nexus between the supply and consideration. It is recognised that whilst the definition of consideration is broad, it does not dispense with the requirement that a linkage exist between the supply and consideration. As said by Blanchard J in NZ Refining: “to constitute consideration for a supply the payment must be for that supply” (p. 13,193) In evaluating the existence or nature of the requisite nexus for a payment to be consideration for a supply, the courts have consistently emphasised the need for reciprocity in the relationship. McGechan J stated in CIR v Suzuki (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 at 15,831 that: The breadth of the term “consideration” – inherent in the definitional phrasing “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” – is to be acknowledged; but as those terms in themselves indicate it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. The Suzuki approach is consistent with cases such as NZ Refining, which essentially held that conditions upon which payment depended did not amount to a state of 7 reciprocity between the parties. The payments could not be consideration for any supplies as the mechanics of the legislation require a “sufficient connection” between the payment and the supply. There were no obligations between the parties as if the refining company failed to meet the conditions for payment, the only recourse to the Crown was to withhold payment The statement of Blanchard J above appears at first glance to be more restrictive than his statement in the same case that there needed to be a sufficient connection between the consideration and the supply. However, when the phrases are placed in their order in the judgement it can be seen that the reference to “sufficiently connected” should not be construed as broadening the requirements for the linkage of a payment a supply beyond those where the payment is made for the supply in question: The definition of "consideration", though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST. (p. 13,193) To analyse the linkage between a payment and supply, it is necessary to have regard to the legal arrangements actually entered into: In taxation disputes the court is concerned with the legal arrangements actually entered into, not with the economic or other consequences of the arrangements: per Blanchard J in New Zealand Refining v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at 13,192 (citing Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 at 706) “In respect of” When will a payment be made pursuant to sufficient reciprocal obligations such that the payment is consideration pursuant to its definition in section 2 GSTA? In the New Zealand Refining case, the Commissioner attempted to use a broad approach, as can be seen in the following extract from his argument: “Consideration” is defined in relation to a supply of goods and services to a person. The supply in this case was by NZ Refining to the oil companies. It was submitted that the supply was either the making available of the refinery (even if it was not used) or the actual use of the refining facilities. “Consideration” is given an extremely wide definition in the Act, which “breathe\[s\] comprehensiveness”, as Richardson J said in C of IR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 at p 6,102; \[also reported as Databank Systems Ltd v C of IR \[1989\] 1 NZLR 422 at p 431\]. It includes any payment made “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply of goods or services”. The payment did not have to be from the recipient of the supply (so it could be a payment by the Crown), nor did it have to be directly linked to a particular supply. It is said to be sufficient that there be a linkage “in the broadest way” between the supply and the payment. “In respect of” is a phase of wide import, as this Court has previously recognised (Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 and C of Ir v Fraser (1996) 17 NZRC 12,607)..... ...In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is said to be a proper inference that the payments achieved their purpose but it was enough, in fact, if it was intended to achieve it, ie if they constituted an inducement. This, it was submitted, provided a sufficient linkage for the purposes of the GST Act; linkage can be “broad based” and “pragmatic”. (p. 13,191) (emphasis added) 8 It can be seen from the judgement of Blanchard J in NZ Refining (see previous page) that the broad definition of the terms “ in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” that was contended for the Commissioner was not accepted by the Court. The lack of any element of reciprocity between NZ Refining and either the Crown or third parties meant that the payments were received in the course of NZ Refining’s taxable activity but were not payments made in consideration for any supply by NZ Refining. The meaning of “in respect of” was directly considered in the Taupo Ika Nui case where a body corporate collected an annual sum of money that paid for upkeep and maintenance for proprietors of a timeshare resort. The Crown alleged that the payments were “in respect of” the provision of the maintenance services. Gallen J concluded the payments were not consideration for any supply despite the term “in respect of” appearing to be broad, and stated: Further, while the term “in respect of” is unrestricted and wide enough to encompass a meaning which would include what took place in this case, it must be construed in relation not only to the use of the term “consideration” but to the allied concepts of “response to” or “inducement of”, both of which involve an element of reciprocity. “In respect of” has not been defined in the above cases by reference to what it includes, but what it does not. The cases both illustrate situations that are outside the scope of the phrase, yet both affirm the breadth of the phrase to be only to the extent that there are reciprocal obligations between the parties. The NZ Refining case further distinguishes between conditions upon which payment depends, and reciprocal obligations between the parties; meaning that conditions upon which payment depends will not, without more, be sufficient for the payment to be consideration for any supply. “For the inducement of” The words “for the inducement of” were considered in the Chatham Islands case. In this case the Crown made a payment to a charitable trust, allowing the trust to provide for its beneficiaries services that were previously the responsibility of the Crown. The Commissioner argued that the payments were consideration as they induced the trust to carry out its functions, and that this was a supply of services to the Crown. In the alternative, the Commissioner argued that the supplies were made by the trust to its beneficiaries. Tipping J felt that duties that existed independently of any payments being made did not have the requisite reciprocal connotation required by the concept of a supply for consideration, whether the consideration was in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply: When coupled with the definitions of taxable activity and consideration, to which I shall come, and in spite of the width of those definitions, the concept of supplying services has a reciprocal connotation. It is not apt to catch the fulfilment by the trustees of their duties as such, albeit that such fulfilment will necessarily, in a direct or indirect way, be of benefit to the beneficiaries and the settlor. For these reasons, I do not consider that the trustees engaged in any supply of services in terms of s8. There is a further and related difficulty in the Commissioner’s argument. Any supply of services by the trustees must have been made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them. To 9 constitute a taxable activity the supply of services must be for a consideration. Thus the definition of that term, which imports the concept of the supply of services already discussed (and which I am assuming for present purposes to have occurred) requires the payment or other qualifying conduct to have been made or done “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply of the services”. As Blanchard J has put it, there must be a sufficient nexus between the payment or other conduct relied on as consideration and the relevant services. If one assumes, contrary to my earlier conclusion, that what the trustees did amounted to the supply of services to the Crown as settlor and/or to the Islanders as beneficiaries, it must also be shown that the payments by the Crown had a sufficient connection with those services to fulfil at least one limb of the statutory definition. The money was not paid for any particular purpose, albeit that in terms of ordinary trustee law it had to be used within the terms of the Trust. I therefore have difficulty in seeing how it can be said that the payments made by the Crown were in respect of or for the inducement of any services. Clearly the payments were not in response to the supply of services. With the use of the money not in any way related to any particular purpose mandated, except by the conventional requirement that the trustees should keep within broad and general powers vested in them by the Trust deed, I do not consider the relationship between the payment and the (assumed) services fulfils the definition of consideration. As a consequence, the trustees did not make their (assumed) supply of services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. There is nothing I wish to add to what Blanchard J has said about s 5(6D). These are my reasons for agreeing that the appeal should be allowed with the consequences as to costs proposed in the judgment prepared by Blanchard J. (p 15,081) (emphasis added) Also in the Chatham Islands case, Blanchard J stated: The Trust is not making a supply of anything to the settlor in exchange for, or induced by, the payments; it is the recipient of an endowment to be held upon the terms of the deed. Nor can it, consistently with well established principles, be said that the Trust is performing services for its beneficiaries in return for a consideration provided by the settlor. It acts on their behalf and in their interests. They are benefited by its activities. In the broadest sense, therefore, it may be said that because it serves their interests it is performing services for them. But there is no consideration passing to the Trust since the payments are not properly seen as an inducement. Without them, it is true, it would not have even come into existence. But in law they cannot be properly characterised as inducing its functions nor can it be said that what the Trust did with the money was a response to the payment. There is an absence of reciprocity in the relationship. (p. 15,079) (emphasis added) Again, as with the phrase “in respect of” the scope of the phrase “for the inducement of” has been defined by what it is not in the Chathams case. The payments made by the Crown were not for the inducement of any supplies as there was an absence of reciprocity between the parties. “In response to” Finally, the meaning of the term “in response to” is illustrated by the Suzuki case, where the Court of Appeal upheld the findings of McGechan J in the High Court. A series of documents were read as having the contractual intention of placing on one of the parties the obligation to perform repairs to vehicles under warranty, in return for an obligation by the other party to pay. The Court of Appeal stated: The Judge was of the view that the payment made was in discharge of the SMC warranty, in the sense that SMC would not be paying it but for that warranty, “but it also is made in respect of the SNZ repair services rendered.” The SNZ repair service was thus an integral component of the situation and activity which brought about the SMC payment. That brought the supply within the GST Acts 10 definition of “consideration” for such a payment. “There is a clear nexus. The payment, if not “in respect of” certainly was “in response to” those repair services.” (p. 17,100) (emphasis added) In the Suzuki case the payment in question was by the above statement impliedly within the scope of the definition of “in response to”, and as for the above cases, this was determined by reference to the existence of reciprocal obligations between the parties. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court in all respects, and characterised the payments as consideration for the supply of a repair service by SNZ to SMC (and simultaneously via another warranty from SNZ to its customers) rather than consideration for the supply of repair services to customers. There was a contractual intention of the parties that SNZ would carry out the repairs under the SMC warranty, and that SMC would pay SNZ after these had been completed (p. 17,102). The underlying obligation upon SMC to pay for the repairs represented the requisite reciprocal obligation (for the payment to be consideration), and this obligation to pay arose upon the occurrence of a contingent event (being the repair under warranty). The payments were “in response to” the repair of the cars, yet the service for which they were consideration was the supply of repair services from SNZ to SMC rather than the service of the actual repairs of the cars. In addition, the Suzuki case is obliquely further support for the narrow view of the definition of the phrase “in respect of” (as requiring underlying reciprocal obligations between the parties in order for a payment to be consideration), adopted above. As the requisite reciprocal obligations were present between the parties, the Court of Appeal did not in detail consider the wording of the definition of consideration, nor the exact scope of each phrase within. They did however adopt the characterisation that the supplies were from SNZ to SMC, which is the adoption of a more narrow nexus between the payment and the supply. A broad definition of the term “in respect of” in this case would have been likely to characterise the payments as consideration in respect of the actual repair services. Reciprocal obligations As GST is a tax on transactions, ultimately the commercial reality of a transaction will aid in determination of what is actually being supplied. Once the existence of a supply is established, the relationship between the parties needs to be evaluated. If the supply cannot be connected to the payment by enforceable reciprocal obligations it can not be said the payment is consideration for the supply. The payer and the supplier must have the ability to enforce the bargain for the transaction to have the reciprocity required to impose GST. It is not necessary for there to be a contract between the parties, but reciprocity does require some type of enforceable reciprocal or two-sided relationship that links the payment to the supply. Other types of legal and enforceable obligations that are not contractual include: obligations enforceable in equity, such as an award of quantum meruit; and obligations that exist via operation of statute (eg under the Fair Trading Act 1986 – see examples below). Despite statements in cases such as Shell New Zealand v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 that the term “in respect of” was a phrase of the widest import, the courts in recent years have consistently rejected tenuous linkages between payments and supplies, and have reinforced the requirement there must be enforceable reciprocity between the parties in regards to the degree of linkage required. 11 Examples where reciprocity was clearly held to be absent are the cases of NZ Refining and Chatham Islands. In NZ Refining, the Crown could only cease payments if the conditions upon which to receive the payments were not fulfilled. Similarly, in the Chatham Islands case the Crown had no means of recourse if the Trust did not make any supplies, other than an action in equity against the trustees based on their duties as trustees rather than on any equitable duties in relation to the payment from the Crown (p. 15,079). The Commissioner considers that the relatively recent rejection of broad linkages in the cases mentioned above and the consistent emphasis upon reciprocity, suggests the inclusion of the words “in respect of”, “in response to” or for the “inducement of” in the definition of consideration have a meaning by reference to the time at which the consideration passes. “In respect of” can be characterised as a contemporaneous situation where payment is given for a supply at the time of payment. “In response to” would include cases where a supply is received and later paid for, and “for the inducement of” would include cases where an enforceable supply or agreement for supply was tendered following an offer of payment for that supply. The payments by the Crown in NZ Refining were not “in respect of” any supply by the refinery as there were no enforceable reciprocal obligations in return for payment. Similarly, in the Chatham Islands case the payments were not an inducement for any supply despite the fact that but for the payments the Chatham Islands Trust would not exist for the benefit of the Chatham Islanders. Finally, in the Suzuki case, the contractual obligations between the parties were the basis upon which the supply relationship was analysed, with the result that the supply was not of the end product of repair services, but was to Suzuki Japan (SMC) via the enforceable and reciprocal obligation for SMC to make payment in response to the contingent event of an actual repair under the SMC warranty. Underpinning all transactions where a payment is within the definition of consideration for a supply is the requirement there are enforceable reciprocal obligations between the parties. Earlier cases such as Databank emphasised the broad nature of the definition yet more recently attempts to use a broad linkage have been rejected by the courts. All transactions where a payment is consideration for a supply must be based upon a platform of reciprocal obligations as noted in the cases above. In order to determine when a payment is “sufficiently connected” to a supply to be consideration for that supply, the following principles can be drawn from the cases: • It is the legal nature of the transaction that will define the nexus between the payment and any supply: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. • For a payment to be consideration for a supply there must first be an identifiable supply: NZ Refining and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. • The concept of supply is active; to supply is to furnish or provide: Databank. 12 • For a payment to be consideration there must be a sufficient connection between the payment and a supply of goods or services: NZ Refining. • Tenuous or unrealistic connections between the payment and supply will not be sufficient: Suzuki (HC). • A sufficient connection involves legally enforceable reciprocal obligations between the payer and payee: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust, New Zealand Refining and Suzuki. • Conditions that must be fulfilled to receive payment do not, without more, evidence a supply: NZ Refining. • An expectation that the recipient of the payment would carry out a certain activity is not enough for a payment to be in respect of or for the inducement of a supply. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity that has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. See Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. • A supply will only be liable to tax if it is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity: Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. Adjustments to consideration It is possible, where a payment is made as a result of a court award or an out of court settlement, that it will not be consideration for a supply but will be an adjustment to the previous consideration provided for a supply, such as a partial refund of the consideration for a supply. Section 25 of the GSTA deals with situations where a supplier has either issued a tax invoice or furnished a return with the incorrect amount of output tax shown (section 25(1)(d) or section 25(1)(e)) due to subsequent changes to a taxable supply transaction. After specified adjustment events (section 25(1)(a) to 25(1)(c) inclusive) the supplier must issue a credit or debit note to the recipient of the supply and both parties (if registered) must adjust their output and input tax amounts where required. Output tax is required to be charged upon the supply of goods or services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity pursuant to section 8 GSTA. An invoice or tax return will only have been furnished where a taxable supply has already occurred or been agreed to, as for a supply to be taxable it must also be made for a consideration, or no tax is payable (section 10(19) GSTA). In order to make an adjustment under section 25, one of the following must be satisfied: • The supply has been cancelled, or • The supply has been fundamentally varied or altered, or • The previously agreed consideration has been altered, or 13 • The goods or part of those goods have been returned. In order for section 25 to apply there must have been either a taxable supply, or an agreement for a taxable supply between the parties to the transaction, and the output tax must be either incorrectly provided for on the invoice, or incorrectly returned. (a) cancelled The meanings of “cancelled”, “fundamentally varied” and “altered” are not defined in the Act. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995) defines cancel as: cancel .v 1 tr. a withdraw or revoke (a previous arrangement). b discontinue (an arrangement in progress). The Commissioner considers the above definition of “cancel” (including discontinuance as well as withdrawal or revocation) can be appropriately applied to section 25(1)(a) as in the GST context the cancellation is of a supply, not a contract. Situations where a supply could no longer be performed would be within the above definition, even if the parties had not agreed to a formal contractual cancellation. (b) alteration of consideration Section 25(1)(b) applies where the previously agreed consideration is altered. Consideration must already have passed or been agreed to for output tax on a taxable supply to require adjustment pursuant to section 25. As the courts have emphasised the need for reciprocity between the parties in order for a payment to be consideration for a supply, reciprocity must be established in order for the supply to be taxable. Once a supply is taxable, if the consideration has not passed, it will be due as a debt (being payment owing for a supply). Looking at section 25 and the GSTA as a whole, the Commissioner considers that in order for the previously agreed consideration to be altered the parties or a court must actually alter the consideration; rather than an event having the economic effect of altering the price for a supply being included within the meaning of the subsection. Aside from the constant citation of the Marac case that the court must look into the legal arrangements actually entered into in determining liability to tax, this approach is consistent with the context of consideration in the GSTA which requires reciprocity in order for a payment to be linked to a supply. A payment that passes between parties (although nominally because of a supply) will not alter the consideration unless it involves reciprocity between the parties in regards to altering the consideration for the supply. Commonly this would occur by agreement of the parties, but it could also for example be imposed by Court order, or by a Commission of Inquiry (pursuant to section 15 Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994). Support for the statement above is found in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Montgomerie v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,569. This case considered whether payments received by a liquidator of a company for transactions made void by the operation of section 292 of the Companies Act 1993 were alterations to consideration previously provided by the company for supplies it received. The High Court held that partial 14 recoveries were alterations to the consideration as part of the value provided by the company was returned. The Court of Appeal did not favour this analysis, and stated: We are not attracted to the concept that a recovery in part only amounts in itself to alteration of consideration provided for in the underlying agreement in terms of s25(1)(b). The contract price is not reduced merely because pursuant to Court order or agreement reached between liquidator and creditor the latter restores to the company all or part of the value received from the company during the “specified period” in s 292. (p. 15,369) (emphasis added) In Montgomerie the payments made by the creditor appear to have been viewed by the High Court as an alteration to the consideration. Yet whilst the transactions appear to have had the economic effect of reducing the contract price, the Court of Appeal pointed out that the payments were made owing to the provisions of the Companies Act, and this in itself did not mean there was an alteration of consideration for the previous supplies. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal is founded upon the principles behind consideration, including the requirement that there is reciprocity present within a transaction in order to link a payment to a supply. If as in the above case, a payment is made that is in some way connected to an original supply and has the appearance of reducing the consideration previously provided for that supply, it will not alter the consideration unless the parties to the transaction agree to do so. The payment made in the above case was as a result of a one-sided transaction as distinguished from one that is reciprocal; as the liquidator had a statutory right to void previous transactions and require payment from the creditors. Although the statute provided a link between the payment and the previous supply, the link was by reference to issues that were different to those that would reduce the contract price for the supply, and the Court of Appeal held accordingly. (aa) fundamentally varied or altered Section 25(1)(aa) was included in the Act by amendment in 1986 and states that an adjustment of output tax might be made if the nature of a supply has been fundamentally varied or altered. There is a mention in the Public Information Bulletin #150, July 1986 regarding the introduction of the subsection: Where goods are hired with an option to purchase within a set period the arrangement normally falls within the terms of the Hire Purchase Act 1971. The GST is therefore payable at the commencement of the hire. However, a potential anomaly existed where the option to buy was not taken up. The agreement then would have become a mere agreement to hire and the wrong amount of output tax accounted for. Section 25 as previously drafted did not provide scope for this. This amendment ensures that in the above situation and any similar circumstances an adjustment can be made. (emphasis added)The necessity for the amendment is illustrated by the hire purchase example given above. Changing the hire purchase agreement into a mere agreement to hire would not necessarily have the effect of altering the overall consideration. If the consideration was not altered, the (then) existing section 25(1)(b) could not be applied. When a hire purchase agreement is entered into, GST on the whole supply amount is calculated at the beginning of the agreement (section 9(3)(b) GSTA as the supply is 15 deemed to take place at this time. Where the option to purchase is subsequently not exercised the nature of the supply is no longer that of a purchase, it is merely a hire with the GST payable in instalments (section 9(3)(a)), and the successive supplies are deemed to take place each time a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. In a situation where a hire purchase agreement changes to become a mere agreement to hire, a supplier would be disadvantaged by having initially returned the full amount of tax on the transaction, instead of progressive returns of smaller tax amounts. “Fundamental”, “vary” and “alter” are defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999) as: fundamental adj. of or serving as a foundation or core; of central importance. n. 1 a central or primary rule or principle. vary v. 1 differ in size, degree, or nature from something else of the same general class. 2 change from one form or state to another. Modify or change (something) to make it less uniform. alter v. 1 change in character, appearance, direction, etc. In order for GST consequences to arise in section 25, the amount of tax due and payable must alter in order for the invoice or return to be incorrect. (section 25(1)(d) and 25(1)(e)). The critical aspect of section 25(1)(aa) is that the alteration to the nature of the supply affects the tax amount payable in the period to which the invoice or return relates. Where an alteration to the nature of a supply had output tax implications it would often also involve an alteration to the consideration and thus be within subsection 25(1)(b), this would be the usual section applied where the nature of the supply changes. However, where timing or other issues arise as a result of a variation or alteration to the nature of a supply, and they are not within the scope of section 25(1)(b), subsection 25(1)(aa) can be applied. Apportionment of a sum only partly consideration for a taxable supply. Section 10(18) of the GSTA states that where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a payment relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for the part that is properly attributable to it. When can section 10(18) be applied? The term “properly attributable” is not defined in the Act. “Properly” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995) as “correctly, suitably or completely”. Section 10(1) of the GSTA states: For the purposes of this Act the following provisions of this section shall apply for determining the value of any supply of goods and services. 16 Section 10(18) only applies where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, so establishing that there is a taxable supply as well as something else for the consideration is a prerequisite to its application. There have been no cases decided specifically pursuant to this section, however two cases have commented upon its application and scope: CIR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC) and CIR v Coveney (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328 (CA). In the Smiths City case the taxpayer had purchased a commercial property which included an area of bare land. The purchase price was inclusive of GST, and the taxpayer accordingly sought a credit for input tax. The claim was disallowed by the Commissioner on the basis that the supply was one of a going concern and was accordingly zero-rated. The Taxation Review Authority held that two-thirds of the land represented the sale of a going concern and should be zero-rated, and the taxpayer was entitled to an input tax credit based on the amount of the purchase price that related to the bare land. The Commissioner appealed to the High Court where the appeal was dismissed. In the High Court, Tipping J found a case for apportionment was made out under a different section of the Act. In regard to section 10(18) and apportionment of consideration he stated: The framers of the Act have not incorporated any statutory definition of the expression “going concern”. Nor is there any statutory guidance, so far as I am aware, for when and how the apportionment exercise should take place. The only assistance, on the material to which I was referred, seems to derive from section 10(18) which, as earlier noted, provides that where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. That of course relates to the distinction between a supply which is taxable and one which is not. It would seem logical however to apply the same approach to a supply which is in part liable for tax and is in part zero-rated. (p. 9,144) The comments above might be taken to suggest that a single consideration must relate to a taxable supply and a non taxable supply, however it was recognised in Coveney that part of a consideration could relate to some other matter without being restricted only to non taxable supplies. In Coveney the application to allow apportionment of items that comprised part of one supply was rejected. This case concerned the Commissioner’s attempt to disallow part of an input deduction for the purchase of a farm property, on the basis that the transaction involved two supplies – one of the farm and one of the domestic dwelling on the farm. In the High Court, Fraser J concluded there was only a single supply, and that section 10(18) can only apply where a single consideration relates to more than a single taxable supply. This ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal, where Richardson J stated in regard to section 10(18): The provision applies where, and only where, “the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates”. To come within the proviso it is necessary to identify a matter, other than the supply in question, to which the consideration relates. Thus on the supply of land with late settlement, 17 the consideration may contain an interest equivalent component which may fairly be described as a second matter to which the consideration relates. Section 10(18) applies in order to apportion the part of the consideration that is for the taxable supply. As section 10 GSTA as a whole deals with valuation of supplies, the inclusion of the words “properly attributable” in section 10(18) suggest the valuation of the supply is the amount of consideration that would suitably or correctly be provided for the supply in isolation, taking into account the overall consideration provided and if necessary, pro-rating the various amounts. Application of section 20A of the GSTA Section 20A(2) of the GSTA allows a taxpayer to claim an input tax deduction for GST incurred on goods and services acquired for determining liability to tax, by operating as a deeming provision and deeming these goods and services as being acquired for the “principle purpose of making taxable supplies”. Where a taxpayer receives any recovery or reimbursement of costs incurred in determining liability to tax (such as an award of costs in a successful appeal to the TRA), section 20A(4) operates to deem the receipt of the award to be in return for taxable supplies, and requires the taxpayer receiving the award to account for output tax. Such awards or payments are not within the scope of this statement, as the focus of this provision is upon the recovery or award of costs incurred in determining liability to tax rather than awards in settlement of disputes. TAX TREATMENT OF COURT AWARDS AND OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT When a court award is made it is likely that a wrongful act will be involved at some stage of the dispute. However owing to the emphasis placed in the NZ Refining and Chathams cases upon reciprocity and the requirement that a payment must be for a supply, the Commissioner considers that the appropriate focus is whether the award is payment for any supply that has been made, and not the action that gave rise to the award. In order to identify potential GST consequences, every transaction must always be analysed upon its individual facts and will involve the application of GST principles relating to supply and consideration. As the degree of linkage identified above is narrower than in the previous statement for a payment to be consideration for a supply, a broad classification of classes of transactions in the awards and settlement context will be attempted below, rather than stating only that GST principles must be applied to the facts of each transaction. Whilst every transaction must always be analysed upon its individual facts the exercise will involve the application of principles relating to supply and consideration, which have become increasingly conceptual in regards to reciprocity and the required link between supply and consideration. When a payment is made under a court award or out of court settlement and it is consideration for a taxable supply (or an adjustment to a consideration for a taxable supply) this will be taxable. If the payment is made for compensation or damages it is not taxable. 18 Court awards, remedies and GST liability For the purposes of this statement, the term “court awards” refers to all awards made by a binding decision of a third party, including awards of the courts, awards made by tribunals and settlements reached in binding arbitration, that are not within the scope of section 20A(4) GSTA. Where the parties themselves agree on the nature of a settlement, including via mediation or at the invitation of a court, and these are not within the scope of section 20A(4) GSTA, they are referred to in this report as “out of court settlements”. The same GST principles will apply in an analysis of any settlement transaction, whether it is the result of a court award or an out of court settlement. Courts have powers to grant relief pursuant to statute as well as common law. A dispute might result in a number of potential claims and different remedies being available for a party to pursue. The nature of any court awarded payment will be influenced by the claim that is made by the recipient, and determined by the type of remedial award the court makes if the claim is made out. Statutory provisions can provide specific remedies, in addition to preserving the right of a party to receive a common law measure of damages. For example, where a trader has received goods of a lesser quality than they contracted for, they can either claim at common law for damages to be awarded in compensation for the loss they have suffered (relative to the value of the supply), or claim the goods had a “lack of merchantable quality” pursuant to section 43(2) of the Fair Trading Act 1986 (“FTA”). Under the statutory provision, the court can make a specific order to vary or adjust the consideration or order the supplier to refund the purchase price. It is the legal nature of the court award, rather than the economic effect that is the basis for an analysis of reciprocal relations between the parties in regards to the payment and therefore liability to GST. Example An Italian chef purchases an expensive pot for $500, which the retailer claims is of commercial quality and therefore suitable for high use situations such as commercial catering operations. The large pot is used on three occasions. On the occasion of its fourth use one of the handles breaks. The chef is unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade the retailer to replace the pot, as there are no longer any available. Additionally, the retailer refuses to refund the purchase price, owing to its policy only to offer refunds on unused goods. Scenario #1 The chef brings the case to court, claiming general damages, as he has suffered a loss in receiving goods of lesser quality than he paid for. The judge agrees, and orders the retailer to pay the chef $300. 19 • The $300 is compensation for the chef’s loss in receiving goods of poor quality. As the payment is for a loss, the GST consequences are nil. Scenario #2 The chef brings the case to court, claiming that pursuant to section 43(2) of the FTA, the pot had a “lack of merchantable quality” as the handles were not secured by rivets. The judge agrees, and pursuant to section 43(2) of the FTA orders the retailer to refund $300 to the Chef. • The $300 is a refund of the purchase price owing to the specific order of the court. The retailer will need to make a GST adjustment pursuant to section 25 of the GSTA if output tax was paid prior to the time the refund is ordered by the court. The chef (if a registered person) is also required to make an adjustment to their GST return. Whilst damages for loss appear to have the same economic effect as a variation of the purchase price, the two awards above give rise to different treatment for GST purposes. Where damages are awarded for a loss, the nexus of the payment for GST purposes is with the loss, rather than the supply that gave rise to the damages claim. Where a refund of the purchase price is ordered this will give rise to an adjustment for GST purposes regardless of whether the goods are returned to the supplier. Debts and adjustments to consideration If a judgment debt is received that is payment for a previous supply, that payment is consideration for that supply and not a new supply. Even in situations where liability is unclear, where a judgement debt is ordered paid by the court the court is recognising the existence of reciprocal obligations between the parties. By virtue of judgment being ordered the payment is linked to the supply and the requisite element of reciprocity is present. Therefore, the payment will be consideration for the earlier supply. If the supplier accounts for GST on an invoice basis, receipt of the payment will not trigger any GST implications as the GST will have been returned following the issue of the invoice. If the supplier accounts for GST on a payments (cash) basis, receipt of the judgment sum will trigger liability for GST on the original supply. Example B responds to an advertisement offering a 30 day free trial of a new stereo costing $500, and places an order with A. (A, a mail order retailer, accounts for GST on a payments basis.) B understands that if she retains the stereo after 30 days then she has accepted A’s offer to sell it, and B must then make payment of $500 to A. As A is overly trusting, he does not require any credit card details or cash bonds before sending any goods to potential purchasers. A sends the goods to B, and the 30 day period passes (indicating that the offer to sell is accepted). A receives no payment from B, and is unsuccessful in his attempts to contact her or collect the money owing. 20 A brings the case to court, seeking judgment for the $500 owing. The court duly enters judgment for the sum requested. B pays on the day the judgment is entered. • The $500 is consideration for the supply of the stereo. As A accounts for GST on a payments basis, he has not returned GST on the supply of the stereo prior to the award of the judgment sum by the Court. Once B pays A, GST liability is triggered, and A must return the GST on the $500. • If instead, A accounted for GST on an invoice basis, and issued an invoice to B at the time the purchase became finalised (ie, after the 30 day period elapsed), the GST would have been returned under the normal time of supply rules. The subsequent judgment and payment of the $500 would not have any new GST consequences. Awards in restitution Where restitution is received by a party that made a supply (and the supply was made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity) the payment will be consideration for a supply. The legal nature of the transaction will be that the court is recognising obligations exist between the parties. For example, an award for quantum meruit can be made where the recipient has provided something for the payer’s benefit, but where there is no contractual remedy for them to pursue in order to receive payment. “Quantum meruit is the generic term used to identify a right to a reasonable remuneration for goods supplied or services rendered; the same expression is used irrespective of whether the right to remuneration is an incident attached by implication to a contractual relationship or whether it arises independently of contract in one of the assortment of situations which are classified, for lack of a better term, as quasi-contractual”. (per Prichard J, Seton Contracting Ltd v Attorney-General \[1982\] 2 NZLR 368,376. Often an award of this nature is made where a contract is silent as to the price of goods or services, where there has been a supply of something upon the assumption that a contract would eventuate. The above analysis might seem inconsistent with one of the principles drawn from the Chatham Islands case noted above, which states that: An expectation that the recipient of the payment would carry out a certain activity is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity that has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. This statement however refers to a situation where a payment is made, but in return the existence of any potential supply is unclear and uncertain. Where a payment is made but any supply is uncertain there are problems in identifying liability to GST and therefore collecting GST. Therefore the statutory focus is on supplies and not payments, as was identified in Databank. Awards of quantum meruit are made where something of value has been provided by one party, and there is an inability to enforce payment for this owing to a lack of formal contractual relations. Where an award is made for quantum meruit the payment awarded will be consideration for a supply made by the other party. 21 Example A Ltd hears B Ltd is looking for new office accommodation, and puts together a proposal whereby A Ltd will purchase a site, and design and build office space to B Ltd’s requirements. B Ltd chooses the site, and informs A Ltd that its directors have approved A Ltd’s proposal. B Ltd requests A Ltd proceed rapidly as the timing of the completion of the building is important. A Ltd purchases an option to buy the site chosen by B Ltd, and starts work immediately. Ten days later B Ltd informs A Ltd they wish to proceed with an alternative site. Meanwhile the option to purchase the site expires. Despite not having a contract with B Ltd, A Ltd claims in court for the cost of the work performed for B Ltd up to the time of B Ltd’s advice regarding the alternative site. The court holds that despite the absence of a concluded contract, A Ltd proceeded upon the representation of B Ltd, and is entitled to judgment for its normal charge out rates. • The judgment sum is consideration for the supply of services by A Ltd to B Ltd. If a supply is made for consideration then GST is payable. In the above example the recipient of the award had made a supply for which the payer was liable. Rather than in the Chatham Islands case, where any supply was uncertain following payment, in this example the supply is certain and has occurred in order for the supplier to receive a court awarded payment, as the award can only be made retrospectively. The concept of consideration in the GSTA does not require the existence of a contract (see principles above). The court’s action links the (eventual) payment of the award to the supply and the requisite element of reciprocity for a payment to be consideration is present. The payment is thus consideration for a supply, which will be taxable if made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Using the fact situation in the above example, if A Ltd had merely heard B Ltd required the office space, and proceeded having had no communication with B Ltd regarding its proposed requirements, a court would be unlikely to order an award based on quantum meruit as the work could not fairly be said to be at B Ltd’s request. In this situation there is no supply from A Ltd to B Ltd, as there is an absence of reciprocity. Payment awarded for continuing wrong Under section 16A of the Judicature Act 1908, a court can award prospective damages for a continuing wrong, instead of granting an injunction or specific performance. Example A council constructs a sewer pipe on private property without permission of the owners. The owners take the case to court and request the removal of the pipe. 22 The court refuses to order removal of the pipe but exercises its power under section 16A of the Judicature Act 1908, and awards the owners a sum based on the amount they could reasonably expect if the council had agreed to pay for the use of the land. • The payment by the council to the owners is a payment of damages and is not consideration for any supply. It might be argued that the award in the above example is consideration for a supply, as it is for the use of the land. However, the damages are in lieu of the court’s refusal to enforce the plaintiff’s rights via an injunction. On the basis of the Databank characterisation of a supply as being something that is “furnish\[ed\] or provid\[ed\]” there cannot have been a supply in the above case. The court did not require the plaintiffs to make any supply to the defendant, only that they accepted payment in return for non-enforcement of their property rights. Neither the plaintiffs (nor the court on their behalf) have furnished or provided anything to the defendant. What has occurred is that the court has declined to enforce the plaintiffs’ property rights, and the payment merely has a nexus with the continuing trespass. Awards in respect of loss (compensatory damages) The basic principle that governs compensatory damages was stated by Cooke P in Gardiner v Metcalfe \[1994\] 2 NZLR 8 (CA): In general terms there can be no doubt that, as was said in the High Court of Australia in Haines v Bendall (1991) 172 CLR 60,63: “The settled principle governing the assessment of compensatory damages, whether in actions of tort or contract, is that the injured party should receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money can do, will put that party in the same position as he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed or the tort had not been committed...” Compensatory damages are awarded for loss, however the label attached to a payment is not determinative of its nature in terms of liability to GST, as the Act imposes a tax upon goods and services supplied rather than payments received. Where compensatory damages are awarded for a loss, reciprocity will be absent from the transaction. Unlike situations where the payer has gained something at the expense of the recipient, where loss is the basis for an award the recipient can not be said to have supplied anything to the payer in return for the payment. The payer’s causation of the loss gives rise to liability to make payment, but the basis for the other party’s receipt of payment is the fact they have suffered loss rather than made any supply. It is the legal nature of a transaction not its economic effect that determines liability to tax (Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 at 706). The payment cannot be consideration for a supply if it is not reciprocal to the supply of something by the other party. An award for a loss arising from an earlier supply may appear to be an adjustment to consideration. However whilst the calculation of a compensatory award might induce this appearance it will not affect the legal nature of the award. In Coxhead v Newmans Tours Ltd (1993) 6 TCLR 1 (CA) it was said that: 23 ...at common law the purchaser could not recover the purchase price except on a total failure of consideration as money had and received. The ordinary remedy at common law is not the return of a proportion of the purchase price, but damages to compensate the innocent party for the wrong which he has suffered. Where that wrong is the breach of a contract, his loss is measured by the amount which would put him as far as practicable in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. If the breach is the failure to complete the sale of a business, then the purchaser has lost the value of the business, which may be greater or less than the agreed purchase price. (p. 12) (emphasis added) In the Montgomerie case the distinction between the effect of an award or settlement and its legal nature (upon which liability to tax rests) was emphasised. The court stated: We are not attracted to the concept that a recovery in part only amounts in itself to alteration of consideration provided for in the underlying agreement in terms of s 25(1)(b). The contract price is not reduced merely because pursuant to Court order or agreement reached between liquidator and creditor the latter restores to the company all or part of the value received from the company during the “specified period” in s 292. (p. 15,369) (emphasis added) Case S77 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,483 specifically considered the issue whether an amount received for damages could be consideration for any supply subject to GST. The taxpayers were a farming couple registered for GST. A fire they lit on their farm spread to the neighbouring farm and caused substantial damage, leading to allegations of negligence which resulted in an out of court settlement. The taxpayers sought an input tax credit on the amount they paid and this was disallowed by the Commissioner on the basis that the recipient of the payment had made no taxable supplies in return. Barber DJ held that the transaction did not involve the supply of any goods and services to the taxpayers, as the payment was made on account of a loss: While I find that the L partners issued the court proceedings in the course of their taxable activity as agricultural contractors, they have merely received payment of a liability of and from the objectors. The L partners made no supply in return for the payment. They merely received a debt due to them in recompense for the loss they suffered from the fire for which the objectors were responsible. Case S77 emphasised the importance of the distinction between payments and receipts made in the course of a taxable activity and the requirement these are linked to supplies in order for GST liability to arise. Loss may be suffered in connection with a supply. Where payments are compensatory, and relate to loss, the nexus is with the loss, rather than the supply that caused the loss. Example A Ltd sells trucks with freezer units on board. B Ltd, an expanding icecream company purchases a truck for $100,000 so it can deliver its own outgoing orders of icecream, and pays $75,000, with the remaining $25,000 due in one month. The truck is delivered and functions well for two weeks as B Ltd transports icecream from its factory in Invercargill to retailers in Christchurch. One day however, the truck driver arrives in Christchurch to find the entire consignment melted. Upon investigation, the freezer unit on the truck is found to be faulty. 24 B Ltd takes A Ltd to court claiming $20,000 for the loss of the icecream, and a further $10,000 for inconvenience and loss of trade associated with the breakdown. The judge awards the full amount claimed as well as ordering A Ltd to remedy the freezer fault at its own cost. As B Ltd had a payment arrangement with A Ltd for the purchase price of the truck, B Ltd still owes A Ltd $25,000. A Ltd proposes to set off the $30,000 award of the court against the balance owed by B Ltd on the truck. B Ltd agrees, and receives the difference of $5,000 in cash. • The entire award is for the loss B Ltd has suffered, and is not consideration for any supplies it has made. • The set off of $25,000 against the amount owing for the truck does not affect the amount of consideration provided for the truck. The set off has the same effect as if A Ltd paid B Ltd $30,000, and B Ltd then in return paid A Ltd the $25,000 owing on the truck, and thus the consideration for the supply of the truck is $100,000. Applying GST principles, awards made for a loss must be contrasted from reciprocal awards where the payer (or a third party) has gained something as a result of the recipient’s actions and is making the payment in return. Reciprocity is absent where a payment is for loss even if the loss is directly attributable to an earlier supply, as the nature of the payment is that it is for the loss rather than the supply. If a payment is received for a loss the payment will be compensatory and outside the scope of GST. GST treatment of out of court settlements As for court awards, where a payment is for loss or damage it will not be consideration for a supply and there will be no element of reciprocity between the parties in regards to the payment; rather the payment is to compensate one party for the loss caused by the wrongful act of the other. The following section provides examples of out of court settlements that may or may not give rise to GST consequences, rather than providing a conclusive guide to categories of settlement giving rise to GST liability. Where earlier supplies have been made If a debt is recovered that is payment for a previous taxable supply, that payment is consideration for the supply. Example A shop sells groceries to a customer and accepts a cheque for $100 in payment. The shop returns GST on an invoice basis. Five days later it is informed that the cheque has been dishonoured. The shop engages the services of a debt collection company, which some weeks later collects the sum of $110 (including a debt collection fee) in cash from the customer. $100 is passed on to the supermarket, and the agency keeps $10 as its fee. 25 • As the shop has already returned GST after receiving the cheque, there are no additional GST consequences in regards to the $100. The shop is merely collecting the consideration for the original supply. • The debt collection company must return GST on the $10 it has charged for the supply of services it has made to the supermarket, for which the defaulting customer has paid. The supply by the debt collection company to the shop is not an exempt supply of a “financial service” as debt collection services are expressly excluded from the definition of “financial service” pursuant to section 3(4)(b) GSTA. Adjustments to GST If an earlier taxable supply has been made, and the nature of that supply has been fundamentally altered or cancelled, or the consideration for that supply has been adjusted, section 25 will apply. Example A purchases a kilo of roasted coffee beans from B for $50. The coffee was advertised as being “premium quality”, however when A opens the bag one week later he can see the beans are clearly of a cheap and inferior quality. Outraged, A returns to B’s roastery, and demands that B refund the difference in price between what he paid for and what he actually received. B apologises profusely, explaining that a mistake in labelling the coffee must have occurred. B agrees to refund $25, which is the difference in price between the two grades of beans. • The original consideration for the coffee ($50) has been varied as a result of the partial refund B has given to A. The variation is because the parties agreed to a partial refund, not because the amount B paid to A represented the difference in price between the goods. (It is the legal nature of the transaction that will determine liability to tax, not its economic consequences.) If GST has already been returned on the $50, B will need to make a GST adjustment and issue a credit note to correct the original tax invoice issued. The result of the above refund means the consideration for the original supply of the coffee has been varied, and is in fact $25, meaning that B will have returned too much output tax. B will be able to claim a credit for the amount of tax already returned that corresponds to the refund given to A. If B did not issue a tax invoice at the time of the original supply (and has not returned GST on the value of the original consideration) he will not need to make a GST adjustment. B will return output tax on the $25 sale that is the ultimate result of the above transaction. 26 Example A purchases B’s truck for $10,000 plus GST. Only B is GST registered. B provides A with a tax invoice, and A takes possession of the truck. B returns GST on the supply of the truck. A does not register the change of ownership papers immediately. Two weeks later A finds the truck has disappeared from its usual parking spot, and after making inquiries finds out that it has been repossessed. A discovers that 5 days after she purchased the truck B’s bank had served B with papers to exercise its rights as holder of a registered security interest in the truck to repossess it for B’s non payment of its business loan. Rather than waste time arguing in court over ownership of the truck, A accepts a refund from B of the $10,000 plus GST paid for the truck (which is now in the possession and ownership of the bank). • The original supply of the truck has been cancelled and section 25(1)(a) GSTA will apply. As B has already furnished a return for $1,250 (being the GST portion of the $10,000), a tax adjustment is necessary. B must issue a credit note to correct the tax invoice originally issued. Pursuant to section 25(2)(b) (and under section 20(3) of the GSTA), B can make a corresponding deduction of input tax to the value of $1,250. Payment connected to a unilateral action – eg termination of a contract where there is no “right” to terminate Where one party terminates an ongoing supply contract without a right to terminate or the agreement of the other party, any settlement sum in respect of this action will be outside the scope of GST. This is because the party receiving payment is being compensated for the wrongful or unilateral act of the other party, and has made no supply in return. An example of such a payment was in NZ Refining, where the Crown removed various concessions enjoyed by NZ Refining unilaterally, without needing the agreement of NZ Refining. As no supply was made in return the payment from the Crown to NZ Refining was compensatory and no GST liability attached. GST liability for supplies made for consideration up to the point of termination will not be affected, owing to the timing of supply for GST purposes being set at the time payment is received or an invoice provided (section 9). Example A has a 5 year, five million dollar contract with B, to make regular supplies of a fixed number of items. The contract runs smoothly for 3 years, when all of a sudden B informs A it is no longer willing to accept the contracted supply. As the contract is extremely valuable to the ongoing viability of A’s business, A informs B it will pursue its contractual rights to the fullest extent of the law. B still refuses to perform its side of the contract in accepting the items, and A files a claim in court for two million dollars. 27 B decides that it would be sensible to offer a compromise sum as an out of court settlement, offering A $1,500,000 to avoid the court case. A accepts. • The payment is not made for any supplies and is therefore not consideration. The payment is made to compensate A for the wrongful act of B in refusing to be bound by the contract. Termination or modification of contract by agreement Where there is no provision in the contract to alter or terminate, and the parties reach agreement to do so, this will be a supply for consideration if payment is made. The passage of rights and obligations in this situation will constitute a supply of services for GST purposes. The requirements from NZ Refining and Chatham Islands that there are reciprocal obligations and a nexus between the payment and supply are met in this case; as the payment is given in return for the agreement to alter or release from the contract. Example A has a 5 year, five million dollar contract with B to make regular supplies of items. After 3 years, B no longer wishes to receive these supplies, and contacts A in order to negotiate an early termination to the contract. A informs B that it will terminate the contract in return for a one-off payment of $1,000,000. B agrees, and makes payment. • The payment is consideration for A’s supply of a service to B – being the early release from a fixed term contract – and is subject to GST. Where there has been no supply For a supply to take place, something of value must be “furnish\[ed\] or provide\[d\]” (Databank). The supply must additionally involve enforceable reciprocal obligations (Chatham Islands). If something has been used, but there was no agreement for its supply between the relevant parties, any payment subsequently received by the aggrieved party is not consideration for the supply. The receipt of payment does not involve any reciprocal obligations between the parties, and cannot be retrospectively linked to there having been a “supply” for GST purposes. Any payment received relating to a previous use of an item where there has been no agreement to supply will be by nature compensatory, and thus outside the scope of GST. (eg, of theft and wrongful use of trade name) Agreement to allow an act in the future Where agreement is reached that payment will be given in return for one party’s forbearance in relation to the future conduct of another party, the payment will be consideration for the supply of a right or obligation provided the agreement is binding and enforceable, rather than a mere understanding or assumption. (NZ Refining, Chatham Islands) 28 Example A is a manufacturer and has a patent for a lucrative product. For three years business is booming, with global exports increasing every year. However, in the subsequent two years business suddenly drops, and export volumes are only 20% of the earlier totals. A finds out from a local contact that for the past two years another company B has been using the technology patented by A to create and sell an almost identical product. A is provided with ample evidence of the unauthorised use of the patent, and approaches B, informing B that a court case is imminent. B accepts that it has made wrongful use of the patent, and offers $100,000 as compensation to A. A accepts the compensation offered and makes an offer to B to sell it the patent rights in return for an additional $50,000. B accepts and makes payment. • The $100,000 is not consideration for any supply – rather it is to compensate A for B’s wrongful use of the patent. The $50,000 however, is consideration for the supply of the patent rights by A to B and A must return output tax, with B entitled to claim a corresponding input tax deduction. Forbearance to sue as part of an out of court settlement A settlement including payment for loss caused by an earlier supply might include a clause where the recipient of the payment accepts “full and final payment”, and forbears to sue in future. Forbearances are explicitly mentioned as satisfying the definition of “consideration” in section 2 GSTA. The principles identified above that relate to supply and consideration illustrate that a nexus in the form of reciprocal obligations is required in order for a payment to be consideration for GST purposes. The Databank case stated that to supply is to “furnish or provide”, and the definition of services in section 2 GSTA is “anything that is not goods or money”. Forbearance to sue would thus appear to be capable of being a supply of a service within the GST definition, regardless of whether it is seen as the giving up of a “right” or the provision of something of value to the other party (being a service). If supply of forbearance to sue is the supply of a service, it will only be taxable if it is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, and is given in return for consideration. Where a forbearance to sue is undertaken there will usually be an underlying dispute in settlement of which the payment is made, and any GST inquiry will commence with a determination of what the payment is for. The usual result will be that the payment is for something other than the forbearance, and the forbearance is merely a mechanism to ensure finality in the dispute. Whilst the forbearance is capable of being a supply for GST purposes, in such cases it might fairly be said it is given for no consideration. Accordingly, in the majority of cases there will not be a separate and ascribable value attached to a forbearance to sue, and it will not be given in return for any consideration as the payment will not be linked to the forbearance, but some other issue such as a loss or damage. If however, one party to the dispute is making 29 an identifiable payment that is reciprocal and directly linked to the obligation of forbearing to sue, the payment will be consideration for the supply of forbearance and will be taxable (provided the supply is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (section 8 GSTA)). Example A and B are both GST registered. A causes B to lose thousands of dollars as a direct result of B relying upon A’s negligent business advice. B believes he has a solid case to take to court, but is persuaded by A to settle out of court as A wishes to avoid adverse publicity. Scenario #1 The parties settle the claim for loss for $10,000, and the settlement agreement includes a clause whereby B accepts the sum in “full and final settlement” of his claim against A. • The GST consequences of the payment for loss are nil. The agreement not to sue is merely a mechanism in order for A to ensure finality in the dispute, and does not have a separately attributable sum ascribed to it. Scenario #2 The parties settle the claim for loss for $10,000, with an additional payment of $5,000 by A to B in order for B undertaking to refrain from pursuing his claim by bringing the matter before the courts, as A believes his reputation would be seriously damaged by the resulting publicity. • The GST consequences of the payment for loss are nil. The payment of $10,000 is not payment for any supply. • GST consequences do arise as a result of the $5,000 payment as the payment is clearly made by A in return for the enforceable obligation undertaken by B in his agreement not to sue A. The payment is consideration for a taxable supply by B as B is accepting payment in the course of his taxable business activity. B must accordingly return output tax of $650, and A will be able to claim an input tax deduction pursuant to section 20(3). Overseas treatment - Australia The ATO have recently issued a ruling on the GST treatment of court orders and out of court settlements. The ruling does not distinguish between court awards and out of court settlements for the purpose of liability to GST. Payments made pursuant to either a court order or out of court settlement are characterised in the ruling as relating to either “Earlier supplies”, “Current supplies” or “Discontinuance supplies”. These categories recognise that an award or settlement might relate to an earlier supply, be for a supply made as a result of the award or settlement, or be a payment made in return for refraining from doing something. As is the case in New Zealand, where a 30 payment is compensatory (eg. for a loss suffered) it will not be for any supply and will not attract GST in Australia. The Australian ruling however, differs from this Interpretation Statement in regard to the degree of linkage required for a payment to be consideration for a supply. The recent introduction of GST in Australia means there is little judicial guidance in regards to the degree of connection required for a payment to be consideration for a supply. Whilst the Australian statutory scheme is similar to the NZ Act there is a degree of difference between the two interpretations of the relevant statutory definition of “consideration”. The Australian Act uses the phrase “in connection with” (in regard to the link between a payment and a supply), which differs from the New Zealand wording “in respect of”. The words “in connection with” have been interpreted in the Australian ruling as having the same meaning as in Berry v FCT (1953) 89 CLR 653. This case considered the meaning of “in connection with” in the context of a provision in the Income Tax Act 1936, which considered consideration “for or in connection with goodwill in a lease premium”. Kitto J held that consideration will be “in connection with” property where “the receipt of the payment has a substantial relation, in a practical business sense, to that property” (at p. 659). Recent judicial direction in New Zealand diverges somewhat from the Australian interpretive position in this regard, due to an emphasis upon the concept of reciprocal obligations between parties being evidence of a sufficient connection between a payment and a supply. In particular, the NZ Refining and Chatham Islands cases suggest that this approach should be followed in New Zealand. Conclusions A court award in relation to a claim that relates to an earlier supply or alleged supply will give rise to GST consequences where it is payment for that supply and therefore “consideration”. It has also been concluded that in most cases forbearance to sue will not be given for any consideration. However it has been concluded that forbearance to sue is capable of being a supply if it is given pursuant to a binding obligation, and that a payment will be capable of being consideration for this supply if it has the requisite linkage and a clear value ascribed to it. Examples where a payment will be consideration include an award at common law in quantum meruit, and orders made pursuant to statutory authority for a variation, adjustment or refund of consideration. Awards of the court that have a nexus to something other than a taxable supply, such as loss caused by a taxable supply or negligence, will not attract GST liability as they will not be consideration for any supplies. In an out of court settlement the legal nature of the settlement and what the parties have agreed will provide the basis on which to identify any reciprocal obligations and determine liability to GST. Where a decision is made by the court the relevant reciprocal obligations will be those that arise as a result of the judgment of the court. The remedy itself will be determinative of the nature of the transaction rather than the 31 32 cause of action upon which it is awarded, as a court may have a number of potential remedies at their disposal for one cause of action. Finally, where a number of disputes between the parties give rise to the set off of monies owing between the parties, there is no change to consideration. Set off can only occur after any liability between the parties has been quantified, meaning the value of any consideration and the GST portion will not change, rather the actual amount of money that is received will differ.
\[Interpretation statement IS3394 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in January 1998\] PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY USED OTHERWISE THAN FOR DERIVING INCOME OR CARRYING ON A BUSINESS IN NEW ZEALAND— APPLICATION FOR A SPECIAL DEPRECIATION RATE AND MEANING OF “ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE” Summary Section EG 10 allows the Commissioner to issue special depreciation rates. When determining whether or not to allow a special depreciation rate and the rate (if any) at which such a rate is to be set, section EG 10(2) requires the Commissioner to have regard to the formula set out in section EG 4(3) and the rate of depreciation (if any) adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the property for financial reporting purposes. The formula contained in section EG 4(3) refers to the “estimated useful life” (EUL) of the depreciable property. When an asset has been used in New Zealand for deriving income or carrying on business ever since it was new, it does not matter that it may have been owned by more than one taxpayer. The EUL of depreciable property is the total period that the property could be useful for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. This Interpretation Statement deals with the question of how the definition of “estimated useful life” is applied in setting a special depreciation rate where a taxpayer has depreciable property which was previously used for a purpose other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Examples of situations where this will occur are: • The property was previously used outside New Zealand otherwise than for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand (e.g. secondhand imported assets). • The property was previously used for private purposes in New Zealand and so has not been used in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. For the purposes of determining the EUL of property, the words “in New Zealand” in the definition of “estimated useful life” mean the property’s EUL in New Zealand conditions (i.e. physical conditions and legal and regulatory conditions). The test applied is the total period for which the asset could be used in New Zealand and not the period for which it is actually used in this country for business or income earning purposes. The EUL of such an asset is not reduced by the period in which it is not used for deriving gross income or carrying on business in New Zealand. Background The purpose of section EG 10 is to enable a taxpayer to apply for a rate of depreciation in respect of a particular asset owned by the taxpayer which is different to the general rate which has been established by the Commissioner under section 1 EG 4 for assets of that type, or to apply for a provisional rate if no general rate applies. A taxpayer may choose to apply for a different rate of depreciation to the general rate if special circumstances apply to the particular asset which mean that the asset depreciates at a different rate to the rate at which assets of that type normally depreciate. In these circumstances the general rate may be inappropriate, and so a special rate can be applied. Legislation Section EG 1(1) states: Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year. Section EG 2 sets out the alternative formulae for calculating the depreciation deduction under section EG 1. One of the components of these formulae is the applicable annual depreciation rate. The applicable annual depreciation rate is determined under sections EG 5 - EG 9, depending on the type of depreciable property in question. In determining the applicable annual depreciation rate under sections EG 5 - EG 9, the property’s basic economic depreciation rate is relevant. Under section EG 4(1), the Commissioner must specify the basic economic depreciation rate for any depreciable property, other than fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property, by determination made under section EG 4. Under section EG 4(3), in setting a diminishing value economic rate under section EG 4, the Commissioner shall have regard to the following formula: 1 1 - (( residual value ) estimated useful life ) cost Section EG 4(3) defines “residual value” as the greater of: (a) Estimated residual market value; and (b) 13.5% of cost. Section OB 1 defines “estimated residual market value” as meaning, in respect of any depreciable property: ... its market value at the end of its estimated useful life, estimated reasonably as at the date of acquisition and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance of that property over its estimated useful life: Section OB 1 defines “estimated useful life” as meaning, in respect of any depreciable property: ... the period over which such property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand, having regard to such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance: Section EG 10(1) provides for the setting of special depreciation rates. It states: 2 The Commissioner may, upon application in writing from a taxpayer in respect of any depreciable property other than fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property, allow that taxpayer to apply in respect of that property, for such income year or years as the Commissioner may specify - (a) A special base economic depreciation rate higher or lower than that specified in a determination under section EG 4; or (b) A provisional basic economic depreciation rate, where no applicable economic rate is specified in a determination under section EG 4. Section EG 10(2) states: When determining whether or not to allow a special economic rate or a provisional economic rate under subsection (1), and the rate (if any) at which such a rate is to be set, the Commissioner shall have regard to - (a) The formula set out in section EG 4(3); and (b) The rate of depreciation (if any) adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the depreciable property for financial reporting purposes. Application of the Legislation Section EG 10(2) requires the Commissioner to have regard to both the formula set out in section EG 4(3) and the rate of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the depreciable property for financial reporting purposes, when determining whether or not to allow a special depreciation rate and what that rate (if any) should be. In the Commissioner’s view the primary focus of this provision is to reconsider the formula and set a depreciation rate having regard to the use of the particular asset. The rate used for financial reporting purposes is included in the legislation so that the Commissioner may compare the impact of relevant factors upon the asset’s EUL proposed in the application with the effect assigned to these factors for financial reporting purposes. The formula in section EG 4(3) is the diminishing value formula that is also used for calculating the general depreciation rates. The variables in this formula are: cost, residual value, and EUL. A key variable is the “estimated useful life”, as defined in section OB 1. Essentially, the definition refers to “the period that property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand”. In the context of setting a general depreciation rate under section EG 4, “that property” in the definition of “estimated useful life” is the class of property for which the general rate is being set. In setting a special depreciation rate the focus is on a particular item of property, and “that property” (when the definition of “estimated useful life” is considered in that context) is the particular asset or group of assets for which the special rate is being set. The question to be answered is how long the property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on business in New Zealand. This test focuses on the use of the asset, not the use of the asset by a particular taxpayer. If an asset has been used in New Zealand since new in deriving income or carrying on a 3 business it does not matter that it has been owned by more than one taxpayer. The EUL test is a test of how long the asset could have been expected to be useful in New Zealand. However, the question arises as to the situation where an asset that has not previously been used for deriving gross income or carrying on business in New Zealand is subsequently used by a taxpayer for those purposes. This Interpretation Statement deals with how the definition of “estimated useful life” is applied in setting a special depreciation rate for property in that context. There are two possible approaches as to how the definition of “estimated useful life” applies when a taxpayer applies for a special depreciation rate in respect of property which was previously not used for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. A. The Total Life approach The first is that the definition of "estimated useful life" focuses on the potential usefulness of the asset to any business in New Zealand and only takes into account the effect of factors that cause the asset to depreciate as set out in the definition of that term (i.e. wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence). When determining the EUL of a particular asset using this approach it is irrelevant that the asset has previously been used for purposes other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. This means that the EUL of a particular asset is not reduced by the time the asset was not used in producing gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The EUL of the asset applied in setting a special depreciation rate for the asset is the total life of that asset, not the remaining life to that taxpayer. B. The Remaining Life approach The second approach determines the EUL by assessing the period a particular asset will actually be used to produce income or carry on a business in New Zealand. When determining the EUL, this approach takes into account the factors that may cause the asset to depreciate as set out in the definition of that term, and also takes into account the period that the asset is used for purposes other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income in New Zealand. This means that the EUL of the particular asset is reduced by the time that the asset is not used in producing gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The wording of the definition of “estimated useful life” is capable of supporting both the first and second approaches. The first approach interprets the words “the period over which such property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand” broadly, as meaning the period over which there is a possibility that the asset theoretically could be useful for producing income or for a business in New Zealand. Under this interpretation the EUL of an asset will generally begin at the start of the asset’s actual life, and it does not matter whether the asset actually is used for deriving income or carrying on a 4 business in New Zealand for all of the asset’s actual life. This is because the asset could potentially be useful for these purposes in New Zealand for all of its actual life. The second approach interprets the words “might reasonably be expected to be useful” narrowly, as meaning the period an asset is used or is physically available for use for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Under this interpretation the EUL is taken from the time that the asset is first used for these purposes in New Zealand, and does not include any time that it is used for other purposes (e.g. private use in New Zealand, or for producing income or carrying on a business overseas). While it is acknowledged that the legislative wording could be more certain, the Commissioner’s view is that the first approach – the Total Life approach - is correct. When a taxpayer applies for a special depreciation rate, the EUL for the particular asset will only be reduced by “such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based on the assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance”. The fact that the asset was previously used for a purpose other than deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand will not reduce its EUL. Reasons for adopting this interpretation There are a number of reasons for adopting this interpretation of “estimated useful life”. • As previously noted, in relation to secondhand assets generally, the definition of “estimated useful life” is specific to assets or classes of assets, rather than being taxpayer specific. It focuses on the EUL of an asset, or asset class, and does not relate to a particular taxpayer. It is the total potential life of the particular asset to the New Zealand economy that is important, and not the life to a particular taxpayer. The Total Life approach is consistent with the EUL being specific to the life of an asset or class of assets. The Remaining Life approach is not, and focuses on the life of an asset to a particular taxpayer. • The definition of “estimated useful life” does not require the EUL to be measured at the time the asset is acquired by the owner. This can be compared to the definition of “estimated residual market value”, which requires the estimated residual market value of property to be measured as at the date of acquisition. The absence of such wording in the definition of “estimated useful life” confirms that that definition refers to the total life of the particular asset, and not to the asset’s remaining useful life. • The Remaining Life approach adopts what is, in effect, a “remaining estimated useful life” test. However, the definition of “estimated useful life” makes no reference to “remaining” life. This can be compared to the definition of “fixed life intangible property” in the depreciation regime which contains the phrase “the property’s remaining estimated useful life”. This strongly suggest that the definition of “estimated useful life” refers to property’s total estimated useful life. 5 If this were not the case, the word “remaining” would not have been necessary before the reference to EUL in the definition of “fixed life intangible property”. • The purpose behind allowing taxpayers to apply for and be issued with special depreciation rates was to enable taxpayers to apply more accurate rates in respect of certain property. The special rates were to be allowed where specific or unusual conditions affected the property in question. There is no indication in the legislation that the term “estimated useful life” should have one meaning for setting general rates (i.e. total life) and another for setting special rates (i.e. remaining life). If Parliament intended this, it would have expressly provided for it. • Under the Remaining Life approach to the application of the term “estimated useful life”, the term only applies to the period that an asset will actually be used in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. If the overseas or private use part of a particular asset’s life can be disregarded in determining the asset’s EUL, there will be different estimated useful lives within a class of assets for those assets which have been overseas or in private use and those which have not. Further, assets which have been overseas or in private use for different lengths of time will also have different estimated lives. This can be demonstrated by the following example. An asset with a total expected useful life of 20 years is held overseas for 10 years by a non-New Zealand resident taxpayer, and is then sold to a New Zealand resident taxpayer. Under the second approach, the EUL of the asset is reduced by the time that the asset spends in non-New Zealand income producing or business use. The New Zealand taxpayer could apply to the Commissioner for a special depreciation rate based on the asset’s remaining useful life of 10 years. Varying the example, if the asset is instead held by the overseas taxpayer for 15 years, the Commissioner could grant the New Zealand taxpayer a special depreciation rate based on the asset’s remaining 5 years of EUL to the New Zealand taxpayer. This would result in assets of the same class ending up with widely varying depreciation rates, depending on the remaining number of useful years to the owner (in the example, the EUL of the asset would be either 20 years, 10 years, or 5 years, depending on when it was purchased by a New Zealand taxpayer). The Commissioner does not consider that the depreciation regime was intended to operate in this way. • The basic economic depreciation rate for any class of depreciable assets is based on a formula in which one of the components is the EUL of assets in that class. If assets which belong to a particular class have different estimated useful lives depending on whether and how long they have spent overseas or in private use, it will be impossible to set a general basic economic depreciation rate for that class of assets. This is plainly not what was intended. Instead, assets of a particular type should generally all have the same EUL (regardless of time spent outside New Zealand or in private use) and have the same applicable economic depreciation rate, unless special circumstances apply to a particular asset. • Another implication of the Remaining Life approach is that it would result in more favourable depreciation rates applying to imported secondhand assets than 6 would apply to New Zealand secondhand assets (other than those which had been in private use). This would occur because an imported asset’s total useful life would be reduced by the time that it was not used in deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand, while a New Zealand asset’s EUL would be the total useful life of that asset. This would appear to provide an unintended incentive for taxpayers to import secondhand assets, rather than purchase the equivalent secondhand New Zealand asset. Such an incentive is contrary to the proposition that the tax system should have a neutral effect on business investment decisions unless the legislation is clearly intended to be concessionary or provide an incentive. • The Total Life approach is also consistent with the final recommendation of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (“the Valabh Committee”). The final recommendations of the Valabh Committee on depreciation were contained in their letter to Government of 14 November 1991. This letter refers to the definition of “estimated useful life” and states: The definition reflects our view that the useful life on an asset for depreciation purposes is not the life for which an asset could technically be used, but the life for which it is or will be useful in the income earning process. It is necessary to identify relevant objective criteria for determining useful life such as physical deterioration, technical obsolescence, obsolescence due to market factors and the average length of time for which an asset is held for income-earning or business purposes. However it is necessary to note that it is the useful life of the asset which is the important criteria for determining depreciation rates, not necessarily the length of time for which it will be used by any particular taxpayer. This means that where an asset will be disposed of to another taxpayer for use by that taxpayer, the useful life of the asset needs to be calculated having regard to the entire period for which the asset will be used, not just the period for which the asset is first used by the taxpayer. The Valabh Committee stated that the “estimated useful life” of an asset for depreciation purposes is the life for which it is or will be useful. The definition of “estimated useful life” reflects this by saying “might be .... expected to be useful”. The Valabh Committee did not contemplate that the definition would only apply to the period during which the asset was actually being used in New Zealand. Conclusion The EUL of property is the total period that the property theoretically could be used for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Generally, this period begins when the asset is new (there may be exceptional cases where the estimated useful life of an asset does not begin when the asset is new, e.g. where it would not make commercial sense for any New Zealand business to purchase a particular type of asset new, but the purchase of the same asset secondhand at a later stage when the cost is lower is a sensible investment decision). What is relevant in determining the end of the EUL is whether any New Zealand business would choose to retain the asset for use in deriving gross income or carrying on that business. Examples Example 1 7 Company A imports a secondhand machine into New Zealand. The machine is 15 years’ old, and is expected to be useful in New Zealand for a further 4 years. It will then cease to comply with New Zealand safety standards, and so will be scrapped or sold offshore. No unusual factors will cause it to deteriorate faster than normal. Taking the Total Life approach, the EUL of the machine is 19 years - being the total number of years that the machine could potentially be expected to be useful for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The machine could potentially have been used for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand during its entire life, even though it was actually outside New Zealand for its first 15 years. Taking the Remaining Life approach, the EUL of the machine is 4 years - being the number of years the machine will actually be used for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The first approach is correct. The machine has an EUL of 19 years. Example 2 Company B purchases a secondhand asset in New Zealand. The asset was previously used privately for 5 years, and will be used by Company B for another 3 years before it is scrapped. The asset would normally last for another 5 years, but the way that the company uses it will cause it to deteriorate within 3 years of acquisition. The EUL of the asset is 8 years. This includes the 5 years that the asset was used privately as it might reasonably have been expected to be useful in a business in New Zealand during this period. The 8-year EUL also takes into account the abnormal use by Company B of the asset which causes it to lose value faster than normal (normally that type of asset would have an EUL of 10 years). Example 3 Taxpayer A acquires a new depreciable asset for $500,000. The asset has a 20-year EUL, and is expected to have a nil estimated residual market value. The asset’s basic economic depreciation rate, using the diminishing value method, is 9.5%, calculated as follows: 1 1 1 - (13.5% of cost ) estimated useful life ) = 1 - ( ( 67,500 ) 20 ) = 9.5% cost 500,000 If Taxpayer A retains the asset for 10 years, the asset’s adjusted tax value at that time will be $203,163. The depreciation deduction available in that year will be $19,300. The depreciation deductions for the 11th, 12th, and 13th years of ownership are as follows: Adjusted tax value Depreciation deduction Year 11 $ 183,863 $ 17,467 Year 12 $ 166,396 $ 15,808 8 Year 13 $ 150,588 $ 14,305 Taxpayer B acquires an asset which belongs to the same class as the asset owned by Taxpayer A. The asset is 10 years old and has not been used for the purposes of deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand during that time. Taxpayer B purchases the asset for $200,000. There is no difference between the asset purchased by Taxpayer B and other assets of the same class in terms of the industry or the physical environment in which the asset has operated or will operate, or in terms of the way or amount the asset has been or will be used. The formula for calculating the depreciation deduction in respect of Taxpayer B’s asset is set out in section EG 2 of the Act and is: a × b × c 12 where - a is the annual depreciation rate applicable to the property and the depreciation method; b is the adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year before the depreciation deduction is taken; and c is the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year that the property is owned by the taxpayer. The formula will give rise to different results depending on which of the two approaches discussed in this statement is applied. Under the Total Life approach, the annual depreciation rate is the basic economic depreciation rate for that type of asset (in this case 9.5%). Under the Remaining Life approach, Taxpayer B can be issued with a special depreciation rate based on the remaining EUL of the property. A special depreciation rate based on the remaining EUL (10 years) of the property would be: 1 1 1 - ( (13.5% of cost ) remaining estimated useful life ) = 1 - ( ( 27,000 ) 10 ) = 18 % cost 200,000 Using the special depreciation rate of 18% (and assuming the asset is owned for the entire income year), the depreciation deduction for the 10-year old asset in its first year of ownership by Taxpayer B will be: special depreciation rate × adjusted tax value of asset (in this case the cost price) = 18% × 200,000 = $ 36,000. Using this special depreciation rate, the depreciation deductions in the asset’s 11th, 12th, and 13th years (Taxpayer B’s 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of ownership) will be: 9 10 Adjusted tax value Depreciation deduction Year 10 $ 200,000 $ 36,000 Year 11 $ 164,000 $ 29,520 Year 12 $ 134,480 $ 24,206 Year 13 $ 110,274 $ 19,849 Comparing the depreciation of Taxpayer A and Taxpayer B’s identical assets, it can be seen that if the depreciation rate is based on the remaining EUL of the asset (i.e. where approach 2 is used), the asset depreciates at a much faster rate than it normally would. If, instead, the EUL of the secondhand asset is the total EUL of that asset, so the depreciation rate of the asset is not adjusted, the depreciation deduction for the 10- year old asset in its first year of ownership by Taxpayer B will be: annual depreciation rate × adjusted tax value of asset (in this case the cost price) = 9.5% × 200,000 = $ 19,000. Using the standard 9.5% depreciation rate, the depreciation deductions in the asset’s 11th, 12th, and 13th years (Taxpayer B’s 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of ownership) will be: Adjusted tax value Depreciation deduction Year 10 $ 200,000 $ 19,000 Year 11 $ 181,000 $ 17,195 Year 12 $ 163,805 $ 15,561 Year 13 $ 148,244 $ 14,083 It is clear that the depreciation deductions which result from using the basic economic depreciation rate are very similar to those which would apply had Taxpayer B owned the asset for its entire life. Given that there are no special circumstances affecting the asset to make it depreciate at a faster rate than other assets of the same class, there does not appear to be any reason for Taxpayer B to apply a higher depreciation rate, calculated using the remaining EUL of the asset, than the basic economic depreciation rate pertaining to the asset.

This item addresses: • The circumstances in which expenditure on travel between home and work will be deductible; • The interpretation of the expressions “business purposes” and “business use” in sections DH 1 to DH 4; and • The circumstances in which travel between home and work will be treated as work-related use rather than “private use or enjoyment” for FBT purposes. Summary Deductibility of expenditure on home to work travel The general rule is that travel between home and work is private travel and expenditure on such travel is not an allowable deduction as such expenditure is expenditure of a private or domestic nature. A deduction is allowable under section BD 2(1) for expenditure incurred in deriving income or necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business for that purpose, but expenditure that is of a private or domestic nature is not an allowable deduction: section BD 2(2)(a). For travel between home and work to be deductible it is necessary to establish that: • The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) arises from the nature of the work; and • The travel is in the course of performing work (“on work”). In cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work (some of which relate to taxpayers who are employees), the following broad factual situations have been identified as circumstances where travel between home and work is regarded as business or work-related travel: • Where a vehicle is essential for transport of goods or equipment necessary for the performance of employment duties at the home and elsewhere; • Where the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations); • Where the taxpayer is required to be accessible at the home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; and 2 • Where the travel is “on work” between two work places, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. FBT – Private use or enjoyment An employer who has provided or granted a fringe benefit to an employee is liable to pay Fringe Benefit Tax (“FBT”): section ND 1. A benefit consisting of the private use or enjoyment (or the availability for private use) of a motor vehicle owned, leased, or rented by the person who makes it available to an employee is a fringe benefit: section CI 1. FBT is calculated according to the number of days on which a benefit consisting of the “private use or enjoyment” of a motor vehicle is provided: section CI 3(1). “Private use or enjoyment” means travel that confers a benefit of a private or domestic nature. The definition of “private use or enjoyment” specifically includes travel to or from the person’s home and any other travel that confers on the person a benefit of a private or domestic nature. The fundamental issue is whether a private benefit has been conferred. The concept of private use or enjoyment imports a concept of a distinction between private use and work-related use. The provision of a vehicle for work-related use only does not constitute a benefit of a private nature. See CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738. For FBT purposes (as for deductibility purposes) travel between home and work will be private use unless: • The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) arises from the nature of the work; and • The travel is “on work”. The fact that work is performed at the home (whether or not under a contractual obligation) is not sufficient. Travel between home and work would be private travel if the work is performed at the home because of the personal circumstances or personal preferences of the taxpayer. The fact that a vehicle is taken to an employee’s home for security reasons does not in itself mean that travel between the home and work is work-related travel. Note : Even if travel between home and work is work-related travel (so that the use of a motor vehicle for that purpose is not private use) and there is no actual private use of the motor vehicle, the employer must establish that the vehicle is not available for private use. (The requirements necessary to establish that a vehicle is not available for private use are discussed in more detail below.) Purpose of travel The record-keeping requirements necessary to establish the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle are set out in sections DH 1 to DH 4. A deduction is permitted for the proportion of the expenditure which reflects the proportion of the business use of 3 the vehicle to the total use of the vehicle: section DH 1(3). To be “business use” or use for “business purposes”, the travel must be undertaken solely for a business reason. A journey is classified either as business use or not business use rather than the journey being apportioned on a mileage basis. Travel between home and work in the circumstances outlined above will be travel undertaken for a business reason. For both deductibility and FBT purposes, where a journey undertaken for business purposes or work-related purposes includes a private component, the private travel would be disregarded and the entire journey would be classified as business travel in the following circumstances: • The private benefit received is incidental to a journey that has been undertaken solely for business purposes or work-related purposes (being a private benefit that necessarily results from a journey undertaken for such purpose); or • The private travel is de minimis (being a deviation for a private reason in the course of a journey undertaken for business purposes or in the course of performing employment duties that is a minor or insignificant part of the journey). The circumstances in which an incidental private benefit or de minimis private travel will be disregarded (so that the entire journey is treated as business use) are discussed in more detail below. Common principles relating to deductibility of motor vehicle expenditure and FBT The test for determining whether travel expenditure is deductible and the definition of “private use or enjoyment” for FBT purposes are expressed in different terms. However, the tests raise essentially the same issues and require consideration of the same factors. For both deductibility and FBT purposes: • The fact that work is performed at the home is not sufficient. The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) must arise from the nature of the work. Travel between home and work would be private travel if the work is performed at the home because of the personal circumstances or personal preferences of the taxpayer. For travel to be work- related travel, it is not sufficient that the employer and employee have contracted on the basis that employment duties would be performed partly at the home; and • There is a distinction between travel undertaken to enable a person to commence work and travel on work. The exceptions to the general rule (that travel between home and work is private travel for deductibility purposes) relate to situations where the travel is on work rather than travel in order to commence work or travel from work. Travel by an employee in such situations would be travel for work-related purposes and would not constitute private use or enjoyment. 4 Legislation Deductibility of travel expenditure Section BD 2 provides: (1) An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a) if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). (2) An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is (a) of a private or domestic nature, or (b) incurred in deriving exempt income under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined) or F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), or (c) incurred in deriving income from employment, or (d) incurred in deriving schedular gross income subject to final withholding, or (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (f) disallowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment of Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). Section DH 1 provides: (1) Except as provided in this section, no deduction is allowed in relation to expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in respect of or in relation to a motor vehicle used in deriving gross income of a taxpayer. (2) Nothing in this section or in sections DH 2 to DH 4 shall apply to disallow any deduction or allowance by way of depreciation— (a) In relation to a motor vehicle that is not used for any purpose other than— (i) The deriving of gross income; or 5 (ii) A purpose that constitutes a fringe benefit; or (b) To a taxpayer who is— (i) A company; or (ii) A person whose sole income is income from employment. (3) Where in any income year a motor vehicle is used by a taxpayer partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes, there shall be allowed as a deduction in that income year the proportion of all expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in relation to the motor vehicle that reflects the proportion of business use of the vehicle to its total use in that income year, as that business use proportion is determined in accordance with sections DH 2 to DH 4. The phrases “business purposes” and “business use” are defined in section OB 1 as follows: “Business purposes”, or “business use”, in sections DH I to DH 4, in relation to the use of a motor vehicle and to a taxpayer, means travel undertaken by the vehicle wholly and exclusively in deriving gross income of the taxpayer. FBT – private use or enjoyment Section ND 1(1) provides: Subject to section CI 5, an employer who has provided or granted a fringe benefit to an employee is liable to pay a special tax by way of an income tax to be known as fringe benefit tax. The definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1 includes: ...any benefit that consists of— (a) The private use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee, at any time during the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, of a motor vehicle owned, leased, or rented by the person who makes the motor vehicle available to the employee: (b) The availability for the private use or enjoyment of the employee, at any time during the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, of a motor vehicle that is so owned, leased, or rented: being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, a service referred to in paragraph (ga), or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; The definitions of “benefit” and “private use or enjoyment” in section OB 1 read as follows: “Benefit”, in the definitions of “private use or enjoyment”, “specified insurance premium”, and “work related vehicle”, and in the FBT rules, includes the availability, for the private use or enjoyment of any person, of a motor vehicle that is owned, leased, or rented by another person: “Private use or enjoyment”, in the definitions of “benefit” and “work related vehicle” and in the FBT rules, in relation to a motor vehicle and to any person, includes travel by the person in the motor vehicle in the course of proceeding to or from the person’s home; and also includes any other travel by 6 the person in the motor vehicle where that travel confers on the person a benefit of a private or domestic nature: Provided that— (a) Where the motor vehicle is required to be used by the employee for the purpose of making an emergency call in the course of the employee’s employment, the day on which the employee departs from home to make that emergency call shall not be counted as a day on which the motor vehicle is available for the private use or enjoyment of the employee: (b) Where an employee is required by the employer of the employee to use a motor vehicle in the course of the employment of the employee and the nature of the employment of the employee regularly requires the employee to be absent from home in the course of the employee's employment, the whole of each day in which that motor vehicle is used by the employee, while so absent from home, in the course of the performing of the activities of which that employment consists, where the period of absence is not less than 24 hours continuously, shall not, for the purposes of section CI 3, be counted as a day in which the motor vehicle was available for the private use or enjoyment of the employee,— and, for the purposes of this proviso, the expression “day” means the continuous period of 24 hours ending at midnight: Analysis Income Tax General rule A deduction is allowable under section BD 2(1) for expenditure incurred in deriving income or necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business for that purpose, but expenditure that is of a private or domestic nature is not an allowable deduction: section BD 2(2)(a). Expenditure on travel between home and work is generally considered to be expenditure on private travel: see Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1925\] AC 1. The historical background to the general rule is explained by Lord Denning in Newsom v Robertson \[1952\] 2 All ER 728. Lord Denning noted that when income tax was introduced most people lived and worked in the same place. Therefore, it was considered that the need for travel between a taxpayer’s home and work was dictated by the taxpayer’s choice to live at a location different from the taxpayer’s place of work. Lord Denning acknowledged that in the twentieth century generally taxpayers had limited choice as to whether to live “over their work”. In FCT v Collings 76 ATC 4254 Rath J noted that the view that home and work is private travel because such travel relates to a taxpayer’s choice of living in a location different from the taxpayer’s place of work was based on history rather than reason. However, changes in the way people live and work have not resulted in the general rule established in case law being overruled. In Lunney v FCT 11 ATD 404 Dixon CJ commented: Both in Australia and in England the view has always prevailed that expenses of travelling from home to work or business and back again are not deductible. An explanation of how this rule came about in England is given by Denning LJ in Newsom v Robertson. .... The relevant provisions of the English Income Tax Acts are not in the same terms as those of the Australian law, but the whole course of English authority involves a like conclusion. To escape from 7 the course of reasoning on which they proceed requires the taking of refined and rather insubstantial distinctions. I confess for myself, however, that if the matter were to be worked out all over again on bare reason, I should have misgivings about the conclusion. But this is just what I think the Court ought not to do. It is a question of how an undisputed principle applies. Its application was settled by old authority long accepted and always acted upon. If the whole subject is to be ripped up now it is for the legislature and not the Court to do it. (p. 405) Exceptions to the general rule The exceptions to the general rule were summarised by Northrop J in FCT v Genys 87 ATC 4875 as follows: However, the general proposition laid down in Lunney, notwithstanding that it remains good law, is not exhaustive. In Garrett v FCT 82 ATC 4060, the Supreme Court of New South Wales constituted by Lusher J held that it had no application to the following situations: (a) where the taxpayer keeps necessary equipment or instruments at his home which he needs for the purpose of performing his work, and by reason of its bulk, such equipment needs to be transported by vehicle from the home to his place or places of work and where the equipment is used at home; (b) where the taxpayer incurs expenses for travel between two places of business or work; and (c) where the employment can be construed as having commenced at the time of leaving home. A fourth situation, not enunciated in Garrett, is where the taxpayer travels between home and shifting places of work, i.e. an itinerant occupation. (para 28) There is some overlap between the categories referred to in Genys. In Garrett v FCT 82 ATC 4060 Lusher J said: ... where the nature of the employment or income earning activity can be construed as having commenced at the time of leaving the home, the expenditure on travel is a proper deduction. This can be illustrated by the commercial traveller whose engagement provides that his duties commence when he leaves his home with his samples which are kept there as part of his employment. Similarly, where equipment is transported from the home to the place of work by the taxpayer but the taxpayer’s activities by which he earned income under a contract could be regarded as having been embarked upon either before or when he left his home so that the home in that sense became his base of operation from which he carried on his income earning activities the expenses become deductible. Expressed in other terms the contractual activities and requirements, by reason of their nature, in this sense are construed as being moved back anteriorly from the place of substantial performance to the earlier point or to the point of commencement of the journey. (p. 4062) Principles relating to deductibility of travel expenditure The general rule (that travel between home and work is private travel) will apply unless : • The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) arises from the nature of the work; and • The travel is “on work”. Work performed at the home for business reasons 8 For expenditure on travel between home and work to be deductible, the need for the travel must arise from the nature of the income earning activity carried on by the taxpayer and not from the personal circumstances or personal preferences of the taxpayer. Although the minority in the House of Lords in Taylor v Provan \[1975\] AC 194 disagreed on the proper inference to be drawn from the facts in that case, there was no disagreement that this was the correct principle to be applied. Lord Reid (who was in the majority) said: Ricketts decided that if the place where a man resides is his personal choice he cannot claim with regard to expenses made necessary by that personal choice. If the holder of an office or employment has to do part of his work at home the place where he resides is generally still his personal choice. If he could do his home work equally well wherever he lived then I do not see how the mere fact that his home is also a place of work could justify a departure from the Ricketts ratio. I do not find it easy to discover the ratio decidendi of Pook’s case. But that does not diminish the authority of the decision. I am sure that the majority did not intend to decide that in all cases where the employee’s contract requires him to work at home he is entitled to deduct travelling expenses between his home and his other place of work. Plainly that would open the door widely for evasion of the rule. There must be something more. I think that the distinguishing fact in Pook’s case was that there was a part time employment and that it was impossible for the employer to fill the post otherwise than by appointing a man with commitments which he would not give up. It was therefore necessary that whoever was appointed should incur travelling expenses. (p. 208) \[emphasis added\] (Pook’s case (Owen v Pook \[1970\] AC 244) is discussed in detail below.) Lord Simon (who was in the minority) said: Applying the rule in Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1926\] AC 1 i.e. that the obligation to incur the expenses of travelling in question must arise out of the nature of the office or employment itself, and not out of the circumstances of the particular person appointed to the office or employed under the contract of employment - two different classes of travelling expenses readily come to mind. The first is where the office or employment is of itself inherently an itinerant one.... The second class of case is where the taxpayer has two places of work and is required by the nature of his office or employment to travel from one to the other. (p. 221) Lord Wilberforce (who was also in the minority) said: To do any job, it is necessary to get there; but it is settled law that expenses of travelling to work cannot be deducted against the emoluments of the employment. It is only if the job requires a man to travel that his expenses of that travel can be deducted, i.e. if he is travelling on his work, as distinct from travelling to his work. The most obvious category of jobs of this kind is that of itinerant jobs, such as a commercial traveller. It is as a variant upon this that the concept of two places of work has been introduced: if a man has to travel from one place of work to another place of work, he may deduct the travelling expenses of this travel, because he is travelling on his work, but not those of travelling from either place of work to his home or vice versa. But for this doctrine to apply, he must be required by the nature of the job itself to do the work of the job in two places; the mere fact that he may choose to do part of it in a place separate from that where the job is objectively located is not enough. The case of Owen v. Pook \[1970\] A.C. 244 brought out this distinction. The basis of the decision of the majority in that case (the minority holding the opposite) was that the nature of the office, or employment, of part-time anaesthetist and obstetrician required the doctor to work partly at his surgery and partly at the hospital. (p. 215) \[emphasis added\] Taylor v Provan does not relate to travel by vehicle, but the principle stated in that case (that the need for the travel must arise from the nature of the employment duties 9 and not from the taxpayer’s personal circumstances or personal preferences) is applicable generally. In Burton v FCT 79 ATC 4,318, where the taxpayer was a magistrate who was sometimes required to write judgments at his home at night, the court did not accept that expenditure on travel from and to his home was deductible as the work was performed at the home from personal preference: Necessity from the personal circumstances or the personal preferences of the taxpayer is not enough. A facet of the performance of the appellant’s duties upon which counsel for the appellant placed some reliance was the practice of the appellant to write urgent reserved decisions at his home at night and the need to use his car to carry work associated written materials and books from his Beaufort Street chambers to his home to perform this task. There can be no doubt on the evidence that the appellant from time to time did write reserved decisions at his home but it is also clear that his chambers were available for his use at all times for this purpose. It was a matter of his personal preference that he performed this work at his home . (p. 4,323) Travel “on work” A distinction has been drawn in case law between travel undertaken to enable a taxpayer to commence work and travel “on work” (travel in the course of performing work). In Case F72 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,924 Judge Bathgate commented: Each case however must be related to its own facts, and usually involves consideration of when a taxpayer’s work commences. Expenses incurred in the course of gaining or producing assessable income are deductible. The real question in the present context becomes whether the trip from one place to another (home to work) is travel “to one’s work” and “from one’s work” or is “on one’s work.” A dwellinghouse may be a place of work so that a trip from there to a place of work may be on one's work. This is all a question of fact. (p 59,928) In FCT v Payne (2001) ATC 4027 the majority in the High Court noted that the test of deductibility did not permit a deduction for all expenses having some causal connection with the deriving of income and that what must be shown is a closer and more immediate connection. In Lunney v FCT 11 ATD 404 in the joint judgment of Williams J, Kitto J and Taylor J, it was said: It is, of course, beyond question that unless an employee attends at his place of employment he will not derive assessable income and, in one sense, he makes the journey to his place of employment in order that he may earn his income. But to say that expenditure on fares is a prerequisite to the earning of a taxpayer’s income is not to say that such expenditure is incurred in or in the course of gaining or producing his income. (p. 413) Each of the exceptions referred to in Genys relate to situations where travel can be regarded in some sense as travel in the course of performing work rather than travel in order to commence work or travel from work. Expenditure on travel which enables a taxpayer to commence income earning activities is not deductible but expenditure incurred on travel in the course of deriving income (travel “on work”) is deductible: refer FCT v Payne 2001 ATC 4027. Travel costs are not deductible merely because the taxpayer cannot begin to perform work duties unless the travel is undertaken. For the costs of travel to be deductible, the journey between home and work must be undertaken “to complete some aspect of employment already under way when the journey commences” (see FCT v Collings 76 ATC 4254, 4262. 10 Therefore, generally travel from a taxpayer’s home to the taxpayer’s place of work (or to make the first business call of the day) and travel between the last business call of the day and the home would be private use, being travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work or after work has finished. Travel between the place where the first business call is made and the taxpayer’s work base, or to make subsequent business calls, would be business use, being travel in the course of performing work. Under the general rule it is irrelevant whether the travel is between the home and a regular workplace or between the home and a workplace that is not the taxpayer’s regular workplace. In Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] EWHC 30 Patten J commented that: ...the costs of travelling directly from home directly to a temporary workplace would probably have fallen foul of the decision in Ricketts v Colquhoun (Inspector of Taxes) \[1926\] AC 1, that the choice of location of one’s home was a matter of personal choice and not a necessity of the office or employment. That objection is no longer available to the Revenue provided that the employee or office holder needs to attend the temporary workplace, in order to perform his duties and the workplace is truly a temporary one. \[para 15\] These comments indicate that in the absence of specific legislation, the general rule would apply to travel between the home and any temporary workplace (that is, such travel would be private travel although the travel is not to the taxpayer’s regular workplace). (Under the UK Act, a deduction is not allowable for expenses of “ordinary commuting” or private travel: section 198(1) Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Travel to a “temporary workplace” is not ordinary commuting.) Circumstances where travel between home and work is not private travel In cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work (some of which relate to taxpayers who are employees) the following broad factual situations have been identified as circumstances where travel between home and work is “on work” rather than travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work: • Where a vehicle is essential for transport of goods or equipment necessary for the performance of income earning activities at the home and elsewhere; • Where the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations); • Where the taxpayer is required to be accessible at the home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; and • Where the travel is for work purposes between two related work places, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. 1. Vehicle essential for transport of goods or equipment Where a vehicle is used for the transport of goods or equipment necessary for the performance of income earning activities performed both at the home and at the taxpayer’s normal work place or work places, the use of the vehicle would be 11 attributable to the transport of the goods rather than the transport of the taxpayer. For this exception to the general rule to apply: • It is necessary (because of the nature of the income earning activity) to transport the goods or equipment to the taxpayer’s home to enable the taxpayer to carry out the income earning activity at the home and to transport the goods or equipment to the taxpayer’s usual work place or work places; and • A vehicle is required to transport such goods or equipment (because of their bulk or because the value, sensitivity or other special characteristics of the items transported make it impractical to transport such items without the use of a car). “Bulky” in this context means cumbersome. Whether an item or set of equipment is bulky will generally depend on the weight of the equipment and the relative ease of transporting or carrying it. An example is FCT v Vogt 75 ATC 4073, where the taxpayer was a professional musician who performed at a number of venues and who was required to provide his own instruments and equipment. The taxpayer kept his instruments and equipment at his home and practised there. The taxpayer required a vehicle to transport his instruments (trumpet, flugelhorn, acoustic bass, electric bass, and amplifiers) to performance venues because of their bulk. Waddell J held that the expenditure was deductible. He took into account the following matters: Firstly, the expenditure was incurred as part of the operations by which the taxpayer earnt his income. Secondly, it was essential to the carrying on of those operations: there was no other practicable way of getting his instruments to the places where he was to perform. Thirdly, in a practical sense, the expenditure should be attributed to the carriage of the taxpayer’s instruments rather than to his travel to the places of performance. The mode of his travel was simply a consequence of the means which he employed to get his instruments to the place of performance, that is by carrying them in the motor vehicle which he drove. (p. 4078) The term “bulky” was used in the Vogt case. In Crestani v FCT 98 ATC 2219 the AAT discussed the meaning of that word. The AAT said: 7. ....I do not think that the term ''bulky'' should be construed to refer only to an article which is of large size, such as the musical instruments which were the subject of the decision in FC of T v Vogt 75 ATC 4073 . The term is, in my view, more aptly to be construed as similar to ''cumbersome'' in the sense that it is not easily portable In Gaydon v FCT 98 ATC 2328 the AAT said: 22. The question whether an item or set of equipment is bulky will generally depend on the weight of the equipment and the relative ease of transporting or carrying it. In Scott v FCT (No 3) 2002 ATC 2,243 the AAT considered that this exception to the general rule was not limited to items that require special transport arrangements because of their physical characteristics. The AAT considered that the value, sensitivity or other special characteristics of the items transported may also make it necessary to transport such items by car. The AAT said: 15. I think the exception is broader than that. A taxpayer may think it is necessary to make special arrangements to transport essential items to his workplace for reasons other than their size or 12 weight. An item that is essential to a business might have other features or attributes that make special transport arrangements appropriate. The simplest example is valuable items, like jewellery or cash. But it is easy to imagine items that are awkward to transport. Items that have a noxious smell, or which are offensive or which might scandalise or embarrass other people might require special arrangements for their transport. The taxpayer may be uncomfortable transporting the items in the usual way, and could therefore justify making a claim for the cost of transporting those items through alternative means. He or she is free to ''hitch a free ride to work'' on those items: U107 at 652. The Scott case concerned a dentist who was required to transport confidential patient files and wax denture moulds between his home and a secondary surgery which did not have much equipment. Because of the size and shape of the moulds, it was not possible to carry the items in a briefcase or a box that could be sealed. The AAT accepted that transport costs were deductible on the basis that special arrangements were necessary to transport the items because of their sensitivity and value: 16. Dr Scott carried cash (although not in large amounts) and patient files including, on some occasions, x-rays. The files were confidential. The wax moulds were also grotesque. He said a patient would be disturbed if she knew that her dentures were being ogled by the dentist's fellow passengers on a bus. 17. While it is easy to imagine better examples of items that might be regarded as awkward to transport in the sense that I have described, I am satisfied Dr Scott should be able to claim the cost of making the special arrangements for transporting the goods in his own vehicle. He was carrying items that were sensitive and valuable. He (and his fellow travellers were he to use public transport, and his patients) might feel distinctly uncomfortable were the contents of the box to spill or be observed by others. Since the evidence suggests the contents of the box might be visible to others because it often could not be sealed, special arrangements for its transport were justified. It follows that the cost of those arrangements should be an allowable deduction. 2. Itinerant occupations An occupation would be regarded as an itinerant one if the following conditions are satisfied: • The taxpayer’s home is the taxpayer’s base of operations. (In Taylor v Provan \[1975\] AC 194 Lord Wilberforce regarded a situation where a taxpayer had two fixed work places, one of which was the home, as a variation of a situation where a taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation”); and • The nature of the taxpayer’s income earning activity is such that travel is essential to the carrying out of the activity; and • The taxpayer is required to undertake work at a number of work places during the course of a day or the sequence of work places and the periods of time spent by the taxpayer at each work place vary and are unpredictable so that it is impractical for the taxpayer to carry out the income earning activity without the use of a car; and • The taxpayer can be regarded as travelling in the performance of the taxpayer’s work from the time of leaving home. 13 These criteria are drawn from the following cases on deductibility of travel expenditure: Horton v Young \[1971\] 3 All ER 412; Gaydon v DFC of T 98 ATC 2328; FCT v Wiener 78 ATC 4006; FCT v Genys 87 ATC 4875. In Wiener, the taxpayer was a teacher who taught at five different schools from Monday to Thursday. On Friday she taught at one school and did the administrative work associated with the teaching programme. The court considered that the taxpayer’s employment was an itinerant one. The nature of the job made travel in the performance of the duties essential and it was an implied term of her employment that she provide her own means of transport. A motor vehicle was necessary to enable the taxpayer to comply with her teaching timetable. The taxpayer could be said to be travelling in the performance of her duties from when she left home to when she returned home. In Genys, the court did not accept that the fact that the taxpayer (a nurse who was employed at various hospitals through an employment agency) did not have permanent employment at one hospital was sufficient for her occupation to be an “itinerant” one. The court considered that the taxpayer’s duties did not commence until she arrived at the hospital. She merely drove from home to work and back again. The court considered that if the taxpayer in Wiener had been employed at one school on each day of the week, each school would have been regarded as a fixed place of work: see p. 4883. 3. Travel in response to emergency calls That an employee travels to and from work in response to a telephone call is not sufficient to make the travel work-related travel. For example, it was considered that the work duties of an airline pilot who was on call did not begin until the pilot arrived at the airport and travel between the pilot’s home and work was private travel: Nolder v Walters 15 TC 380. Also, travel by the taxpayer in Genys was private travel as the taxpayer was not obliged to accept the work offered and her duties did not commence until her arrival at the hospital. If an employee elects to carry out some work duties at home and is consequently required to travel to the employee’s usual work place in response to a call, travel between the employee’s home and work would still be private travel. The requirement for the employee to perform work duties at the home and to be accessible at the home for emergency calls must be a consequence of the nature of the employee’s duties. Examples of such a situation are: Owen v Pook \[1970\] AC 244 and FCT v Collings 76 ATC 4254. In Owen v Pook, a doctor (who was in practice as a GP and who was also employed part-time by a hospital for emergency cases) was required to be accessible by telephone at home. On receipt of a phone call from the hospital the taxpayer gave instructions to the hospital staff before leaving for the hospital or advised treatment by telephone. The majority in the House of Lords considered that the taxpayer carried out his duties in two places, namely, at the hospital and at his home and that the taxpayer had commenced his employment duties at the home before travel commenced. Lord Guest said: 14 In Ricketts v. Colquhoun there was only one place of employment, Portsmouth. It was not suggested that any duties were performed in London. In the present case there is a finding of fact that Dr. Owen’s duties commenced at the moment he was first contacted by the hospital authorities. This is further emphasised by the finding that his responsibility for a patient began as soon as he received a telephone call and that he sometimes advised treatment by telephone ... There were thus two places where his duty is performed, the hospital and his telephone in his consulting room. If he was performing his duties at both places, then it is difficult to see why, on the journey between the two places, he was not equally performing his duties ... It follows that he had to get from his consulting room to the hospital by car to treat the emergency. The travelling expenses were, in my view, necessarily incurred in performance of the duties of his office. \[pp. 256 - 257\] In Collings, the taxpayer was employed as a computer consultant who had been sent to the US for special training in relation to a major conversion in computer facilities of her employer. Her normal hours of work were from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, but she was also required to be on call for the remainder of the 24 hours of the day and on weekends. It was normal for her to receive calls and to give telephone advice to workers at the office at any time of the day or night. The taxpayer was provided with a computer which was connected to the office computer, in order to assist in diagnosing and correcting computer faults from home. If the problem could not be dealt with at home, the taxpayer was required to go into the office. The taxpayer did not claim that her normal daily journeys between home and work were business journeys. The issue in the case was whether expenditure relating to the “special journeys” in response to calls for assistance was deductible. However, the following passage from the judgment indicates that if the court had been required to determine whether expenditure on the normal daily journeys was deductible, the court would have considered that such expenditure was private expenditure: It seems to me that the proposition that expenses of travel between the taxpayer’s residence and his place of work are not allowable deductions under sec. 51 has its basis in a specific viewpoint that such expenses are of a private nature, and not in any compulsion of the words “incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income” or in any of the criteria formulated for applying those words in particular cases. That such expenses are essentially of a private nature has derived from a view that a man’s choice of a home in a location different from work is a decision relating to his private living. The historical origins of this view, and the anomalies inherent in it, are explained by Denning LJ (as he then was) in Newsom v Robertson \[1953\] 1 Ch 7 at p. 17). The relevant passages are quoted in the joint judgment in Lunney’s case (100 CLR at p. 499-500) and are referred to by Dixon CJ (at p. 485). Thus the question in the present case resolves itself into whether a principle, that appears to be grounded in history rather than reason, should be extended to a case such as the present when a business element is present in the journey from home to work, if not from work to home. I am not concerned with those normal daily journeys that have their sole relation to a person’s choice of his place of residence; I am concerned with journeys which begin as a result of performance of duties of the employment at the taxpayer’s home. (p. 4262) \[emphasis added\] Rath J considered that expenditure on travel undertaken by the taxpayer between home and work in order to resolve a problem or malfunction of the employer’s computer was deductible as the expenditure was incurred in the course of performing employment duties commenced at the home (‘on work”). Expenditure on the special journeys was, therefore, deductible. Rath J commented: There were two separate and distinguishable facets of her employment. On the one aspect she commuted regularly to her work; on the other she had a different set of functions, namely to be ready at call at all other times, night or day or on weekends to work at problems of malfunctioning of the 15 computer, with the aid of such information as she could obtain on the telephone, and with or without the aid of her portable terminal. Lord Reid said (in Taylor v. Provan) that it was necessary, in Owen v. Pook, that whoever was appointed should incur travelling expenses. Similarly it would, in a practical sense, be necessary for any person on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week to incur travelling expenses. Adapting the words of Lord Morris (p. 211), the journeys to and from home were made necessary by the very nature of the employment and of the taxpayer’s duties. The taxpayer here, as much as in Taylor v. Provan, had a “very special” employment (cp. p. 212). She was not really in a position similar to those “thousands of employees” that Lord Donovan referred to (in Owen v. Pook, p. 261) who have to be on stand-by duty at their homes and are required to obey a summons to cope with some emergency. It may or may not be that those “thousands of employees” cannot deduct the expenses of emergency travel; but the case of the present taxpayer is clearly different, for she was engaged upon a special assignment, and was continuously on duty, wherever she was. The taxpayer is not in this case choosing to do part of the work of her job in two separate places (cp. Lord Wilberforce in Taylor v. Provan, at p. 215). Unless she were to spend all her time in the office with the computer, she must have more than one place of work. Hers is not the freedom of choice of a barrister who does some of his work at home (Newsom v. Robertson (1953) 1 Ch. 7). Her double work-location is not only not merely colourable, but the two places of work are a necessary obligation arising from the nature of her special duties (cp. Lord Simon, p. 222). The taxpayer’s employer had gone to the expense of having the taxpayer specially trained in the United States so as to be capable of effecting and supervising the computer conversion. The employer had to have her, as a person so uniquely qualified, available at all times for the conversion. It seems to me that the circumstances of this case are closer to those of Taylor v. Provan than to those of Owen v. Pook, and are thus more strongly in favour of the taxpayer (cp. Lord Salmon, p. 227). None the less the analogy with Owen v. Pook is close. When called at her home, the taxpayer immediately had the responsibility of correcting the malfunction in the computer. She might there and then diagnose the trouble, and provide the remedy; or she might decide that she would have to make the journey to the office, and if she took this course she was during the journey on duty in regard to the particular problem that had arisen. The circumstances of her case contrast sharply with the case of the airline pilot on call (Nolder v. Walters 15 T.C. 380). In that case the expenses of the pilot’s telephone were also disallowed, and here again there is a contrast between the pilot’s use of the telephone and the use that the taxpayer in the present case makes of the telephone. Rowlatt J. said (p. 388): “He has to be at the office, wherever he has to start from, and I think the telephone is in the same position. It is a mere question of communicating with him with a view to him coming to the office to do his duties, which begin when he gets there; and, of course, when I say the office I mean in this case the aerodrome; the place of employment. That is all it is, and it seems to me that both those heads are clearly outside the rule.” \[emphasis added\] (p 4268) In each case it is necessary to consider whether the taxpayer’s work commenced at the home. Travel by the taxpayer in Collings in response to emergency calls was travel to complete work commenced at the home but the taxpayer’s normal daily travel was travel to put the taxpayer in the position of being able to commence work and was private travel. The mere fact that a taxpayer is required to be accessible at the home to receive business calls is not sufficient. The taxpayer in Nolder v Walters was required to travel to the airport in order to commence work there but did not travel between home and work in the course of performing work. In Pitcher v DFC of T 98 ATC 2190 (which concerned a radiographer who was required to be on-call after hours but was not paid to be on-call) the AAT said: As the Applicant accepted, she received the calls and in response to them travelled to the hospital to perform her duties there. Unlike the taxpayers in Collings and Owen v Pook, her home could not be described as a place at which work was performed; it was by contrast merely the place at which she received the calls. (para 14) 16 A second journey to the workplace after an evening meal or travel undertaken at the weekend is not business travel merely because the travel is undertaken outside normal business hours. In Case M99 80 ATC 691 the taxpayer was a public servant whose duties involved the carrying out of independent research. The taxpayer’s ordinary hours of work were a minimum of 36¾ hours a week to be worked between 8 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday. However, the taxpayer often returned to work in the evenings and worked on weekends in order to do something that had to be done at that particular time for the success of his research. The AAT held that the weekend and evening journeys had the same character as the usual morning and afternoon journeys. The AAT said: 10. There is no doubt that that principle applies where a person chooses to travel to his home for his midday meal, and then to travel back to the place of work. By analogy that principle applies also where, say a barrister finds it is essential for him to return at night to his city chambers for a conference after he has had his evening meal at his suburban residence. Thus the application of Lunney and Hayley is not excluded where the journey is merely any daily journey from home to work and return; nor is it excluded where the second such journey is, in the opinion of the claimant, a compulsory one for the proper conduct of work. The taxpayer in Case M99 was not travelling in the course of performing work but was merely travelling to work and from work. The travel to the home in the evening was for a private purpose (to have dinner) and the travel back to work was no different from the normal daily journey. 4. Travel between two work places (one of which is the taxpayer’s home) It is not sufficient to establish that the home is a work place. For expenditure to be deductible, the need for the work to be performed at the home and, therefore, the need for the travel must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or personal circumstances of the taxpayer: see Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1926\] AC 1; Taylor v Provan; Burton v FCT 79 ATC 4,318; Miners v Atkinson \[1995\] STC 58; Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] STC 231 (discussed in more detail below). There is also a distinction between travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work and travel in the course of performing work. Travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work is not deductible. Travel between home and work would be travel “on work” rather than travel to enable the taxpayer to commence work in the following circumstances: • If the taxpayer had commenced work at the time of leaving the home or before the taxpayer leaves the home to travel to work; or • Where travel to the home is undertaken in the course of performing work in order to complete the work at the home. Travel between a work place at the home and another work place would be work- related travel only where the two work places relate to the same income earning activity. In FCT v Payne 2001 ATC 4027 the taxpayer was employed as an airline pilot and also operated a deer farming business at a property where he lived with his family. By a majority, the High Court of Australia held that expenditure incurred in travelling between the farm and the airport was not deductible. Travel between a 17 workplace relating to one income earning activity and a workplace relating to a different income earning activity was no different from travelling from home to work in order to enable a taxpayer to commence work: 14. When, as here, the travel is between two places of unrelated income derivation, the expense cannot be said to be incurred “in the course of” deriving income from either activity. As the majority of the Full Court \[99 ATC 4391 at 4399\] recognised in this case: “...The expenditure was incurred before \[the taxpayer\] began to perform his duties as a pilot, or after he had fulfilled those duties. Similarly, in relation to the deer farming business.” \[99 ATC 4391 at 4399\] The expenditure was, as the majority of the Full Court rightly said, “not incurred in the course of his employment as a pilot, nor in the course of his deer-farming business”. The taxpayer’s travel occurred in the intervals between the two income-producing activities. The travel did not occur while the taxpayer was engaged in either activity. To adopt and adapt the language used in Ronpibon, neither the taxpayer’s employment as a pilot nor the conduct of his business farming deer occasioned the outgoings for travel expenses. These outgoings were occasioned by the need to be in a position where the taxpayer could set about the tasks by which assessable income would be derived. In this respect they were no different from expenses incurred in travelling from home to work. (pp. 4030-4031) The Commissioner now considers that the item “Travelling Expenses Between Two Places of Business” in Public Information Bulletin No 12 (July 1964) does not correctly state the position. The item, which is based on A v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 6 AITR 47, is not consistent with the view of the Court of Appeal in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 that for expenditure to be deductible it must be incurred in the course of deriving income. The consequence of that approach is that a distinction is drawn between travel to put a taxpayer in the position of being able to commence work and travel “on work” (travel in the course of deriving income). FCT v Payne is an example of a case where the court drew that distinction, with the result that a deduction was not allowed for travel between workplaces relating to different income-earning activities. See also the comments of Judge Bathgate in Case F72 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,924 referred to above, where the judge considered that to determine whether travel expenditure was deductible generally consideration was required of when work commenced. Record keeping requirements – Sections DH 1 to DH 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 Motor vehicle expenses are not deductible except as provided in section DH 1. Sections DH 1 to DH 4 (which concern the record-keeping requirements necessary to establish the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle that is used partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes) do not apply to companies or to taxpayers whose sole income is income from employment, nor do they apply in relation to a motor vehicle that is used only for the deriving of income or for a purpose that constitutes a fringe benefit: section DH 1(2)(a). Section DH 1(3) requires apportionment of expenditure in relation to a motor vehicle that is used partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes. A deduction is permitted for the proportion of the expenditure which reflects the proportion of business use of the vehicle relative to the total use of the vehicle: section DH 1(3). The business use proportion of a vehicle, for the purpose of section DH 1(3), is determined in accordance with sections DH 2 to DH 4. Under sections DH 2 and DH 3, the business use proportion may be established from: 18 • Complete and accurate records of the reasons for and distance of journeys undertaken by a motor vehicle for business purposes and such other details as the Commissioner may require; or • A logbook including these details which is maintained for a test period: section DH 2(2). Where a taxpayer has not maintained actual records for any period or the logbook test period provision does not apply, the business use proportion of the vehicle for that period would be limited to the lesser of the proportion of actual business use and 25 percent of the total use of the vehicle during that period: section DH 4. “Business use” or use for “business purposes” “Business use” or use for “business purposes” is travel undertaken wholly and exclusively in gaining or producing the taxpayer’s gross income: see definition of “business purposes” or “business use” in section OB 1. To be “business use” or use for “business purposes” the travel must be undertaken solely for a business reason. In circumstances where (in line with the principles outlined above) travel between home and work is business travel, such travel would be “business use” or use for “business purposes”. In each case, the question is: what was the objective to be served by the travel. See Bentleys Stokes and Lowless v Beeson (1952) 33 TC 491; Mackinlay v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co \[1990\] 2 AC 239. To be travel undertaken “wholly and exclusively in deriving gross income”, the advantage gained or sought to be gained from the travel must be the deriving of gross income and no other purpose. A journey is classified either as business use or not business use rather than the journey being apportioned on a mileage basis. This follows from the “wholly and exclusively” test. A journey undertaken for a business purpose which includes a material deviation for a private reason is not “travel undertaken ...wholly and exclusively in deriving gross income of the taxpayer”. Section DH 2, which requires taxpayers to maintain details of the reasons for and distance of journeys undertaken by a vehicle for business purposes, also contemplates that a particular journey will be either business use or not business use. Travel undertaken solely for a business reason which necessarily also results in an incidental private benefit being received by the taxpayer would still be “business use” and the costs of the travel would be deductible : see Bentleys Stokes and Lowless v Beeson (1952) 33 TC 491; Mallalieu v Drummond 57 TC 330. A private benefit received by a taxpayer would be disregarded where travel has been undertaken solely to achieve a business objective but the travel also has an effect of providing a private benefit to the taxpayer. Such an incidental private benefit would arise where the transport of the taxpayer is a necessary consequence of travel undertaken for business purposes. For example, if it is essential for a taxpayer to use a vehicle to transport business goods or equipment (because of their bulk, weight or other special characteristics) between home and work in the course of carrying out income earning activities, the journey would be “business use”, notwithstanding that the taxpayer is also transported . An incidental private benefit could also arise where a taxpayer is 19 able, in the course of a journey undertaken for business purposes, to also go to a private destination without travelling any additional distance to do so. For example, if a taxpayer, who is travelling to a business destination, must pass a dairy in order to reach the business destination and stops at the dairy for personal shopping, the private benefit received would be incidental to the business use of the vehicle for the purpose of sections DH 1 to DH 4 and the costs of the journey would still be deductible . Conversely, the performance of incidental tasks such as picking up mail or newspapers or making a business call on the way to work (when travel between home and work is not business travel) would not make the trip business travel. In Sargent v Barnes \[1978\] STC 321 the taxpayer was a dentist who had a laboratory one mile from his home and 11 miles from his surgery. The laboratory was maintained for the purpose of the repair, alteration and making of dentures. Each morning on his way to the surgery the taxpayer spent about ten minutes at the laboratory to collect completed work. Each evening after closing his surgery the taxpayer called at the laboratory to deliver dentures and other articles to the technician working there. Oliver J considered that the journey was essentially a private journey (travel between home and work) and the intermediate stop did not alter the character of the travel and, therefore, expenditure on such travel was not incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes: In seeking to assess, on the facts as found by the commissioners, the taxpayer’s purpose in incurring the expenditure here in question, counsel for the taxpayer points to the fact that he paused in his progress to the surgery to discuss matters with the technician and that he sometimes spent up to an hour with him in the evening, even carrying out work on dentures himself. But the interruption of a journey, whether for five minutes or for a longer period, does not alter the quality of the journey, although it may add to its utility. At highest, as it seems to me, it merely furnishes an additional purpose Of course, it is right to say that if I notionally interrupt the taxpayer’s journey at an intermediate point between the laboratory and the surgery and ask myself the question ‘Why is he on this particular road at this particular time?’ I may come up with the answer that he is taking that particular route because it passes the laboratory. But, as counsel for the Crown points out, that is not the right question. What the court is concerned with is not simply why he took a particular route (although that may be of the highest relevance in considering the deductibility of any additional expense caused by a deviation) but why the taxpayer incurred the expense of the petrol, oil, and wear and tear and depreciation in relation to this particular journey.” (p. 328) \[emphasis added\] In each case the question is: what is the real purpose of the journey? If travel between home and work is private travel but the taxpayer plans a journey so as to incorporate a deviation through a place of work where the taxpayer has no business to do, the deviation would not alter the nature of the journey. In Sargent v Barnes Oliver J made the following comments in relation to the taxpayer’s argument that once it was established that the laboratory was a place of business, a deduction was allowable: Now the assumption here is that the expense of travel between two places of business is always and inevitably allowable, and counsel for the taxpayer bases himself on this passage in the judging of Lord Denning MR in Horton v Young \[1971\] 3 All ER 412 at 415, \[1972\] Ch 157 at 168, 47 Tax Cas 60 at 71: “If the commissioners were right it would lead to some absurd results. Suppose that Mr Horton had a job at a site 200 yards away from his home, and another one at Reigate, 45 miles away. All he would have to do would be to go for five minutes to the site near home and then he would get his travelling expenses to and from Reigate. I can well see that he could so arrange his affairs that every morning he would have to call at a site near home. Instead of 20 going to that absurdity, it is better to hold that his expenses to and from his home are all deductible.’ I question, however, whether, in that passage, Lord Denning MR intended to suggest that by deliberately planning your journey to your place of work so as to incorporate a deviation through another place of work where you actually have no business to do you alter the quality of the journey. (p. 327) Example 1 A taxpayer has two places of work. One work place (A) is situated in a town which is 20 km from the taxpayer’s home. The other work place (B) is located 2km from the taxpayer’s home. Normally, on 4 days of the week the taxpayer works from A and on the other day the taxpayer works from B. Sometimes the taxpayer travels between A and B during the day. The taxpayer travels from A to the taxpayer’s home but chooses to deviate through B, although there is no business reason for the taxpayer to do so. The travel between home and work would generally be private travel as the taxpayer cannot alter the character of the journey by deliberately planning the journey to the taxpayer’s place of work so as to incorporate a deviation through another place of work where the taxpayer has no business to do: see Sargent v Barnes. A journey undertaken for business purposes which involves a deviation of no significant distance for a private reason would be classified as business travel. The broad principle to be applied is that to be business use, any additional distance travelled for a private reason in the course of a journey undertaken for business purposes must be insignificant in comparison with the total journey. Both the additional distance travelled for a private reason and the proportion of the total journey which the private use represents need to be taken into account. Where a significant proportion of the journey involves travel undertaken for private purposes, the journey would not be business travel (even if the private component involves only a short distance). As a guideline, the Commissioner considers that private travel that represents the lesser of approximately 2 km or approximately 5 percent of the journey would be minor or insignificant. Example 2 A taxpayer is a self-employed plumber whose home is his base of operations. He goes to the gym on his way home at the end of the day. The stop at the gym involves the taxpayer travelling an alternative route from the last job of the day to the home work base which adds 1 km to the journey. The total journey is 17 km. The travel to the gym (5.8% of the journey) would be minor or insignificant private use. Example 3 A taxpayer is employed as a midwife. The taxpayer does not work from a fixed base and her duties require her to visit all of her clients at regular intervals during their pregnancy and to be present at the birth of their babies. 21 On a particular day the journey from the taxpayer’s last call of the day to her home would have been a distance of 3 km. However, instead of going direct to her home, the taxpayer travelled to a rest home to visit her father. The visit to the rest home added an additional distance of 2 km to the journey. The travel to the rest home (40% of the journey) is not minor or insignificant and the journey would not be minor or insignificant private use. If there was a material deviation for a private reason (an additional distance travelled representing a significant proportion of the journey) the journey would not be business use for the purpose of section DH 1(3). However, in some cases travel involving an intermediate stop between two points could be two journeys rather than a single journey. Whether this is so depends on what the real purpose of the journey is and whether the intermediate stop is incidental to the entire journey: see Sargent v Barnes. For example, if a taxpayer travels to the taxpayer’s office in order to carry out substantive business activities there and then travels to another place for business purposes, there would be two journeys and (assuming that travel between the taxpayer’s home and work is private travel) the first journey would be private. Example 4 A taxpayer travels from home to the taxpayer’s office to pick up some papers required for a meeting at a client’s office and then travels to a client’s office. The journey would be a single journey for one purpose, the stop at the taxpayer’s office being incidental to the journey. Example 5 A taxpayer travels from home to the taxpayer’s office where the taxpayer has appointments with clients. Later in the day, the taxpayer travels to a supplier’s premises for a meeting. The journey to the taxpayer’s office and the journey to the supplier’s premises are separate journeys. To summarise, to be “business use” or use for “business purposes” the travel must be undertaken solely for a business reason. A journey is classified either as business use or not business use rather than the journey being apportioned on a mileage basis. Where a journey undertaken for business purposes includes a private component, the private travel would be disregarded and the entire journey would be classified as business travel in the following circumstances: • The private benefit received is incidental to a journey that has been undertaken solely for business purposes (being a private benefit that necessarily results from a journey undertaken for such purpose). For example, if a taxpayer is required to transport heavy or bulky business equipment between home and work in order to perform income earning activities at the home and another work place and a vehicle is essential for that purpose, the transport of the taxpayer would be incidental to the transport of the business equipment. If a taxpayer made a stop at a dairy on the way to a business destination and did not follow a particular route to enable the taxpayer to make the stop, the private benefit would also be incidental. However, if a taxpayer made a deviation on a business journey in order to pick up children from school, then the journey would be undertaken for both a private and 22 a business reason and would not, therefore, be business use (being travel that is undertaken wholly and exclusively in deriving gross income of the taxpayer); or • The private travel is de minimis (being a deviation for a private reason in the course of a journey undertaken for business purposes or in the course of performing employment duties that is a minor or insignificant part of the journey). (If the private travel is more than a minor or insignificant part of the journey, the journey would not be business use. However, in some cases travel involving an intermediate stop between two points could be two journeys rather than a single journey.) FBT – private use or enjoyment Distinction between private use and work-related use FBT is chargeable where a fringe benefit consisting of the private use or enjoyment (or availability for private use or enjoyment) of a motor vehicle is provided by an employer to an employee. In CIR v Schick (1998) 18 NZTC 13,738, Gallen J considered that the term “private use or enjoyment” imported the concept of a distinction between work-related use and private use. The fundamental issue is whether a private benefit has been conferred. A fringe benefit will not be conferred unless a private benefit is provided. Gallen J considered that the provision of a motor vehicle to an employee only for work-related travel would not constitute a private benefit and would not be “private use or enjoyment”. The definition of “private use or enjoyment” specifically includes “travel in the course of proceeding to or from ... the home”. However, in Schick the court considered that this part of the definition did not apply where the vehicle was used for travel between the home as a work base (rather than as a home) and another work place. Therefore, the fact that the vehicles were used for travel starting from or ending at the home did not necessarily bring the travel within the definition. No fringe benefit unless private benefit provided In Schick Gallen J approved the reasoning in Case Q25 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,124 that the definition of “private use or enjoyment” applied to travel that conferred a benefit of a private or domestic nature: The comments are interesting firstly because they put an emphasis on the purpose for which the vehicles were used as distinct from whether they merely travelled to or from home and secondly because he regarded the concept of benefit of a private or domestic nature, which qualifies the second part of the definition of private use or enjoyment, as applying also to the first part where it does not appear. I think in context there is justification for that particular view. The term “fringe benefit” itself in definition refers to benefit not only in the title, but in the first part of the definition. The concept of private use or enjoyment where it appears in sub-para (a) and in the definition of that term itself, imports the concept of a distinction between a work related use and a private use. It follows then that I agree with the Judge that the word “travel” where used in the definition of private use or enjoyment, is to be regarded as qualified by that qualification which appears in the 23 second part of the definition and means travel which confers a benefit of a private or domestic nature. (p.13,743) \[emphasis added\] The taxpayers in Schick carried on business as transport operators and earthmoving contractors and had provided vehicles to their foremen who used the vehicles to transport themselves and fuel and grease and other equipment necessary for the operation of earthmoving equipment to remote worksites where the equipment was operated. The mechanic employed by the taxpayers used the van provided to him to service both the transport vehicles and the earthmoving equipment. The employees usually travelled direct from home to the worksites and were paid from the time that they left home to the time that they returned home. Also, the foremen were paid an extra half hour a day to do clerical work and were required to keep their daily records at home. At times the foremen kept oil or grease and a few tools at their homes. The foremen were given plastic cards that allowed them to purchase fuel, oil and grease and were expected to ensure that they had sufficient stocks of oil and grease to ensure the smooth running of the earthmoving equipment. The foremen had discretion to discuss the progress of work with customers. Gallen J considered that a private benefit had not been provided to the employees in Schick. He accepted that the employees were working from the time they left home. They were paid from the time they left home, they were required to keep daily records at home and to be available there for consultation with clients. The employees and the vehicles were required to be available at the home for emergency call-outs. The provision of the vehicles was for the benefit of the employer in getting the employee to remote worksites in the quickest and most efficient way possible. No private benefit provided where vehicle provided for work-related travel between work and home as a work place Gallen J considered that where the employee’s home is also a work place and where the vehicle was used for transport to and from work, a private benefit would not be provided: ...The concept of “home” where it appears in the definition of “private use or enjoyment”, does not apply where the home concerned is not used exclusively as a home, but also as a work place. This is in accord with the view that the definition of “private use or enjoyment” is confined to a situation where there is a genuine benefit to the employee concerned which would occur where the vehicle was used for transportation to and from work. Where however transportation was from work to work, there is no room for the operation of the definition. (p. 13,643) Gallen J considered that it was open to the TRA to conclude on the facts that the home was also a work place (Gallen J noted that different considerations would arise if the question being considered was whether deductions are allowable in respect of the home). The Commissioner had argued that whether a home was a work place depended on the extent to which it was so used and that one or more of the following factors were satisfied: • Whether there are sound business reasons for operating from home; • Whether significant business activity actually occurs at home; 24 • Whether there is significant storage of business goods or equipment at home; • Whether significant space is set aside and used for business-related activities conducted at home; • Whether the activities conducted at the home are closely integrated with the taxpayer’s business. These factors were drawn from the facts of cases on “private use or enjoyment” decided before Schick: see Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208; Case Q25 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,124; Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182 (discussed in more detail below). Applying these factors, the court in Schick concluded that the employees’ homes were work places for FBT purposes. The court considered that three of the above factors had some application, and that these three factors taken together were sufficient for the home to be considered to be a work place. The court made the following comments in relation to these factors: • There were sound business reasons for working from home. The employees were required by their employers to keep their daily records at home. They were required to be available for consultation with clients and were required to be available for emergency purposes. • The activities carried on at the home were an integral part of the taxpayers’ business activities in that the employees effectively operated and managed the taxpayers’ business from their homes to the actual work sites. • The storage of the vehicles at the employees’ homes would go some way towards establishing that there was significant storage of business goods and equipment at the homes. The court noted, however, that this factor should not be given too much weight given the issues in the case. In the context of the employers’ business (which involved work carried out at remote work sites and which required the employees to be available at the home for consultation with clients or for emergencies), the vehicles were taken to the home and kept there to be available for work-related travel. Relevance of Schick factors In Schick, the employees’ homes were considered to be work places, although the taxpayer could not establish that a significant proportion of the homes were set aside for business purposes or that significant business activity occurred at the homes and the only storage of business goods or equipment was the vehicles themselves. Whether the factors of significant storage of business goods or equipment at the home or significant space at the home being set aside for business purposes are relevant and are to be given weight depends on the nature of the employment duties and whether the goods and equipment stored at the home are necessary for the performance of employment duties and the space requirements of the particular activity. The significant storage of business goods and equipment at the home and the setting aside of significant space at the home for business use will not in themselves make the home also a place of work or business. On the other hand, technological changes mean that significant space or significant storage of tangible goods may no longer be 25 necessary for the carrying on of business activities at a home. Technology has also made it more feasible for employees to perform their employment duties outside the conventional factory or office environment. For these reasons, the Commissioner considers that the presence or absence of these three indicators will not necessarily determine whether travel between home and work is private travel or work-related travel. A home still retains the characteristics of a home although business goods may be kept there and some employment duties may be performed there. The approach in cases on deductibility of travel expenditure is that for expenditure on travel between home and work to be deductible it is necessary to establish: • The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) arises from the nature of the work ; and • The travel is “on work”. The Commissioner considers that the same approach is to be applied in determining whether travel between home and work is private travel for FBT purposes. The first requirement is consistent with the two other indicators referred to in Schick (whether there are sound business reasons for operating from the employee’s home and whether the activities conducted at the home are closely integrated with the employer’s business), The Commissioner considers that for both FBT and deductibility purposes, in order to distinguish between business use and private use, it is necessary to consider the nature of the income earning activity and the relationship of the travel to that activity. Travel between home and work would be private travel if the work is performed at the home because of the personal circumstances or personal preferences of the taxpayer. For travel to be work-related travel, it is not sufficient that the employer and employee contracted on the basis that employment duties would be performed partly at the home. However, it is not sufficient that employees carry out employment duties at home for business reasons. The Schick case establishes that the fundamental issue is whether a private benefit has been conferred. Under the FBT regime there is a presumption that the provision of a vehicle for travel between home and work confers a private benefit. The definition of “private use or enjoyment” specifically includes “travel ... in the course of proceeding to or from the person’s home”. Generally travel between home and work is private travel as it enables employees to live away from their work and relates to a private decision (the employee’s choice of location of residence). In Lunney v FCT in their joint judgment Williams J, Kitto J and Taylor J referred to Newsom v Robertson (which concerned a barrister who worked at his chambers or in court during the day and frequently took papers home to work for several hours after dinner) and commented: It should be mentioned that in this case the additional fact appeared that the taxpayer consistently performed some of his professional duties at his home and the case was put as one in which the facts disclosed that the expenditure was incurred, not merely in travelling between his home and place of business, but, rather, in travelling between one place of business and another. Yet the taxpayer’s claim to a deduction was rejected both, in the first instance and in the Court of Appeal. None of the members 26 of the latter Court were prepared to assent to the proposition that the taxpayer’s journeys were for the “purpose” of his profession; in the language of Romer LJ: “The object of the journeys between his home and place of work, both morning and evening, is not to enable the man to do his work but to live away from it.” The fact that few taxpayers are free to choose whether they will live at their place of work or away from it may appear to invest this statement with a degree of artificiality. But, even in these modern times, they still have, within limits, the right to choose where their homes shall be so that a taxpayer’s daily journeys between his home and place of work are rendered necessary as much by his choice of a locality for his residence as by his choice of employment or occupation. And indeed the purpose of such journey \[sic\] is, at least, as much to enable him to reside at his home as to attend his place of work or business. (p. 413) \[emphasis added\] Example 7 An employee is the manager of a foreign exchange dealing room of a bank whose head office is in Hong Kong. Many of the bank’s clients are in different time zones from New Zealand. The manager often works at the home in the evenings or on Saturday mornings (when the US markets are still open) as the manager is required to be available to provide market information or report to the bank’s head office or to carry out currency dealing. The manager is sometimes required to travel back to the bank’s premises or to a video conference facility for conference calls or video conferences. Although FBT was introduced much more recently than income tax, the same philosophy underlies the classification of travel between home and work as private travel (that is, travel between home and work is required because of the taxpayer’s choice of location of residence). The normal daily travel by an employee does not cease to be private travel merely because employment duties are performed at the home. A second journey to participate in a video conference is no different from travel by an employee who chooses to travel home for lunch and then to travel back to work: see Case M99 80 ATC 691. Travel by an employee in such circumstances is undertaken to enable the employee to live away from the employee’s workplace and remains travel to commence work. An employee who performs work duties at the home after normal working hours cannot be regarded as being continuously engaged in employment duties while travelling between home and work. The employee may be travelling to do work at the home but is not travelling on work. Unlike the taxpayer in Collings, the employee would not be travelling to complete an aspect of the employee’s employment already underway when the journey began. Both the normal daily journey between work and home and a second journey back to work for a video conference by the manager is travel of a private nature. Example 8 A researcher works in an open plan environment at the employer’s premises. Sometimes the researcher takes more complex and difficult work home. 27 Because of disruptions at the employer’s premises it is more efficient for the work to be carried out at home. Travel between work and home would still be private travel where work is performed at home because of problems with facilities at work. The employee would be travelling to work rather than in the course of performing work duties. In Warner v Prior (2003) Sp C 353 a deduction was not allowed although it was accepted that the taxpayer performed the additional duties at her home because adequate facilities were not provided for her to carry out these duties at the schools where she taught. Each of the FBT cases where travel between home and work has been found not to be “private use or enjoyment” falls into one or more of the exceptions referred to in Genys. Each of these exceptions involves situations where the travel is “on work” rather than travel in order to commence employment duties or travel from work. Travel by an employee in such situations would be travel for work-related purposes and would not constitute private use or enjoyment. • Vehicle essential for transport of goods or equipment In Cases S26 and Q25 one of the factors taken into account in reaching a conclusion that travel between home and work was not private use was that the vehicle was used for the transport of goods to the home for work to be performed on them. In Case S26, the taxpayer was a clothing manufacturing company. Finishing off work was carried out on the garments at the home of the shareholder-employees. The finishing work on garments was intricate and time-consuming and it was inconvenient to fit in such work during the day at the factory. The vehicle was used each night to transport the garments between the factory and the home, and the following day, after finishing work had been done, the garments were transported back to the factory or were delivered to customers. The company in Case Q25 was also in the business of clothing manufacture. The home of the shareholders was fitted out for the storage of garments and up to 5,000 garments could be stored there at any time. The work performed at the home involved pressing garments, unpicking, and making good defective workmanship. The work carried out by the shareholders at the home was intended to minimise overheads. (In Case Q25 the TRA also held that the vehicles were work-related vehicles within the meaning of section 336N(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now contained in section OB 1 of the Act).) That aspect of the TRA’s decision was upheld by the High Court: CIR v Rag Doll Fashions (NZ) Ltd (1995) 17 NZTC 12,104.) • Itinerant occupations The occupations of the employees in Schick can be regarded as itinerant occupations. The court considered that the employees operated the employers’ business from their homes to the actual work sites where the work was performed. As previously mentioned, the employees were regarded as working from the time they left home. They were paid from the time they left home, they were required to keep daily records at home and to be available for consultation with clients. The employees and the vehicles were required to be available at the home for emergency call-outs. The 28 vehicles were required to transport oil and grease necessary for the smooth running of the earthmoving equipment at remote work sites. • Travel between work and home as a work place In Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208, it was held that travel from and to the home of the shareholder-employees was travel from and to a second business site. The company carried on the business of screen-printing. The actual printing and screening work was carried out at the company’s factory. Continuous test washing of sample garments (to check the quality of adherence of ink and dyes on garments) was carried out at the home on most days, there being no washing facility at the factory. Preparation of art work and clerical work involving the confirmation of quotes given during the day and the issuing and payment of accounts was also carried out at the home (because it could not be established that the vehicle was not available for private use or enjoyment, the company was liable for FBT). In Case S26 the home was also considered to be a business site. The company’s clothing manufacturing business had initially been conducted from the home and had later expanded to the factory. Although much of the manufacturing was carried out at the factory, finishing work continued to be done at the home. In Case Q25 also, garments manufactured at the company’s factory were taken to the home for finishing off work to be carried out on the garments. It was held that the vehicles were used for travel between the home and work for work-related purposes. Case T39 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,261 concerned a company which carried on the business of cosmetic dentistry and employed its principal shareholder and director in that business. Vehicles owned successively by the main shareholder and director of the company were leased to the company during working hours. The shareholder carried on the taxable activity of car leasing. Two issues were considered in the case: whether a fringe benefit had been provided and whether the shareholder had acquired the vehicles for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies for GST purposes. The TRA accepted that the nature of the agreement between the shareholder and the company was that the company was entitled to use the vehicle only during the lease hours (being the company’s hours of business). Because the vehicle was available to the shareholder for private use during those hours, the company was liable for FBT. In relation to the GST issue, the TRA considered that travel between home and the surgery was business use, as the home was an ancillary place of business in relation to the dentistry business (as that business was carried on by the company, it appears that while the vehicle was used for travel between the surgery and the home, the vehicle was considered to be subject to the lease). The work performed by the shareholder involved examining the patient, taking X-rays, preparing a jaw record, and making models of teeth. The shareholder specialised in treating complicated cases. Patients were seen at the surgery and treatment plans were prepared at the home office. Written records, teeth models and an articulator (a machine which simulated the movement of the jaw) were moved between the surgery and the home. The equipment at the home office included an X-ray viewer and a Bunsen burner used to remodel with wax the models of teeth. Also, the practice laundry was done at the home and was transported from the surgery to the home for that purpose. The TRA accepted that the particular style of dental speciality required there to be available a 29 place of business separate from the surgery where the shareholder could consider and plan the highly specialised form of treatment which the shareholder would recommend and apply to the practice’s clients. Travel between a work place at the home and another work place would be work- related travel only where the two work places relate to the same income earning activity: FCT v Payne 2001 ATC 4027. Therefore, applying the approach in Payne: • If an employee had full-time employment and the employee’s home was a place of work in relation to that employment, travel between the home to carry out employment duties in relation to a second job would be private travel. • If an employee was employed full-time and carried on a part-time business at the employee’s home, travel between the home and work would be private travel. Common principles relating to deductibility and to FBT The test for determining whether travel expenditure is deductible and the definition of “private use or enjoyment” for FBT purposes are expressed in different terms. However, the tests raise essentially the same issues and require consideration of the same factors. Expenditure on travel of a private nature cannot satisfy the test of deductibility. Conversely, if travel between home and work is “private use or enjoyment” (being travel which confers a benefit of a private or domestic nature”), expenditure on such travel would not be deductible. The test of deductibility and the FBT test applied to the same facts (and assuming that the employee had incurred expenditure on travel and a deduction was allowable for expenditure incurred in gaining income from employment) would produce the same result. In each of the FBT cases where it has been found that travel between home and work is not private use would have satisfied the test of deductibility in relation to the employee. For both deductibility and FBT purposes: • It is not sufficient that work is performed at the home. The need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel) must arise from the nature of the work; and • There is a distinction between travel undertaken to enable a person to commence work and travel in the course of performing work (“on work”). Travel to enable a person to commence work is private travel. For FBT purposes (as for deductibility purposes) a journey would be treated as work- related travel where: • The private benefit received is incidental, being a private benefit that necessarily results from a journey undertaken for work-related purposes; or 30 • The private travel is de minimis (being a minor or insignificant proportion of a journey undertaken solely for work-related purposes). Employment duties performed at home because of employee’s personal circumstances There may be cases where an employee has contracted on the basis that employment duties would be performed partly at the home. Technological and social changes have made such arrangements more common. The House of Lords in Taylor v Provan considered that an employment contract stipulates the nature of the employment duties and where the employment duties must be performed. However, the contract must be bona fide. Their Lordships also considered that (applying Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1926\] AC 1) the travel must be necessitated by the nature of the employment duties and not from the personal circumstances of the employee: see pp. 208, 212, 215-216, 221-222, 225, 226. Although the majority and the minority in Taylor v Provan did not agree on the proper inference to be drawn from the facts, there was no disagreement on the principles to be applied. Therefore, the terms of an employment contract (provided these are bona fide) generally establish the nature of the employment duties and where these are to be performed. However, the fact that the home is a place where work is performed (whether or not under a contractual obligation) is not sufficient. The need for the travel must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or circumstances of the employee. Whether the need for travel arises from the nature of the work is determined objectively. These principles were applied in Taylor v Provan. In Taylor v Provan, the taxpayer was a Canadian brewery magnate who was a director of several UK brewery companies with special responsibility for negotiating mergers and amalgamations. The position was created specifically for the taxpayer who was uniquely qualified for the position. The arrangement was that the taxpayer would provide his services in Canada or the Bahamas as far as possible and when necessary he would travel to the UK to visit breweries there. The taxpayer was not paid for his services but he was reimbursed for the cost of travelling between Canada or the Bahamas and the UK. The Commissioner had assessed the taxpayer for income tax on the amounts reimbursed. The House of Lords held that the amounts were income but the majority (Lords Reid, Morris and Salmon) considered that the travel to and from the UK was not private travel and that, therefore, the expenses of such travel were deductible. It was not sufficient that the taxpayer had contracted to do most of the work outside the UK. Taylor v Provan is a case that involves exceptional circumstances. The distinguishing feature in the case was that the office was a unique one created to be held by a particular person with specialised skills and it was not possible for the company to get the work done by anyone else: see judgment of Lord Reid at p. 208, Lord Morris at p. 212-213, Lord Salmon at p. 227. However, the minority (Lords Wilberforce and Simon) did not accept that the taxpayer was under a contractual obligation to carry out part of his duties in Canada or the Bahamas and even if there had been such an obligation, the minority considered the terms of the taxpayer’s 31 employment merely recognised the taxpayer’s personal circumstances and were not required by the nature of the tasks involved in the office. The above principles were applied in two cases which were decided comparatively recently: Miners v Atkinson \[1995\] STC 58 and Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] STC 231. In Miners v Atkinson the taxpayer was a computer consultant and director of his own company. The company contracted to provide the taxpayer’s services to another company. The company’s registered office was at the taxpayer’s home, 80 miles away from the premises where the consulting services were performed. A distinction was drawn between services provided to the client and the taxpayer’s duties as a director. There was no contract between the client and the taxpayer and, therefore, in all of the taxpayer’s activities the taxpayer acted as a director of the company. It was accepted that the taxpayer’s home was the base from which he worked, being the place where he carried out his duties as a director of the company. The taxpayer argued that once it was accepted that the home was the taxpayer’s base of operations, it followed that expenses of travel between the home and the place where the consulting services were performed were necessarily incurred unless it could be shown that the taxpayer’s choice of residence was unreasonable. It was held that the expenditure was not deductible as the taxpayer was working at home out of choice. It was not necessary for the work to be carried out at the taxpayer’s home and the work could have been done anywhere. In Kirkwood v Evans the taxpayer was a civil servant who chose to join a homeworking scheme provided by his employer. The scheme was available to approved employees and was not compulsory. Under the scheme the taxpayer was provided with a computer and other equipment but was required to provide his own office accommodation at his home. The taxpayer’s home was his main work place but he agreed to travel to Leeds (which was 135 miles away from the taxpayer’s home) once a week in order to deliver work that he had done, to collect work and to download information from a database. While in Leeds the taxpayer was available to work there for the remainder of the day. It was held that the cost of travelling between the taxpayer’s home and Leeds was not deductible. The fact that the taxpayer had two places of work was not sufficient as this was not required by the nature of the taxpayer’s employment. Patten J said: \[12\] I mean no disrespect to Mr Evans when I say that he was obviously not uniquely qualified for the work he did and he accepted that in argument. The highest that he can put his case is that he was under the terms of the homeworking agreement with the CAS required to visit the office in Leeds to deliver and collect work and to update the information needed for his work. On the authorities this is not enough to make the travelling expenses ones which are necessarily incurred in the performance of those duties. Even accepting that the terms of his contract (whilst the homeworking agreement subsisted) required him to work four days in King’s Lynn and one in Leeds his choice to live in King’s Lynn rather than Leeds was historical and is unconnected with any term of his employment. The necessity of travelling to Leeds is dictated by his choice of the place where he lives and not by the nature and the terms of the job itself. \[13\] In para 10(b) of the case stated the reasoning and decision of the General Commissioners on this point is set out in the following terms: ‘(b) Having found as a fact that the taxpayer had two places of work, one his home in King’s Lynn and the other at his employer’s office in Leeds, the Commissioners 32 determined that the taxpayer was obliged in respect of the performance of his work duties to travel from his King’s Lynn office to Leeds and therefore the expense of so doing was necessary within the meaning of Section 198 of the 1988 Act, as was the expense relating to heating and lighting his King’s Lynn office.’ It seems to me that the commissioners considered that the mere fact that Mr Evans had two places of work (one being his home) and was required to travel between them was sufficient to bring the expenses involved within the provisions of s 198(1). For the reasons set out in the speech of Lord Reid in Taylor v Provan (Inspector of Taxes) this is not correct as a matter of law. Unless it could be shown either that Mr Evans was uniquely qualified to do that job or that objectively the job could only be done by working at home in King’s Lynn (as opposed to anywhere else) and at the office in Leeds the expenses cannot be said to have been necessarily incurred in the performance of Mr Evans’ duties. The Crown’s appeal will therefore be allowed in respect of the travel expenses which relate to the year 1997–98. .... \[16\] ...The travel in question was between his home in King’s Lynn and the CAS office in Leeds. The fact that his home was also a ‘work place’ does not prevent it from being his home. \[emphasis added\]: FCT v Collings 76 ATC 4254 also confirms that Taylor v Provan is to be regarded as an exceptional case. The Collings case concerned a computer consultant whose employer had undertaken a conversion of its computer system and who had been sent to the US for training in connection with the conversion. The taxpayer was required to be on call 24 hours a day. The court in Collings considered that the case was analogous with Taylor v Provan in that the taxpayer was uniquely qualified for the position. Although the actual result in Taylor v Provan was not discussed in the following cases, the authority of Taylor v Provan was not questioned in these cases: R v Deimert \[1976\] CTC 301; FCT v Wiener 78 ATC 4006; Garrett v FCT 82 ATC 4060; Case D19 (1979) 4 NZTC 60,553; Case F47 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,801. In R v Deimert the court noted that Taylor v Provan did not detract from the authority of Ricketts v Colquhoun, which was distinguished on the facts: see para 39. In Wiener (a case concerning a taxpayer with an itinerant occupation) Smith J, adopting the approach in Taylor v Provan, focused on the nature of the taxpayer’s employment. Fitzpatrick v IRC \[1994\] SLT 836 also supports the view that a contractual obligation to undertake travel between a home work place and another place of work would not mean that travel between the two places would be work-related travel. In that case the House of Lords confirmed that an expense is not deductible merely because it relates to an act which is required as a condition of employment. Generally, if an arrangement is made for an employee to perform employment duties partly at the employee’s home solely because of the employee’s personal circumstances, such an arrangement would merely recognise the employee’s personal circumstances and would not be required by the nature of the employment duties. In exceptional cases, where the business reason for the employer agreeing to employment duties being performed partly at the home is to obtain the services of the employee, travel between home and work may be regarded as work-related travel. This would be so where the position is a unique one for which the employee is uniquely qualified and it is not possible for the employer to fill the position otherwise. 33 In order to decide whether a particular case is such an exceptional case, it is necessary to consider the employee’s role in the employer’s business and why the arrangement was agreed to by the employer. Example 9 An employee works at home because otherwise the employee would spend long periods travelling to work because of traffic jams. During the day the employee is required to call at the employer’s premises in order to deliver documents or to pick up documents. Travel between the home and the employer’s premises is private travel, being travel that is necessary because the employee lives at a distance from the employer’s premises. The performance of work duties at the home is for the employee’s convenience. Vehicle taken to home for security reasons The Commissioner considers that the fact that a vehicle is taken to an employee’s home for security reasons would not in itself make the journey work-related travel (although this factor may be taken into account in conjunction with other factors). While the employer would receive a benefit from a car being taken home by an employee for security reasons, the employee would also receive a benefit from the use of the vehicle for travel to and from the home which is more than incidental to the benefit to the employer. Such travel would not be undertaken in the course of performing employment duties. Rather the travel would be undertaken in order to travel from home to work or from work to home. In Schick, it was acknowledged that the storage of the vehicle at home should not be given too much weight given that the issue being considered was whether the travel between home and work was private travel. Although in Case Q25 the TRA appeared to give some weight to the evidence that the vehicle was taken home because it was unsafe to leave it at the factory, other factors were present in the case which led to the conclusion that travel between home and work was work-related travel. The principle underlying the exceptions to the general rule that travel between home and work is private travel is that such travel will not be private travel where such travel is “on work” (in the course of performing work duties) rather than from work or to work. The Commissioner considers that an employee would not be travelling “on work” when travelling between work and home merely because the vehicle is stored at the employee’s home. Where a vehicle is taken to the employee’s home for storage, the private benefit derived by the employee (the transport of the employee) is not incidental to transport of work items. Availability for private use or enjoyment Even if travel between home and work is work-related travel (so that the use of a motor vehicle for that purpose is not private use) and there is no actual private use of the motor vehicle, the employer must establish that the vehicle is not available for 34 private use. For a vehicle to be available for private use, the owner, lessor or hirer of the vehicle must have permitted the private use of the vehicle: CIR v Yes Accounting Services Ltd (1999) 19 NZTC 15,296. If a vehicle is physically available for private use by an employee, the vehicle would be regarded as being available for private use unless the employer can establish that: • The employee is prohibited from using the vehicle for private purposes. If the employer has prohibited the private use of the vehicle it could not be said that the employer has made the vehicle available for private use, although the vehicle may be physically available for private use: CIR v Yes Accounting Services Ltd (1999) 19 NZTC 15,296. The prohibition against private use may be a general prohibition to employees contained in a human resources manual (or other formal employment policy document) or the prohibition may be part of an individual employee’s terms of employment; and • The prohibition on the private use of the vehicle is a genuine one. In Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 letters had been written on behalf of the company by shareholder-employees to themselves in their capacity as employees of the company prohibiting the private use of the vehicle. However, the TRA found that the letters were not really intended to prevent the availability of the vehicles. Whether the employees have private motor vehicles available for private use will also be relevant in determining whether the prohibition is genuinely observed: see, for example, Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182; and • The employer takes steps to ensure that the prohibition is observed. The employer in Yes Accounting Ltd carried out regular checks in order to enforce the prohibition. The record keeping requirements necessary to establish that a vehicle is not available for private use are set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 8 (April 1993) – “Shareholder-Employees and FBT on Company Vehicles”. Comments on technical submissions received Comments were received from parties external to Inland Revenue that: • for FBT purposes it is sufficient to establish that the home is a workplace and • the Schick case establishes that the reasons that an arrangement is made for an employee to work at home are irrelevant. The Commissioner does not accept that for FBT purposes it is sufficient to establish that a home is a workplace (on the basis of the five indicators outlined in Schick). As discussed above, the Schick case confirms that the fundamental issue in respect of FBT is whether a benefit of a private nature has been conferred and that a private benefit will not be provided where a vehicle is provided only for work-related travel This item addresses the circumstances in which travel by an employee between home and work will be treated as work-related travel. 35 The Commissioner also does not accept that the Schick case establishes that the reasons that an arrangement is made for an employee to work at home are irrelevant. Two of the factors referred to in Schick were: • There are sound business reasons for undertaking work at home; and • The activities carried on at the home must be an integral part of the employer’s business activities. In each of the cases where it has been held that travel between work and home was travel between work and home as a workplace for FBT purposes, there were sound business reasons for undertaking work at the home and the activities carried on at the home were an integral part of the employer’s business: see Schick; Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208; Case S26 (1994) 17 NZTC 7,182. These factors require the nature of the employment duties and the relationship of the travel to those duties to be considered. A comment was also made that the approach adopted in this Interpretation Statement fails to recognise technological and social changes which have resulted in greater numbers of employees performing work-related duties at home. There is recent case law which confirms that in spite of technological and other changes, the rule relating to deductibility of expenditure on travel between home and work remains a strict one: see Miners v Atkinson \[1995\] STC 58; Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] STC 23. These cases confirm that: • The fact that the home is a place where work is performed (whether or not under a contractual obligation) is not sufficient. The need for the travel must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or circumstances of the employee. • Whether the need for travel arises from the nature of the work is determined objectively; and. • If the work could have been done anywhere but is done at the home from the taxpayer’s personal choice or because of the taxpayer’s personal circumstances travel between the home and another work place is private travel. It was also submitted that in some circumstances where an employee takes a vehicle home for storage purposes (such as where an employee has a private vehicle, lives close to the work premises and the vehicle is not available for private use other than travel between work and home) there may be little actual private benefit to the employee from using the vehicle for travel between home and work. However, liability for FBT and the valuation of the fringe benefit arising from the private use of a motor vehicle does not depend on its actual value to the employee. 36
\[Interpretation statement IS3507 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in February 1999\] AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL—ENERGY COMPANIES CALCULATION FOR SUCCESSORS TO ELECTRIC POWER BOARDS AND MUNICIPAL ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENTS SUMMARY Under the Energy Companies Act 1992 (“the ECA”) and establishment plans approved under that Act, the energy undertakings of: • Electric Power Boards (“EPBs”) were vested in successor energy companies, the successor energy companies issued shares, and the EPBs were dissolved; and • Municipal Electricity Departments (“MEDs”) were transferred to successor energy companies and those successor energy companies issued shares. For the purposes of determining the amount of available subscribed capital (“ASC”) of the successor energy companies, this statement concludes that ASC arises from the issue of shares on the corporatisation of the successor energy companies to the EPBs or MEDs. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. BACKGROUND ASC is generally the amount of capital contributed by shareholders to a company. In certain circumstances a distribution of ASC on the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation of shares, or on the liquidation of a company, is excluded from the definition of “dividends” and may therefore be distributed tax-free to the shareholders. The energy companies were generally corporatised because of the requirements of the ECA. There were a number of ways that new energy companies were formed. This interpretation statement applies to energy companies formed in any of the following ways: • The corporatisation of an MED or MEDs; • The corporatisation of an EPB or EPBs; and • The combined corporatisation of an EPB or EPBs and an MED or MEDs. Because the effect of corporatisation on the level of ASC for shares issued on corporatisation was not clearly identified or specified, doubt has arisen as to whether such shares have given rise to any ASC. This interpretation statement concludes that in respect of the shares issued on corporatisation, ASC arises from their issue. There are three different fact situations discussed in this item regarding the issue of shares by the new energy companies. These are: 1 2 • The recipient of the shares was the transferor of the energy undertaking. That is, a local authority transferred an MED to a new energy company in return for an issue of shares to the local authority; • The recipient of the shares was not the transferor in circumstances where a local authority transferred an MED to a new energy company in return for an issue of shares to third party recipients; and • The recipient of the shares was not the transferor in circumstances where an EPB’s undertaking was vested in a new energy company and an issue of shares was made to third party recipients. LEGISLATION Section OB 1 defines ASC. The relevant portion of the definition states: “Available subscribed capital”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula in respect of all shares of the same class (referred to in this definition as the “specified class”) as the share: a + b – c where – a is – (i) In the case of any company which existed before 1 July 1994, the transitional capital amount; and ... b is the aggregate amount of consideration received by the company on or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time in respect of the issue of all shares in the company of the specified class, including as consideration – (i) In the case of any bonus issue in lieu made on or after 1 July 1994, the amount of money or money’s worth offered as an alternative to such bonus issue; and (ii) In the case of any taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu) made on or after 1 July 1994, the amount of the dividend arising in respect of the taxable bonus issue; and ... but not including – (v) Any amount in respect of a bonus issue other than a bonus issue to which paragraph (i) or paragraph (ii) of this item b applies; or ... c is the aggregate of amounts distributed – ... The “transitional capital amount” (“TCA”) is defined in section OB 1 as: “Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where – j is the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the same class as the share (whenever issued and including the share), not being- (i) An amount paid up by a bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988, except where - (A) The date of the acquisition, redemption, other cancellation, or liquidation falls more than 10 years after the date of the bonus issue; or (B) The amount was paid up by way of application of any amount of qualifying share premium; or 3 (C) The relevant time is the time of liquidation of the company; or (ii) An amount paid up by a bonus issue (other than a taxable bonus issue) made on or after 1 October 1988, except where the amount was paid up by way of application of any amount of qualifying share premium; and k is the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of that class (whenever issued and including the share), not being an amount subsequently (but before 1 July 1994) applied to pay up capital on shares in the company; and l is the number of shares of that class (including the share) ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares of that class (including the share) on issue at the close of 30 June 1994: “Bonus issue” is defined in section OB 1 as: “Bonus issue”, in relation to a company, means – (a) The issue of shares in the company; or (b) The giving of credit in respect of or forgiveness of the whole or part of the amount unpaid on any shares in the company – where the company receives no consideration (other than an election by the shareholder not to receive money or money's worth as an alternative to the issue) for the issue, crediting, or forgiveness, except to the extent to which, in respect of any issue or crediting on or before 20 August 1985, such issue or crediting was excluded from the meaning of the term “bonus issue” in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of section 3 of the Income Tax Act 1976 as those subsections applied from time to time before their repeal by section 31(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988: The former definition of “bonus issue” in section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 read: “Bonus issue” means a capitalisation of any amount available for capitalisation, being a capitalisation by way of – (a) The allotment of fully paid-up or partly paid-up shares in the company; or (b) The giving of credit in respect of the whole or part of the amount unpaid on any shares in the company, – except to the extent to which, in respect of any such capitalisation completed on or before the 20th day of August 1985, such capitalisation was excluded from the meaning of the term “bonus issue” in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section as those subsections applied from time to time before their repeal by section 31 (1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988: “Qualifying share premium” (“QSP”) is defined in section OB 1 as: “Qualifying share premium” in relation to any company, means any premium paid (whether in money or money's worth) by any shareholder or former shareholder to the company in respect of the issue of share capital by the company at a premium, being a premium that – (a) Was credited to a share premium account in the books of the company or, where the company has been taken over by another company or merged with another company, in the books of that other company; and (b) Did not arise with respect to the issue of shares in one company as consideration for the acquisition of shares in any other company, whether by one transaction or a series of transactions: 4 APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION ASC is calculated “in relation to a share in a company ... in respect of all shares ... of the same class as the share”, and is generally a summation of consideration received and paid out in respect of those shares. The calculation therefore requires: 1. the share and class of shares to be determined. 2. the consideration received or paid out in respect of those shares to be ascertained. Determining the “share” and the “class of shares” at issue “Share” is defined in section OB 1 as including “any interest in the capital of a company”. In relation to the calculation of ASC for the energy companies the concern is with the shares in the new energy companies. Because ASC is calculated “in relation to” a share, it is important to determine the point at which the shares in the energy companies are created. Before this point there can be no transactions “in relation to” the share. The shares in the energy companies were issued on corporatisation under sections 32 and 33 of the ECA and under terms contained in an approved establishment plan. These shares were new shares. They were not a modified re-issue of shares in the energy trading operators (“ETOs”). (“ETOs” is a convenient way of describing both EPBs and MEDs.) Therefore, any transactions in relation to shares in the ETOs are not transactions in relation to shares issued on the corporatisation of the energy companies. The calculation of ASC in relation to a share issued on the corporatisation of the energy companies is, therefore, confined to transactions arising on or after a share’s issue under the ECA and the approved establishment plan. Furthermore, a “share” must be a share in “a company”. The energy companies are clearly companies and their predecessor ETOs were also companies: in terms of the broad definition of that term contained in section OB 1 and/or because they were deemed to be companies by operation of section OC 2(5) (section OC 2 was the tax regime for ETOs). However, for the purposes of the definition of ASC the reference is to “a company”. “A company” is clearly a reference to a single company, and this is reinforced by the references to “the company” in relation to each of parts “a”, “b” and “c” of the calculation of ASC. Since “a company” means a single company, the ETOs and their successor energy companies are clearly not “a company”. They are separate companies. Accordingly, in the absence of legislative intervention, the calculation of ASC for the energy companies ordinarily would take no account of any matters relating to the ETOs. However, there are two possible sources of legislative intervention that may be argued to cause the ETOs and their successor energy companies to be treated as a single company when calculating ASC: 1. The amalgamation provisions in the Act. However, these do not apply because there is no “amalgamation” as that term is defined in section OB 1. Consequently, 5 the amalgamation provisions do not affect the analysis outlined above. 2. Sections 54 and 62 of the ECA deem the EPBs and the MEDs respectively to be “the same person” as their successor companies for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. Since the ETOs and their successor energy companies are deemed to be the same person, the ETOs and their successor energy companies constitute “a company” for purposes of the ASC definition. It follows that transactions involving shares in an ETO may be relevant to the calculation of ASC in respect of a share in an energy company, if the shares in the ETO and the shares in the energy company are “shares of the same class ... as the share”. “Shares of the same class ... as the share” The section OB 1 definition of “Shares of the same class” commences: “Shares of the same class”, in sections CF 3 to CF 5, section FC 4, and this section, in relation to shares of a company, means any 2 or more shares of the company where- (a) The shares carry the same right to exercise voting power ... The definition is concerned with any “2 or more shares \[interests in the capital\] of the company”. Its purpose is to designate which shares can be considered together for the purpose of calculating the relevant ASC. Shares “of” the company means that the shares to be compared must be currently existing shares in the company. We are concerned with comparing any shares in the ETOs with the shares in their successor energy companies. Even assuming that the ETOs had shares, the EPBs were deemed to be dissolved by operation of section 47(2)(a) of the ECA. Therefore, shares in the EPBs do not coexist with shares in their successor energy companies, and thus cannot be shares of the same class as shares in the successor energy company for these purposes. The MEDs were entities created by statute and with perpetual existence. They were not owned by anyone and no one had any interest in their capital in the ordinary sense. However, section OC 2(5)(a) did deem the “elected members of the energy trading operator, in their collective capacity as such, ... to hold shares in the energy trading operator”. Therefore, while there may still be deemed shares in the MEDs, those shares cannot be shares of the same class as the shares in their successor energy companies because they do not carry the “same rights”. The deemed shares in the MEDs carry no particular rights, while the shares in the successor energy companies carry very specific rights. None of the rights, if they exist, attached to deemed shares in the MEDs can therefore be called the “same rights” as those attaching to the shares in the energy companies (it is noted that this conclusion applies equally to all ETOs). It follows that the class of shares relevant to the calculation of ASC in relation to a share issued by an energy company on its corporatisation, under the ECA and an approved establishment plan, is confined to shares of the same class issued on or after incorporation. 6 The class of shares having been determined to this extent, it is possible to turn to ascertaining the relevant amounts of “consideration” received or paid out for them. Ascertaining the relevant amounts of TCA and “consideration” received in respect of the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation To ascertain the relevant amounts received or paid out in respect of the shares issued by the energy companies during the corporatisation process, being the “specified class” for purposes of the definition of ASC, it is necessary to apply the definition’s calculation formula “a + b – c”. As this interpretation statement is concerned solely with any amounts arising on the issue of the shares, variable “c” (amounts distributed by the company) may be ignored for present purposes and this leaves variables “a” and “b” to be considered and determined. Variable “a” of the ASC amount Variable “a” of the formula is the TCA or nil, depending on whether the company existed before 1 July 1994. Most of the energy companies were established before 1 July 1994. It is therefore necessary to calculate the TCA for those energy companies that were so established. For those energy companies not established before 1 July 1994, “a” has a nil value. The TCA is calculated according to the formula “j + k x m” l Variable “j” is the aggregate of capital paid up before 1 July 1994. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the shares in the energy companies were “paid up” when they were issued. “Paid up” and “capital paid up” are not defined in the Act. However, the courts have considered the meaning of “fully paid up” in the context of shares. In Bloomenthal v Ford \[1897\] AC 156; \[1895-9\] All ER Rep 1845 (HL) Lord Halsbury LC stated (at page 1849 of the All ER Rep report): People who know anything about limited liability companies know that there is a certain liability upon their shares, and that from time to time the company calls up such and such a proportion of the money due upon those shares, and I should have thought that without being a lawyer, or discussing questions which have been raised in the courts, a person would ordinarily understand that fully paid-up shares mean shares upon which the whole amount that could be called had been called up. That is the meaning of “fully paid-up shares”, and in strictness it is the only meaning. The question is whether consideration was given, in money or money’s worth, for the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation such that they are “paid up”. Share recipient was the transferor of the ETO: Local authority transfer of an MED in return for shares issued to the local authority In some cases the recipients of the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation gave “money or money’s worth” for those shares. In particular, for some local authority transferors of MEDs to new energy companies, the transfer was 7 carried out pursuant to an agreement for sale and purchase, by which the transferor agreed to sell the ETO to the new energy company in consideration for an issue of shares to that transferor. In such cases the consideration given (the ETO) led to the issue of shares, and meant that the new company had an amount of paid up capital for the purposes of the definition of TCA. Share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO: EPB’s undertaking being vested in the new energy company, and shares being issued to third parties In other circumstances the recipients of the shares did not themselves give money or money’s worth for the issue of shares to them, but consideration was still given for the shares by the transferor of the ETO. There is no requirement in the definitions of ASC or TCA that consideration for the shares be given by the recipient. If a local authority transferred an ETO to an energy company and the shares issued by the energy company were received by third parties, and when an EPB transferred an ETO to an energy company and the shares issued by the energy company were received by third parties, there is still consideration provided to the new energy company sufficient to cause capital to be “paid up” for the purposes of the ASC and TCA definitions. This is discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs. Sections 18, 22, 47, 48 and 56 of the ECA establish that the ETO transferred to the new energy company was consideration for the shares consequently issued by that particular company. Section 18 dealt with establishment plans. Section 18(2) set out the required details to be included in an establishment plan. Amongst other things, such an establishment plan had to: • Identify with reasonable precision the energy undertaking that was to be vested; • Value that energy undertaking; • Contain a share allocation plan; • Indicate whether or not any equity securities should be issued by the relevant energy company to any person consequent upon the vesting in the company of the relevant energy undertaking. Section 22 of the ECA provided for the formation of a share allocation plan. Under section 22(1), the establishment plan should set out the recommendations as to the persons to whom the voting equity securities in the relevant energy company should be allocated consequent upon the vesting in that company of the relevant energy undertaking. In both these sections of the ECA the use of the words consequent upon demonstrates that the issue of shares results from the receipt of the energy undertaking. The ordinary meaning of “consequent” supports this conclusion. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines “consequent” as • Consequence; • Following as an effect or result; • Following as a logical conclusion; and • The second part of a conditional proposition. 8 The word “consequence” is defined by the same dictionary to mean: • A thing or circumstance which follows as an effect or result from something preceding; • The action, or condition of so following; the relation of a result to its antecedent. Therefore, the use of the word “consequent” supports the conclusion that the issue of shares followed from, and as a result of, the vesting of the EPB’s undertaking in the new energy company. That is, the statute provided that the vesting was the consideration for the issue of shares. Sections 47 and 48 of the ECA provided certain rules for the transfer of EPBs to successor energy companies. Section 47(1) provided that on a date appointed by the Governor General by Order in Council, the undertaking of the EPB named in the Order was to vest in the EPB’s successor company and all of the shares held by that EPB in the EPB’s successor should vest in such persons as were specified in the Order, which should give effect to the provisions of the establishment plan. Under section 48(1), every Order in Council made under section 47(1) would specify the kind, number, nominal value, and terms of any equity securities that were to be issued by the successor company consequent upon the vesting in it of the undertaking of the Board and the names of the persons to whom those equity securities were to be issued. Again, both sections link the undertaking being vested in the new energy company and the shares being issued to those persons specified in the establishment plan and share allocation plan. Share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO: Local authority transfer of a MED to a new energy company in return for shares being issued to third parties Even for the transfer of MEDs to new energy companies, which do not have the same detailed rules as for EPBs, section 56 of the ECA still provided a link between the transfer of the undertaking and the issue of shares when those shares were issued to a third party. Under section 56(1), the local authority would transfer its energy undertaking no later than 1 April 1993 to one or more energy companies. Under section 56(2), this transfer must be pursuant to an approved establishment plan. An approved establishment plan had to include a share allocation plan. The share allocation plan was to explain who was going to receive shares after the energy undertaking was transferred to the new energy company. In this context section 18(2)(b), that required a valuation of the energy undertaking prior to transfer, is relevant. If there was no connection between the transfer of the undertaking and the issue of shares, it is difficult to see why any valuation would be necessary. However, if one considers that the transfer of the undertaking led to the issue of shares pursuant to a share allocation plan, then the use of a valuation becomes very relevant. The value of the undertaking would set the value of the share capital, and the amount of consideration provided for shares issued to subscribers, and would 9 determine how many shares of a particular nominal value are to be issued, or whether shares are issued at a premium. Summary of situations where the share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO The sections discussed above mean that the transfer of an energy undertaking to a new energy company leads to the issue of the shares pursuant to the share allocation plan. That is, the transfer of the undertaking is consideration for the shares, sufficient to mean that paid up capital arises on the transfer. Those energy undertakings that were transferred were transferred as consideration for the issue of the shares to the subscribers. In respect of EPBs this is also brought out under section 48(3)(a) which provides that the company shall, on the date specified in the Order in Council that vests the undertaking in the new company, issue to the person specified in the Order in that behalf, and as fully paid up, the shares specified. Although the use of the word “as” could suggest that the shares are not really paid up, in this context this is not the appropriate interpretation. That is, in the interpretation of the ECA, the word “as” does not mean “as if something was that which it was not”, which is the way the word “as” was interpreted in the statute in issue in Styles v Treasurer of Middle Temple (1899) 4 TC 123; 68 LJQB 1046 (CA). If this had been the intention of Parliament, it could have used the words “as if they were”. Examples of recent legislation using such a formulation include section 42(3) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (“as if it were a caveat”) and section 176(4) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (“as if it were a collective employment contract”). Although the word “as” has a number of meanings (see The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary for examples), in this situation it most probably means “in the manner that” or “in the way that”. It may be that the word is even superfluous and should be interpreted as having no meaning other than to make the legislation read better. Section 48(3)(a) envisages that the shares issued to the subscribers are fully paid up, the consideration for paying up the shares being the provision of the energy undertaking. Section 48(1)’s use of the word “consequent” underlines the point. In the context of shares issued under the Companies Act 1955 (which had a par value) and taken together with the requirement in an establishment plan to value the undertaking, the requirement that shares be issued as fully paid up means that at the very least the par value of the shares issued must equal the value of the undertaking. The valuation sets the consideration given by the EPB to the new energy company for the paying up and issue of the shares. It would be possible for the value of the undertaking to exceed the par value of the shares issued. In such a case the shares would be being issued at a premium. However, it is clearly envisaged in the Act that the amount of share capital issued will not be greater than the value of the undertaking. In those circumstances the shares would only be partly paid up, and shareholders would potentially be liable to further calls by the company. Turning to variable “k” of the TCA, the exclusion cannot apply because any capital raised on the incorporation of the energy companies would be the only capital 10 available at the time the original shares in the energy companies were issued. That capital could not have been “subsequently applied” at that time, and this interpretation statement is only concerned with ASC arising from the initial issue of shares by the energy companies on their corporatisation. The question is, therefore, whether any QSP was paid to the energy companies before 1 July 1994 in respect of their issues of shares on corporatisation. The definition of QSP refers to any “premium paid ... in respect of the issue of share capital ... at a premium”. Some energy company share issues were, according to the terms of issue, made at a premium. Accordingly, where such an issue was made at a premium there will be an amount for item “k” of TCA. Conclusions in relation to the TCA The better view is that ETOs were provided as consideration for the issue of the shares on the basis of the scheme of the ECA, the Vesting Orders, and for local authorities and MEDs the terms of the relevant Agreements for Sale and Purchase. This means that the shares issued by energy companies established before 1 July 1994 on their corporatisation were issued “paid up”, and in some circumstances a premium was “paid” in respect of them. As a result, a TCA arises from the initial issues of shares by energy companies established before 1 July 1994. Variable “b” of the ASC amount for those energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 This interpretation statement is only concerned with ASC arising in relation to the initial issues of shares by the energy companies. Therefore, this part of the discussion is only relevant to initial issues of energy company shares made on corporatisation on or after 1 July 1994. Variable “b” is concerned with the aggregate “consideration” received for shares of the specified class. “Consideration” is not defined for this purpose and thus it is necessary to consider the common law meaning. Lord Dunedin said of consideration in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd \[1915\] AC 847 at 855: I am content to adopt from a work of Sir Frederick Pollock ... the following words as to consideration: “An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.” The common law meaning of “consideration” may be seen as having a contract law focus and be referring only to the consideration passing between contracting parties. This would not cover all the circumstances surrounding the creation of the energy companies, where some shareholders were not contracting parties with the energy companies but were gratuitous recipients of shares. However, there is case law that suggests that consideration can have a wider meaning where the context so requires, such that the focus is on the receipt of consideration by the energy company, rather than on the provision of consideration by shareholders; Central and District Properties Ltd v IRC \[1966\] 2 All ER 433(HL) and Shop and Store Developments Ltd v IRC \[1967\] 1 All ER 42; \[1966\] TR 357 (HL). This is consistent with variable “b” which refers to “consideration received” by the company, the focus being on the company’s receipt of consideration not the shareholders’ provision of consideration. 11 The context surrounding the creation of the energy companies (discussed above in respect of variable “a”) also supports a wider interpretation of “consideration” in variable “b” consistent with this case law. It is then a factual question whether consideration is received as the price for shares and, as with ascertaining whether shares are paid up, this is generally to be determined from the terms on which the shares were issued. Apart from reflecting differences of terminology arising from the enactment of the Companies Act 1993, the terms of issue of the initial share issues made by energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 were no different from those for energy companies established before that date. Accordingly, for the same reasons as discussed above for pre-1 July 1994 energy companies, consideration was provided either by the share recipients or by third parties, and hence the energy companies did receive consideration for the issue of shares. It follows that the initial share issues made by energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 were issued for consideration, giving rise to an amount for item “b” of ASC. Bonus issues Amounts in respect of bonus issues are generally excluded from variables “a” (TCA) and “b” of ASC. “Bonus issue” is defined in section OB 1, and before that it was defined in section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Whichever definition is applied to energy companies established before 1 July 1994, the issue of shares on corporatisation of those companies did not amount to bonus issues. In terms of the Income Tax Act 1976 definition, there is no bonus issue because there were no capitalisations of amounts available for capitalisation. As a new company, there were no such amounts available (for example, there were no retained earnings or capital revaluation reserves to capitalise). In terms of the section OB 1 definition, there is no bonus issue because the energy companies received consideration for the issue of shares, as discussed earlier in this statement. For post 1 July 1994 energy companies, the section OB 1 definition does not apply because, as discussed above, the energy companies received consideration for the issue of shares. CONCLUSIONS Consideration was provided to energy companies for the issue of shares in those companies, sufficient to mean there was “capital paid up” or “consideration received” for the purposes of the ASC definition. Accordingly, items “a” or “b” of the ASC definition are positive amounts reflecting the value of the energy undertaking transferred to, or vested in, the new energy companies. 12 For a local authority transferor of an MED to a new energy company, where that local authority was also the recipient of the shares in the new energy company, the MED was clearly given as consideration for the issue of the shares. For a local authority transferor of an MED to a new energy company, where third parties were the recipients of the shares in the new energy company, the MED was given as the consideration for the issue of the shares. Although the point is not so clear as in the case where the MED was the recipient of the shares, the terms of the relevant provisions of the ECA support this conclusion. If an EPB’s undertaking was vested in a new energy company, where third parties were the recipients of the shares in the new energy company, the vesting of the undertaking was consideration for the issue of the shares. Although the point is not as clear as transfers involving MEDs, the terms of the relevant provisions of the ECA support this conclusion. In no case did the share issues amount to bonus issues.
\[Interpretation statement IS3533 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in June 1998\] MEANING OF “INCURRED”—THE PRIVY COUNCIL DECISION IN THE MITSUBISHI CASE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. SUMMARY This interpretation statement considers the Privy Council decision Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (“Mitsubishi”). That case dealt with the timing of deductions and, in particular, the meaning of “incurred” (as it now appears in section BD 2(1)(b)) in the context of warranty expenditure. The Privy Council held that the taxpayer in the case incurred future estimated warranty expenditure in the year in which it sold the warranted vehicles and, as a consequence, was entitled to take a deduction for that estimated expenditure in that income year. This statement sets out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the meaning of “incurred” in the light of Mitsubishi. It also considers: • what is required in terms of a reasonable estimation of future estimated expenditure; • how to account for estimated liabilities, including in the first year that an estimated basis is adopted; and • the application of section EF 1. In this regard, this statement reaches the following conclusions: • The Mitsubishi decision applies to express warranties of the type considered in the case. It also applies to warranties and guarantees of a similar nature implied under statute. It is acknowledged that the decision has potentially widened the meaning of “incurred”. In some situations this will mean that taxpayers are able to claim deductions in anticipation of expenditure, where previously a deduction could be claimed only after an obligation to pay a particular sum had arisen. However, it will always be necessary to identify the event which gives rise to the liability, and to determine whether that event has occurred prior to year-end. • In addition, to rely on Mitsubishi taxpayers must be able to make a reasonable estimation of the relevant future expenditure. To the extent that it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation, the expenditure has not been incurred in that income year. The authorities indicate that a rigorous standard, as regards the provision of detailed information and calculation methods to support claims for deductions based on estimations, is required. To this end, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers who seek to rely on the Mitsubishi decision to substantiate claims made on the basis of estimated future expenditure in the light of their particular circumstances. 1 2 • The approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to expenditure which has been “incurred but not reported” (IBNR) reporting is accepted as a workable treatment for accounting for estimated future expenditure for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. In changing to such a method, it is acceptable to take a deduction in the first year of adjustment of all estimated future expenditure for which a deduction is available on the basis of the reasoning in Mitsubishi. In this regard, the Commissioner will exercise his discretion under section EC 1(1) and EC 1(3) to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. In some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate (either upwards or downwards) estimated claims relating to previous income years. In both cases, the adjustment should be made in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction. • Inland Revenue accepts that section EF 1 does not apply to require the adding back of warranty expenditure in the same or similar factual situations to those which arose in Mitsubishi. It is considered to be unclear whether the words of section EF 1 are wide enough to apply to expenditure incurred by a warrantor in the same or similar circumstances to those which arose in the case. Given such ambiguity it is necessary to look to the legislative context and background to the enactment of the provision, as considered by the courts. Taking into account such matters, and in particular the recent Court of Appeal judgment in Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577, it is considered that the better view is that the section is aimed at achieving matching of the timing of deductions with the income flowing from that expenditure, and should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with that aim. To apply section EF 1 to facts analogous to those arising in Mitsubishi would result in a taxation treatment that differs from matching in those terms. BACKGROUND Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (“MMNZ”) assembled new motor vehicles and sold them through franchised dealers. The dealers in turn sold those motor vehicles under warranty to retail customers. The warranty provided against defects appearing in the material or workmanship of the vehicle during the warranty period. Under the terms of their dealership franchise, MMNZ reimbursed dealers for expenditure incurred by dealers in meeting warranty claims. The issue before the courts was whether, in computing its profits or gains, MMNZ could deduct its anticipated liabilities under warranties which remained unexpired at the end of the income year, for vehicles sold during that income year. The High Court found in favour of the taxpayer: Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,163. Doogue J held that the taxpayer was definitively committed to the warranty expenditure as at the time of sale and delivery of the vehicles. The Court of Appeal also found for the taxpayer, but on a different basis: CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,099. The Court considered that MMNZ was not definitively committed to warranty expenditure because the 3 liability was contingent on a defect manifesting itself within the warranty period. However, the Court reached a similar result by concluding that part of the sale price represented unearned income; income that was not derived until performance of the warranty was completed or discharged. The Commissioner appealed from that decision to the Privy Council. The Privy Council dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal, finding for the taxpayer on the question of deductibility on the basis that the taxpayer was definitively committed to the future warranty expenditure. Inland Revenue released an issues paper, Implications of the Mitsubishi Decision on 10 December 1996 (Issues Paper No 2: reference 3533) (“the issues paper”). The submissions received in response to that paper have been fully considered in the formulation of this interpretation statement. In December 1997 the Court of Appeal heard the case of Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR. That decision is discussed below in relation to the issue of the application of section EF 1 to the deductibility of warranty expenditure. LEGISLATION Section BD 2(1) determines what is meant by an allowable deduction. It states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer ... (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer's gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer's gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). (Emphasis added) Section BD 4 allocates allowable deductions to particular income years. It states: (1) A taxpayer or the Commissioner must allocate each allowable deduction to an income year in accordance with this section. (2) If an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the deduction must be allocated to an income year in accordance with that regime. (3) An allowable deduction that is not subject to a timing regime must be allocated to the income year in which the allowable deduction is incurred. (4) If an expenditure or loss gives rise to more than one allowable deduction, the allowable deductions may be allocated to income years to the extent that their total does not exceed the amount of that expenditure or loss. (Emphasis added) 4 Section EC 1 provides a mechanism by which the Commissioner may make adjustments in one income year for incorrect accounting practice in previous years. It states: (1) This section applies if in respect of an income year (that income year being referred to in this section as the "year of adjustment") the Commissioner is satisfied that the gross income or allowable deductions of a person in respect of a business for any income year or income years (that income year or those income years being referred to in this section as the "preceding period") preceding the year of adjustment have been understated or overstated by reason of the whole or any part of that gross income or those allowable deductions having been calculated - (a) By reference to cash receipts or outgoings and without taking into account amounts owing to or by the taxpayer at the beginning or end of any income year in the preceding period; or (b) By taking into account provisions or reserves which are not allowed as deductions; or (c) Without taking into account provisions or reserves which are allowed as deductions; or (d) By including as gross income for an income year in the preceding period an incorrect proportion of any amount received by the taxpayer in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the income year. (2) The Commissioner may, with respect to a taxpayer to whom this section applies and to a year of adjustment, deem the following amounts to be gross income derived by the taxpayer in that year - (a) Where subsection (1)(a) applies, the total of the amounts owing to the taxpayer at the end of the preceding period; and (b) The total amount of any provisions or reserves to which subsection (1)(b) refers; and (c) The total of any amounts to which paragraph (d) refers that are in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the preceding period and that had not been included in annual gross income for any income year in the preceding period. (3) The Commissioner may, with respect to a taxpayer to whom this section applies and to a year of adjustment, deem the following amounts to be allowable deductions incurred by the taxpayer in that year - (a) Where subsection (1)(a) applies, the total of the amounts owed by the taxpayer at the end of the preceding period; and (b) The total amount of any provisions or reserves to which subsection (1)(c) refers; and (c) The total of any amounts to which subsection (1)(d) refers that are in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the preceding period and that had been incorrectly included in annual gross income for any income year in the preceding period. ... Section EF 1 deals with “accrual expenditure”. It provides a “qualification” to the general position under the Act that outgoings relating to the gaining or production of assessable income are deductible when incurred. Although a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred, under section EF 1 assessable income is deemed to include the amount of the unexpired portion of any “accrual expenditure” that relates to future income years. It states: 5 (1) Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure - (a) That expenditure is allowed as a deduction when it is incurred in accordance with this Act; and (b) The unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year shall be included in the gross income of the person for that income year and shall be allowed as a deduction in the following income year. (2) (repealed) ... (5) The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be - (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income: (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c) Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. (5A) For the purposes of this section, any payment to which section CB 12(1) applies is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the payer as payment for services performed in the year or years in which the recipient of the payment is expected to incur the expenditure to which the payment relates. ... (7) In this section - “Goods” means all real or personal property; but does not include choses in action or money: “Services” means anything which is not goods or money or a chose in action. ... “Accrual expenditure” is defined in section OB 1: “Accrual expenditure”, in sections EF 1 and FE 4, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is deductible under this Act, or was deductible under the Income Act 1976, other than expenditure incurred - (a) In the purchase of trading stock; or (b) In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c) In respect of a specified lease, or a lease to which section EO 2 applies; or (d) Under a binding contract entered into before 8.30 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986: 6 PRIVY COUNCIL DECISION Facts As indicated in the “Background” section, the case involved the timing of the deductibility of warranty expenditure. The taxpayer assembled new motor vehicles and sold them under warranty through franchised dealers. The warranty provided against defects appearing in the material or workmanship of the vehicle during the warranty period. The issue before the courts was whether, in computing its profits or gains, the taxpayer could deduct its anticipated liabilities under warranties which remained unexpired at the end of the income year, for vehicles sold during that income year. Decision The Privy Council dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal, finding for the taxpayer on the question of deductibility on the basis that the taxpayer was definitively committed to the future warranty expenditure. The Privy Council was satisfied that the evidence showed that it was in accordance with proper accounting treatment for the taxpayer to match the reasonable estimation of the cost of meeting warranty claims against the corresponding income earned from vehicle sales in the relevant income year. Their Lordships noted that the evidence before the High Court satisfied Doogue J that a reasonable estimation could be placed upon the anticipated liabilities. The Privy Council considered that the New Zealand courts have “followed Australian authorities” on the meaning of “incurred”. “Incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer must have either paid or become “definitively committed” to the expenditure before a deduction will be available. As a summary of the test in the Australian and New Zealand context, their Lordships referred to the four propositions put forward by Henry J in AM Bisley & Co Ltd v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at 5,096, i.e.: • a particular expenditure is incurred for tax purposes in any income year if it constitutes an existing obligation which arose in the course of that year; • where the expenditure arises under a written deed or agreement, determining whether or not it is an existing obligation is a question of construction of that deed or agreement; • the fact that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; • the fact that the expenditure is a defeasible liability does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. The Privy Council made two specific observations about the test. First, that the test focuses on particular items of expenditure. Their Lordships noted that this is a different approach from that usually adopted for accounting purposes. To be 7 deductible, each item must satisfy the test of being an “existing obligation”. There is no basis for taking an aggregate approach as is acceptable for accounting purposes. Secondly, that the test involves characterising the nature of the legal relationship between the taxpayer and the person to whom the obligation is owed. It was noted that “on one view” this requires, as a matter of construction, deciding whether the obligation is “contingent”, or, alternatively, “vested, but defeasible”. The Privy Council described this as being a “nice distinction” and noted that it is one which can easily become a matter of language rather than substance and lead to conflicting results. The Privy Council considered that these two specific features of the meaning of “incurred” demonstrate that the test is a jurisprudential rather than a commercial test. The Privy Council noted that this is an “unusual approach to a taxing statute”, and one which can lead to tensions if formal legal doctrine is wholly divorced from commercial reality. In their Lordships’ view this was illustrated to some extent by the Australian decisions in this area. The Privy Council considered that the “incurred” test is primarily one of construction. It was therefore necessary to consider the words of the warranty. The warranty provided: 1. The vendor of the new vehicle described herein warrants to the original purchaser and subsequent owners that if in normal use and service during the relevant warranty period as provided below any defect appears in the material or workmanship of any part of the vehicle not otherwise warranted, and as soon as reasonably possible within 21 days of becoming aware of the defect, the purchaser returns the vehicle to the vendor’s premises and notifies the vendor of the defect, the vendor will at the vendor’s cost either (a) supply and fit, or (b) repair any such part acknowledged by the vendor to be defective. 2. This warranty shall not apply if the vehicle has been repaired or altered in any way other than by the vendor or in any service workshop not authorised by the vendor, or if the vehicle has been subjected to misuse neglect or accident, or if it has been loaded beyond manufacturer's loading capacity or operated in such a way that is not recommended by the manufacturer. 3. The vendor shall not be liable for any loss or any consequential loss damage or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the defect. 4. This warranty is in lieu of all warranties terms conditions representations expressed or implied whether by common law or statute. 5. The new vehicle warranty period shall be 12 calendar months after delivery of the vehicle to the original purchaser or until the vehicle shall have run 20,000 km whichever first occurs. However, their Lordships then went on to say that in their view the form of the warranty was not the final consideration. It was also necessary to look to two other principles, i.e.: • the fact that the jurisprudential approach to the meaning of “incurred” does not rule out statistical estimation of facts which have happened, but are not yet known to the taxpayer. (The Privy Council saw this as being distinct from treating an aggregate of contingent liabilities as a statistical certainty, which their Lordships acknowledged is not permitted under the jurisprudential approach.); and 8 • whether, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. The Privy Council looked to a body of case law dealing with the insurance industry. In particular, the Australian decision in RACV Insurance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1974) 4 ATR 610. In that case, an insurance company was allowed to make a deduction from its premiums of an estimated sum to represent its IBNR liabilities. In law the liabilities were not contingent because they had occurred within the relevant year of account. This was the case even though the insurance company did not know about them. Applying the approach taken in the insurance cases to the facts in Mitsubishi, the Privy Council then concluded (at page 12,355): The relevance of this principle is that estimation on the basis of statistical experience can be used to conclude that 63% or thereabouts of the vehicles sold by MMNZ in fact had defects which would manifest themselves within the warranty period of twelve months or 20,000 km. The finding of Doogue J on the evidence was that “63% or thereabouts of all vehicles sold by \[MMNZ\] contain defects”. Since this information could only be derived from MMNZ’s experience of warranty claims, their Lordships understand the finding to mean that this was the level of defects notified to dealers in accordance with the terms of the warranty. Counsel for the Commissioner sought to refute this conclusion by arguing that the 63% of reported defects might include some defects which were not present at the time of sale, but manifested themselves within the warranty period. If this were correct, then using past warranty claims information to estimate the liability for defects which had happened at year-end would not be reliable, because the estimate would include both types of defect. The Privy Council rejected this argument. Counsel was unable to think of any examples of defects which were not present at the time of sale. The Privy Council doubted that a defect in the material or workmanship of the vehicle would appear within 12 months of sale, unless it were present, even if hidden, when the vehicle left the assembly plant. It was therefore legitimate to have regard to the evidence that established that 63% of the vehicles would in fact have had defects. Although, the Privy Council reconfirmed the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the warranty, i.e. that it requires manifestation and notification to trigger liability, the Privy Council considered that the Australian cases dealing with the meaning of incurred show that the resolution of this issue does not simply depend on whether “future events which may determine liability are expressed in the language of contingency or defeasance”. This may give rise to merely “theoretical distinctions”. Their Lordships restated this aspect of the test in the following terms (at page 12,355): ...whether, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. The Privy Council considered whether there was a contingent, or merely a theoretical, liability in the case of warranty claims in relation to vehicles sold by the taxpayer, given that the warranty required notification. The Privy Council concluded that there would be a contingent liability if one looked at all the vehicles in question, but not if one only concentrated on the 63% of vehicles which were estimated to have defects. In the case of those vehicles, the Privy Council considered that the existence of such defects “was a matter of existing fact, not future contingency”; it being only a theoretical contingency that the owners would be content not to make a claim. The 9 Privy Council considered (at page 12,356) that owners of defective vehicles would not make a claim only in the most trivial of cases and that this contingency: ...would not make any material difference to the accuracy of the estimated amount of expenditure to which the taxpayer could be said, as a matter of law, to be definitively committed. On the basis of this analysis the Privy Council held that the estimated warranty costs were deductible at the time of sale. Conclusions It is possible to draw the following conclusions from the Privy Council’s analysis and application of the meaning of “incurred”: • Where the expenditure arises under an agreement then it is fundamental to analyse the nature of the obligation as set out in that agreement. However, this is only a first step. • Where the event which gives rise to the liability has already happened as at year- end, but is just not known to the taxpayer, then it is permissible to adopt a reasonable estimate to determine the extent of that liability. That reasonable estimate may be based on past expenditure for a number of liabilities of a similar kind. • In determining whether a liability is contingent or vested, but defeasible, theoretical contingencies are to be ignored. The question must be viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances and not just on the terms of the agreement which gave rise to the liability (which might appear to include a contingency, but which in practice is not in any practical sense likely to impede liability). In circumstances such as those in the case, the failure to notify once manifestation had occurred was simply a theoretical contingency, unlikely to happen in practice. APPLICATION The meaning of “incurred” following the decision The Mitsubishi decision provides a new statement of the existing law on the meaning of “incurred”. The existing law included cases in the insurance arena which permitted deductions for liabilities which had occurred, but were unknown and/or uncertain as to quantum at year-end. The Privy Council decision applies that line of cases to a new fact situation, i.e. warranty expenditure to remedy inherent defects. In evaluating how Mitsubishi restates the meaning of “incurred”, it is useful to “measure” the decision against the four propositions laid down in Bisley (referred to by the Privy Council and set out above): • a particular expenditure is incurred for tax purposes in any income year if it constitutes an existing obligation which arose in the course of that year; 10 The Mitsubishi decision suggests that whenever an event giving rise to a liability can be said to have occurred within the relevant period, and the number of such events and cost of meeting the aggregate liability can be reasonably estimated, then that cost is deductible. The requirement that there be a reasonable estimation can be on the basis of an aggregate, rather than a single, assessment of liability. The Privy Council reached this position notwithstanding that it acknowledged (at page 12,353) that to date the word “incurred” (now in section BD 2(1)(b)) had been interpreted as referring to particular items of expenditure “rather than the aggregate sums which would concern a businessman drawing up his accounts”. In their Lordships’ view the insurance cases give support to this “aggregated approach”. • where the expenditure arises under a written deed or agreement, determining whether or not it is an existing obligation is a question of construction of that deed or agreement; It is still vital to look to the terms of the arrangement which give rise to the liability so as to establish what is the event that gives rise to liability, and at what point in time an existing obligation to fulfil that liability arises. However, that is not the end of the matter. First, it is necessary to consider whether this is a situation where the liability has arisen, but is just not known, and can be reasonably estimated. And, secondly, whether there are any aspects, given all the surrounding circumstances, which make the liability to pay something less than an existing legal obligation. • the fact that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; This proposition was not discussed directly in the case. This is because the case was not concerned with the deductibility of specific liabilities as at year-end. However, implicitly the decision acknowledges that expenditure may be incurred even if the obligation to pay, i.e. a pecuniary liability, necessarily does not arise until some future date. • the fact that the expenditure is a defeasible liability does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; The Privy Council criticised the language used to date to express this aspect of the test. On one interpretation, the decision has replaced the “contingent, versus vested, but defeasible” dichotomy with a new test as to “defeasibility”, i.e. whether, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. In applying this test it is necessary to disregard merely theoretical contingencies. It is also possible in some cases to look beyond any legally binding arrangements which are pertinent to the creation of the liability, e.g. notice requirements. Warranties Mitsubishi provides authority for the claiming of reasonable estimates for future warranty costs where motor vehicles are sold under a warranty against inherent 11 defects. The decision will apply to other motor vehicle industry manufacturers and assemblers that provide warranties of the same, or similar, type to that which featured in the case. The decision will generally also apply to other manufacturing, distributing, wholesaling, and retailing taxpayers who provide warranties to remedy inherent defects in new goods sold, e.g. computer manufacturers and distributors. However, in every case it will be necessary to show that anticipated future warranty expenditure relates to defects present at the time of sale. If a warranty provides cover on a different basis, for example “to keep goods in good working order”, it may be that the liability under the warranty does not arise at the time of sale. The liability may relate to contingent events that occur after the time of sale, e.g. the manner in which the goods are used by the customer. In every case, in accordance with the Privy Council decision, it will also be necessary to satisfy Inland Revenue that a reasonable estimate of future costs supports the deduction sought. The decision will only apply to taxpayers who are able to provide sophisticated, reliable information, being those taxpayers who have maintained records for a statistically relevant period, in the light of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. Given this standard, the amount deducted for tax purposes may vary from the reserve adopted for financial accounting purposes. Free servicing Many taxpayers who offer warranties to customers for new goods sold also offer free servicing for a defined period, or at a set time or times, from the date of sale, e.g. a motor vehicle warranty may include one free service after 10,000 kilometres. A free service may be offered on a general basis or may involve a defined set of services, e.g. oil check, wheel alignment, etc. It is generally accepted that on the basis of Mitsubishi, taxpayers offering free servicing of this nature will be able to take a deduction for future free servicing costs in the year of sale. This is because the obligation to provide the free service arises at the time of sale. Considering all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future has arisen at the time of sale. In most cases it will not be reasonable to argue that the customer may not take up the offer, or not fulfil the terms of the offer, e.g. not drive the requisite distance. In most cases, particularly where the period in which the free service must be taken up is of a relatively short duration, it is only a theoretical contingency that customers will not take advantage of the free service. Inland Revenue accepts that this is analogous to the Privy Council’s finding that it was only a theoretical contingency, limited to customers with trivial defects, that customers with defective vehicles would not seek remedial work under the warranty. However, a deduction at the time of sale will only be available if the taxpayer is able to substantiate the amount sought with reference to accurate servicing data, including the average cost of providing such a service (e.g. labour and costs). (In Mitsubishi the permitted deduction was based on a reasonable estimate calculated with reference to actual past claims.) 12 The offer of a free service on fixed terms (i.e. to provide a pre-determined number of services or replacement parts) is to be distinguished from a service contract. A service contract is usually an agreement whereby the vendor agrees to provide services as required by the customer over a period of time, e.g. 12 months from the date of sale. A service contract will generally not relate only to a pre-determined number of services, but will cover all repairs necessary during the contract period. Accordingly, at the time of sale it is uncertain whether the vendor will incur expenses under the service contract. This will depend in part on the manner in which the goods are used by the customer, and events subsequent to the entering into of the service contract. Sometimes the distinction between warranties, free servicing arrangements, and service contracts may be difficult to discern. A consideration of the terms of particular arrangements will always be necessary to determine whether a deduction for anticipated expenditure is available at the time of sale. In some cases it may be appropriate to apportion between anticipated expenses relating to inherent defects and free servicing arrangements, and other types of expenditure. Implied warranties Inland Revenue accepts that Mitsubishi also applies to taxpayers who provide products subject to statutorily implied guarantees as to fitness, in so far as those guarantees relate to remedies for inherent defects present at the time of sale, e.g. those imposed under the Sale of Goods Act 1908, the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, and the Motor Vehicle Dealers Act 1975. Provided taxpayers are able to give reasonable estimates of the level of claims made for particular products under the applicable legislation, and the claims relate to defects which were in existence at the time of sale, it is accepted that the reasoning in the Mitsubishi decision will generally apply. Inland Revenue anticipates that not all taxpayers who meet claims made under statutorily implied conditions will necessarily have sufficient historical and detailed statistical information to support the taking of a deduction. However, it is acknowledged that, in time, taxpayers may introduce recording systems to permit them to rely on the decision in the future. Some taxpayers who provide a wide range of products, and/or an ever-changing selection of products, may never be able to rely on the decision. This is because it will be impossible to establish that a certain consistent level of warranty claims is made in relation to any particular product line. Inland Revenue considers that Mitsubishi only applies in cases where the estimated level of warranty costs can be attributed to particular items based on their individual sales records. In other cases it will generally not be possible to provide a reasonable estimate of future liability. In such cases it will not be sufficient to produce statistics based on total sales compared with claims made. Fair Trading Act 1986 In this context a further issue arises as to whether similar principles might apply to obligations imposed under the Fair Trading Act 1986. 13 Broadly, the Fair Trading Act prohibits misleading and deceptive conduct by suppliers of goods and services to consumers. For example, it prohibits the making of false representations in relation to the supply of goods and services, and prohibits a range of specific practices, e.g. offering goods and services where there is no intention of supplying them, pyramid selling schemes, importing goods bearing false trade descriptions or trade marks. The Act also provides for the prescribing of consumer information standards requiring disclosure of information relating to such matters as the kind, grade, quantity, origin, performance, care, use, etc., of goods and services. Generally speaking, contravening any of the provisions of the Act is an offence and gives rise to either civil liability alone (most notably in the case of misleading or deceptive conduct), or both civil and criminal liability. The Act extends rights to the public to take action against suppliers or manufacturers. A court is empowered to make a range of orders in such cases, including ordering compensation or the refunding of money. In this way, the focus of the Fair Trading Act is essentially on the prevention of wilful acts of deception. Although on one level it might be possible to say that a supplier or manufacturer from time to time supplies goods or services which are inherently in contravention of the Act, it would seem somewhat unusual for a supplier or manufacturer to be in a position where its past conduct was such that it could reliably estimate what its future liability would be from year to year. This seems contrary to the aim of the fair trading legislation which is to deter future offending by imposing penalties. It also ignores the fact that it would presumably be very difficult to estimate the level of claim, even if the frequency of offending could be reliably estimated. Therefore, intrinsically, obligations arising under the Fair Trading Act do not seem to be analogous to obligations arising under warranties against inherent defects, whether contractual or implied. In the case of a warranty against inherent defects, the underlying rationale is that the manufacturer or supplier strives to sell a defect-free product, rather than deliberately or recklessly selling defective items subject to a warranty. In summary, subject in every case to being able to make a reasonable estimation of future liabilities, Inland Revenue accepts that taxpayers who provide products subject to statutorily implied guarantees as to fitness, in so far as those guarantees relate to remedies for inherent defects present at the time of sale, may rely on Mitsubishi. However, the reasoning in Mitsubishi will not apply to obligations imposed under the Fair Trading Act. Service providers A further issue in this context is whether the reasoning in Mitsubishi may extend to taxpayers who provide services, rather than products. This would permit service providers to take a deduction for estimated future claims for deficient services in the year the services are provided, e.g. professional advisers such as lawyers and accountants might argue that a level of tortious or contractual liability under common law always exists in the giving of their advice. 14 Inland Revenue acknowledges that there may be situations where the reasoning in Mitsubishi applies to service providers. However, the arguments for applying the reasoning in those instances are considered to be significantly weaker as regards the provision of services. Mitsubishi dealt with sales of goods of like kind, i.e. vehicles, under warranty. The warranty established liability for inherent defects in the materials and workmanship. In many instances the provision of services will not involve the provision of services of such a similar and repetitive nature. Furthermore, whether services are deficient or “defective” in terms of meeting the requirements of the agreement they are provided under, or obligations implied under statute or at common law, may not be certain. It may not be able to be said that the services were deficient at the time they were provided. This may be a contingency which depends in part on circumstances arising after the services were provided. In addition, when compared with the facts in Mitsubishi, it is considered that it would be unusual if a service provider could estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty that “x”% of its services were inherently defective. It would seem more likely that a service provider will have an erratic history of claims made against it which would make it difficult to argue that any particular sum is a reasonable, annual estimate of potential future claims for particular “defective” services. It is also considered to be more likely that in the services arena taxpayers will be held liable not only for expenditure in the nature of “repairs” (i.e. putting right the direct “defect”), but also for any consequential loss. Given this, it is considered reasonable to assume that in most cases it would not be possible to quantify liability for consequential loss on any reliable, annual basis. In the case of some service providers, the distinction may be between a “provision”, suitable for financial accounting purposes, and a quantifiable deduction for tax purposes. Although, it is acknowledged that in very limited situations it may be possible to make a reasonable estimation of future liability in relation to the repeated provision of certain, discrete services, in general the Commissioner considers that the reasoning in Mitsubishi will not apply to taxpayers who provide services. However, if taxpayers who provide services are in doubt in relation to their particular circumstances, they may approach their local Inland Revenue office for guidance. Wider implications Inland Revenue acknowledges that the reasoning in Mitsubishi is potentially wider than the giving of warranties. However, in seeking to rely on the decision it will always be necessary to determine the “event” which triggers liability. Only where that event can be said to have occurred during the relevant income year will a deduction be available (subject to providing a reasonable estimate). As seen in the Mitsubishi decision itself, it is not always an easy task to identify the event which creates liability. The Court of Appeal thought it was the manifestation of the defect; the Privy Council, in effect, disagreed and considered it to be the act of sale of a vehicle containing an inherent defect which would manifest itself within the warranty period. The difficulty with the “incurred” test has always been in anticipating how it will apply to new or unique fact situations. It is considered that the Privy Council decision raises further difficulties in terms of applying it to new fact situations because: 15 • although the Privy Council recognised that the test for deductibility in section BD 2(1)(b) is concerned with particular items of expenditure, rather than deductions for aggregate sums (at page 12,353), their Lordships went on to reach their decision on the basis of an estimate of aggregate liability (at page 12,356). • the decision purports to apply the same principles as were applied in the “insurance cases” (RACV Insurance and Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Limited v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 435). However, in those cases a deduction was permitted in the current income year for liabilities which had occurred during that income year, but had not been reported to the taxpayer. Because of the nature of the insurance under consideration, it was probable that the taxpayer would be made aware of its liability to particular insured parties within a reasonable period following that income year. In Mitsubishi a deduction was permitted for a liability occurring in the current income year (the sale of an inherently defective vehicle subject to a one year warranty). Again, in practical terms, the taxpayer was likely to be aware of the actual number of claims arising out of those sales within a reasonable time following that income year due to the relatively short warranty period. Had the warranty period been for longer, e.g. ten years, this would not have been the case - although, arguably, applying Mitsubishi a deduction for a reasonable estimate of future liability during that period would still be available. It should be noted, however, that longer warranty periods may also raise questions as to whether future liability can be attributed to defects which were present at the time of sale. • the decision does not address the issue of how to determine the level of deduction where liability may be absolute, in terms of the contractual obligations of the taxpayer, but the likelihood of having to meet that expenditure is less than 100%. This issue did not arise in the case because the Privy Council chose to discount the possibility of some owners not claiming remedial work for defective vehicles sold during the relevant income year. Their Lordships considered that this possibility could be ignored because it was only likely to happen in the most trivial of cases and therefore would not affect the accuracy of the estimated amount of expenditure. By ignoring this potential reduction to the estimated liability, their Lordships were able to accept the estimate of liability for the current income year, based on past claims made. But, it is considered that such an approach leaves it unclear as to how to deal with the possibility that the actual level of liability may be less than the contractual liability. In cases where there is a more than trivial difference between the level of contractual liability and the estimated actual level of liability, it may be arguable that there is no existing obligation - the liability is still a contingent one. In addition, Inland Revenue considers that in applying the meaning of “incurred” in the future, taxpayers should bear in mind that Mitsubishi dealt with a particular set of facts - essentially trying to ascertain whether an aggregate of liabilities (the cost of meeting warranty obligations for inherent defects present in vehicles sold during the relevant income year) had been incurred. The issue of whether certain expenditure has been incurred will not always arise in situations analogous to that in Mitsubishi. In particular, it is suggested that in cases of “one-off” expenditure, case law prior to Mitsubishi will still be of relevance. For example, in such cases it will still be 16 relevant to ask whether the particular expenditure is no more than “impending, threatened or expected”: New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd. v FC of T (1938) 5 ATD 36, 49. Conclusions The Mitsubishi decision applies to express warranties of the type considered in the case. It also applies to warranties and guarantees of a similar nature implied under statute. Inland Revenue acknowledges that the decision has potentially widened the application of the meaning of “incurred”. This will mean that certain taxpayers are able to claim deductions in anticipation of expenditure where previously a deduction could be claimed only after an obligation to pay a particular sum had arisen. However, it will always be necessary to identify the event which gives rise to the liability, and to determine whether that event has occurred prior to year-end. Reasonable estimation To rely on the Mitsubishi decision taxpayers must be able to make a “reasonable estimation” of the quantum of the liability concerned. The Privy Council noted (at page 12,352) that the High Court was satisfied on the evidence that a reasonable estimate could be placed on the anticipated liabilities. However, there is no legal discussion by the Privy Council as to what constitutes a reasonable estimation, nor what methods may be adopted in reaching such an estimation. Nor, was there any discussion of this issue in the High Court or Court of Appeal judgments. The issue of what constitutes a reasonable estimate of expenditure or loss under section BD 2(1)(b) has had very little consideration by the New Zealand courts. However, the Australian courts have considered the question relatively recently. In ANZ Banking Group Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 27 ATR 559, 571-573, the Full Federal Court of Australia, drawing in part on earlier decisions, had the following to say about what is a reasonable estimate in the context of a provision for insurance claims: • An “estimate” does not involve arbitrarily seizing upon any figure. • An estimate involves forming a judgment or opinion based on reason. • The opinion or judgment must be bona fide, but need not be exact as estimation involves a process of approximation. • There is no rule as to the proper way of making an estimate. It is a question of fact and figures whether the way of making the estimate in any case is the best way for that situation (Sun Insurance Office v Clark \[1912\] AC 443, 454). • The concept of a “reasonable estimate” appears to mean “susceptible of more or less accurate estimation” or “capable of approximate calculation based on 17 probabilities”. The fact that an estimate is wrong, does not necessarily mean it is unreasonable. In the ANZ Banking case, the estimate of workers’ compensation liabilities for a self- insurer in respect of injuries which had occurred prior to balance date was accepted as a reasonable estimation, even though there was a relatively short history to utilise in calculating the estimate. In particular, Hill J agreed that the estimation was bona fide and that the method of estimation (case by case analysis carried out by an appropriate expert) was acceptable and was an exercise capable of approximate calculation on the basis of probabilities. The ANZ Banking case supports a rigorous approach to the application of Mitsubishi to estimations provided by taxpayers. Although it is difficult to set general guidelines for what is required by individual taxpayers in terms of providing reasonable estimates, in broad terms, at a minimum, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers to substantiate their estimations by reference to documentation evidencing past liabilities, e.g. sales records, claims data, etc., and be able to justify any adjustments made from that information for future years. It will be necessary for taxpayers to justify their methods of calculation in the light of their particular circumstances and to continually reassess the method of estimation adopted in the light of changing circumstances. It will also be necessary to have sufficient data, in terms of providing a credible “history of past expenditure”, in order to give a reliable estimation. It would generally not be appropriate for taxpayers to simply adopt a set percentage of sale or cost price from year to year without reference back to actual levels of warranty expenditure, for the same or similar products, for past years. Nor, would it generally be acceptable for taxpayers to base deductions on some kind of “industry standard”, unless it could be shown that those standards apply to the taxpayer’s specific circumstances. Taxpayers will need to show that their deductions for each year reflect a reasonable estimate of future warranty expenditure calculated for that particular income year. Use of an inflexible percentage calculation may suggest that the taxpayer is simply making a provision. This may be appropriate for financial accounting purposes, but will generally not be a reasonable estimate for tax purposes. If taxpayers are unsure as to what is required in their particular situation, then they may approach their local Inland Revenue office for further guidance. In other cases, it may not be possible for a taxpayer to make a reasonable estimate due to: • no past history of claims (e.g. in the first year of operation); • inadequate record keeping; and/or • changes in product line or other relevant circumstances which make it difficult to use past years’ information to reliably ascertain future liability. In cases where taxpayers are unable to make a reasonable estimation (and thereby take a deduction for estimated expenditure), a deduction will generally be available for that expenditure in the year that the liability becomes capable of reasonable 18 estimation. Establishing that a liability is capable of reasonable estimation is considered to be part of the test of whether that liability has been “incurred”. Accordingly, a deduction may be made in the earliest year that a reasonable estimation of the future expenditure can be determined. In some cases no deduction will be available until the year in which actual payment or liability for payment for an individual and identified amount occurs. This is because no reasonable estimation can be made before that time. In addition, a reasonable estimation for future expenditure may need to take into account anticipated rises and falls in the cost of meeting that expenditure at the time that it is reasonable to anticipate that the expenditure will be paid. However, any increase (or decrease) on current costs will also need to be substantiated on the basis of a reasonable estimation. In this regard, it is also noted that the Act does not require any “discounting” of expenditure which has been “incurred” in a particular income year to take into account the fact that it will not be paid until some time in the future. The Act applies to nominal, rather than present value, sums (e.g. Burrill v FCT 96 ATC 4,629). Standard of estimation It is acknowledged that the previous analysis imposes a high standard. A contrary view is that there is authority to support a “reasonable attempt” or “conservative estimate” as being sufficient and that smaller taxpayers should not be disadvantaged (in comparison with larger corporate taxpayers) solely because they do not maintain sophisticated systems, or have detailed information. For example, it might be argued that the essence of Lord Loreburn’s judgment in the Sun Insurance Office decision is that where an estimate is required, then the method that “comes nearer to the truth” than any other method should be accepted (rather than no estimate at all being taken). On such a basis, it should be possible for smaller taxpayers to make a provision based on a conservative (from a tax perspective) estimate and, as a result would resolve issues concerning the level of information required and the consequences of changes in product lines. What standard of evidence is required? It is considered that the common thread throughout the case law in this area is that an estimate must be reasonable and reliable, and what is reasonable and reliable in any particular case will necessarily depend on the facts of that case. For example, in Sun Insurance itself the taxpayer, a fire insurer, carried to reserve each year a sum equal to 40% of the year’s premium income. It was estimated that this was the amount necessary to meet unexpired risks. The House of Lords held that this was a reasonable and proper allowance, given that in assessing a fire insurance company it was necessary to proceed by estimate. Lord Loreburn accepted the taxpayer’s method as being the only way in which the true gains of the company could be ascertained, but noted that this result was not of universal application (at page 77): ...there is no rule of law as to the proper way of making an estimate. There is no way of estimating, which is right or wrong in itself. It is a question of fact and figure whether the way of making the estimate in any case is the best way for that case. Similar sentiments were expressed in ANZ Banking, where Hill J noted (at page 571) that: 19 The concept of “estimate” does not involve arbitrarily seizing upon any figure. What is involved is the formation of a judgment or opinion based upon reason. That judgment or opinion must necessarily be made bona fide but it need not be exact for the process of estimation involves a process of approximation. Applying those principles to the facts of that case, Hill J concluded (at page 573): In my view the present is not a case where it can be said that there can be no process of estimation or that no process of estimation was in fact made because the figure adopted was not reasonably arrived at. Rather, the establishment of provisions in the present case was an exercise capable of approximate calculation based on probabilities. On this basis, Inland Revenue does not accept that any “guess” will do, or that a small, conservative (in tax terms) deduction, taken on the basis that the future liability is bound to exceed that amount, is permissible. The cases tend to indicate that there must be some method advanced to support the deduction taken, and that method must be based on past experience – the deduction sought thereby being “capable” of estimation. Estimation as part of the “incurred” test It has been suggested that the question of whether an expense has been incurred, and the quantification of that expense, are completely separate issues, i.e. the requirement to make a reasonable estimate is not part of the “incurred” test. The fact that expenditure is incurred means that the taxpayer may (and in fact is required to) make the best possible estimate based on the information available, even if there is a paucity of such information. However, this approach is not consistent with the reasoning of the Privy Council in Mitsubishi. At page 12,355 of the decision, having agreed with the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the warranty provision, i.e. as being one that gave rise to a liability contingent on a defect appearing and being notified within the warranty period, Lord Hoffman went on to state that this was not the end of the matter because of two further principles that must be taken into account; the first being: ...that although the jurisprudential approach prevents one from treating an aggregate of contingent liabilities as a statistical certainty, it does not rule out statistical estimation of facts which have happened but are unknown... The relevance of this principle is that estimation on the basis of statistical experience can be used to conclude that 63% or thereabouts of the vehicles sold by MMNZ in fact had defects which would manifest themselves within the warranty period of twelve months or 20,000 kms. ... This, however, is not in itself enough to show that a liability was incurred. ...(Emphasis added) The Privy Council felt able to circumvent the problem of an aggregate of contingent liabilities because of the taxpayer’s ability to make an estimation of that collective liability. Although, the judgment does not address how reliable that evidence needs to be, their Lordships’ reasoning makes it clear that the requirement that there be a reasonable estimate is intrinsic to the application of the “incurred” test in similar fact situations. It is not a separate consideration, but rather a fundamental aspect of the 20 test, i.e. without the ability to make a reasonable estimate the liability has not been incurred. This approach is not new. For example, the decision in Texas Co (Australia) Ltd v FCT (1940) 63 CLR 382 has always stood for the principle that a taxpayer may completely subject itself to a liability notwithstanding that the quantum of that liability cannot be precisely ascertained, provided that it is capable of reasonable estimation. A similar approach was taken in the ANZ Banking Group decision discussed above and confirmed by Hill J in Ogilvy & Mather Pty Ltd v FC of T (1990) ATR 841, 874. The question is how much can actually be said to have been incurred, not how low should the amount taken as a deduction be to ensure that it will not ultimately be exceeded. Section BD 4 refers to the allocation of allowable deductions to the income year in which the deduction has been incurred – this is the only legal basis on which a deduction may be taken in a particular income year. It follows that determining how much should be deducted in any year must form part of the “incurred” test. In addition, the suggestion that estimation does not form part of that test does not address the situation where the taxpayer is unable to make any kind of estimate (e.g. in some cases in the first year of operation). If the requirement to be able to reasonably estimate is interpreted as not being part of the “incurred” test, then no deduction is available at all in that year, or subsequently, due to the ability to deduct being linked to the year of incurrence. It is considered that this result also suggests that the ability to estimate reasonably is part of, rather than an adjunct to, the “incurred” test. Conclusions In order to rely on Mitsubishi it is paramount that taxpayers are able to make a reasonable estimation of the relevant future expenditure. To the extent that it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation, the expenditure will be treated as having not been incurred in that income year. The standard of calculation demonstrated by the taxpayer in Mitsubishi, and past case law on what is a reasonable estimation, indicate that a rigorous standard, as regards the provision of detailed information and calculation methods to support claims for deductions based on estimations, is required. To that end, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers to substantiate claims made on the basis of estimated future expenditure in the light of their particular circumstances. If taxpayers are unsure as to what is required in their particular situation, then they may approach Inland Revenue for further guidance. Accounting for estimated liabilities Mitsubishi permits taxpayers to make deductions in the year of sale for estimated warranty costs. In most instances such estimates will prove to be incorrect in following years, when compared with actual expenditure. The original deduction will prove to be either an over- or under-statement of the actual expenditure incurred. In 21 the case of most warranties it will be several years after the expiration of the warranty before the total warranty costs for any particular year are known. The fact that an estimate will almost inevitably not reflect the “true” future liability has not been seen by the courts as being fatal to the taxpayer’s ability to make a deduction based on an estimate - as seen the estimate does not have to be “right”, just reasonable: RACV Insurance at pages 618 and 627. However, this raises the issue of how to deal with the potential mismatch between estimated expenditure and actual expenditure. It also raises the issue of how to deal with revised estimates. IBNR approach As seen above, the Privy Council decision refers to the taxation treatment of the general insurance industry; in particular, the judicial acceptance that reasonably estimated provisions for “incurred but not reported” (IBNR) claims are deductible. Inland Revenue currently permits general insurance companies to take a deduction for IBNR reserves. A deduction is permitted for estimated IBNR claims as at the end of the relevant income year. However, the taxpayer must add back as income the value of claims settled during the income year for IBNR claims for previous income years. There is no statutory authority for this treatment. However, there is judicial support for this approach indirectly in RACV Insurance and more explicitly in the Commercial Union decision. The treatment was summarised by Newton J in Commercial Union (at page 445): In a case where a provision for claims outstanding at the end of a year is an allowable deduction in calculating the taxable income of an insurer for that year, then when those claims come to be paid in the future, they must for income tax purposes be debited against the amount of that provision, so far as it is sufficient for the purpose. The claims cannot be treated as allowable deductions from the assessable premiums earned by the insurer in the year in which the claims are paid for the purpose of calculating the insurer’s taxable income of that later year, except insofar as the provision proves insufficient to meet them. Otherwise claims would be treated as allowable deductions twice over. (Emphasis added) Newton J went on to describe how this treatment is achieved in the taxpayer’s accounts: A convenient method of achieving the result just referred to, is to treat the amount of the provision for outstanding claims at the end of one year as part of the insurer’s assessable income of the following year together with the earned premiums of that year, and then to calculate the insurer’s taxable income for that second year by deducting all the claims in fact paid during that year, plus a provision for outstanding claims at the end of that year, plus, of course, administration and like expenses attributable to that year. Many of the claims paid during the second year will of course have been claims which were outstanding at the end of the first year, and they will thus in fact be debited against that provision for outstanding claims at the end of the first year, because that provision is treated as part of the assessable income of the second year. This method is perhaps technically incorrect, because the provision for outstanding claims at the end of the first year was part of the assessable income of that year, and cannot therefore also be part of the assessable income of the second year, except insofar as the provision may prove to have been excessive...however this may be, the method nevertheless produces the correct result...(Emphasis added) Newton J noted (at page 445) that a shorthand method to achieve the same result is to compare the provision for claims outstanding at the end of one year with the provision for claims outstanding at the end of the following year, treating any increase as an 22 allowable deduction for that second year and any decrease as part of the assessable income of that year. Further support for this approach is found in the Privy Council decision Southern Pacific Insurance Co (Fiji) Ltd v IRC (Fiji) \[1986\] STC 178. That case concerned the deductibility of IBNR reserves by a underwriter of general insurance, including third party motor insurance. The Privy Council confirmed that the amount of the liability of the taxpayer company for accidents which had occurred, but were not reported, in a particular year is part of the expense of the company in carrying on its insurance business during that year, and must be deducted in arriving at the total income of the company for that year. Of relevance to the question of adjustments, the Privy Council noted: ...the Court of Appeal suspected that provision for an IBNR claim in one year would be duplicated by providing for an outstanding claim once the IBNR claim was reported. This suspicion is ill-founded. A claim, when reported, disappears from the next valuation of IBNR and becomes part of the next valuation of outstanding claims unless it has been settled in the meantime. IBNR and outstanding claims are adjusted each year by reference to the provision made at the beginning of the year. There is thus no double provision. This treatment has also been endorsed by the Australian Taxation Office in IT 2663 Income Tax: Basis of Assessment of General Insurance Activities (20 December 1991) at paragraphs 136 to 139. The ruling provides for a general insurer to compare the amount of its outstanding claims provision at the end of an income year, with the amount of the provision at the previous year-end. Any increase in the provision is allowed as a deduction; any reduction in the provision is included as assessable income. The ruling refers to the RACV Insurance and Commercial Union cases in support of that approach. Thus, adjustments for over- and under-estimations in the insurance industry are made on a “rolling” basis (in a similar fashion to the treatment of trading stock and the operation of section EF 1). This has the practical advantage of not requiring previous years’ assessments to be reopened. In the case of warranty costs this would inevitably involve reopening past years at the end of each income year as it became apparent that the actual costs incurred were different from those estimated and/or that past estimations in themselves should be adjusted up or down. It is acknowledged that this may lead to an unworkable position from a compliance perspective. Adoption of an IBNR approach Inland Revenue considers that the approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to IBNR reporting provides a workable treatment for dealing with adjustments in the context of estimated warranty costs. This approach has been upheld by the courts in the context of general insurance taxpayers and applied for many years. Although there may be difficulties with explicitly justifying an IBNR approach within the statutory framework for the recognition of income and deductions (dicta from the Commercial Union case highlight the fact that this treatment is not strictly in compliance with ordinary income concepts), it is considered that in the absence of express legislation dealing with estimated but incurred expenditure, such an approach produces the best and most workable solution to the question of adjustments. It is 23 therefore proposed to apply an IBNR approach to estimated warranty costs for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. First year of deduction The adoption of an IBNR approach to estimated future expenditure raises the question of how the first year of estimated deductions should be handled. This is essentially an issue concerning changes in accounting treatment, similar to those raised in cases such as Henderson v FCT (1970) 119 CLR 612 and Country Magazine Pty Limited v FCT (1968) 15 ATD 86; (1968) 42 ALJR 42. The issue in this context is whether it is possible to take a deduction in the first year for all estimated future expenditure outstanding at year-end, whether it relates to events giving rise to liability occurring in that income year, or past income years. The alternative would be to restrict the deduction to only estimated future expenditure arising out of events that occurred in that income year, on the basis that it is only that expenditure which has been incurred in that year. This would be achieved by requiring taxpayers to make a notional opening balance adjustment in the first year – effectively adding back estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. It is considered that from a purely technical perspective there is a strong case for requiring an opening balance adjustment to be made. This particularly flows from a close analysis of the Commercial Union decision. In that case it was held that the taxpayer, an insurance company, could take a deduction for provisions made for IBNR claims, even though it was a condition precedent of the relevant insurance policies that insured persons make their claims within a certain period. The Court held that there was in effect strict liability and, therefore, the taxpayer became definitively committed to the liability upon the happening of the insured event. The case also concerned the issue of how IBNR provisions should be accounted for. Prior to the year ended 30 June 1973 the taxpayer had only taken deductions for outstanding and reported claims, although it was acknowledged that those estimates had been uplifted by 5% to 10% each year to take into account IBNR claims. During the 1973 income year it became apparent that this method of providing for IBNRs was unsatisfactory, and from that year on it was decided to estimate the IBNR claims separately. As regards the way in which the IBNR claims had been accounted for, the Commissioner argued that: • even if the IBNRs were deductible in principle, the company had not adopted a consistent basis of estimating IBNRs at the end of the income year and the preceding income year; and • because the taxpayer’s IBNR estimates included amounts in respect of unreported insured events that had occurred in prior years, those amounts should be excluded from the allowable deductions for the year in question since they would have been incurred in previous years. 24 Newton J rejected both arguments. As discussed above, as regards the first argument his Honour confirmed that the IBNR approach, although perhaps technically incorrect, was acceptable given that it gave the right result. He then went on to directly consider the issue of whether or not a notional amount should be added back in the “first” (1973) year (at page 446): It was contended in substance on behalf of the Commissioner that if in fact the provision of $5,864,866 in respect of claims incurred but not reported as at 30 June 1973, was an allowable deduction in calculating the taxable income of the Commercial Union Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, as part of the total deduction of $60,020,125 for all outstanding claims as at 30 June 1973, then for the purpose of calculating the taxable income of the Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, an appropriate amount in respect of claims incurred but not reported as at 30 June 1972, should be added to the sum of $39,559,704 which, as earlier stated, had been included in the assessable income of the Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, as representing the provision for outstanding claims as at 30 June 1972. If this were done, then of course the allowance of the sum of $5,864,866 as a deduction would be offset by a substantial amount...(Emphasis added) Newton J rejected this contention. His Honour noted that if it were correct then in his view no deduction would ever be allowed in respect of IBNR claims as at 30 June 1972 in calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer for any year, not even when the claims were paid. The reasons for this conclusion are interesting – Newton J considered that there was no material difference between the character of the provision for all claims as at 30 June 1973 and as at 30 June 1972. This was despite the fact that the later year included a separate IBNR amount. His Honour considered that both sums were a “total provision” for outstanding claims as at the end of the income year. In addition, the 1972 provision included an amount for IBNR claims, although not separately calculated. On this basis, Newton J concluded that there was no change in accounting methods – “there was merely a refinement in the method of calculation or estimation of the component of the provision for outstanding claims at the end of the year, which was intended to represent claims incurred but not reported”. He then expressly noted (at page 447) that on this basis it was unnecessary for him to consider what would be the position if there had been a material difference in the character of the provisions so that there was a relevant change in accounting methods. Newton J also rejected the Commissioner’s second argument, i.e. the contention that on no view could a provision for IBNR claims, where the event insured against had occurred before 1 July 1972, be an allowable deduction in calculating the taxpayer’s income for the year ended 30 June 1973. His Honour considered that in so far as the IBNR figure as at 30 June 1973 represented any claims arising out of events occurring in previous years, this simply represented a re-estimate of the taxpayer’s liability in respect of those claims. He considered that the words “assessable income” in section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 meant assessable income of the taxpayer generally without regard to division into annual accounting periods and therefore, just as it is possible to take an IBNR deduction for claims arising out of events in the relevant year, it is possible to take a deduction for an increase in an estimate at the end of that year for any claims arising out of previous years which are then still outstanding. 25 In this way, Newton J treated the 1973 IBNR amount as being simply a re-estimate of the earlier IBNR deductions which formed an unspecified part of the outstanding reported claims for those previous years. Therefore, although on the facts of the case Newton J decided that there was no need to add back a notional opening amount, this essentially turned on the fact that in prior years there had been some kind of deduction made for IBNR claims – meaning that there was no movement to a new accounting method, and the first year in which a separate IBNR deduction was taken simply represented a re-estimate of IBNR claims relating to previous years. In response to the Commercial Union decision the ATO released ruling IT 110 General Insurance Companies: Claims Incurred But Not Reported (28 October 1977). The ruling set out the “advice” that was sent to branch offices in the light of the decision. The ruling adopts the view that the conclusion that the company’s method of calculation of outstanding claims in the first year that IBNRs were separately claimed was merely a refinement of earlier methods was a reasonable one in the circumstances. However, the conclusion reached on the second issue discussed above, i.e. whether it is possible to take an IBNR deduction in one year in respect of unreported insured events that had occurred in prior years, is considered by the ATO to be “more doubtful”. IT 110 notes: However, that issue is of relatively minor importance once the basic principle of the deductibility of IBNRs is accepted and the Judge’s approach to it is a logical and reasonable one, at least from a practical viewpoint. The ruling goes on to conclude that where IBNRs are claimed as a separate item for the first time in a year of income, because it is probable that an over-estimate of outstanding reported claims has occurred (as was the situation in the case) or because the IBNRs are really no different in character to those claims (Newton J’s second argument), then: It will not be necessary in these cases, therefore, where a company has claimed IBNRs as a separate item for the first time in a particular year of income, to reduce the deduction claimed by some amount which ought to have been claimed as IBNRs in the immediately proceeding year (except in the extremely unlikely event that an insurance company has operated for a number of years without ever claiming deductions for outstanding claims of any kind). Therefore, although Newton J decided on the facts before him that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to add back any notional amount to relate to IBNRs for previous income years, this seems to be based on factors that would not be present in the case of taxpayers seeking to rely on the Mitsubishi decision. It is more likely that such a taxpayer would be moving to a new accounting treatment whereby it would be taking a deduction for estimated expenditure, as opposed to actual expenditure, for the first time. On a strict application it follows that this change in accounting treatment should result in only deductions for future estimated expenditure relating to that income year being taken. This is achieved by requiring an “add-back” of the notional amount of estimated future expenditure at the beginning of the first year so that only the increase between the amount attributable to estimated future costs at the end of the income year and the amount of such claims at the beginning of the year, is deductible. 26 Section EC 1 Section EC 1(1) applies if in relation to any income year (the year of adjustment) the Commissioner is satisfied that the allowable deductions of a person, in respect of a business for any preceding income year or years, have been understated by reason of those deductions having been calculated without taking into account provisions or reserves which are allowed as deductions. Under section EC 1(3), the Commissioner may deem the amount of such provisions or reserves as allowable deductions incurred by the taxpayer in the year of adjustment. Section EC 1 was first enacted as section 92A of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. It was a response to the decision in Henderson where it was held that if a taxpayer moved from a cash basis to an earnings basis of accounting for income, it was correct not to account for income earned in the cash basis years, even though it was paid to the taxpayer in subsequent years. Section EC 1 was, therefore, primarily designed to enable the Commissioner to include within assessable income any income that might otherwise escape taxation as a result of a change in a taxpayer’s method of tax accounting. However, the wording is clearly wider because, in addition, it gives the Commissioner a discretion to make an adjustment in a taxpayer’s favour where he considers that there has been an understatement of income through failure to take into account allowable deductions which have been treated as provisions or reserves. What constitutes a provision or reserve was considered by the Court of Appeal in CIR v The Farmers’ Trading Company Limited (1989) 11 NZTC 6,007. In that case the Commissioner had attempted to apply the precursor to section EC 1 in order to bring to account proceeds from certain credit sales made in earlier years which the taxpayer had not brought to account due to having adopted a “profits emerging” accounting basis. The Court held (applying the decision in CIR v National Bank of New Zealand Limited (1976) 2 NZTC 61,150) that the equivalent to section EC 1(1)(b) had no application to a situation where the taxpayer had omitted income altogether, rather than brought income in from which an unauthorised deduction for a provision or reserve had been made. Richardson J (as he then was), who delivered the judgment of the Court, considered (at page 6,010) that as no guidance is given in the Act as to the meaning of the phrase “provisions or reserves” it was appropriate to look to generally accepted accounting principles and ordinary commercial practice in determining its meaning. In that regard, he referred to the definitions of the terms given in paragraph 2(1) of the Eighth Schedule to the Companies Act 1955 which provides: For the purposes of this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires, - (a) The expression "provision" shall, subject to subclause (2) of this paragraph, mean any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewals, or diminution in value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy: (b) The expression "reserve" shall not, subject as aforesaid, include any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewals, or diminution in value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability: He also commented (at page 6,011) that in general terms a provision reflects a charge against profits, whereas a reserve reflects an allocation, or setting aside, of profits for future use or advantage. 27 It is considered that this definition of “provisions or reserves” is broad enough to encompass a situation where a taxpayer has brought to account income from the sale of warranted goods, and for financial reporting purposes, but not for tax purposes, has created a provision for the cost of meeting estimated future warranty claims. This would appear to be an amount retained (or charged against profits) by way of “providing for a known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy”. Notwithstanding that a strong case can be made for the need to make an opening balance adjustment in the first year that a taxpayer changes to an estimated basis from an actual basis for accounting for warranty expenditure, it is acknowledged that this may lead to an unworkable position. Given this, and the scope of section EC 1, the Commissioner is prepared to exercise his discretion under that provision to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. Re-estimation Another feature of the treatment of insurance claims is the recognition by the courts that in some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate previous years’ estimates for claims, i.e. to make a further adjustment for anticipated claims relating to a previous period which at the end of the current accounting period are still outstanding. The need to re-estimate reflects the fact that at all times the deduction taken should reflect a “reasonable estimate” of the quantum of the underlying liability. In the context of estimated warranty costs, a need for re-estimation might occur where the cost of replacement parts suddenly escalates, or it is shown that an unexpected repetitive defect in a particular warranted product has arisen. It is acknowledged that in such instances it may well be prudent from an accounting/commercial perspective to re-estimate the anticipated cost of meeting outstanding warranties. The insurance cases indicate that re-estimations of this type should be taken as a deduction in the year in which the re-estimation is made and not in the year the original deduction was made: RACV Insurance at pages 610 and 618; Commercial Union at pages 435 and 448, and the NZSA Financial Reporting Standard No. 7 (1994): Standard 5, at paragraphs 5.21 and 5.22. Conversely, there is also authority for the need to return income in the event that revised estimates which reduce the estimated liability are made in subsequent years. Again, income is returned in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction: Commonwealth Aluminium Corp Ltd v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 376, 386 and International Nickel Australia Limited v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 739; 743, 751 and 755. It should also be noted that re-estimating in some circumstances, given the level of the re-estimation and/or the nature of the events surrounding the re-estimation, may indicate that the original estimates were not in themselves reasonable, and, in turn, raise issues as regards the methods of estimation being adopted by the taxpayer. As 28 indicated previously, it is considered that taxpayers must at all times satisfy a rigorous standard as regards their methods of calculating estimated liabilities. If Inland Revenue finds that taxpayers have not adopted, or have not continued to adopt, such a standard, it may not be possible to rely on the reasoning in Mitsubishi in relation to the timing of expenditure deductions. Conclusions Inland Revenue accepts that the approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to IBNR reporting provides a workable treatment for accounting for estimated future expenditure for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. It has been used and accepted for a long time in the context of general insurance taxpayers and IBNR reserves, and in that context has received judicial support. In changing to such a method it is acceptable to take a deduction in the first year of adjustment of all estimated future expenditure for which a deduction is available on the basis of the reasoning in Mitsubishi. The Commissioner is prepared to exercise his discretion under sections EC 1(1) and EC 1(3) to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. In some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate estimated claims relating to previous income years. This may involve, in the light of new information, increasing the quantum of those claims, and thereby taking a further deduction or, conversely, returning additional income in the event that revised estimates reduce the quantum of the estimated liability made in previous years. In both cases, the adjustment should be made in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction. The need to re-estimate simply reflects the fact that at all times the deduction taken should reflect a “reasonable estimate” of the quantum of the underlying liability. In cases where taxpayers have not adopted, or have not continued to adopt, such a standard of estimation, it may not be possible to rely on the reasoning in Mitsubishi in relation to the timing of expenditure deductions. Section EF 1 Section EF 1 is a “qualification” to the general position under the Act that expenditure relating to the derivation of gross income is deductible when incurred. Although a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred, under section EF 1 gross income is deemed to include the amount of the unexpired portion of any “accrual expenditure” that relates to future income years. In this way, section EF 1 modifies the section BD 2(1)(b) “incurred” test where expenditure is incurred in one year, but the benefit extends beyond that year. Its effect is to progressively write down the expenditure over later years. Under section EF 1(1), although accrual expenditure that has been incurred is deductible when it is incurred in accordance with the Act, the unexpired portion (if any) of that expenditure must be added back as gross income. Section EF 1(5) determines the amount of the unexpired portion of any accrual expenditure. The amount depends on the character of the expenditure, i.e. whether it relates to goods, services, monetary remuneration (which is not relevant here), or a chose in action. 29 Section EF 1(3) permits the Commissioner to make determinations for exemption from section EF 1. The current determination is Determination E10 which applies for the 1994/95 income year and all subsequent income years until it is cancelled. Section EF 1 was not argued before the courts in Mitsubishi. However, it has been suggested that section EF 1 may apply to the facts of the case. That is to say, although the Privy Council established that the estimated warranty costs were deductible under the equivalent of section BD 2(1)(b), that deduction, or a part of it, may still have to be added back under section EF 1. This would have the practical effect of largely reversing the timing advantage that Mitsubishi affords taxpayers who are able to rely on the decision. What follows is an analysis of the words of the section (and the issues raised in that regard), the legislative background to section EF 1 and a discussion of the Thornton Estates Court of Appeal decision. Preliminary issue – is section EF 1 limited to pre-paid expenditure? It is understood that section EF 1 is commonly seen as only applying to “pre-paid expenditure”, i.e. taxpayers are required to add back the cost of goods, services or chooses in action actually paid for in advance of those items being applied to the production of assessable income. In this regard it has been suggested that sections EF 1(5)(b) and 1(5)(d) were never intended to apply to future payments, i.e. they were only aimed at pre-payment situations. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the legislative intent at the time of enactment, notwithstanding the subsequent introduction of section EF 1(5)(c) which clearly applies more widely. It has been observed that in the warranty context this approach has the attraction of eliminating the problems of applying those subsections – the taxpayer will not have made a payment for any goods or services, or for, or in relation to, any chose in action. Although it is acknowledged that such an interpretation may resolve some of the uncertainty arising from the potential application of section EF 1 to warranty expenditure, it is considered that this approach is doubtful both in terms of the wording of the provision and the background to its introduction. Section EF 1 applies to all accrual expenditure. “Accrual expenditure” is defined as being “any amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is allowed a deduction under this Act...other than expenditure incurred...”. Under section EF 1(1), if any person has incurred any accrual expenditure, that person is allowed to take a deduction when it is incurred, but the unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year must be included as gross income. There is nothing in those words to suggest that the provision only applies to expenditure that has been incurred and paid for. Although section EF 1(5)(b) refers to “payment”, i.e. “the expenditure relates to payment for services; as does section EF 1(5)(d), i.e. “the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action”, there is nothing in the wording of the section to suggest that the word “payment” should be read down as only applying to situations where a payment has already been made. It is consistent with the terms of the provision to interpret it as referring to both past and future payments. In addition, 30 the introduction of section EF 1(5)(c) now makes it very difficult to argue on a plain reading of the section that the meaning of incurred and payment should be read down. To do so would mean that section EF 1(5)(c) applies in a wholly different way than the other subsections. The converse view is that there is at least some ambiguity as regards the scope of sections EF 1(5)(b) and 1(5)(d) because they refer to “payment”, and this may be interpreted as requiring that actual payment has taken place. It may be suggested that this is more consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term. For example, The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) provides: payment 1 An act, or the action or process, of paying. (Foll. by of the money etc. paid, the debt discharged, the payee; for the thing bought or recompensed.) 2 (A sum of) money etc. paid In addition, some support for this interpretation comes from section EF 1(5A) which also uses the word “payment”. For the purposes of section EF 1, that provision deems any payment to which section CB 12(1) applies to be expenditure incurred by the payer as payment for services performed in the year or years in which the recipient of the payment is expected to incur the expenditure to which the payment relates. Section CB 12(1) refers to “an amount paid by an employer in respect of an employee’s employment or service”. In this context “payment” seems to require physical payment. Given this potential ambiguity, it is necessary to look to the background to the introduction of the provision to try to ascertain its true meaning. A preliminary point is that the section applies to “accrual expenditure” which, uses the term “incurred” – a common law concept that at the time of the introduction of section EF 1 (in 1987) was clearly understood as being wide enough to encapsulate future expenditure (this had been the understood position as early as 1938 with the decision in New Zealand Flax Ltd v FC of T (1938) 5 ATD 36). The Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (October 1986) recommended the introduction of a regime for the timing of deductions for expenses other than interest. Chapter 14 sets out the broad outline for what became section EF 1. Nothing in the general discussion indicates whether the Committee envisaged the provision applying to all incurred expenditure, or only to prepayments. However, all of the examples concern prepayment scenarios. The comments made in the subsequent Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (April 1987) are also inconclusive in this regard. However, there is one indication that the focus may have been on prepayments. In Appendix III to the Report: Recommendations of the Consultative Committee to the Minister of Finance, in referring to the precursor to section EF 1(5)(a) and the change from a “delivery” test to a “use” test for goods, the following comment is made: Clause 12 of the amended Bill deals with how the accruals treatment will apply to the specified categories of expenditure, other than interest, outlined in your Budget. The treatment for non-interest expenditure in the Bill follows the treatment outlined in your Budget, with one exception. Your Budget announcement required the add-back of expenditure on goods only to the extent that the goods 31 were paid for but not received by the end of the income year. Under clause 12 however, expenditure on goods must be added back where the goods have not been used at the end of the income year. Thus goods are treated in the same way as other types of accrued expenditure. That is, a deduction for the whole of the expenditure is allowed in the income year in which it is incurred but that part of expenditure related to future years is added back to the taxpayer’s assessable income. This treatment is similar to the current treatment of expenditure incurred on trading stock and conforms with one of the options outlined in the Consultative Document. (Emphasis added) From this statement it might be inferred that section EF 1(5)(a), at the very least, was only aimed at prepayments, i.e. that was the intention when it applied a “delivery” test, and the same approach applied under the eventually adopted “use” test. However, it is considered that the comments made about the regime being the same as for other types of accrued expenditure, and in particular the trading stock regime, seem to be somewhat at odds with that interpretation. For example, the definition of “trading stock” does not differentiate between payments actually made and future payments – trading stock is essentially what has been acquired or purchased at year- end, whether actually paid for or not. In addition, the definition of “trading stock” was amended in 1987 to expressly provide that it included “anything in respect of which expenditure is incurred after 23 October 1986 and which, if possession of that thing were taken, would be trading stock”. Arguably, the reference to “incurred” makes it even clearer that the trading stock regime operates on an accruals basis, i.e. recognising all expenditure that has been incurred at year-end, regardless of whether that expenditure has been physically paid out. Although not completely free from doubt, it is considered that the better view is that section EF 1 is not limited to pre-payments. The concept of “incurred” expenditure is clearly wider. Although the examples provided in the consultative documents referred to above all dealt with pre-payment situations, there is nothing in the background to the provision’s enactment that expressly limits it in that way. (In this regard it should be noted that in cases such as Marac Life Assurance Limited v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086, at pages 5,093, 5,095, 5,100 and 5,104 and CIR v Dewavrin (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048 at page 11,054, the Court of Appeal noted a word of caution regarding taking into account background discussion papers as being indicative of the underlying purpose of any provision or as necessarily identifying the mischief that the legislation was designed to counter. Although such background material may be helpful, it is always necessary to look at the plain words of the legislation actually promulgated to determine what Parliament intended.) In addition, since the enactment of section EF 1(5)(c), it is considered very difficult from an interpretative stance to read the other subsections down in the manner suggested. This statement therefore proceeds on the basis that section EF 1 potentially applies to all incurred accrual expenditure. It is also noted that this result is consistent with the comments made by Inland Revenue in Technical Policy Circular 88/2 (Part 2), the text of which was subsequently published in the same form in Public Information Bulletin No 167 (December 1987). Although the examples given all involve pre-payments, the perceived mischief is stated more broadly (at page 51) as being the ability to take a deduction for expenditure that has been incurred, but not paid for: 32 Mischief As noted in the 1986 Budget many tax avoidance schemes depend upon deficiencies in the rules governing the timing of tax deductions and the derivation of income. Under section 104 of the Act a deduction is allowed for expenditure as it is incurred, i.e. when the taxpayer is under a legal obligation to make payment, not when payment is actually made. Given that a deduction could be taken in advance of actual payment there were obvious cashflow advantages in advancing the point in time at which an obligation to make payment was assumed. The new section 104A removes such timing anomalies by introducing a regime similar to the treatment of trading stock for expenditure that is wholly or partly attributable to income years other than the year in which the expenditure is incurred. (Emphasis added) It is also interesting to note that the taxpayer in Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 argued before the Court of Appeal (at page 13,582) that section EF 1 was directed at pre-payments, and particularly at payments for consumable aids. Although this argument is not addressed in the reasoning, it seems implicit in the decision reached that the Court did not see the provision as being limited in anyway to pre-payments. Application to deductions for warranty costs The Privy Council in Mitsubishi held that the taxpayer had “incurred” a liability to meet future warranty costs arising out of sales of vehicles in the relevant income year and was entitled to make a deduction equivalent to a reasonable estimation of those costs. The expenditure in question was the estimated warranty costs. This type of expenditure falls within the definition of “accrual expenditure”. It has not been incurred in the purchase of trading stock, nor in respect of any specified lease or financial arrangement. (The question of whether the warranty was a financial arrangement was considered by the Court of Appeal. That Court reached the view that although a contract of sale which includes an indemnity in respect of conditional obligations under warranties to be performed (at a cost) in the future came within the broad reach of paragraph (b) of the definition of “financial arrangement”, the fact that the warranty was an integral part of an agreement for sale and purchase of property meant that the entire arrangement was an “excepted financial arrangement” and therefore outside the accruals regime.) Under section EF 1 the “unexpired portion” of any accrual expenditure must be added back. Deciding whether there is any “unexpired portion” requires consideration of section EF 1(5). Section EF 1(5) determines what is meant by the “unexpired portion” of any amount of accrual expenditure with reference to the type of expenditure. That is, in this context, whether the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods (section EF 1(5)(a)), payment for services (section EF 1(5)(b)), or payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action (section EF 1(5)(d)). Each subsection uses the phrase “relates to”, e.g. the relevant expenditure must relate to the purchase of goods. Given this, before considering the application of each part of section EF 1 to warranty expenditure it is useful to consider the meaning of that phrase. This issue is key to determining the potential breadth of the provision. 33 “relates to” The meaning of “relates to” in section EF 1 has not been directly considered by any New Zealand court. However, the words “relates”, “in relation to”, and “relating to” have been considered by the courts, both here and overseas. A leading case on the meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” is Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303. In that case the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to the employment” in the definition of “monetary remuneration” and “extra emolument” in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The words “in respect of or in relation to” were held to be “words of the widest import”. However, given that the words “in relation to” appear as a compound term in section 2 with the words “in respect of”, it is arguable that their scope is naturally broader in that context. In Department of Internal Affairs v Poverty Bay Club Inc \[1989\] DCR 481, the District Court held that the meaning of the word “relates” in section 2(c) of the Antiquities Act 1975 is the ordinary meaning of the word, i.e. “to have a connection or to establish a relationship with”. In the High Court decision Picture Perfect Ltd v Camera House Ltd \[1996\] 1 NZLR 310, Barker J considered the scope of the word “relates” as it appears in section 29(1)(c) of the Commerce Act 1986. Barker J did not have to draw any final conclusions on this point, however he observed that the interpretation of “relates” in this context could involve either a flexible or restrictive approach. He noted that it had been suggested that the preferable interpretation in the context before him was that the “relates to” concept should be given a “liberal view” (i.e. to extend to situations with only an indirect connection) to reflect the underlying legislative intention. The Supreme Court of Canada also gave a wide interpretation to the words “relating to” in Slattery (Trustee of) v Slattery \[1993\] 2 CTC 243. The Court considered the meaning of “in respect of proceedings relating to the administration or enforcement” of the Income Tax Act. Iacobucci J gave “relating to” the same meaning as “in respect of” and “in connection with”. The Court considered that these words suggested a wide, rather than a narrow, interpretation of the section containing those words. However, a narrower interpretation of “relating to” was preferred by McLachlin J in his dissenting judgment. He was of the opinion that the context and jurisprudence concerning the section within which the phrase was used determined its meaning and indicated a narrower construction. From this analysis it is considered that “relates to” means that one thing has a connection or establishes a relationship with some other thing. However, the scope of this connection will depend on the statutory context in which the relating to concept appears. Having considered the potential meaning of “relates to”, it is necessary to consider the ordinary meaning of the words of sections EF 1(5)(a), (b) and (d) as they might apply to warranty expenditure. 34 Section EF 1(5)(a) - Goods Section EF 1(5)(a) deals with expenditure that “relates to the purchase of goods”. “Goods” are defined as meaning all real and personal property, but not including choses in action or money. It is considered that in the context of warranty expenditure, section EF 1(5)(a) could be interpreted as potentially applying to: • the purchase price of goods acquired for, and paid (or to be paid) for by, the taxpayer; and/or • the purchase price of goods acquired by a third party, but paid for (or to be paid for) by the taxpayer (although only to the extent that such expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1)(b) in the first instance); and/or • expenditure paid for (or to be paid for) by the taxpayer, being ancillary, or relating to, the purchase of any such goods (e.g. freight, custom or other transportation charges). On this basis, the estimated warranty costs incurred by a taxpayer in an analogous position to the taxpayer in Mitsubishi, would not fall within the provision. The expenditure is not payment for the purchase of goods by the warrantor, or by any third party (customers paying for the purchase of their own vehicles). Nor, does the expenditure relate to any such purchase. However, it is acknowledged that an alternative, and potentially wider, interpretation of section EF 1(5)(a) is possible. It is arguable that the inclusion of the words “relates to” extends the provision to apply to any expenditure that has a connection with the purchase of goods, regardless of whether the taxpayer (the warrantor) has paid, or is to pay, for the purchase of those goods. It is only necessary that the expenditure relates to, in a general sense, the purchase of goods. Taking this wider approach, it can then be argued that the warranty expenditure which a warrantor may incur relates to the purchase of goods, i.e. the purchase of vehicles by consumers. In Commissioner of Customs and Excise v Ingram \[1949\] 2 KB 103, the Court of Appeal considered whether a “person concerned with the purchase....of goods” could be required to furnish information relating to a sale of goods by that person to others. That case concerned section 20(3) of the Finance Act 1946 (UK) which dealt with purchase tax and provided: Every person concerned with the purchase or importation of goods or with the application to goods of any process or manufacture or with dealings with imported goods shall furnish to the Commissioners within such time and in such form as they may require information relating to the goods or to the purchase or importation thereof.... The Commissioner contended that the phrase “information relating to the purchase thereof” required the taxpayer to not only furnish information about goods purchased by him, but also information relating to the sale of those goods by him to others. The Commissioner argued that the phrase must be read in the context of, and having regard to, other sections of the Act which imposed purchase tax. 35 The Court accepted the Commissioner’s arguments. The Court looked to the definition of “purchase”. For the purposes of the Act it was defined as meaning any contract which is a contract of sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1893. This meant that “purchase” must be read in section 20(3) as applying to buyers and sellers. However, in reaching this decision the Court noted: It must, we think, be conceded that the drafting of the sub-section is not in any way felicitous: and....it seems to us that a first and natural reading of its terms would confine “purchase” to the purchase by the “person concerned”. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(a) It is unclear if section EF 1(5)(a) is intended to apply only to expenditure relating to purchases of goods paid, or to be paid for, by the taxpayer seeking the deduction. However, in the light of Ingram it is considered that the better view is that the section is limited in this way. As seen, “relates to”, and similar phrases, have generally been given a broad interpretation by the courts, although the breadth of their meaning tends to be influenced by the legislative context. Arguably, if Parliament had intended to apply section EF 1(5)(a) to both purchases and sales it could have provided for this expressly. It is considered that the better view of the meaning of “relates to” is that it extends the provision to cover expenses ancillary to, or paid in connection with, the purchase of goods by the taxpayer, e.g. freight charges, or storage charges. But, it does not extend section EF 1(5)(a) to cover expenditure relating to the purchase of goods by a third party for which the taxpayer does not pay, or become obliged to pay, consideration for. In the context of warranty expenditure, adopting this interpretation means that section EF 1(5)(a) does not apply to payments made by taxpayers (warrantors) for the cost of goods applied to remedy defects under warranties. Section EF 1(5)(b) - Services Section EF 1(5)(b) deals with expenditure for services. “Services” is defined as anything which is not goods, or money, or a chose in action. The ordinary meaning of “service” confirms its wide application. The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) defines “service” as: IV 18 Provision of a facility to meet the needs or for the use of a person or thing...20 Assistance or benefit provided to someone by a person or thing;...21a An act of helping or benefiting another; an instance of beneficial, useful, or friendly action. b The action of serving, helping, or benefitting another... B vt 1 Be of service to; serve; provide with a service. 2 Perform maintenance or repair work on (a motor vehicle etc.) Section EF 1(5)(b) applies where the expenditure in question relates to payment for services. As for section EF 1(5)(a), in the context of warranty expenditure section EF 1(5)(b) could be interpreted as potentially applying to: • the cost of services supplied to the taxpayer and paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer; and/or 36 • the cost of services supplied to a third party, but paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer (subject to being deductible under section BD 2(1)(b) in the first instance); and/or • expenditure paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer, being ancillary, or relating to, the payment for any such services. To determine if, and how, section EF 1(5)(b) might apply to warranty expenditure, it is necessary to ask whether any “services” have been or will be provided, and whether “payment” has been made for those services by the warrantor. Warranty claims by customers will generally involve the supply of services, i.e. vehicle repair work. Although the facts in different arrangements may vary, it is generally the case that those services are provided directly by dealers to customers. Dealers then seek reimbursement for the cost of providing those services from the distributor or manufacturer (the warrantor). It may be arguable that dealers, in providing repair work to customers, also provide a “service” to their distributor/manufacturer by honouring the terms of their dealership arrangement with that party. The service is the processing of warranty claims, including the provision of repair work. Alternatively, it might also be argued that the warrantor pays dealers to provide repair services to customers. It is considered that the repair services provided by dealers to customers, to the extent to which they are not paid for by the warrantor, would not come within this provision. Although, it is possible to argue for an alternative and potentially wider interpretation of section EF 1(5)(b) based on the meaning of “relates to”, it is considered that the reference to “for” in section EF 1(5)(b) strongly indicates that for the section to apply the taxpayer must be obliged to pay for the underlying services. This result is consistent with the interpretation of section EF 1(5)(a) discussed above, i.e. that the section only applies if the taxpayer has paid for (or will be obliged to pay for) the goods in question. It is considered reasonable to assume that Parliament intended for there to be consistency between the various subsections where the same words, i.e. “relates to”, are used. For these reasons, it is considered that the better view is that section EF 1(5)(b) does not apply to the provision of repair services by dealers to customers, to the extent to which those services cannot be said to have been paid for (or will be paid for) by the taxpayer (the warrantor) seeking the deduction. Accepting that section EF 1(5)(b) does not apply to services provided to third parties and not paid for, or to be paid for, by the warrantor, the question becomes whether it could apply to the relationship between dealers and warrantors. The issue becomes whether it is possible to say that: • the warrantor has paid for, or is obliged to pay for, services supplied to it by the dealer; or • the warrantor has paid for, or is obliged to pay for, the repair services provided to customers. 37 In either case it would then be arguable that section EF 1(5)(b) applies to require the adding back of the future estimated warranty expenditure by the taxpayer. Has the taxpayer paid for services supplied to it by the dealer? In most situations, warrantors require dealers to process warranty claims and undertake repair services to fulfil obligations under warranties provided by dealers to customers. This will be in accordance with the dealers’ responsibilities under their dealership agreements with the warrantor. It might be argued that, to that extent, dealers do also provide a “service” to the warrantor, i.e. repair work for a third party, but for the indirect benefit of the warrantor. It is arguable that the warrantor makes payment for those services in the form of the reimbursement of the cost of the repairs (and replacement parts). It is acknowledged that some support for this analysis is available in the Taxation Review Authority decision Case R34 (1996) 16 NZTC 6,190 and the supplementary decision dealing with the same facts and taxpayer, Case S88 (1997) 17 NZTC 7,551. Although those decisions concerned GST, they include an analysis of the relationships which may exist between customers, dealers, and distributors in the motor vehicle industry. In both cases the question was whether reimbursements for warranty repair costs made by the overseas manufacturing company to the objector, a New Zealand distributor (a party in approximately the same position as the taxpayer in Mitsubishi in the chain of distribution), were subject to GST. In Case R34 the Commissioner had conceded the argument that there was no supply of any services by the objector to the manufacturing company. The argument focussed on whether the payments made by the manufacturing company to the objector were consideration for the supply of repair services by the dealers. On this basis the Commissioner lost. However, in Case S88 the Commissioner argued successfully that there was a supply of repair services by the objector to the manufacturing company. Barber DJ noted (at page 7,562) that the result of the respondent’s approach is to construct three supplies out of the one set of repair work, namely: from the dealer (who did the actual physical repair work) to the objector; from the objector to the customer of that warranty work, for which consideration is in the purchase price of the car; and the supply of services from the objector to the manufacturing company. These cases must be viewed with some caution given that they deal with the issue of whether consideration has been paid for the supply of services in the context of GST, and the facts differ from those in Mitsubishi, (e.g. in these cases the warranty was provided by the distributor to the customers, whereas in Mitsubishi warranties were given by the dealers to customers, rather than by the taxpayer, through the dealers). However, they do tend to support the conclusion that in some cases a dealer, in providing repair services to customers under warranties, also supplies services to a distributor who reimburses the dealer for the cost of those services. And, in addition, that a distributor who effects repair services through its agent in order to fulfil obligations under a warranty it provides to its dealers’ customers, also provides those repair services to the manufacturer who in turn provides a warranty to that distributor. However, there is a contrary argument. That is, that the services provided by dealers are only provided to customers, and not also to the party that reimburses the dealer for the cost of providing those services, i.e. the warrantor. On this basis, dealers merely 38 fulfil the terms of their dealership agreements (and the underlying warranties) for which they are indemnified by a third party. They do not provide a service to the party that reimburses them for the cost of providing those services. Has the taxpayer paid for services supplied to customers? Even if it is accepted that no services have been supplied to, and paid for by, the warrantor, it is arguable that section EF 1(5)(b) might still apply on the basis that the taxpayer has paid for (or is obliged to pay for) the services supplied to customers. However, for the reasons set out above, the section will not apply if the relationship is not one of “payment for services”. The better view is that it will not apply where there is only a reimbursement or indemnification of services provided to a third party. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(b) It is considered that the above analysis demonstrates that it is not possible to decide the exact scope of section EF 1(5)(b) by simply considering the ordinary meaning of the words used. This is because the words used may be interpreted in different ways. A broad interpretation tends to indicate that the resolution of these issues in any particular case will depend on the exact terms of the relevant dealership arrangements, including establishing who provides the warranty and on what basis. In particular, in this context the application of section EF 1(5)(b) seems to turn on whether the warrantor is paying for the services of the dealer under the warranty arrangement, or paying for services to be provided by the dealer to customers, compared to a situation where the warrantor is simply reimbursing or indemnifying the dealer for fulfilling obligations under the warranty. In the former case, it is arguable that given the language of section EF 1(5)(b) it potentially applies; in the latter situation it does not. However, even if this interpretation is sustainable, it is considered at least questionable as to whether these distinctions were intended by Parliament to be determinative of the application of the section in this context. On the other hand, a narrow interpretation of section EF 1(5)(b) would tend to indicate that the provision is limited to situations where the taxpayer is paying for services (and/or ancillary expenses) provided for its own benefit. Given this ambiguity, in accordance with the approach to statutory interpretation endorsed in cases such as CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd. (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175, in order to determine the scope of the provision it is necessary to look beyond the words of section EF 1 and consider its underlying purpose. This is discussed below. Section EF 1(5)(d) - Choses in action Section EF 1(5)(d) deals with choses in action. A chose in action is not defined for the purposes of the section. Both “goods” and “services” are defined as not including choses in action. A “chose in action” is an expression used “to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by physical possession”: 39 Torkington v Magee \[1902\] 2 KB 427, 430. A warranty is an enforceable right under a contract and as such is a chose in action. Section EF 1(5)(d) applies to expenditure which relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action. On a similar basis as for sections EF 1(5)(a) and (b), the types of warranty expenditure potentially within the provision may be identified as follows: • the payment by the taxpayer for, or in relation to, a chose for the benefit of the taxpayer; and/or • the payment by the taxpayer for, or in relation to, a chose for the benefit of a third party; and/or • expenditure paid for by the taxpayer, being ancillary, or relating to, the payment for any such chose in action. As for sections EF 1(5)(a) and (b), because of the phrase “relates to”, it is possible to argue that the payment for the chose in action does not need to be made by the taxpayer in question. It is enough if the expenditure merely relates to a payment made by a third party for a chose in action. However, again, it is considered that the better view is that the inclusion of the word “for” requires that the expenditure be for (or in relation to) a chose in action paid for by the taxpayer; the chose being for either the benefit of the taxpayer or a third party. It is considered that the words “relates to” must be read in the light of the word “for”. As for section EF 1(5)(b), this analysis then raises the question of whether a warrantor can be said to have paid for a chose in action in terms of the estimated warranty expenditure. With regard to warranties, it is the customer that has the benefit of the warranty, i.e. the right to make a claim in the event of a defect appearing within the warranty period. It is the customer’s chose in action, and not the warrantor’s. On that basis, it is suggested no payment is made for a chose for the direct benefit of the taxpayer. However, in certain cases it may be possible to argue that a payment is made for the customer’s chose in action by a warrantor. Again, it is considered that whether this is the case in any particular situation will depend on the exact terms of the dealership arrangements (including the relevant warranty) and the basis on which payment is made by the warrantor to dealers. On a literal interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d), it is acknowledged that to the extent that payment is made for the underlying warranty, even though this will be for the direct benefit of customers and not the taxpayer/warrantor seeking the deduction, the provision may apply. “in relation to” In addition, unlike sections EF 1(5)(a) and 1(5)(b), section EF 1(5)(d) also includes the words “in relation to”. As seen, the words “in relation to” tend to have been interpreted in a broad manner by the courts. By the inclusion of these words it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended to broaden the application of section EF 1(5)(d), when compared with sections EF 1(5)(a) and 1(5)(b). 40 A similar phrase, “for or in connection with”, as it appears in section 26AB of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (which deals with payments for the grant or assignment of a lease) was considered in Berry v FCT (1953) 89 CLR 653. The Court in that case concluded that the words “for or in connection with” covered a payment received for something other than the main property in question, so long as the receipt of the payment had a substantial relation, in a practical business sense, to that property. This might suggest that the words “for or in relation to” are wide enough to cover a payment made by a warrantor for warranty costs, in that although that payment may not be for the chose in action (i.e. the warranty) it is a payment made “in relation to” that chose. To that extent, section EF 1(5)(d) would apply to the estimated future warranty costs. However, such an interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d) requires reading the words “for, or in relation to” disjunctively. That is, the section will apply even if the taxpayer has not made any payment for, or is obliged to make any payment for, the acquisition of the underlying chose in action. Provided that a payment has been made in relation to that chose, that will be enough to come within the section. A narrower interpretation would be that for the provision to apply the taxpayer must have made payment for a chose in action, before any other payment made in relation to that payment is caught. However, it is acknowledged that the difficulty with this argument is that it tends to attribute the same meaning to the words “in relation to” and “relates to”, i.e. expenses ancillary to the principal payment for the underlying chose. Unless it can be accepted that the words are simply otiose, principles of statutory interpretation suggest that the words “in relation to” have a meaning distinct from the words “relates to”. One possible meaning for the phrase would be that it extends the provision to apply to expenditure which merely relates to a third party’s chose in action. On this basis section EF 1(5)(d) would be potentially wide enough to cover a deduction for future estimated warranty costs made by a warrantor. A further difficulty with adopting a broad interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d) arises out of the way in which the unexpired portion is calculated. The provision states that the amount of the unexpired portion is “the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period, in relation to which the chose is enforceable”. In the context of warranty expenditure it is difficult to find a relationship between that expenditure and the warranty period. This method of calculating the unexpired portion of the accrual expenditure suggests that section EF 1(5)(d) was intended to apply to the cost of acquiring choses in action for the taxpayer’s own benefit, rather than other types of payment relating to a third party’s chose in action. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(d) As for section EF 1(5)(b), section EF 1(5)(d) permits of more than one interpretation. Applying a broad interpretation, the provision potentially applies to all warranty expenditure to the extent that the terms of any particular warranty arrangement involves the warrantor paying for the underlying warranty, although not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the customer. This is consistent with the wide judicial interpretation that tends to be given to the phrase “relates to”. In addition, the 41 inclusion of the phrase “in relation to”, suggests that section EF 1(5)(d) is broad enough to encompass such payments. A narrower approach would restrict the provision to situations where the taxpayer is paying for a warranty (and/or ancillary expenses) where the warranty is for its own benefit. As for section EF 1(5)(b), given this ambiguity, it is considered that in order to determine the scope of section EF 1(5)(d) it is necessary to look beyond the words of the provision and consider the underlying purpose of section EF 1, as may be determined from the legislative background to the provision, and relevant case law. Purpose of section EF 1 Legislative background Section EF 1 forms part of the accruals regime enacted in 1987. As previously noted, the Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (October 1986) proposed a test of delivery (rather than the current “use” test) for expenditure relating to the purchase of goods. At paragraph 14.2.1 it states: Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on the purchase of goods will be deemed to relate to the income year in which the goods are supplied or provided to the taxpayer. (Emphasis added) At that stage, at least in regard to “goods”, it seems clear that the goods in question had to be goods acquired by the taxpayer seeking the deduction. The Consultative Document also deals with services. The commentary does not make it clear whether or not the services must be performed for the direct benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction. However, the thrust of the discussion, and the examples given, suggest that this was the focus. At paragraph 14.2.2, dealing with “services”, the following comments are made: Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on services will be deemed to relate to the income year in which the services are provided. Where the expenditure is for services to be provided in more than one income year, the expenditure related to each income year will be determined on the basis of the fair market value at the date the expenditure is incurred of (sic) the services provided that year. A written statement from the supplier of the services to the purchaser will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of the amount of the total expenditure relating to the services in each year. ... Expenditure incurred on contingent service contracts (i.e., contracts for the supply of services contingent upon certain events, such as a contract for the repair of equipment in the event that the equipment breaks down) is to be pro-rated over the period to which the contract relates. (Emphasis added) It is considered that although this extract does not expressly say that the services in question must be performed for the benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction, this seems a reasonable implication. The assumption is that the “purchaser” of the services is the taxpayer seeking the deduction. In the case of contingent service contracts, the assumption is that the taxpayer is the party which has paid for the benefit of the contract, e.g. to cover any breakdown of its equipment. 42 By the time of the Consultative Committee’s Report of April 1987, the test for determining whether expenditure in relation to the purchase of goods was fully deductible had changed to a “goods used” test. A “use test” makes it at least arguable that the goods do not have to be those of the taxpayer (on a broad interpretation payment need only relate to the purchase of goods by a third party). However, there is nothing in the report to suggest that the “use test” was intended to be wider in this respect than the former delivery test. The focus is on a test analogous to the trading stock regime (i.e. a regime dealing with expenditure on stock acquired by the relevant taxpayer). Paragraphs 60 to 62 of Part II of the Report indicate that the emphasis was on consumable aids, i.e. non-capital goods used by a business in the production of assessable income which are not trading stock. The reference to consumable aids again suggests that the Committee had the purchase of goods by the taxpayer seeking the deduction in mind. Statements by Inland Revenue released shortly after the enactment of the precursor to section EF 1 also tend to show that the focus was on goods, services, or choses acquired by the taxpayer for the direct benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction, with the timing of that deduction being linked to the application of that expenditure to the production of assessable income: Public Information Bulletin No 167 (December 1987), paragraphs 14 and 35. Case law Section EF 1 has recently been considered by the Court of Appeal, on appeal from the High Court decision: Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230. The case concerned a property developer which acquired land for development. In the year of acquisition it claimed a deduction for the cost of the land, development costs, and other expenses which it argued were directly attributable to the utilisation of the land. The taxpayer maintained that it did not have to bring to account the value of the land, nor, alternatively, any expenditure on purchasing and developing the land, as a corresponding revenue item. High Court Hansen J held that although the taxpayer was entitled to a deduction for the expenditure (under the equivalent to section BD 2(1)(b)), this was subject to the application of section EF 1. Section EF 1(5) applied to the purchase of goods, which included real property. The taxpayer argued that under section EF 1(5)(a) the land (i.e. the good) had been “used” as soon as it had been applied for the production of assessable income. This meant that the total costs associated with the land could be taken as a deduction from the time the development commenced, even though the use was spread over a number of income-producing years. Hansen J rejected the taxpayer’s argument and concluded that the land was not used in terms of section EF 1(5)(a) until the land was sold, i.e. it had produced assessable income - this treatment being analogous to the treatment of trading stock. In reaching this conclusion, Hansen J rejected the taxpayer’s arguments for adopting the ordinary 43 meaning of the word “use”. Instead he was prepared to apply a “scheme and purpose” approach to the interpretation of section EF 1 (at page 12,245): In my view, it is correct to interpret this legislation in that manner. As was noted earlier, the purpose of the accrual regime was to achieve tax symmetry by the matching of expenditure and income. It seems to me that for the legislation to have the required effect, it is necessary to interpret and apply these sections in the manner the Commissioner has done in this particular case. To interpret “use” in the manner Mr Martin urged me to would be to make the accruals regime pursuant to s104, if not totally ineffective, then very close to it. (Emphasis added) Court of Appeal In an unanimous decision the Court disallowed the taxpayer’s appeal. The Court found that where a land developer is entitled to deduct expenditure on the acquisition and development of land, section EF 1 requires that that part of the expenditure which relates to land still on hand at balance date must be added back under section EF 1(1). This result was considered to be consistent with the purpose of section EF 1 – to match deductible expenditure and revenue production. Richardson P noted (at page 13,581): A crucial problem addressed by the special regimes \[financial arrangements, leases of personal property and accrual expenditure\] was that the timing of tax deductions and income recognition was not symmetrical. In particular expenditure might be deductible much earlier than when the income to which it related would be assessable. The mismatch allowed taxpayers scope to defer taxes even where there was a resulting asset held in the interim on revenue account, depending on the terms of the general legislation. ... The obvious purpose implicit in s\[EF 1\] is to match deductible expenditure and revenue production. The section focuses on the effect of expenditure in the current year by bringing into account as income and thereby offsetting the expenditure by that part of the expenditure which remains attributable to the future period. In discussing the scheme of section EF 1, his Honour went on to note (at page 13,582): The next step in the statutory matching scheme is to ascertain the extent to which the effect of expenditure is referable to the subsequent year. Under the description of “the unexpired portion...of any amount of accrual expenditure” paras (a), (b) and (c) of s104A \[paras (a), (b) and (d) of sEF 1(5)\] deal with goods, services and choses in action respectively. Under (b) the unexpired portion is “the amount of expenditure incurred on services performed”. Under (c) the unexpired portion is “the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable”. Under (a) the unexpired portion is “the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in the production of assessable income”. In all three cases the apportionment is time related: under (a) it is the goods yet to be used; under (b) it is the services yet to be performed; and under (c) it is the amount for which the charge is then enforceable. In harmony with (b) and (c) the assumption underlying (a) is that the extent that goods, including land, have not been used in the production of assessable income, the amount of the accrual expenditure is not attributable to the income year when the expenditure was incurred but belongs to the next year and subsequent years. The subsection proceeds on the premise that in such cases the effect of the expenditure is not spent and there is an unexpired portion of expenditure to be included in the assessable income for the income year (subs(4) \[subs(1)\]). (Emphasis added) The Court of Appeal rejected the taxpayer’s argument that “used” in the precursor to section EF 1(5)(a) meant “employed, applied, committed or dedicated”, preferring the meaning “used up”. That meaning was considered to be consistent with the matching purpose of the legislation (at page 13,583): 44 The obvious purpose of the accruals provision is to achieve a closer matching of the timing of deductions and income recognition for tax purposes. To that end s104A \[sEF 1\] allows the taxpayer the benefit of the deduction as and when goods purchased on revenue account are expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets. The net result reflecting the income earning activity is that while the expenditure is deductible in full the unexpired portion is brought back in as assessable income, the assumption being that the difference, i.e. the expired portion, has been reflected in product sales or in products on hand. The contrary interpretation espoused by Mr Martin ignores the continued existence and continuing availability for the use of the land in its then state beyond the income year. That interpretation would produce an irrational result turning on how much of the land has been subjected to development work rather than what was still on hand at the end of the income year. It would also undermine the purpose of the accruals regime and would be inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles and commercial practice. (Emphasis added) The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision and confirmed that the underlying purpose of section EF 1 is to match the timing of the deduction of revenue expenditure with the production of assessable income to which it relates. Notwithstanding these comments, in seeking to determine what is the underlying purpose of section EF 1, it is acknowledged that an alternative argument may be made. On the basis of the language of section EF 1(5) it is arguable that the purpose of the legislation is to match the timing of deductions for expenditure with the actual benefit that flows from that expenditure (by the use of the goods, the performance of services or the expiry of the period of the relevant chose in action), rather than the income derived by virtue of such expenditure. The matching of the timing of deductions with the benefit through consumption derived from such expenditure will not always correspond with the matching of deductions and the production of income from that expenditure. In Thornton Estates, the Court of Appeal was not confronted with a situation where, although the expenditure in question had been used to derive income (product sales), the direct benefit of that expenditure had not yet arisen (e.g. benefits flowing to a third party under a warranty in terms of the provision of goods and services to repair defective vehicles). In that case, at the time the deduction was taken for the expenditure, although arguably the taxpayer had received the direct benefit of that expenditure (e.g. goods and services acquired to develop the land), it had not been used to derive income. This would only arise when, and to the extent that, the land was subsequently sold. Notwithstanding this difference, it is considered that the Court of Appeal decision stands for the principle that section EF 1 should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the matching of expenditure and income. Applying such an approach to the facts in Mitsubishi leads to the result that section EF 1 does not apply because its application causes a mis-matching of the timing of the deduction (for warranty costs) with the income that flows from that expenditure (vehicle sale proceeds). This is also inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles and commercial practice as referred to by the Court of Appeal in Thornton Estates, and by the Privy Council in reaching their decision in Mitsubishi. 45 Conclusions Inland Revenue considers that section EF 1 is not limited to pre-payments of accrual expenditure and therefore has potential application to future estimated warranty expenditure. It is acknowledged that it is possible to argue that the words of section EF 1, when applied to the same or similar facts to those in Mitsubishi, are wide enough to cover expenditure incurred by a warrantor. This would be on the basis that the warranty expenditure relates to payment for services (either provided to the warrantor or to the customer), or because it is for, or in relation to, a chose in action (the warranty). However, it would appear that a payment which is a reimbursement or indemnification for the cost of services provided, as distinct from a payment for services, is not covered. In the case of services, applying section EF 1 means that the expenditure is not deductible until the warranty has been honoured by the performance of the repair services. In the case of a chose, the expenditure would need to be spread over the period of the underlying warranty. However, it is unclear on the words of the provision which subsection (section EF 1(5)(b) or 1(5)(d)) would apply in any particular case. (The result will be different given the different way in which the unexpired portion is calculated.) It is also unclear why Parliament would have intended a wider interpretation to apply to services and choses in action, than to goods – the better view of section EF 1(5)(a) being that it is limited to payments for goods acquired for the benefit of the taxpayer. It may be suggested that this difficulty of classification stems from the fact that although estimated future warranty expenditure may be for the future supply of particular goods or services (repair of the defective vehicle), prima facie they are payments made to honour a warranty. That is to say, they are first and foremost warranty costs. Given this uncertainty on the words of the provision, it is necessary to consider the underlying purpose of section EF 1 as demonstrated by the legislative background to the provision, and considered by the courts (most notably the Court of Appeal in Thornton Estates). That analysis shows that the section is aimed at achieving matching of the timing of deductions with the income flowing from that expenditure and should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with that purpose. To apply section EF 1 to facts analogous to those arising in Mitsubishi would result in a taxation treatment that differs from matching in those terms. Therefore, Inland Revenue accepts that section EF 1 does not apply to require the adding back of warranty expenditure in the same or similar factual situations to those which arose in Mitsubishi.
\[Interpretation statement IS3970 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in April 1998\] “FORESTRY”: WHETHER OR NOT IT IS INCLUDED IN THE SECTION CD 1(7) DEFINITION OF “FARMING OR AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS” Summary This item states the Commissioner’s view on whether “forestry” falls within the definition of “farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under this interpretation, the Commissioner accepts that “forestry” falls within the definition of “farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background The Commissioner’s previous policy, dated January 1993, sets out the activities Inland Revenue considers are carried on for agricultural or farming purposes. It specifically does not include the growing of trees for the production of timber in the definition of agriculture and farming. The following specified activities were considered to be carried on for farming and agricultural purposes: beekeeping, animal husbandry, dairy farming, grain and seed growing, market gardening, fruit growing, poultry farming, sharemilking, tobacco growing, and vegetable growing. The following activities specifically did not qualify: dealing in livestock, leasing or bailing livestock by the bailor, aerial topdressing, growing trees for the production of timber, and providing services to persons carrying on a farming or agricultural business, e.g. services provided by agricultural contractors and seed cleaners. Legislation Section CD 1(2) includes in a taxpayer’s gross income, any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in some seven categorised circumstances. Section CD 1(7) excludes from the gross income of a taxpayer any amount derived from the sale or disposition of land resulting from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, “or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business”. The following requirements must all be satisfied before the exemption applies: • The land sold must have resulted from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before the division was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, or both, primarily or principally for the purpose of a farming or agricultural business that the relevant persons carried on. • The Commissioner must be satisfied that the land sold is of such an area and nature that it is presently capable of being worked as an economic unit in a farming or agricultural business. 1 2 • The Commissioner must be satisfied, having regard to the circumstances in which the land was disposed of, that the land was disposed of primarily and principally for the purpose of it being utilised in a farming or agricultural business. Application The question of whether forestry is included in the expression “farming or agricultural business” has been considered by the courts in relation to other sections of the Act that use similar wording, but not directly in relation to section CD 1(7). Earlier cases tended towards the view that forestry was not included in the definition of “farming and agriculture”. In Gilchrist v Lanarkshire Assessors (1895) 35 Sc LR 663, the Court had to consider whether a greenhouse used for growing tomatoes was an erection or a structural improvement made or required for agricultural purposes. Lord Stormouth Darling said at page 665: Now that question must be solved by considering the meaning of the phrase in its ordinary acceptation. The appellant considers that a market garden is an agricultural subject because it effects the culture of the ground. No doubt it does but there are three main methods of utilising the soil, which are expressed by the terms agriculture, horticulture and forestry. These three things are distinguishable, and any one of them is not to be held as including any other without special provision to that effect. In Horniblow v Napier \[1985\] NZLR 105, the question was whether an orcharidist was a farmer for the purposes of the Transport Act 1949. Barrowclough CJ referred to the Gilchrist case and said at page 105: It might be very unsafe to accept as applicable to this country’s special type of husbandry (I deliberately use a new and comprehensive word), a classification that was applicable in Scotland over fifty years ago. But it appears to me that that classification is adaptable to New Zealand conditions, and is a classification which is commonly accepted here. Agriculture is essentially the business of the farmer. That is recognised in the interpretation clause of the Transport Act 1949, where the phrase ‘agriculture purpose’ is defined ‘as a purpose concerned directly with the management of a farm’. I would conclude that a farmer is one engaged in the first of the three methods of utilizing the soil referred to by Lord Stormonth Darling, and consequently that a person engaged in either of the two other methods is not a farmer. The viticulturist is in the second group comprising those who utilize the soil of a garden; and so also, is the fruitgrower or an orchardist. They are not properly referred to as farmers. The silviculturist is in the third group; and he too, is not properly referred to as a farmer. In 1994, in the Court of Appeal decision of Hill v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,037, Richardson J concluded that agriculture and farming might include forestry. The Court of Appeal considered whether forestry was included within the expression “farming or agricultural business” in terms of section 126 and 127 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In this case, Richardson J who delivered the judgment of the Court stated at page 11,046: “Farming” and “agricultural” are broad flexible words and the use of both expressions in the phrase on its face suggests that a broad approach casting a wide net was intended. But the particular meaning to be accorded to the words depends on the context in which they are used. In order to determine the intended application of the phrase in ss 126 and 127 it is also necessary to set the sections in context in the Income Tax Act as a whole. After briefly considering the earlier cases, Richardson J stated at page 11,047: 3 Horniblow v Napier and Hill v Rothwell were decided 40 years ago and Gilchrist is even more remote in time. But the classification in Gilchrist and the approach in Re Walker and Township of Uxbridge perhaps indicate that variable meanings and shades of meaning may attach to such expressions. At the same time it is apparent from any reference to standard dictionaries that in their ordinary sense the words have wide meanings. Thus the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definitions are indicative of the potential breadth of the expression. Agriculture is defined as “the science and art of cultivating the soil; including the gathering in of the crops and the rearing of livestock; farming (in the widest sense)”. Farming is “the business of cultivating land , raising stock etc” and a farm is “a tract of land held...for the purpose of cultivation; sometimes specialised as dairy-, grass-, poultry-farm. Also a tract of water used as a preserve, eg fish, oyster, etc.” Interestingly forestry is defined as “the science and art of forming and cultivating forests, management of growing timber”. Closer to home the two Australian dictionaries , The Macquarie Dictionary and Tasman Dictionary, both define agriculture as “the cultivation of land, including crop-raising, forestry, stock raising, etc; farming. Richardson J concluded that: Sufficient has been said to show that in New Zealand usage agricultural and farming may include forestry. But in determining the intended scope of the expression “farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand” and so in deciding the intended reach of ss 126 and 127 it is necessary to consider the context...In our view it is a necessary implication from ss 126 and 127 considered in their statutory setting that they did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry. Richardson J considered by way of necessary implication that sections 126 and 127 when they were considered in their statutory setting did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry, because Parliament subsequently legislated specifically (in section 127A) to provide a similar deductibility regime for any taxpayer who carried on any forestry business. In doing so it allowed for the same range of expenses and followed the model of sections 126 and 127, which would, of course, have been unnecessary had those two provisions already applied to forestry. This did not, however, detract from his initial conclusion that the phrase “farming or agriculture” might include forestry on an ordinary meaning of the words. Whilst not all dictionaries give a consistent indication, several other dictionary meanings also indicate that farming and agriculture include forestry: Webster’s International Dictionary, Second Edition, gives a wide meaning to the word “agriculture”: The art or science of cultivating the ground, and raising and harvesting crops, often including also feeding, breeding, and management of livestock; tillage, husbandry; farming; in a broader sense, the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man, including to a variable extent the preparation of these products for man’s use and their disposal by marketing or otherwise. In this broad use it includes farming, horticulture, forestry, dairying, sugar making, etc. Funk and Wagnall’s New Standard Dictionary gives this definition of “agriculture”: 1. The cultivation of the soil for food-products or any other useful or valuable growths of the field or garden; tillage; husbandry; also by extension, farming, including any industry practised by a cultivator of the soil in connection with such cultivation, as forestry, fruit-raising, breeding and rearing of stock, dairying, market-gardening, etc. There is also overseas authority to support the approach that the phrase “farming or agriculture” includes forestry. In Canada, forestry is considered to be a farming activity. “Farming” is defined in section 248 of the Canadian Income Tax Act 1994 to include the various activities of 4 a person who is engaged in the business of earning income from the tillage of soil, the raising or exhibiting of livestock, the maintenance of horses for racing or exhibiting, the raising of poultry, the keeping of bees, fur farming, dairy farming, and fruit growing. The definition is not exhaustive and it has been decided by the courts that farming also includes tree farming: Her Majesty the Queen v Douglas C Matthews 74 DTC 6193, \[1974\] CTC 230(FCTD). Revenue Canada’s Interpretation Bulletin IT—373R March 14 1985 relating to farm woodlots and tree farms states that proceeds from the sale of logs, lumber, poles or Christmas trees are income from farming. It also states that a taxpayer who is not otherwise engaged in a lumbering or logging business and who undertakes the reforestation of an area of land with the objective of producing mature trees at a date that may be 40 or 50 years in the future, or even longer, is considered to be farming. Possible alternative interpretations Certain provisions in the Income Tax Act indicate that (for those provisions at least) Parliament had clearly intended “farming and agriculture” to not include forestry by having explicit separate treatments. The decision in Hill illustrates one such example, and others include the Income Equalisation provisions in sub-part EI of the Act, and sections DZ 2 and DZ 3. It could certainly be argued that this indicates it was Parliament’s intention or understanding that forestry was not included in the phrase “farming and agriculture”. Whilst such an argument does have some merit, it is considered that the better approach is that expressed by Richardson J in Hill, that forestry does generally come within the phrase, unless the context of a particular provision indicates otherwise. Accordingly, each provision needs to be examined separately, and whilst some (such as those discussed above) will result in a conclusion that forestry is not included, section CD 1 has no such contextual reasons to overturn the general proposition that forestry is included. It might also be suggested that the use of the word “worked” in section CD 1(7) can be seen as suggesting a greater level of day to day activity than might be involved in small to medium scale forestry operations. However, the word “worked” is capable of a wide meaning ranging from the application of mental or physical effort for a purpose to cultivating land. The ordinary meaning of the word “worked” tends to suggest that there must be some form of physical activity, but does not necessarily require any particular activity level. Many activities that are clearly regarded as a “farming or agricultural business” do not demand day to day physical work on the part of the proprietor. The existing case law in New Zealand simply analyses as a whole the meaning of the phrase “worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7). It does not look at the meaning of each word in the phrase in isolation. 5 Conclusion The words “farming or agriculture” in their ordinary usage may include forestry. The wording and context of section CD 1(7) do not prevent this interpretation. The New Zealand Court of Appeal case of Hill supports the interpretation that agriculture and farming may include forestry. Several dictionary meanings of these words indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry. Case law and a revenue interpretation bulletin in Canada also indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry The phrase “farming and agriculture” has a wider meaning now than it did many years ago as technology has advanced, and agricultural practices have changed over time. In New Zealand and in the previously mentioned overseas jurisdictions, the ordinary meaning of “farming and agriculture” may include forestry. In determining whether forestry is included in any phrase of the Income Tax Act, the context of the section must be examined. For the purposes of section CD 1(7), forestry is included in the phrase “agriculture and farming”. There is nothing in the context of section CD 1(7) to indicate that forestry is not included. It should also be noted that any claim for exemption under section CD 1(7) in respect of a forestry activity must not only satisfy paragraphs (a) and (c) (“farming or agricultural business”), but the land under consideration must also be “capable of being worked as an economic unit” as required by paragraph (b) of section CD 1(7).
\[Interpretation statement IS9708 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in July 1998\] AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL—CONSEQUENCES OF DEEMED REREGISTRATION Introduction Under the Income Tax Act 1994, the concept of “available subscribed capital” (ASC) is important in determining whether a distribution by a company to its shareholders is a dividend or a return of capital. The definition of available subscribed capital in section OB 1 is concerned with calculating the amount of available subscribed capital referable to a particular class of share at a point in time. Essentially, it reflects the amounts paid to the company on the issue of shares, less amounts paid out on the repurchase of shares when those amounts are not dividends. Under the Companies Reregistration Act 1993, any company registered under the Companies Act 1955 is deemed reregistered under the Companies Act 1993 as from the close of 30 June 1997 (or some Court-approved extended time). One effect of reregistration is that the previous memorandum and articles of the company cease to have effect, and the company is then governed by the provisions in the Companies Act 1993. Under section 28 of the Companies Act 1993, companies without a constitution have rights, powers, duties and obligations as set out in that Act. Further, section 36 sets out shareholder rights and powers for such companies, and in particular provides that a share in a company confers on the holder: the right to vote, dividends, and an equal share in the distribution of surplus company assets. If a company has more than one share class, those share classes merge into the ordinary share class. We have been asked what effect, if any, the merging of share classes, pursuant to a deemed reregistration under the Companies Reregistration Act 1993, has on ASC. Legislation Available subscribed capital is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The relevant parts of the definition are: Available subscribed capital, ..., means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula in respect of all shares of the same class (referred to in this definition as the “specified class”) as the share: a + b - c where - a is - (i) In the case of any company which existed before 1 July 1994, the transitional capital amount; and 1 (ii) In any other case, nil; and b is the aggregate amount of consideration received by the company on or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time in respect of the issue of all shares in the company of the specified class, including as consideration - ... c is the aggregate of amounts distributed- (i) Upon the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class; and (ii) On or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time; and ... This definition looks at relevant amounts attributable to shares of the same class (referred to as the “specified class”). The formula calculates the total amount the company received on the issue of a particular class of share, less the total amounts distributed by the company following any acquisition, cancellation, or redemption of the shares. Generally, shares remain in their specified class and the calculation of ASC is relatively straightforward. But if shares move from a class to become members of another class (“altered shares”) as a result of deemed reregistration, the ASC calculation becomes a little more complex. Effect of alteration With an alteration of shareholder rights, a number of issues emerge: • Does an alteration have the effect of cancelling shares • To what class do the altered shares belong • On what basis is ASC calculated for altered shares • On rectification of altered shares, what is the value of consideration received? No share cancellation An alteration of shareholder rights is not a cancellation and reissue of shares. The shareholder still owns the original shares, but certain entitlements attaching to the shares are varied in some way. The appropriate class For ASC purposes, a specified class is a reference to “shares of the same class” as defined in section OB 1. This definition generally classifies shares on the basis of any 2 (or more shares) having similar attributes. For example, shares of the same class have identical rights as to voting, decision making, and distribution entitlements. The effect of deemed reregistration is that all shares become, at the time of deemed reregistration, members of the ordinary share class. 2 ASC following deemed reregistration The ASC definition looks at the balance of the consideration received for all shares in the specified class at the time of calculation, less relevant distributions. For shares originally issued in the specified class, paragraph (b) credits amounts received on issue and paragraph (c) debits amounts distributed. The definition is concerned with all shares in the specified class at the relevant time - being the time when ASC is calculated. The altered shares simply become members of the new specified class at the time of alteration, and the ASC amount of the altered shares is included in the calculation of ASC of the new specified class. For “altered” shares, a focus on amounts credited and debited at issue is not appropriate because ASC is calculated in terms of the “new” specified class. Accordingly, the altered share component of the ASC of the ordinary share class should reflect the ASC balance as at the time of alteration. This approach avoids the ASC of the altered shares being trapped in its original specified class. The ASC of the altered shares is the balance of the consideration received for all shares in the altered shares class, less relevant distributions. This calculation is made as at the time of the alteration, being the close of 30 June 1997 or such later day if a Court has granted an extended time to reregister. Rectification of shareholder rights If a company decides to alter the rights attaching to a share class, the possibility of varying the relative interests of shareholders arises because of the potential dilution of shareholder rights. The Companies Act 1993 minimises the potential impact of this by ensuring that the company does not take any action that affects the rights attached to shares, unless the action has been approved by a special resolution. With deemed reregistration, the shareholders do not have the option to decide on the variation of their rights. The rights are altered by statute. For ASC purposes the merging of different specified classes, due to deemed reregistration, may dilute the rights and subscribed capital originally received for shares in the original share class and in the altered classes. If the company takes no action to “rectify” the effect of the alteration of shareholder rights (such as creating a new class of share), the amount of ASC for the specified class will include the ASC amounts for the altered shares as at the time of deemed reregistration. However, if a company proposes to rectify the effect of the variation, the question arises as to the value of the consideration received for the shares. • Is it the original issue price • Is it calculated on the ASC value per share as at the time of deemed reregistration • Is it found by dividing the ASC for the specified class by the number of shares in the 3 class immediately prior to rectification? In the Commissioner’s view, when enacting the definition of ASC Parliament did not expressly turn its mind to the potential effect of deemed reregistration. However, it is clear that the definition of ASC is concerned with calculating the balance of consideration received less distributions of shares in a share class. Like deemed reregistration, a rectification is not an issue of shares. Accordingly, the relevant consideration should be calculated as at the time the altered shares join the new specified class, i.e. immediately prior to the rectification. On this basis, it is appropriate that, if a company alters the shareholder rights to rectify the effect of deemed reregistration, it is the proportionate amount of ASC, calculated by dividing the ASC for the specified class by the number of shares in the class immediately prior to rectification, that becomes the ASC of the rectified class. Reissue of shares The result outlined above may be contrasted with one where, instead of a reclassification, the shares of the other class (e.g. preference shares) are redeemed by conversion into ordinary shares. Whereas a reclassification is an alteration of the rights attaching to existing shares, a conversion involves the issue of new shares. For ASC purposes, the consideration received for the ordinary shares is not based on the price of preference shares at the time of issue, but it is the market value at the point of conversion. This reflects the reality that the conversion triggers a tax event in the form of a cancellation and new issue, while a reclassification, of itself, does not. Examples The following examples illustrate the operation of this approach. Example 1: pre-deemed reregistration This example illustrates the calculation of ASC as at 29 June 1997 (prior to deemed reregistration). A company is formed on 1 August 1994, and issues 10,000 ordinary shares at $1 per share. It issues a further 5,000 ordinary shares at $1 per share on 1 December 1994; at the same time issuing 4,000 preference shares at $1.50. A further issue of 3,000 preference shares (at $1.50 per share) is made on March 1 1996. The company decides to cancel some ordinary shares and redeem some preference shares. On 1 December 1996, 4,000 ordinary shares are cancelled at $1.50 per share. On the same day, the company redeems 2,000 preference shares at $2.00 per share. Calculation of ASC 4 Ordinary share class ASC is defined as: a + b - c a = nil b = all consideration received in respect of the issue of ordinary shares, i.e. $10,000 + $5,000 = $15,000 c = the aggregate amount distributed upon the cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class = $6,000 (4,000 at $1.50 per share) ASC for ordinary share class is $9,000 ($15,000 - $6,000). Preference share class a = nil b = $10,500 (7,000 shares at $1.50 per share) c = $4,000 (2,000 shares at $2.00 per share) ASC for preference share class is $6,500. Example 2: post-deemed reregistration This example illustrates the ASC calculation following deemed reregistration. This example uses the same facts as Example 1, except that the ASC is measured as at 1 July 1997. Calculation of ASC Due to deemed reregistration, there are no longer any shares in the preference share class and therefore no ASC to calculate for that class. Ordinary share class Prior to the alteration of rights, the ASC in the ordinary class was $9,000 and in the preference share class, $6,500 (see Example 1). The effect of the alteration of rights is that the preference shares become ordinary shares. The “altered” preference shares (and the ASC amount) simply join the ordinary share class. The ASC amount is $15,500. This amount includes the amount of ASC for the ordinary shares as calculated in Example 1 ($9,000) and the ASC balance of the preference shares when they became ordinary shares as calculated in Example 1 ($6,500). 5 Example 3: rectification In this example the company wishes to re-establish the preference share class, and to this end, on July 10 1997 it alters the rights of 3,000 ordinary shares. Calculation of ASC Preference share class When shares join another class, the relevant ASC goes with them. In this example 3,000 ordinary shares become preference shares and the ASC for these shares must be calculated as at the time of reclassification. This figure is found by calculating the value of the ASC per ordinary share, multiplied by the number of shares reclassified. • ASC for the ordinary shares (at the time of reclassification) = $15,500 (see Example 2). • Number of ordinary shares on issue = 16,000 (see Example 1). ASC per ordinary share = ($15,500/16,000) = $0.96875. Accordingly the value of the ASC for the 3,000 preference shares is $2,906. Ordinary share class The ASC for the ordinary share class following reclassification can be found by calculating the ASC for the class (prior to reclassification), less the ASC for the preference shares ($2,906). Prior to reclassification, the consideration received in respect of the issue of the ordinary shares is \[10,000 x $1\] + \[5,000 x $1\] + \[ASC for the “altered” preference shares = ($6,500)\] = $21,500. b = $21,500 c = the aggregate amount distributed upon the cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class = $6,000 (4,000 at $1.50 per share). ASC for the ordinary share class is $15,500 ($21,500 - $6000) After reclassification, 3,000 ordinary shares become preference shares and item ‘b’ becomes $21,500 - $2,906 = $18,594. Item ‘c’ = $6,000 ASC for the ordinary share class is $12,594 ($18,594 - $6,000). 6 7

Issues paper on GST integrity open for feedback
===============================================

**17 May 2019**

Inland Revenue has released an issues paper on how to align an aspect of GST with international best practice and principles. Revenue Minister Stuart Nash is encouraging interested parties to make submissions by 28 June.

“New Zealand’s tax rules are held up internationally as a model for a good way to levy and collect a Goods and Services Tax or a Value Added Tax”, Mr Nash says. Ideally a GST or VAT should be broad-based with few exceptions and flexible enough to respond to changing circumstances and business models and commercial practices.

“Our system of GST works because of its simplicity and coherence. But that simplicity requires a lot of ongoing maintenance to keep pace with changes. For example the previous government introduced GST on services purchased online such as music streaming.

“This work is continuing and later this year I will launch public consultation on a range of other important maintenance issues. A current example is the loophole which allows special rules for telecommunications services.

“These are now out of step with the OECD’s guidelines for GST and VAT and for establishing taxing rights. This raises the possibility of a person either being taxed twice or not at all for using global roaming overseas.

“Inland Revenue has therefore released a consultation document which presents details on implementing proposals to align the GST treatment of most telecommunications services with the treatment of other remote services like digital downloads.

“Under the OECD’s best practice guidelines, a consumer’s usual place of residence is used to determine which country has the right to tax the consumption of remote services. This means a remote service should generally be subject to New Zealand GST when it is supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer.

“The OECD guidelines define remote services as services where it is not necessary for the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a digital download). The OECD’s definition of remote services is broad and includes telecommunication services.

“Therefore under these guidelines supplies of telecommunications services for example on international roaming services should be subject to GST when consumed by a New Zealand resident regardless of the consumer’s location. It would ensure services rules are consistent with international best practice such as the United Kingdom and European Union.

“New Zealand has already adopted rules in 2016 consistent with the guidelines for most remote services other than telecommunications services. But the 2016 changes did not make that final step regarding telecommunications services. This proposal would close that loophole and protect the coherence of the system.

“To ensure that our GST rules remain fit for purpose, we need to conduct ongoing maintenance and keep pace with best practice,” Stuart Nash says.

The issues paper is at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Consultation closes 28 June 2019

Issues paper on taxation of employee share schemes for start-ups
================================================================

**30 May 2017**

Revenue Minister Judith Collins has today welcomed the release of an officials’ issues paper on the taxation of employee share schemes for start-up companies.

“Employee share schemes are an important remuneration tool for start-ups as they can assist companies to both attract and retain talented staff. However, it is equally important that employee share schemes are taxed like any other form of remuneration.

Generally, employees who receive free or discounted shares from their employer are taxed on that benefit when they acquire the shares.  If the employee is receiving a large proportion of their remuneration in this way, paying the tax can be difficult.  Even valuing the shares can be difficult, if the company is in the early stages of development.

The officials’ issues paper, _Taxation of employee share schemes: start-up companies_ sets out proposed deferral rules aimed specifically at start-up companies with employee share schemes. 

The deferral rules would delay the time when the employee recognises income from the benefit.  Generally the employee would not have income unless and until the shares are sold or listed on a stock exchange.  There would be a seven year limit on the deferral.

“Shares in start-up companies can often be difficult to value or sell, making it hard for employees to meet their tax liabilities when they become the full owner of the shares. Deferring the taxing point should ease that problem,” says Ms Collins.

The issues paper follows the development of new rules for taxing employee share schemes that were included the recently introduced Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Investment and Employment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill.  These recommendations:

*   ensure that employee share scheme benefits are taxed in a similar way to equivalent cash remuneration
*   prevent benefits equivalent to share options being provided tax free
*   give employers a deduction matching the employee’s income
*   expand and modernise the tax exemption for widely offered share schemes.

“The proposals contained in the issues paper are aimed at greater fairness without penalising start-ups,” Ms Collins says.

Submissions on the consultation document at, [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/)
 close on 12 July 2017.

1 EASEMENTS—DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE COSTS OF PREPARATION, STAMPING, AND REGISTRATION This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of expenditure incurred for the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income—previously stated in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/7 Easements – deductibility of costs of preparation, stamping, and registration, published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 10, No. 12 (December 1998). The ruling ceased to apply from 31 March 2002. Public Ruling BR 98/7 has not been reissued as there is some doubt as to whether the arrangement to which the Ruling applied is an arrangement (as defined in the Act) for which a Public Ruling can be issued. Summary All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement considers whether the expenditure incurred for the preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income is deductible under s DJ 11. Section DJ 11 applies as follows: • An easement is a lease for the purposes of section DJ 11. • The Commissioner will allow a deduction for costs incurred by a taxpayer in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements where they are used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred. • Payments made for the grant of an easement are not expenditure incurred in the preparation of an easement and therefore not deductible under s DJ 11. Background Land may have its utility enhanced by the right to the use of an easement. Once registered an easement gives an interest in the land that is of enduring benefit. Under section DJ 11 a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the costs of the preparation, stamping, and registration of “any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income”. Issue The issue is whether an easement is a “lease of property” as defined in the Act. Legislation Section DJ 11 states: 2 A taxpayer is allowed a deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during an income year for the preparation, stamping, and registration of any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, of any renewal of any such lease, or in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of gross income. The following are defined terms in section OB 1: “Estate” or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: “Interest” – ... (b) In relation to land, has the same meaning as “estate” “Lease” – (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: Analysis The nature of an easement The essential elements of an easement, as developed by common law, are that: • there must be a dominant tenement and a servient tenement (Hawkins v Rutter \[1892\] 1 QB 668); and • the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement such that it is related to the utility of the land and must do more than confer a personal benefit on the owner of the land (Re Ellenborough Park \[1955\] 3 All ER 667); and • the dominant owner and servient owner must be different persons (Metropolitan Rly Co v Fowler \[1892\] 1 QB 165); and • the easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of the grant (Re Ellenborough Park). In New Zealand, the common law elements of an easement have been modified by statute. The statutory modification has created “easements in gross”. Section 122 of the Property Law Act 1952 allows the creation of easements in gross. An easement in gross is one where there is no requirement for a dominant tenement. The right created by the easement is not appurtenant to another parcel of land. This modifies the first element of a common law easement, that there be a dominant and servient tenement. While statute permits an easement where there is no dominant tenement, there must be a servient tenement. This is necessary, for if the right granted by the easement arises from ownership of the land, there is no requirement to claim that right as an easement as it already exists. 3 Two other features of an easement, while not defining characteristics, further describe the rights and limitations of an easement: • An easement permanently binds the land over which the right is exercised, and similarly subsists permanently for the benefit of the dominant tenement. One issue that arises is whether the rule against perpetuities applies to an easement. If the right created by the easement vests immediately with the grantee, authority indicates that the rule against perpetuities does not apply (Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104). • The notion that an easement cannot and does not confer a right to possession in the land over which the right is granted (Copeland v Greenhalf \[1952\] 1 All ER 809). An easement is a lease for the purposes of the Act Although an easement is not an estate in land, it is an interest in land as contemplated by the law of real property. In Auckland City Council v Man O’War Station Limited \[1996\] 3 NZLR 460, Anderson J observed: An easement... is an incorporeal hereditament, which is a right in respect of land, and therefore an interest in land, but it is not land in the tangible sense nor an estate in land in the common law sense. \[page 465\] \[emphasis added\] An easement may be distinguished from other lesser rights such as a licence. A licence is a personal right and so does not pass an interest in the land in the way that an easement does (Errington v Errington \[1952\] 1 All ER 149 and Thomas v Sorrell (1673) 124 E.R. 1098). A lease, as contemplated in the law of real property, is an estate of less than freehold. Estates of less than freehold exist where the duration of the estate is certain or capable of being made certain (Charles Clay & Sons Ltd v British Railways Board \[1971\] 1 All ER 1007). Adams EC (Ed) in Garrow’s Law of Real Property (Butterworths, Wellington, 1961) categorises leases whether for a fixed term, at will, or at sufferance as the estates of less than freehold. For the purposes of the Act, a “lease” is defined in section OB 1 as any disposition by which a “leasehold estate” is created. An easement is created by a disposition of property. The owner of the fee simple which will become the servient tenement surrenders, or disposes of, part of his or her right in the land to another person. Also implicit in the definition is that the disposition must create a leasehold estate. That is, the disposition must not be one that, for example, transfers the leasehold estate in the land. An easement qualifies, as it is not a transfer of any interest in the land but the creation of an interest in the land, a right that attaches to land so that it may improve its use and benefit. “Leasehold estate” is also defined, as any estate however created, other than a freehold estate. The concept of a “freehold estate” was developed by common law. A freehold estate is one of uncertain duration: the feature that distinguishes it from an estate of less than freehold, i.e. a lease. In the case of individuals it is uncertain as it is measured by reference to their lives. For corporations, it is uncertain, as they may 4 continue on indefinitely. There are three types of freehold estates in New Zealand: the fee simple which will enure until the holder of the estate dies intestate without heirs, the life estate which will continue only for the life of the holder and is extinguished on that person’s death, and the stratum estate created by section 4(2) of the Unit Titles Act 1972. The term “estate”, also defined in the Act, is coupled with the word “interest”. “Interest” is defined as having in relation to land the same meaning as “estate”. For the purposes of the Act, therefore, the terms “estate” or “interest” are merged and treated synonymously. An easement is an interest in land. A lease is an estate in land. The term “lease” is the nomenclature used in the Act for estates or interest in land unless specifically excluded, such as estates of freehold and mortgages. An easement as an interest in land is therefore a “lease” as defined in the Act. Therefore s DJ 11 applies to the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of easements. Incurred expenditure allowable by the Commissioner It is difficult to identify definitively the types of expenditure incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements. The costs incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements are not specified in the Act. The Courts have not had occasion to consider the types of expenses that are incurred in the “preparation” of an easement in the context of s DJ 11. However, the word “preparation” or “prepare” has been considered judicially (Horsley v Collier and Cartly Ltd \[1965\] 2 All ER 423 and Calabria v R (1982) 151 CLR 671). Those cases point to the word “preparation” indicating something that is done prior to it being ready for its use. Where the character of the expenditure is for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and the easement is used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, then the statutory requirement has been satisfied and a deduction permitted accordingly. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of preparation costs. However, an example of costs that will be allowed are legal costs, registration fees, and surveying costs. Costs for granting of an easement not deductible It is not uncommon for the owner of what will become the servient tenement to receive a sum of money for granting the easement. Payment for the granting of an easement is not part of the preparation expenses. Preparation expenses are expenses incurred in the acts or instances of preparing an easement. Payments for the grant of an easement are payments made in consideration for the grant of an easement and are not expenses incurred in the process of preparing an easement. Payments made for the grant of an easement are not deductible under s DJ 11. Example 5 Farmer Ltd is a company conducting its agricultural and horticultural activities in an area where rainfall is limited and there is no natural irrigation. Farmer Ltd arranges for irrigation to be provided to the property. This requires reticulation across a neighbouring property. Farmer Ltd incurs survey costs and legal fees in the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement allowing the diverted water to be transported to Farmer Ltd’s property. Farmer Ltd agrees to pay the owner of the neighbouring property a one-off lump sum payment for the right to create the easement. In addition, the owner of the dominant tenement, Farmer Ltd, agrees to pay the legal costs for reviewing and approving the drafted easement’s documentation incurred by the owner of the neighbouring property, i.e. the owner of the servient tenement. The survey costs and legal fees, including those paid for the owner of the neighbouring property, are costs for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and so are deductible in the income year in which they are incurred. The cost of the irrigation scheme itself is not part of the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement. The one-off payment to the owner of the neighbouring property for the right to create the easement is not for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and therefore is not deductible.

2006 International Tax Disclosure Exemption
===========================================

ITR17 covers 2006 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OB 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA).

Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 2006. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR17", and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2006 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2005 exemption.

#### Interests held by residents

Disclosure is required by residents for these interests:

*   an interest held in an FIF
*   an "income interest of 10% or greater" held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence.

An "income interest of 10% or greater" is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes these interests:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (that is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA.

**Example**  
  
If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other's interests, so they each hold an "income interest of 10% or greater" which must be disclosed.  
  
They are not required to account for attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss under the CFC rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules.  
  
In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in an FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 form (see "Overlap of interests" below).

#### Foreign company interests

A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company's country of residence. The 2006 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an "income interest of 10% or greater" must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an IR477 or IR479 _Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule._

The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons:

*   attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an "income interest of 10% or greater" in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC's country of residence.
*   to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America).
*   the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993.

#### Foreign investment fund interests

An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an "interest in a foreign investment fund" specified within sections CQ 5(1) and DN 6(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press).

However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in an FIF under sections CQ 5(1) and DN 6 does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in sections CQ 5(1), DN 6, EX 32-35, EX 36(1) and EX 37(1) as exclusions from what constitutes an interest in an FIF:

*   an "income interest of 10% or greater" in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America)
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme
*   a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person's 2004 tax return. See Inland Revenue's booklet Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) for more information
*   interests in foreign entities held by a natural person other than in that person's capacity as a trustee, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency
*   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years.

A resident who holds an interest in an FIF at any time during the 2006 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule (IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442, IR443). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits, branch equivalent, comparative value and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed five forms to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of these methods. The respective forms to use for whichever FIF income calculation method you choose to apply is as follows:

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR441 form for the comparative value method
*   IR442 form for the comparative value method and multiple interests
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method.

#### Overlap of interests

A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in an FIF. For example, a person with an "income interest of 10% or greater" in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in an FIF.

However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR477 or IR479 form or the IR439, IR440, IR441 or IR443 form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file:

1.  Use the appropriate IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular:
    *   an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held)
    *   an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country
    *   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident.
2.  Use the IR477 or IR479 forms to disclose:
    *   an "income interest of 10% or greater" in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 forms.

Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not an FIF interest. An example is an interest which is covered by the Schedule 3, Part A exclusion from the FIF rules.

#### Interests held by non-residents

The 2006 disclosure exemption removes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs.

The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (sections CQ 2(1) and DN 2 of the ITA 2004). In addition, under sections CQ 5(1)(e) and DN 6(1)(e) of the ITA 2004 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Summary

The 2006 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an "income interest of 10% or greater" (ie, it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company's country of residence. Further, an interest in an FIF must be disclosed.

The 2006 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR17".

It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2006. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand.
2.  **Interpretation**  
    In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004.
3.  **Exemption**  
    1.  Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 2006, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an "income interest of 10% or greater", as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company.
    2.  Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 2006, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
        *   No attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of sections CQ 2(1) and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and/or
        *   No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund by virtue of sections CQ 5(1)(e) and DN 6(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004.This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 9th day of March 2006.

2007 International Tax Disclosure Exemption
===========================================

ITR18 covers 2007 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during an income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OB 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA).

Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 2007. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR18", and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2007 disclosure exemption is the same as the 006 exemption.

### Interests held by residents

Disclosure is required by residents for these interests:

*   an attributing interest held in an FIF in respect of which FIF income or FIF loss arises
*   an income interest of 10% or more held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence.

An "income interest of 10% or greater" is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes these interests:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8(3) of the ITA.

**Example**  
  
If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other's interests, so they each hold an "income interest of 10% or greater" which must be disclosed.  
  
They are not required to account for attributed CFC income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules.  
  
In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in an FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 form.

### Foreign company interests

A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company's country of residence. The 2007 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an income interest of 10% or more must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an _(IR477) or (IR479) Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule_ form.

The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons:

*   attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC's country of residence
*   identifying tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States of America)
*   the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993.

### Foreign investment fund interests

An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an "attributing interest" in a foreign investment fund in respect of which FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises.

The types of interest that must be disclosed are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 32 to EX 37) from being an attributing interest in an FIF and therefore do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (ie, Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States of America)
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme
*   a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF rules, by the due date for filing the person's 2004 tax return—see Inland Revenue's booklet Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) for more information
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency
*   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before they became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years.

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

A resident who holds an attributing interest in an FIF in respect of which FIF income or loss arises at any time during the 2007 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in foreign investment fund disclosure schedule and worksheet (IR439), (IR440), (IR441), (IR442), (IR443). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in an FIF, using one of the methods. The respective forms to use for whichever FIF income calculation method you choose to apply are:

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR441 form for the comparative value method
*   IR44 form for the comparative value method and multiple interests
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method.

### Overlap of interests

A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an attributing interest in an FIF. For example, a person with an "income interest of 10% or greater" in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest held in an FIF.

However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR477 or IR479 form or the IR439, IR440, IR441 or IR443 form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity.

Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file:

1.  Use the appropriate IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 form to disclose all attributing interests in FIFs and, in particular:
    *   an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3 Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held)
    *   an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country
    *   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident.
2.  Use the IR477 or IR479 forms to disclose:
    *   an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the IR439, IR440, IR441, IR442 or IR443 form.

Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not an attributing interest in an FIF in respect of which FIF income or loss arises. An example is an interest which is covered by the Schedule 3, Part A exclusion from the FIF rules.

### Interests held by non-residents

The 2007 disclosure exemption removes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed.

This would apply, for example, to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs.

The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules, non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC rules (sections CQ 2(1)(d) and DN 2(d) of the ITA 2004). In addition, under sections CQ 5(1)(e) and DN 6(1)(e) of the ITA 2004, a non-resident is not to be treated as having any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Summary

The 2007 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an attributing interest in an FIF in respect of which FIF income or loss arises) that does not constitute an income interest of 10% or more (ie, less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company's country of residence. Further, an attributing interest in an FIF in respect of which FIF income or loss arises must be disclosed.

The 2007 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the tax administration act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR18"

1.  **Reference**  
    This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2007. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are attributing interests in foreign investment funds in respect of which FIF income or loss arises, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand.
2.  **Interpretation**  
    In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004.
3.  **Exemption**  
    1.  Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund in respect of which FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises), in the income year ending 31 March 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an income interest of more than 10%, as defined under sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company.
    2.  Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
        *   No attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of sections CQ 2(1)(d) and DN 2(d) of the Income Tax Act 2004.
        *   No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund by virtue of sections CQ 5(1)(e) and DN 6(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 9th day of March 2007.

2008 International Tax Disclosure Exemption
===========================================

ITR19 covers 2008 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires disclosure of interests in foreign entities.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during an income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#01)
 However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OB1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA).

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) which applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31March 2008. This exemption may be cited as "International tax disclosure exemption ITR19" and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

In general for interests of 10% or more, the scope of the 2008 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2007 exemption. However, for attributing interests in FIFs that are direct income interests of less than 10%, the scope of the 2008 exemption has changed in situations where the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is used.

### Interests held by residents

Disclosure is required by residents holding these interests

1.  an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which FIF income or FIF loss arises where the :
    1.  branch equivalent, accounting profits, deemed rate of return or cost method of calculation is used, or
    2.  fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used and the resident is a "widely held entity", or
    3.  fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used and the resident is not a widely held entity. In this case disclosure is required if the attributing interest in the FIF is incorporated in the case of a foreign company, or in all other cases is tax resident, in a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2008. The countries with which New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2008 are listed below.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea | Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland  <br>Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>Spain  <br>South Africa  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely held taxpayers whose attributing interests in FIFs are incorporated or tax resident in a treaty country.

A widely held entity for the purposes of this disclosure is one which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity, or
*   widely held company, or
*   widely held superannuation fund, or
*   widely held GIF.

Portfolio investment entity, widely held company, widely held superannuation fund and widely held GIF are all as defined in section OB 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required by widely held entities of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed. A split by the currency in which the investment is held, will be also accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdictions. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

2.  an income interest of 10% or more held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose the following interests are counted:
    1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
    2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
    3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by sectionOD8(3) of the ITA.

For determining an income interest at 10% or more for controlled foreign companies, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA apply. For determining an income interest of 10% or more for entities that are not CFCs, for the purpose of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA are to be applied as if the foreign company were a CFC.

### Foreign company interests

Under section 61, a resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company's country of residence. The 2008 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence for any interest in a foreign company which is an income interest of 10% or more. Disclosure is to be made on an IR477 or IR479 _Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule_ form.

The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company with income interests of 10% or more for these reasons:

*   attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC's country of residence
*   identifying tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in the "grey list", that is, a jurisdiction listed in schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States of America).

### Foreign investment fund interests

In previous years, an interest in a foreign entity had to be disclosed if it constituted an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund in respect of which FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arose.

This year with the widening of the FIF rules through the removal of the grey-list exemption for interests under 10%, a new approach is being adopted to meet the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner without imposing undue compliance costs on taxpayers.

The types of interest that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg,a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule4, partA of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 32 to EX 37) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   an interest in an Australian resident company listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in the grey list
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies. Only interests in Guinness Peat Group plc and the New Zealand Investment Trust plc qualify for this exemption
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities. See Inland Revenue's booklet _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_ for more information
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

The respective forms to use for whichever FIF calculation method you apply are as follows:[2](#02) 

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method by widely held entities
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method by widely held entities
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate by individuals or non-widely held entities
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method by individuals or non-widely held entities
*   IR449 for the cost method.

### Overlap of interests

A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest held in a FIF.

However, to meet the disclosure obligations, only one disclosure return (either the IR477 or IR479 form, or the IR439, IR440, IR443, IR445, IR446, IR447, IR448 or IR449 form) is required for each interest, or group of interests in the case of fair dividend rate or comparative value method, a person holds in a foreign entity.

Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file:

*   Use the appropriate IR439, IR440, IR443, IR445, IR446, IR447, IR448 or IR449 form to disclose all attributing interests in FIFs, and in particular:  
    
*   an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC
*   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme

Use an IR477 or IR479 form to disclose:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on an IR439, IR440, IR443, IR445, IR446, IR447, IR448 or IR449 form.

Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not an attributing interest in a FIF or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under sections CQ 5(1)(d) or DN 6(1)(d). Examples include an interest which is covered by the Australian listed company exemption from the FIF rules or interests held by a natural person, not acting in the capacity of a trustee, with a total cost of below $50,000.

### Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents

The 2008 disclosure exemption removes the need to disclose interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC or FIF rules. The disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Summary

The 2008 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   a less than 10% interest in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest in a FIF or an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises

*   where the taxpayer is not a widely held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that does not constitute an income interest of 10% or more (ie,it is less than 10%) where the foreign company is incorporated, in the case of a company, or in all other cases tax resident in a treaty country, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.

*   where the taxpayer is a widely held entity, it limits disclosure to the end-of-year NewZealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed in cases where the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used.

The 2008 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International tax disclosure exemption ITR19".

**1\. Reference**

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2008.

**2\. Interpretation**

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC.

The relevant definition of associated persons is that contained in section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

**3\. Exemption**

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d), is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely held company, widely held superannuation fund or widely held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign investment vehicle, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely held company, widely held superannuation fund or widely held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the attributing interest is incorporated or tax resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2008.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2008, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(d) and/or
    *   no foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund under sections CQ 5(1)(e) or DN 6(1)(e).

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 15th day of April 2008.

**1** In the case of partnerships, however, disclosure will need to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

**2** In the case of forms IR445 to IR449 relating to the fair dividend rate, comparative value and cost method of calculation, the intention is that in subsequent years section 35 of the TAA will require mandatory electronic filing. This year the IR449 - cost method - and IR447 and IR448 - fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for non-widely held entities will still be paper based.

2009 International Tax Disclosure Exemption
===========================================

ITR20 covers 2009 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires disclosure of interests in foreign entities.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during an income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#01)
 However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA).

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) which applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2009. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR20” and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2009 disclosure exemption is the same as for the 2008 exemption.

### Interests held by residents

Disclosure is required by residents holding these interests:

1.  an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which FIF income or FIF loss arises where the:
    1.  branch equivalent, accounting profits, deemed rate of return or cost method of calculation is used, or
    2.  fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used and the resident is a “widely held entity”, or
    3.  fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used and the resident is not a widely held entity. In this case disclosure is required if the FIF in which there is an attributing interest is incorporated (in the case of a foreign company) or otherwise tax resident, in a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2009. The countries with which New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2009 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are incorporated or tax resident in a treaty country, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A widely held entity for the purposes of this disclosure is one which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this now includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund), or
*   widely held company, or
*   widely held superannuation fund, or
*   widely held GIF.

Portfolio investment entity, widely held company, widely held superannuation fund and widely held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required by widely held entities of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed. A split by the currency in which the investment is held, will be also accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdictions. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

2.  an income interest of 10% or more held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose the following interests are counted:
    1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
    2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
    3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by the parts of subpart YB of the ITA that apply for the purposes of the “1988 version provisions”.

For determining an income interest of 10% or more for controlled foreign companies, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA apply.  For determining an income interest of 10% or more for entities that are not controlled foreign companies (CFCs), for the purpose of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA are to be applied as if the foreign company were a CFC.

### Foreign company interests

Under section 61, a resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company's country of residence. The 2009 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence for any interest in a foreign company which is an income interest of 10% or more. Disclosure is to be made on an IR477 or IR479 _Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule_ form.

The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company with income interests of 10% or more for these reasons:

*   attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC regardless of the CFC’s country of residence
*   identifying tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 24, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in the “grey list”, that is, a jurisdiction listed in schedule 24, Part A of the ITA (Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States of America).

#### Foreign investment fund interests

The types of interest that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident in a country or territory specified in the grey list
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies.  Only interests in Guinness Peat Group plc qualify for this exemption
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities.  See Inland Revenue's booklet _Overseas private pensions_ (IR 257) for more information
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey list country
*   an interest in certain grey list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

The respective forms to use for whichever FIF calculation method you apply are as follows:[2](#02)

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR 443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR 445 form for the fair dividend rate method by widely held entities
*   IR 446 form for the comparative value method by widely held entities
*   IR 447 form for the fair dividend rate by individuals or non-widely held entities
*   IR 448 form for the comparative value method by individuals or non-widely held entities
*   IR 449 for the cost method

#### Overlap of interests

A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an attributing interest in a FIF.  For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest held in a FIF.

However, to meet the disclosure obligations, only one disclosure return (either the IR477 or IR479 form, or the IR439, IR440, IR443, IR 445, IR 446, IR 447, IR 448 or IR 449 form) is required for each interest, or group of interests in the case of fair dividend rate or comparative value method, a person holds in a foreign entity.

Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file:

1.  Use the appropriate IR439, IR440, IR443, IR 445, IR 446, IR 447, IR 448 or IR 449 form to disclose all attributing interests in FIFs, and in particular:
    *   an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC
    *   an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme
2.  Use an IR477 or IR479 form to disclose:
    *   an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on an IR439, IR440, IR443, IR 445, IR 446, IR 447, IR 448 or IR 449 form.

Disclosure is not required on any of the forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not an attributing interest in a FIF or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under sections CQ 5(1)(d) or DN 6(1)(d).  Examples include an interest which is covered by the Australian listed company exemption from the FIF rules or interests held by a natural person, not acting in the capacity of a trustee, with a total cost of below $50,000.

#### Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold.  However, under the international tax rules non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC or FIF rules.  The disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. 

### Summary

The 2009 international tax disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   a less than 10% interest in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest in a FIF or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises
*   where the taxpayer is not a widely held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that does not constitute an income interest of 10% or more (ie, it is less than 10%) where the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   where the taxpayer is a widely held entity, it limits disclosure to the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed in cases where the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used.

The 2009 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

#### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR20”.

**1\. Reference**

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs) in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2009.

**2\. Interpretation**

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC.

The relevant definition of associated persons is contained in the parts of subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 that apply for the purposes of the “1988 version provisions”.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

**3\. Exemption**

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d), is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign investment vehicle, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2009.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2009, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(d) and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f).

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 4th day of March 2009.

1  In the case of partnerships, however, disclosure will need to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

2  In the case of forms IR 445 to 449 relating to the fair dividend rate, comparative value and cost method of calculation, the intention is that at a future date section 35 of the TAA will require mandatory electronic filing.  For the time being, however, filing will still be paper-based for the IR 449 - cost method - and IR 447 and 448 - fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for non-widely held entities.

2010 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR21 covers 2010 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#01)
 However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2010. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR21" and the full text appears at the end of this item.

* * *

1: In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

* * *

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2010 exemption is the same as the 2009 exemption although taxpayers with interests in controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and balance dates between 30 June and 30 September (inclusive), for whom the new international tax rules apply, are required to complete a new prescribed electronic form in relation to CFC disclosure. These changes are outlined further below.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2010.

### Summary

In summary, the 2010 international tax disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2010 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Explanation

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF where FIF income or FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   branch equivalent, accounting profits, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods where the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country that New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2010.

The 35 countries that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2010 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund, or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA 2007.

The disclosure required by widely-held entities of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed. A split by currency in which the investment is held, will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdictions. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

_FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed at the time of publication of the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 3, April 2010).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account ([refer to the IR871 form](/Internet/IRD/toii/fif/how-taxed/how-tax-exemption#01)
    )
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident in a country or territory specified in the grey list
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies (only interests in Guinness Peat Group plc qualify for this exemption)
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see our booklet _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_ under "Forms and guides" for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

##### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method.

The IR445 and IR446 forms must be completed online. The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms may be completed online. The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz/)
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

As a transitional measure for non-portfolio FIFs using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods, an alternative to using the IR439 and IR440 forms is acceptable for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2010. For each calculation method, an acceptable alternative disclosure will be a schedule outlining all the FIF interests of a particular taxpayer and must, as a minimum, include the following information:

*   details of the taxpayer filing the form, including name, IRD number, contact details
*   details of the FIF, including name, business activity, balance date, country of residence, address
*   nature of the taxpayer’s FIF interest (ie, shares or units)
*   details of the taxpayer's income interest percentage (including details of the measurement basis used)
*   currency the financial statements were prepared in
*   calculation of FIF income or loss including conversion rate and NZD conversion calculation
*   details of any loss offset or loss to carry forward
*   details of any foreign tax credit available (including details of NZD conversion calculation).

A scanned copy of the audited financial statements of the FIF must also accompany the schedule(s).

The alternative disclosure schedules and audited financial accounts should be sent to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#794d4a404d4d491d100a1a15160a0c0b1c39100b1d571e160f0d571703)
.

The alternative disclosure schedule filed must also be printed, dated and signed by the taxpayer as true and correct. This should be held on file by the taxpayer and may be requested by the Commissioner.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by the parts of subpart YB of the ITA that apply for the purposes of the "1988 version provisions".

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

New international tax rules have been introduced for calculating income from a CFC. These rules apply for all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Entities with late balance dates between 30 June 2010 and 30 September 2010 (inclusive) will begin their 2010 income year on or after 1 July 2009. Therefore, entities with balance dates between 30 June and 30 September (inclusive) will apply the new rules from their 2010 income year.

Disclosure of interests in a controlled foreign company, by an entity applying the new rules, is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure (IR458)_ form.

The IR458 form must be completed online, you can find it under "Forms and guides".

Disclosure of interests in a controlled foreign company, by an entity applying the old rules, and interests in a foreign company that is not a controlled foreign company, is required using either an IR477 or IR479 form (_Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule)_ as appropriate.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, the IR477 or IR479 must be used if the new international tax rules do not yet apply, and the IR458 if they do.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR21".

### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2010.

### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in the parts of subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007 that apply for the purposes of the "1988 version provisions".

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign investment vehicle, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2010.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2010, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 9th of March 2010.

2011 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR22 covers 2011 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held[1](#01)
. However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA 2007").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2011. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR22" and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2011 exemption is the same as the 2010 exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2011.

### Summary

In summary, the 2011 international tax disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA 2007  
      
    
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used  
      
    
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2011 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Explanation

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF where FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   branch equivalent, accounting profits, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods where the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country that New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2011.

The 35 countries that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2011 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund, or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA 2007.

The disclosure required by widely-held entities of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed, in the event that tax residence is not easily determined. A further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held, will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdictions in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

##### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)  
      
    
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme  
      
    
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy  
      
    
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this issue of the _Tax Information Bulletin_ went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)  
      
    
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to the IR871 form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz/)
     (keywords: other exemptions)  
      
    
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions  
      
    
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident in a country or territory specified in the grey list  
      
    
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies (only interests in Guinness Peat Group plc qualify for this exemption)  
      
    
*   an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme  
      
    
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's booklet _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_ for more information)  
      
    
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country  
      
    
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies  
      
    
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement  
      
    
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme  
      
    
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for widely-held entities must be completed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically. We note that currently only 10 disclosures can be made on an individual IR445 or IR446. For disclosures in excess of 10, more than one form should be filed.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for individuals or non widely-held entities as well as the cost method for all taxpayers may be completed online. The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz/)
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

Until the proposed extension of the active income exemption is passed into law, a transitional measure for non-portfolio FIFs using the branch equivalent or accounting profits, namely an alternative to using the IR439 and IR440 forms is acceptable for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2011. For each calculation method, an acceptable alternative disclosure will be a schedule outlining all the FIF interests of a particular taxpayer and must, as a minimum, include the following information:

*   details of the taxpayer filing the form, including name, IRD number, contact details
*   details of the FIF, including name, business activity, balance date, country of residence, address
*   nature of the taxpayer's FIF interest (ie, shares or units)
*   details of the taxpayer's income interest percentage (including details of the measurement basis used)
*   currency the financial statements were prepared in
*   calculation of FIF income or loss including conversion rate and NZD conversion calculation
*   details of any loss offset or loss to carry forward
*   details of any foreign tax credit available (including details of NZD conversion calculation).

A scanned copy of the audited financial statements of the FIF must also accompany the schedule(s).

The alternative disclosure schedules and audited financial accounts should be sent to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aa9e99939e9e9acec3d9c9c6c5d9dfd8cfeac3d8ce84cdc5dcde84c4d0)

The alternative disclosure schedule filed must also be printed, dated and signed by the taxpayer as true and correct. This should be held on file by the taxpayer and may be requested by the Commissioner.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by the parts of subpart YB of the ITA that apply for the purposes of the "1988 version provisions".

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

##### _Format of disclosure_

In 2010 due to differing balance dates, some taxpayers were still applying the old CFC rules while others were applying the new rules involving an active income exemption. As a result there were differing disclosure requirements. This is no longer the case as the new CFC rules now apply to all taxpayers.

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure (IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

The IR458 form must be completed online at [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz/)
 (keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR22".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2011.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in the parts of subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign investment vehicle, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2011.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2011, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on 24th of March 2011.

2012 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR23 covers 2012 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#1)
 However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2012. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR23" and the full text appears at the end of this item.

We note at the time of writing, the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is due to bring in an active income exemption for holdings above 10% in foreign companies that are not CFCs, has yet to be enacted. As the amendments apply for balance dates starting from 1 July 2011 to 30 September 2011, this disclosure exemption will apply to those taxpayers.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2012 exemption is the same as the 2011 exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2012.

### Summary

In summary, the 2012 international tax disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   portfolio investments that fall within the $50,000 de minimis, that is, an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA [2](#2)
    
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2012 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   branch equivalent, accounting profits, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country or territory that New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2012.

The 37 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2012 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland  <br>Russian Federation | Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required by widely-held entities of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdictions in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

##### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 24, No 3 went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to the IR871 form that can be found on Inland Revenue’s website [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
     (keywords: other exemptions))
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident in a country or territory specified in the grey list. Note that for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2011, the grey list should be replaced by an exemption for interests of 10% or more in companies that are resident and subject to tax in Australia.
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies (only interests in Guinness Peat Group plc qualify for this exemption)
*   an interest in a superannuation scheme that qualifies for the new resident’s accrued superannuation entitlement exemption
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue’s guide _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_ for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

##### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year - the de minimis exemption. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests.

We note that from 1 April 2012 in the event that legislation is passed to allow an opt-out of the de minimis, disclosure may be required if it would have been required had the cost of the person’s FIF interest exceeded the de minimis.

##### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR439 form for the accounting profits method
*   IR440 form for the branch equivalent method
*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method.

FIF disclosure forms (of methods that will be unaffected by the potential law change to bring in an active income exemption), have been updated and online filing improved.

In particular, improvements have been made to the _Foreign investment fund disclosure (IR445)_ or _(IR447)_, _Interest in a foreign investment fund disclosure schedule (cost method) (IR449)_, _Interest in a foreign investment fund disclosure schedule (deemed rate of return method) (IR443)_ and _Comparative value disclosures (IR446) or (IR448)_.

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you’re downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue’s online services.

You will still able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_ must be completed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non-widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers may be completed online. The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

##### _Income years starting after 30 June 2011_

Once enacted, the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill will affect some taxpayers with balance dates starting after 30 June 2011. More specifically these taxpayers will:

*   be able to use an active income exemption for interests of 10% or more in foreign companies (non-portfolio FIFs). The active income exemption is based on the CFC rules and will be known as the attributable FIF income method. The attributable FIF income method replaces the branch equivalent method. For taxpayers with balance dates starting from 1 July 2011 until 30 September 2011, to whom the proposed change would apply, mandatory electronic disclosure will be required. This will be able to be found at the "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure" part of our website ([www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
    ) soon after the bill is passed.
*   be able to use the fair dividend rate and cost methods for any attributing interest in a FIF where previously this was limited to interests of less than 10% in a FIF
*   not be able to use the accounting profits method as it will have been repealed.

#### _Situation before application of proposed law change_

Until the proposed extension of the active income exemption is passed into law, or for taxpayers for whom the change does not apply in the 2012 tax year, a transitional measure for non-portfolio FIFs using the branch equivalent or accounting profits, namely an alternative to using the IR439 and IR440 forms, is acceptable for the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2012. For each calculation method, an acceptable alternative disclosure will be a schedule outlining all the FIF interests of a particular taxpayer and must, as a minimum, include the following information:

*   details of the taxpayer filing the form, including name, IRD number, contact details
*   details of the FIF, including name, business activity, balance date, country of residence, address
*   nature of the taxpayer’s FIF interest (ie, shares or units)
*   details of the taxpayer’s income interest percentage (including details of the measurement basis used)
*   currency the financial statements were prepared in
*   calculation of FIF income or loss including conversion rate and NZD conversion calculation
*   details of any loss offset or loss to carry forward
*   details of any foreign tax credit available (including details of NZD conversion calculation).

A scanned copy of the audited financial statements of the FIF must also accompany the schedule(s).

The alternative disclosure schedules and audited financial accounts should be sent to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e7a7d777a7a7e2a273d2d22213d3b3c2b0e273c2a602921383a602034)

The alternative disclosure schedule filed must also be printed, dated and signed by the taxpayer as true and correct. This should be held on file by the taxpayer and may be requested by the Commissioner.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

##### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure_ _(IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

The IR458 form must be completed online at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
 (keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company that also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents’ or transitional residents’ holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR23".

### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2012.

### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2012 in one of the 37 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in the parts of subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2012.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2012, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 8th of March 2012.

Principal Advisor (International Tax)

* * *

1: In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

2: We note that the proposed ability to opt out of the de minimis cannot apply until 1 April 2012 and so is outside the scope of this disclosure exemption.

2013 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR24 covers 2013 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#1)
 However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2013. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR24"("the 2013 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2013 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2012 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2013.

### Summary

In summary, the 2013 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less.
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2013 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity" or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in is a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement[2](#2)
     in force as at 31 March 2013.

The 37 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2013 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland  <br>Russian Federation | Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

##### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 25, No 3 went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to the IR871 form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
     (keywords: other exemptions or IR871))
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   an interest in a superannuation scheme that qualifies for the new resident's accrued superannuation entitlement exemption
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes_ (IR257) for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

##### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests. This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less.

##### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be completed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:  
a) an income interest held directly in a foreign company  
b) an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company  
c) an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

##### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure_ _(IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

The IR458 form must be completed online at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
 (keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

##### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

##### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR24".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2013.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2013 in one of the 37 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2013.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2013, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 11th of March 2013.

Principal Advisor (International Tax)

1: In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

2: For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 37 countries or territories listed in this 2013 disclosure exemption.

2014 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR25 covers 2014 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#1)
 However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2014. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR25" ("the 2014 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2014 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2013 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2014.

### Summary

In summary, the 2014 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less.
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2014 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity" or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement[2](#2)
     in force as at 31 March 2014.

The 38 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2014 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea (Republic of)  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea\*  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America |

\*The Papua New Guinea double tax agreement applies for withholding taxes from 1 March 2014 and for all other provisions from 1 April 2014.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90 - 95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 26, No 3 went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to the IR871 form that can be found on Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
     (search keywords: other exemptions, IR871))
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   an interest in a superannuation scheme that qualifies for the new resident's accrued superannuation entitlement exemption
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide _Overseas pensions and annuity schemes_ _(IR257)_ for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests. This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less.

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be filed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:  
a) an income interest held directly in a foreign company  
b) an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company  
c) an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure_ _(IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

The IR458 form must be completed online at [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz)
 (search keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR25".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2014.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2014 in one of the 38 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.

2015 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR26 covers 2015 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held.[1](#1)
 However, section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2015. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR26" ("the 2015 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2015 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2014 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2015.

### Summary

In summary, the 2015 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less.
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2015 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident is in a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement[2](#2)
     in force as at 31 March 2015.

The 39 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2015 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea (Republic of)  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Viet Nam\* |

\* The Viet Nam double tax agreement applies for withholding taxes from 1 January 2015 and for all other provisions from 1 April 2015.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit  from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014, treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person's interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 27, No 3 went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account ( [refer to the _Australian share exemption list (IR871)_ form](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-800-899/forms-guides-number-801-900.html)
    )
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst a person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide [_Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir257-guide-overseas-pensions-and-annuity-schemes.html)
     for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests. This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold is generally required to continue to apply the FIF rules in each subsequent tax year. If a person has less than $50,000 of attributing interests in FIFs, they will not be required to apply the FIF rules if, for each of the four previous tax years:

*   the person had no attributing interests in FIFs (for example, they had no foreign shares, or only had foreign shares which were exempt from the FIF rules); and/or
*   the person had more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years they would have been required to apply the FIF rules).

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be filed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure_ _(IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

[The IR458 form must be completed online.](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-400-499/ir458-online-cfc-disclosure.html)
 Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR26".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in foreign investment funds ("FIFs") in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2015.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies ("CFCs"). In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2015 in one of the 39 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2015.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2015, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on the 13th of March 2015.

2016 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR27 covers 2016 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less. Even after four years, a person must continue to apply the FIF rules if they still hold any of the shares at the time of the opting out. Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2016. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR26" ("the 2016 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2016 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2015 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2016.

### Summary

In summary, the 2016 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year a FIF income or loss.[1](#1)
    
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2016 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident is in a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement[2](#2)
     in force as at 31 March 2016.

The 40 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2016 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong  <br>Viet Nam | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea (Republic of)  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Samoa\* |

\* The Samoa double tax agreement applies for withholding taxes from 1 February 2016 and for all other provisions from 1 April 2016.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit  from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014, treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person's interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 27, No 3 went to press).

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account ( [refer to the _Australian share exemption list (IR871)_ form](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-800-899/forms-guides-number-801-900.html)
    )
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst a person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide [_Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir257-guide-overseas-pensions-and-annuity-schemes.html)
     for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 arises in respect of these interests. This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold is generally required to continue to apply the FIF rules in each subsequent tax year. If a person has less than $50,000 of attributing interests in FIFs, they will not be required to apply the FIF rules if, for each of the four previous tax years:

*   the person had no attributing interests in FIFs (for example, they had no foreign shares, or only had foreign shares which were exempt from the FIF rules); and/or
*   the person had more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years they would have been required to apply the FIF rules).

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be filed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure_ _(IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR26".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in foreign investment funds ("FIFs") in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2016.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for interests in controlled foreign companies ("CFCs"). In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2016 in one of the 39 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises under either section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2016.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2016, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This exemption is signed on 7 March 2016.

1 In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

2 For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2016 disclosure exemption.

2017 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

ITR28 covers 2017 international tax disclosure exemptions where disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2017. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR28"("the 2017 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2017 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2016 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2017.

### Summary

In summary, the 2017 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year an amount of FIF income or loss.
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2017 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident is in a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2017.

The 40 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2017 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong  <br>Viet Nam | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Samoa |

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2017 disclosure exemption.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014, treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person's interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account ( [refer to the _Australian share exemption list (IR871)_ form](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-800-899/forms-guides-number-801-900.html)
    )
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst a person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide [_Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir257-guide-overseas-pensions-and-annuity-schemes.html)
     for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 of the ITA arises in respect of these interests.

This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less. Even after four years a person must continue to apply the FIF rules if they hold any of the shares they held at the time of opting out.

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be filed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure (IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

[The IR458 form must be completed online.](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-400-499/ir458-online-cfc-disclosure.html)
 Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR28".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the TAA to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2017.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2017 in one of the 40 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the ITA.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the ITA.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises due to the application of the de minimis exemption in section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA , is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the T AA for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2017.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2017, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the ITA; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the ITA.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the TAA.

This exemption is signed on 7 March 2017.

2018 international tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

Determination setting out the 2018 international tax disclosure exemption.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2018. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR29"("the 2018 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2018 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2017 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2018.

### Summary

In summary, the 2018 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year an amount of FIF income or loss.
*   if the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   if the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2018 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the country in which the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident is in a country or territory with which New Zealand **does not** have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2018.

The 40 countries or territories that New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2018 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong  <br>Viet Nam | India  <br>Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland | Russian Federation  <br>Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Samoa |

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2018 disclosure exemption.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. For example, investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014, treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person's interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account ( [refer to the _Australian share exemption list (IR871)_ form](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-800-899/forms-guides-number-801-900.html)
    )
*   an interest in an Australian unit trust that has an New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   an interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst a person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide [_Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir257-guide-overseas-pensions-and-annuity-schemes.html)
     for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 of the ITA arises in respect of these interests.

This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold needs to include FIF income or loss in any of the four subsequent income years even if the total cost of all attributing interests is $50,000 or less. Even after four years a person must continue to apply the FIF rules if they hold any of the shares they held at the time of opting out.

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online. If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

You will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for _widely-held entities_, must be filed online. As discussed above this disclosure is by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61. In order to be exempt from the general requirements, the alternative disclosure must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for _individuals or non widely-held entities_ as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure.

The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a controlled foreign company) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a controlled foreign company is required using a _Controlled foreign companies disclosure (IR458)_ form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

[The IR458 form must be completed online.](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-400-499/ir458-online-cfc-disclosure.html)
 Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR29".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the TAA to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2018.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) apply for interests in controlled foreign companies. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2018 in one of the 40 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the ITA.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the ITA.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises due to the application of the de minimis exemption in section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA , is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2018.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2018, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the ITA; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the ITA.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the TAA.

This exemption is signed on 2 March 2018.

2019 international tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

Determination setting out the 2019 international tax disclosure exemption.

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2019. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR30"("the 2019 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2019 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2018 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2019.

### Summary

In summary, the 2019 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   An interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year an amount of FIF income or loss.
*   If the resident **is not** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   If the resident **is** a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2019 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2019.

The 40 countries or territories with which New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2019 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong  <br>India | Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland  <br>Russian Federation  <br>Samoa | Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Viet Nam |

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2019 disclosure exemption.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. Investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014 and treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person’s interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA.

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company ("CFC") (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   certain interests in Australian resident companies included on the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
     (keyword: other exemptions))
*   certain interests in an Australian unit trust that has a New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions
*   certain interests of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)
*   a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst the person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person
*   certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide [Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257)](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir257-guide-overseas-pensions-and-annuity-schemes.html "Overseas pensions and annuity schemes")
     for more information)
*   an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement
*   an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme
*   certain interests held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency.

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 of the ITA arises in respect of these interests.

This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year a FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold is generally required to continue to apply the FIF rules in each subsequent tax year. Where a person has previously opted out of the de minimis threshold, they will be required to apply the FIF rules unless they have less than $50,000 of attributing interests in FIFs for the current year, and for each of the four previous tax years:

*   the person had no attributing interests in FIFs (for example, they had no foreign shares, or only had foreign shares which were exempt from the FIF rules); and/or
*   the person had more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years they would have been required to apply the FIF rules).

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR445 form for the fair dividend rate method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR446 form for the comparative value method (for widely-held entities)
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 electronic form for the attributable FIF income method (this form can also be used to make electronic disclosures for all other methods).

It is now possible to download a spreadsheet as a working paper or complete the disclosures online.

If you're downloading the spreadsheet you will be able to save it as a working paper on your computer and when completed submit the form by using Inland Revenue's online services.

Alternatively, you will still be able to complete the disclosure online without downloading a spreadsheet by directly entering the disclosure online.

The IR445 and IR446 forms, which reflect the disclosure for fair dividend rate and comparative value for widely-held entities, must be filed online. As discussed above these disclosures are by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61 of the TAA. In order to be exempt from the general requirement, these disclosures must be made electronically.

The IR447, IR448 and IR449 forms, applying to the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods for individuals or non widely-held entities as well as the cost method for all taxpayers, may be completed online.

As noted above, all of the above disclosures can now be filed using the IR458 electronic disclosure (which supports the spreadsheet approach).

The online forms can be found at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz "The main IRD website")
 "Get it done online", "Foreign investment fund disclosure".

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a CFC) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

Disclosure of all interests in a CFC is required using a Controlled foreign company disclosure (IR458) form. This form, which involves uploading a prescribed spreadsheet, can cater for up to 500 individual disclosures.

The IR458 form must be accessed online at [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz "The main IRD website")
 (keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 for controlled foreign companies must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR30".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in FIFs in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the TAA to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2019.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) apply for interests in CFCs. In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2019 in one of the 40 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the ITA.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the ITA.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises due to the application of the de minimis exemption in section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2019.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2019, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the ITA; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the ITA.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the TAA.

This exemption is signed on 6 March 2019.

2020 International tax disclosure exemption
===========================================

Determination setting out the 2020 international tax disclosure exemption.

[TIB Volume 32 No 3 April 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no3)

### Introduction

Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities.

Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose.

Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA").

To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2020. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR31 "("the 2020 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item.

### Scope of exemption

The scope of the 2020 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2019 disclosure exemption.

### Application date

This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2020.

### Summary

In summary, the 2020 disclosure exemption **removes** the requirement of a resident to disclose:

*   An interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year an amount of FIF income or loss.
*   If the resident is not a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used.
*   If the resident is a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.

The 2020 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs.

### Commentary

Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below.

#### _Attributing interest in a FIF_

A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods:

*   attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity"; or
*   fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020.

The 40 countries or territories with which New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020 are listed below.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia  <br>Austria  <br>Belgium  <br>Canada  <br>Chile  <br>China  <br>Czech Republic  <br>Denmark  <br>Fiji  <br>Finland  <br>France  <br>Germany  <br>Hong Kong  <br>India | Indonesia  <br>Ireland  <br>Italy  <br>Japan  <br>Korea  <br>Malaysia  <br>Mexico  <br>Netherlands  <br>Norway  <br>Papua New Guinea  <br>Philippines  <br>Poland  <br>Russian Federation  <br>Samoa | Singapore  <br>South Africa  <br>Spain  <br>Sweden  <br>Switzerland  <br>Taiwan  <br>Thailand  <br>Turkey  <br>United Arab Emirates  <br>United Kingdom  <br>United States of America  <br>Viet Nam |

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2020 disclosure exemption.

No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used.

A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a:

*   portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or
*   widely-held company; or
*   widely-held superannuation fund; or
*   widely-held group investment fund ("GIF").

Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA.

The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. Investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions.

#### _FIF interests_

The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are:

*   rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust)
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014 and treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person’s interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand
*   an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy
*   an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA.

However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed:

*   certain interests in Australian resident companies included on the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to Inland Revenue's website [www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz)
     (keyword: other exemptions))
*   certain interests in an Australian unit trust that has a New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions

*   an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company ("CFC") (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company)

#### _De minimis_

Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 of the ITA arises in respect of these interests.

This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold is generally required to continue to apply the FIF rules in each subsequent tax year. Where a person has previously opted out of the de minimis threshold, they will be required to apply the FIF rules unless they have less than $50,000 of attributing interests in FIFs for the current year, and for each of the four previous tax years:

*   the person had no attributing interests in FIFs (for example, they had no foreign shares, or only had foreign shares which were exempt from the FIF rules); and/or
*   the person had more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years they would have been required to apply the FIF rules).

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows:

*   IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method
*   IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities)
*   IR449 form for the cost method
*   IR458 spreadsheet form (this spreadsheet form can be used to make electronic disclosures for all methods).
*   myIR income tax return attachment form (this form can be used to make electronic disclosures for all methods)

The IR458 spreadsheet and myIR income tax return attachment forms, which reflect the disclosure options for fair dividend rate and comparative value for widely-held entities, must be filed online. As discussed above these disclosures are by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61 of the TAA. In order to be exempt from the general requirement, these disclosures must be made electronically.

As noted above, all other disclosures may be filed using the IR458 spreadsheet or myIR income tax return attachment form options.

If you choose the spreadsheet option you will be able to save the form as a working paper on your computer. When completed, submit the form by logging into your myIR account and uploading it as part of the electronic income tax return filing process, or by logging into your myIR account and attaching it to a web message with ‘FIF disclosure’ in the subject line.

Alternatively, you can complete the myIR income tax return attachment disclosure form online when preparing your income tax return electronically in myIR.

The IR443, IR447, IR448, IR449 and IR458 forms can be found at the [File a foreign investment fund disclosure](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs/file-a-foreign-investment-fund-disclosure)
 page. Click ‘Other ways to do this’ on this web page to access the IR458 spreadsheet form.

#### _Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company_

A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered:

1.  an income interest held directly in a foreign company
2.  an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company
3.  an income interest held by an associated person (not being a CFC) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA.

To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC.

#### _Format of disclosure_

The forms for disclosure of all interests in a CFC are:

*   IR458 spreadsheet form, or
*   myIR income tax return attachment form

If you choose the spreadsheet option you will be able to save the form as a working paper on your computer. When completed, submit the form by logging into your myIR account and uploading it as part of the electronic income tax return filing process.

Alternatively, you can complete the myIR income tax return attachment disclosure form online when preparing your income tax return electronically in myIR.

The IR458 spreadsheet form must be accessed online at www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: ir458).

Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure.

#### _Overlap of interests_

It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF.

To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made.

In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 spreadsheet form or myIR income tax return attachment form for CFCs must be filed.

#### _Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents_

Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed.

This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF.

Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group.

### Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR31".

#### 1\. Reference

This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in foreign investment funds (“FIFs”) in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the TAA to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2020.

#### 2\. Interpretation

For the purpose of this disclosure exemption:

*   to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) apply for interests in controlled foreign companies ("CFCs"). In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and
*   double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020 in one of the 40 countries or territories as set out in the commentary.

The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the ITA.

Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the ITA.

#### 3\. Exemption

1.  Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises due to the application of the de minimis exemption in section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA , is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA for that interest and that income year.
2.  Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed.
3.  Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2020.
4.  Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2020, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply:
    *   no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the ITA; and/or
    *   no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the ITA.

This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the TAA.

This exemption is signed on 6 March 2020.

Jailed for COVID fraud committed in a time of national crisis
=============================================================

**11 November 2024** An Upper Hutt man was sent to jail for nearly four years when he appeared for sentence on fraud charges committed in what the judge called a time of national crisis.  
  
Shane Douglas McNally appeared for sentence on November 8, after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.  
  
McNally was sentenced on 68 charges, 21 of which were Inland Revenue (IR) charges involving Small Business Cashflow scheme (SBCS) fraud. The other charges were Ministry of Social Development (MSD) fraud charges and police charges.   
  
The IR charges related to McNally and his co-accused, Brendon Blair McBride, who made 21 SBCS applications using different identities each time. Seven of these were accepted and paid out. The remaining 14 were declined. The total amount sought was $224,200, while $82,600 was paid out.  
  
The Small Business Cashflow scheme was set up in 2020 and in May of that year, Inland Revenue started making payments to businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
In 2020, McNally and McBride made the applications under 19 separate identities, each of $11,800 and confirmed each time that they met the scheme’s criteria, including that they had a viable business and had experienced a more than 30% decline in revenue.  
  
Inland Revenue began an investigation in June 2020. It found McNally and McBride had made the applications, were both on the unemployment benefit and neither met the criteria for a SBCS loan.  
  
During the investigation, bank account information, I.P. address records and text messages were obtained for both McNally and McBride.  
  
In sentencing McNally, Judge Hastings noted the exploitation of the high trust SBCS loan in a time of national crisis; premeditation, given the number of fraudulent applications; and the extent of financial gain sought, and loss suffered by IR and MSD.  
  
The result was a sentence of 3 years and 11 months prison.  
  
Co-offender McBride was sentenced in 2021 on SBCS fraud charges and again earlier this year on income tax and police charges.

Some information has been withheld as the Government has yet to make decisions on the matter. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand.

This release, known as Release 4.1.1 (Stage 4, workstream 1, release 1), will move these products from heritage systems and processes to START. 9.O n 10 December 2020, we approved the results of checkpoint 2 in our readiness assessment framework. At this checkpoint, we assessed whether we were on track for go- live and the checkpoint results confirm that we were. C ontingency plans are being finalised to cater for the possibility that legislation will not pass in time. Solutions have, where possible, been uncoupled from the legislation and/or workable/low impact contingencies are in place. S olution design and testing 10 .Business system testing (making sure START works as expected) has been completed. 11 .The first mock go-live (a full-dress rehearsal for go-live) was completed successfully on 4 December 2020. We ran an additional data conversion for an issue encountered with paid p arental leave data, which has since been resolved. The second mock go live was also completed successfully on 28 January 2021. We can now confirm our cutover window and go -live date. We will shut down our core systems, along with our front office counters and contact centres, by 6pm Friday 26 February and re-open to customers at 8am on Monday 1 March 2021. 1 2.The first round of scaled business simulation testing (practicing go-live step-by -step ) w as completed successfully on 22 January 2021. The second round is currently underway and will be completed by 21 February 2021. 1 3.Our deployment and cut over activity for this release has been planned and executed on a remote-working basis, thus mitigating any likelihood of COVID-19 impacting our go- live activity. 1 4.The Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment (MBIE) ha s identified an issue that relates to a small number of paid parental leave customers. We will work with MBIE to see if any remediation is required post go-live. R eadying our people 1 5. Training for our people is well underway. For this release, we have made a significant shift to online learning. For previous releases, the mandatory online component of training was pre-learning for the classroom sessions. For this release, the majority of people will complete online training instead of attending classroom training. Of the 523 people who have to attend training, 497 will complete this online with 26 attending classroom training. The small number of people requiring classroom training is mainly due to the specialist nature of the products in this release. R eadying our customers 1 6.On 18 January 2021, digital and social media advertising began letting customers know about the changes to paid parental leave. The changes mainly focus on improving the application process and customers’ online experience. On 20 January 2021, emails an d l etters were sent to around 15,000 people receiving paid parental leave payments. A fact sheet has also been provided to external groups, such as Withheld under Section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act. 5 IR2021/022: Transformation status update: December 2020 / January 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 17.We made some webinars available to different customer groups to view in December 2020 covering the following areas: •Introduction to changes for New Zealand foreign trusts •Introduction to Stage 4 for businesses •Introduction to Stage 4 for Maori Authorities. 1 8.The number of views is small so far, reflecting the smaller impact of this release, and potentially the time of year the webinars were made available. 1 9.On 3 February 2021, we emailed around 500 holders of unclaimed money about the changes being made. We previously communicated to them in November last year, and this time we shared more details with them about the proposed legislation changes. Early life support 20 .After each release, we provide early life support for a period. This is known as Pou Whirinaki, and additional support is provided to customers and our people to resolve any issues that are identified with the release. The initial period of heightened support (known as hyper-care) will run until 26 March 2021, followed by ongoing early life support until 28 May 2021. 21.For this release we will use the same processes, structure, monitoring, and reporting as we have for previous releases. However, as this release is smaller and less complex than earlier releases, resourcing levels will be lower, and meetings will be less frequent. We can quickly and easily scale up or down depending on whether issues arise. Other updates Stage 4 second release (Release 4.1.2) 2 2.We will move child support to new systems and processes in October 2021. 23.From 26 to 28 January 2021, we ran a design review workshop with 36 of our frontline child support people from around the country. The objectives of the workshop were to: •test our systems and processes early and understand how they will work for our customers and us, and whether there are any gaps, and •help us understand the level of impact on our day-to-day work. 24.As part of this release, we will upgrade START and myIR to a newer version. We have been working with FAST over the last three years to realise as many of our requirements as possible as part of this upgrade. This has provided the opportunity for a greater adoption of out-of -the-box configurable functionality over site-specific capability. Our objective is to move a greater proportion of myIR services to out-of -the-box functionality as this provides for a more stable platform and simplifies future version upgrades. P olicy 25 .The Child Support Amendment Bill, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Bill, and their supplementary order papers are being considered by their respective select committees and reported back to Parliament by 4 March 2021. 6 IR2021/022: Transformation status update: December 2020 / January 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Update to Cabinet 2 6.On 27 January 2021, we provided our February 2021 Transformation Update to the Minister of Revenue (IR2021/021 refers). This paper provides an update for Cabinet regarding our progress in modernising the revenue system, our plans for completing the transformation programme, and the progress made with realising benefits. Key risks and issues 27.The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 28 .We are monitoring one issue (a risk that has been realised). This relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 2 9.As at January 2021, the programme has a total of 58 open risks 2 , of which 14 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 30 .Since the last report to Ministers (IR2020/457 refers), one risk reported to the PGC has closed. The risk related to critical and high priority incidents not being resolved in a timely manner. This risk is being well managed as we have improved our risk management capability as part of the organisation design changes made in our information technology area. 3 1.The risk level of one risk reported to the PGC has improved. The current rating of the risk relating to products remaining on FIRST after 1 July 2022 when support for heritage systems ends has improved from very high to high. The current 3 likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from possible (an 11% to 20% chance of occurring) to unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring). There is a plan to migrate all products off FIRST, which we are tracking well against, reducing the likelihood of this risk occurring. 3 2.The top three risks for transformation remain unchanged and relate to the need t o mo ve off all our heritage applications by 1 July 2022, so that we can fully decommission our heritage data centres. Coming up in the next two months 33.Key activities over the next two months include: F ebruary 2021 •Complete second round of scaled business simulation testing (practicing go-live step-by -step). •Complete checkpoint 3 in the readiness assessment framework (this checkpoin t a ssesses whether we are ready for go-live). 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 During December and January, one new programme risk was accepted, and one was closed. 3 The level of risk with the controls already in place. Withheld under Section 9(2)(g)(i) of the Official Information Act. 7 IR2021/022: Transformation status update: December 2020 / January 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • The Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee considers Inland Revenue’s February 2021 Transformation Update.

We successfully exited early life support for child support and for the upgraded version of myIR on 31 January 2022, as planned. 10. Responsibility for delivering changes in START transferred to its new home in our organisation structure, Planning, Design & Delivery in Customer and Compliance Services – Business, on 1 December 2021. This means that START changes will no longer be delivered by the programme team. Decommissioning 11. We are on track with our decommissioning activity. 12. As at January 2022, we had decommissioned approximately 81% of our heritage systems, and removed about 30% of the infrastructure components from our heritage data centres. These percentages have increased significantly since we last reported them to you (IR2021/507 refers). There is no direct correlation between applications and infrastructure, as much of the infrastructure supports multiple applications. 13. A key achievement during January 2022 was the successful relocation of our contact centre solution from our heritage systems to our new data centres. 14. Our high-level timetable remains: • From 1 December 2021 until early April 2022, we will shut down old heritage systems, archive any data that is to be retained, and then remove the systems and databases. • In April 2022, once all the systems have been removed, the network connections and supporting services will be shut down, and the process of dismantling and disposing of the infrastructure will begin. • We remain on track to e xit our heritage Unisys data centres by 30 June 2022. Final progress update for Cabinet 15. You agreed (IR2021/309 refers) that the final progress update for transformation would be provided to Cabinet in February 2022. This timing was agreed before the Cabinet Committee timetable for 2022 was set. The Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee (GOV) will meet on 10 February 2022. For the paper to be considered at this meeting, it would have ha d to be finalised by 3 February 2022. As we have not yet finalised the paper for the Minister of Revenue to review, it was not possible for us to meet this date. 16. We are aiming to have the final transformation progress update considered at GOV’s meeting on 17 March 2022. We intend to provide the draft paper to the Minister of Revenue by mid-February 2022. Key risks and issues 17. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains light amber this month. A light amber profile means that risks and mitigations are defined and understood, and the mitigations are expected to be successful. 18. The issue (a risk that has been realised) relating to Vodafone being unable to provide the support needed to move a heritage application from our heritage Unisys data centre 5 IR2022/043: Transformation status update: December 2021/January 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] to the cloud before Christmas, due to resource availability, has been resolved. Together with Vodafone, we identified a solution and completed this work as planned before Christmas. 19. As of December 2021 2 , the programme had a total of 15 open risks 3 . One of these risks is reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 20. Three risks previously reported to the PGC were closed during December 2021: • The risk relating to decommissioning FIRST by 30 June 2022 did not eventuate, as FIRST was handed over to Unisys to begin decommissioning on 30 November 2021 as planned. • The risk relating to delays in decommissioning the heritage KiwiSaver business-to- business solution did not eventuate. All KiwiSaver providers have successfully migrated to the new gateway services. • The risk relating to decommissioning SAP, which supports our payroll, did not eventuate. Our payroll system was successfully relocated to a cloud-based solution on 15 November 2021. 21. The one remaining risk reported to the PGC relates to delays in decommissioning our heritage data warehouse, an application our staff use to analyse data 4 . The current rating of this risk is high. However, it is unlikely to occur (a 3% to 10% chance), as the majority of the planned mitigations have been completed and the issue relating to Vodafone resourcing has been resolved (refer to paragraph 18 ). Coming up in the next two months 22. Key activities over the next two months include: February 2022 • Continue with decommissioning activity, including decommissioning our heritage data warehouse. March 2022 • Continue with decommissioning activity. • Final progress update considered by the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee. 2 Programme risks were not re-assessed during January 2022 due to the holiday break. 3 During December 2021, nine programme risks were closed, including three reported to the PGC. One risk was transferred from the programme to its enduring home to manage. 4 This risk has since been closed, which we will formally report in the February status update.

Support for businesses and self-employed people

Insurance pay-out tax relief
----------------------------

Insurance payouts for destroyed business assets can lead to businesses earning profits and depreciation recovery income that may be taxed. If you have received insurance or compensation for business assets destroyed by the North Island floods, you can defer paying tax on profits earnt and depreciation recovery income by declaring it in a later year. This is provided that the assets are replaced by the end of the 2027-28 income year.

If you want to declare this income in a later year, you must file an election by 30 April 2024, or in your earliest income tax return, when you can reasonably estimate what your insurance payout will be.

If you file an election, you can leave the deferred income out of your income tax return for that income year. An election is required each year to continue to defer the income until you replace the asset.

When you acquire a replacement asset, your deferred income is subtracted from the cost of the replacement asset in your income tax return. If you do not replace the asset by the end of the 2027-28 tax year, then the tax relief is ceased in that year. If your business ceases operations or acquires replacement assets in an income year before the 2027-28 tax year, the relief would cease in the earlier income year.

We will include more information in our May Tax Information Bulletin.

In the meantime, for further detail on the provisions and how they might apply to an insurance pay-out, please refer to the Commentary to the Bill.

Grants available following Cyclone Gabrielle
--------------------------------------------

Grants and subsidies were available to businesses and other organisations following Cyclone Gabrielle.

### Farmer and grower recovery grant (MPI)

This grant was for urgent repair work. If you are unsure if this grant applies to your business, you can check the MPI website.

[Cyclone Gabrielle recovery: advice, support, and funding (www.mpi.govt.nz)](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/funding-rural-support/adverse-events/cyclone-gabrielle-recovery-advice-support-and-funding-available/)

This grant was made for deductible expenditure or depreciable property, so is not taxable. However, your business cannot claim deductions for the expenses paid for by the payment. Nor can you claim the full amount of depreciation on any depreciable property funded by the grant. Calculate depreciation on the cost of the asset less the value of the grant.

If your business is, or is liable to be, GST registered and the payment is for use in your taxable activity, the payment is liable to GST. This means it should be included in your GST return.

### Cyclone-Gabrielle rural sector funding (MPI)

This grant was made to sector and regional groups to help with immediate recovery efforts. 

If you are unsure if this grant applies to your business, you can check the MPI website.

[Cyclone Gabrielle recovery: advice, support, and funding (www.mpi.govt.nz)](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/funding-rural-support/adverse-events/cyclone-gabrielle-recovery-advice-support-and-funding-available/)

If the grant was made for deductible expenditure or depreciable property, it is not taxable. However, your business cannot claim deductions for the expenses paid for by the payment. Nor can you claim the full amount of depreciation on any depreciable property funded by the grant. Calculate depreciation on the cost of the asset less the value of the grant.

If your business is, or is liable to be, GST registered and the payment is for use in your taxable activity, the payment is liable to GST. This means it should be included in your GST return.

### Cyclone business recovery grant (MBIE)

This grant was made by MBIE to help business keep operating while maintaining cashflow. It was paid by the following delivery partners.

*   Auckland Business Chamber
*   Hawke's Bay Chamber of Commerce
*   Masterton District Council
*   Northland Inc
*   Tararua District Council
*   Thames Coromandel District Council
*   Toi Economic Development Agency
*   Trust Tairawhiti.

This grant is an income subsidy and is taxable to your business. If you use the grant to pay any expenses, your business can still claim a deduction for those expenses.

If your business is, or is liable to be, GST registered and the payment is for use in your taxable activity, the payment is liable to GST. This means it should be included in your GST return.

We recommend you get advice from the grant provider or your tax advisor, as the contractual arrangements can change the GST treatment of these payments.

### Grants from non-government entity, including relief payments from mayoral relief funds

Your business might have received a non-government grant to help you following Cyclone Gabrielle. For example, a grant from another business to help your repair fencing or relief payments from a mayoral relief fund.

In general, funds are taxable to your business if they were provided as an income subsidy, for cashflow or to pay for deductible expenses. Deductions are still available for expenses you incur.

If you received funds to help get depreciable property, the funds are not usually not taxable. A depreciation loss might be available.

Support for property owners

The bright-line test and other land time-related tests do not tax properties affected by a North Island adverse weather event purchased by a Crown or local authority.

Property owners qualify for the bright-line test main home exclusion if they needed to vacate their home for a reasonable period to repair damages from a North Island flooding event.

Support for you or your family

### Relief payments and Working for Families 

Support or relief payments received by individuals and families affected by the recent weather events do not need to be included in your income for Working for Families purposes. 

### IRD Number applications

If you’ve recently applied for an IRD number, and you’ve been affected by the recent weather events, you have an extra 4 weeks (from the time your road access is restored) to complete your in-person identity verification details. 

Affected customers are customers that have been impacted by the effects of the emergency events and they are physically unable to complete the in-person verification of identity documents (because for instance, roading infrastructure has been destroyed) normally required by us to issue them with an IRD number. 

Penalties and interest

If you let us know as soon as you reasonably can that you’ve been affected by the recent adverse weather, we can then remit any late filing and payment penalties, and some interest. You’ll need to ask us to do this and have paid the core tax as soon as you reasonably can.

JG Russell unsuccessful in appeal of his personal tax assessments
=================================================================

2010 case note - appeal rejected by High Court and assessments based upon tax avoidance reconfirmed - Russell template, personal exertions.

Case

John George Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

An appeal by the taxpayer from a Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decision had been rejected by the High Court. Assessments based upon tax avoidance have been reconfirmed.

### Impact of decision

The decision is no surprise given the clear tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement.  
The taxpayer has filed a further appeal in the Court of Appeal.

### Facts

This was an appeal from the TRA (_Case Z19_ (2009) 24 NZTC 14,217).

The taxpayer was the designer and promoter of the “Russell template” tax avoidance scheme. This case addressed his personal tax affairs from 1985 to 2000. It has little to no relationship with the template litigation.

Mr Russell had earned income through his personal exertions including, but not confined to, the sale of the Russell template. Originally a sole trader, he had entered into a partnership structure using two companies that he controlled to create the Commercial Management Partnership. The income earned by Mr Russell’s activities was attributed to the partners. Throughout the life of the partnership new partners would be introduced to replace old ones.

In addition the partners individually would enter agency and management agreements with tax loss companies. The tax losses companies were controlled by Mr Russell. The partners would account to the loss companies for any income earned and that income would be sheltered by the loss in the loss company. As the tax losses of any particular company were used up, a new tax loss company would be substituted in (using agency and management agreements). The cash would, however, be “banked” with finance companies controlled by Mr Russell.

The TRA concluded that the structure was tax avoidance and that Mr Russell was a person affected by it (under section BG1 and its predecessor section 99), confirming the Commissioner’s reconstructive assessments to Mr Russell personally.

The taxpayer appealed the TRA decision on all points but at the High Court abandoned most of the points taken and confined the appeal to three main points.

In summary those points were that if there was an arrangement then it was properly confined to that between the partner companies and the tax loss companies (the agency and management agreements) and not the wider arrangement the Commissioner argued for. If the taxpayer was correct then there was no rationale to reconstruct to Mr Russell personally.

### Decision

Relying upon _Ben Nevis_, Justice Wylie had little difficulty finding the existence of an arrangement. He rejected the narrow arrangement contended for by the taxpayer in favour of the Commissioner’s wider arrangement, primarily because of Mr Russell’s complete control of the entire structure.

The Judge relied upon the recent Court of Appeal decision in _Penny & Hooper v CIR_ to agree that, while the taxpayer had used legitimate corporate, partnership and trust structures, the Commissioner was entitled to challenge the way those structures were employed. The arrangement did alter the incidence of tax, it was contrived, and involved pretence.

His Honour concluded that there was a tax advantage: firstly by Mr Russell divesting himself of personal exertions income into the structure and then, secondly, by the use of the tax loss companies to shelter that income.

The Judge rejected a submission by the taxpayer that he received no tax advantage as he did not receive any money from the arrangement, observing that this was not the test. The proper test was whether there was a tax advantage and the arrangement did confer a tax advantage on Mr Russell (by divesting him of his personal exertions income and then avoiding tax on that income).

Issues are an important aspect of any project or programme and must be identified and managed to a predefined framework to ensure consistent and reliable application across teams and the programme. 1 Managing Issues in B usiness Transformat ion 1. Definition of an Issue An issue is an unplanned situation that has occurred and justifies management consideration and possible action. If left unresolved it will impact upon the achievement of investment objectives. An issue can also be a risk which has come to fruition and requires resolution. 2. Rating an Issue The Issue rating is based on the analysis of the impacts and the determination of the level of consequences as prescribed in the IR ERMP/F. • Low - Any impact which is assessed as Minimal within the relevant Consequence Matrix. • Medium - Any impact which is assessed as Minor within the relevant Consequence Matrix. • High - Any impact which is assessed as Moderate within the relevant Consequence Matrix. • Very High - Any impact which is assessed as Major within the relevant Consequence Matrix (eg an issue that has a high chance of moving a major milestone date or increasing cost if not resolved.) • Extreme - Any impact which is assessed as Severe within the relevant Consequence Matrix (eg the issue must be resolved immediately or a major milestone/implementation date will be moved and/or there will be a significant increase in cost). 3. Escalating Issues Issues generally materialise at the workstream level and are managed appropriately. However, at times, an Issue may need further management intervention either at the PLT or PGC level. Below are a set of criteria to determine if management escalation is required. PLT PGC For an issue • issues are systemic (across more than one workstream) • issues rated as Extreme • issues stop a deliverable being met • issues impact outside of the Programme (inter-dependencies) • issues have the following themes: o ongoing resource constraints o serious business or external stakeholder impact o legislative implications o public perception/media implications. • issues rated as High and mitigation strategies are not effective • issues already monitored at Programme- level and identified to be merged or for closure • a major change of the wording leading to a change in the nature of the issue • a change of the rating decreasing from Extreme or increasing to Extreme. • issues rated as Extreme • issues rated as High with non-effective mitigation strategies • issues already escalated and qualified as “Major” for monitoring purposes. 4.

The email notification contains links to the Issue in JIRA, allowing quick access for review. Note: All “watchers” of your risks and issues will receive a notification email when changes are made within the JIRA ticket. Following JIRA upgrade 8.3.4 (Q4 2019), the notifications are batched and sent between 30-60 mins). Note that the time counts down from first edit on an issue – then all changes made on that issue within the next hour will be sent at the end of that hour. If you would like someone to receive a notification sooner, add an @name mention in the comments field and they will receive the notification immediately. To reduce email traffic (still worthwhile as your edits may not be captured in the timed hour), editing can be done in one screen, this will then summarise all changes in one email.

Risks are identified at the workstream, release and programme (PLT/PGC) level. Below is the high-level business process supporting JIRA and the overarching risk framework based on IR’s enterprise framework. 1 BT Risks in JIRA – At a glance 1. A workstream has identified a risk and created the record in JIRA. 2. The risk has been assigned to the person (risk owner) that is responsible for managing the risk. 3. The risk owner receives notice of the risk via email. 4. The risk is reviewed and can be Accepted or Rejected. 5. The user has the ability to also ‘Reassign’ the risk either to someone within their team, or to another workstream if relevant. 6. A user may ‘Reject’ if they believe it is not a valid risk. 7. Once the risk owner accepts the risk, the status moves to an ‘Active’ status . At this point, mitigations should be documented for the risk. 8. The risk remains ‘Active’ until it is no longer valid. For Active risks requiring PLT approval (these are tabled at the monthly Programme Risk Meeting (PRM): 9. Once Active, a user may select the risk to be reviewed/escalated for acceptance by PLT members by selecting ‘Escalate to PLT’ 10. The status will update to ‘For PLT Review’. 11. Once reviewed by PLT members at PRM, the risk will switch back to ‘Active’ status. Note: New programme escalated risks require PLT approval. 12. Once the risk is no longer valid, then it should be proposed for closure. 13. The risk owner is notified that the risk is proposed for closure via email. 14. The risk owner should review that the risk is no longer valid. If so, then the risk is ‘closed’. Note: All programme risks require PLT approval for closure.

Under JIRA Risk, controls and treatments are referred to as mitigations. A JIRA risk mitigation can either be currently in place to reduce the inherent risk level (referred to as a “control”) or be a planned future activity to reduce the current risk level (referred to as a “treatment”). Note: all Open or In Progress mitigations are the equivalent of “treatments”. All Closed mitigations are the equivalent of “controls 1. To add a Mitigation in JIRA to a specific risk, within the risk record Click More. 2. A dropdown box will appear, scroll down and click Create Sub-Task. 3. A mitigation in JIRA uses the sub- task functionality. Once you have set up a mitigation it may be used across one or many risks. Issue Type – Mitigation Summary – Brief description of the mitigation. Release - enter the release your risk relates to. Component –The workstream the mitigation is being owned by. Description – Detailed description of the mitigation. Due Date – the date the mitigation is due to be completed. Assignee – the team member responsbile for the mitigation. Labels – an effective way of categorising information in JIRA if there is a common theme Attachment – attachment a document if relevant to the mitigation 4. Click Create to finalise the mitigation record. A sub-task record will then be added to the appropriate risk.

The mitigation is recorded as BTR- 27 and is noted as being related to risk BTR-26. NB: numbering in JIRA is sequential for all records. 6. Once you are ready to start work on the mitigation Click Start Progress. This indicates that the mitigation is in progress and to be completed by the due date. 7. Click Close if work on the mitigation is complete and in place. The mitigation is now set to the status of Closed. 8. If during a regular risk review, the mitigation is considered to be failing or not effective, then the mitigation should be re-addressed or rejected. If rejected, then click on the Reject button to update the status. 9. Alternatively, if a mitigation needs to be reassigned to a different risk, you will need to change the parent risk. To do this, click on the More drop down and select “move”. Select “Change Parent” then next. Type in the risk reference where the mitigation should be moved to. Click “Change Parent” and it will then be reassigned. Page | 10 https://irnz.sharepoint.com/sites/BT/PMO/lead/IR's Guide to Transformation External Site - Developing the Narrative/Delivering the Transformation (Collateral)/Getting Going/PMO/IR BT JIRA Risks Guide.docx Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Fre que nt ly Aske d Que st io ns (F AQ) 1. What is the difference between a risk and an issue? A risk is an event that may happen in the future. An issue is an unplanned event that has already happened. 2. What’s the difference between a Workstream, Release and Programme (PLT, PGC) risk? Workstream risks are those that only impact the specific workstream. Release or programme risks are those that affect the programme. Programme risks are monitored by the PLT with a subset of these being reported to the PGC. Changes to programme risks are required to be approved by PLT members at the monthly Programme Risk Meeting (PRM). 3. How do I write a good risk description? Risks should be written with the following details: • Risk event: What event could impact the achievement of an objective • Triggers: What would cause this risk event to occur • Consequences: What are the consequences on achieving an objective if the risk event occurs. Example of Risk Event: • There is a risk that there is unauthorised (and non-malicious) disclosure of confidential information Triggers: • Lack of awareness of data sharing process and tools • The IR standard for data sharing and tools has not been well- communicated to all staff • The LearnIR security modules do not cover all of IR‟s standard data sharing process and tools Consequences: • Inadvertent disclosure of customer confidential information • Loss of public trust and confidence • Damage to IR’s reputation • Lawsuit and/or compensation to affected customers • Privacy complaint/Ministerial inquiry 4. Who can be a risk owner? Anyone can be a risk owner. The risk owner should be the person that is responsible for overseeing that the risk is mitigated appropriately. Frequently this will be a team lead, workstream lead, PLT member, or programme manager. 5. What is a mitigation? A mitigation is an action that is or will support the reduction of the likelihood and / or consequence of the risk event from occurring. Note: The programme considers all controls and treatments as mitigations. 6. What are the differences between an inherent, current and residual risk? Inherent risk (or “initial” risk): This is the risk rating before any action has been taken to manage the risk. Current risk: This is the risk rating with current mitigations already in place. Page | 11 https://irnz.sharepoint.com/sites/BT/PMO/lead/IR's Guide to Transformation External Site - Developing the Narrative/Delivering the Transformation (Collateral)/Getting Going/PMO/IR BT JIRA Risks Guide.docx Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Residual risk (or “target” risk): This is a predicted risk rating that can be expected once the relevant mitigation(s) have been completed and implemented. 7. How do I correctly assess risks? Where do I find the right risk matrix, consequence and likelihood tables to use? The following criteria should be applied to support your risk assessment (including risk matrices) • For Programme, Release and Sub-Programme level risks and issues, please use the “Enterprise” Risk Consequence Criteria • For Workstream level risks and issues, please use the “Project” Risk Consequence Criteria 8. How often should risks be reviewed? Your risks should get reviewed at least monthly. Note: For programme level risks, the PMO may also request from risk owners’ i nformation and/ or updates (over and above the regular monthly meetings) to support various governance reporting requirements (e.g. PGC, Risk and Assurance Committee). 9. When do I close a risk? Workstream, release and programme risks for closure require the approval from the risk owner. These should only be closed once the risk event can no longer materialise. Closure of programme risks are required to be approved by PLT members at the monthly Programme Risk Meeting (PRM). The PMO will ensure these are captured in the Programme Risk Meetings dashboard. 10. Where do I go to find out more about the Programme Risk Meeting (PRM)? The Risks & Issues SharePoint site displays meeting detail including location. Please refer to the PRM Terms of Reference for more information. 11. Where can I go to find more general tips and guidance with regard to managing risks and issues in JIRA? Refer to the General Tips and Guidance - Risks and Issues guide which includes instruction on how to create filters, dashboards, bulk editing and more. The BT PMO Tools team may also be able to assist with more technical queries. Contact: BTPMOTools BTPMOTools@ird.govt.nz.

As expected, customers are taking time to get used to the new look and feel of myIR and child support services. 11.Som e customers have needed help to find their way around the new-look myIR, as they struggle to locate specific information in the new layout. Others have sought reassurance about their COVID-19 support applications, particularly those who had issues applying for the fourth Resurgence Support Payment when this opened on 29 October 2021. We have started to survey individual customers about the myIR changes and over the next couple of weeks we will also survey businesses, intermediaries and child support customers. 12.Th e number of issues we are experiencing are within the levels we expected this early in the release. As we have for all previous releases, there are some areas we are working through to see if we can make improvements. For example, we are seeing some dissatisfaction with some of the functionality of myIR from our larger tax agents and employers which we are working to improve. 13.Da y 1 packs were sent to intermediaries, businesses and employers on 28 October 2021.

Key risks and issues 23.The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber, with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 24.We are actively managing one issue (a risk that has been realised). This issue relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme and continues to be monitored closely. There are no concerns to report at this time. 25.The issue raised last month regarding transferring historic child support suspense account balances to START has been resolved and is now closed. 26.As at O ctober 2021, the programme has a total of 42 open risks 2 , of which 9 are reported to the PGC. 27.One risk previously reported to the PGC was closed during the month. 2 During October 2021, three programme risks were closed, including one reported to the PGC.

2014 case note - application for judicial review of the CIR's decision declining an application for financial relief – serious hardship.

Case

P v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This case concerned an application for judicial review of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's decision declining an application by Mr P for financial relief under section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Impact of decision

The Court confirmed that with the introduction of subsection (1B) into section 177 of the TAA, the year-by-year analysis will no longer be open to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"); a global approach is mandated. However, the subsection does not require the Commissioner to depart from the causation approach.

Taxpayers' late responses to the Commissioner's requests for further information must be treated as a new application for financial relief. Accordingly, it is necessary for the Commissioner to obtain updated information from taxpayers as to their financial position as at the date of the deemed application before making a decision whether or not to accept the taxpayer's application for relief under section 177 of the TAA.

### Facts

The applicant is a self-employed professional who earned well in excess of $200,000 for each of the 2000-2007 tax years, with the exception of 2002, when he earned $190,000. He earned $215,000 in 2008, $182,000 in 2009, $132,000 in 2010, $347,000 in 2011 and $94,000 in 2012. Mr P has experienced significant health difficulties since the late 1980s. Mr P's wife also suffers from significant health issues.

Despite his not insignificant income, Mr P has frequently defaulted on his tax payments and has repeatedly fallen into arrears. He has claimed that his inability to meet his tax obligations is due to his health issues and on a number of occasions he has applied for financial relief under section 177 of the TAA.

Mr P again requested financial relief in July 2011 ("the July 2011 application"). This application was declined on 26 September 2011. Mr P then wrote to the Commissioner disputing the decision. The application was referred to one of the Commissioner's officers and then on 7 November 2011, it was again declined. In November 2011, the parties entered into an instalment arrangement. However, Mr P failed to pay any of the instalments agreed to.

In March 2012, Mr P in effect asked the Commissioner to reconsider his application for financial relief on the grounds of serious hardship ("the March 2012 application"). The Commissioner declined that application and it was recommended that debt recovery action be taken against Mr P. In July 2012, Mr P commenced judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner.

In September 2012, the Commissioner agreed to reconsider both the July 2011 application and the March 2012 application. On 30 May 2013 she requested further information from Mr P. The required information was mostly provided by Mr P on 1 July 2013, with a further tax return being provided on 3 July 2011.

Prior to a decision being made on the July 2011 and March 2012 applications, Mr P made a further application for relief based on the serious hardship provisions.

On 16 August 2013 the Commissioner wrote to Mr P declining his request for hardship.

### Decision

Wylie J began his analysis of the issue by setting out the relevant statutory provisions of the TAA including section 177, which sets out the circumstances in which a taxpayer may apply for financial relief, and section 177A which defines "serious hardship".

In relation to section 177, his Honour's focus was on subsection (1B) (an amendment to section 177 that came into force in 2012) which requires the Commissioner to assess the taxpayer's financial position as at the date on which the application for financial relief is made.

Counsel for Mr P submitted that the introduction of subsection (1B) into section 177 changed the effect of the section. He argued that the introduction of subsection (1B) changed the previously applied "causation test" to a "prospective test" and that the focus is now on the taxpayer's ability to pay the tax assessed without financial difficulties at the time the application was made. In opposition, the Commissioner submitted that the "causation test" still applied.

Wylie J, in his analysis of subsection (1B), referred to the cases of _W v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,602 ("_W_") and _Larmer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,016 (HC); \[2011\] NZCA 157, (2011) 25 NZTC 20-043 ("_Larmer_"), which considered section 177 prior to the introduction of section 177 (1B) and which both held that in determining whether a person is in serious hardship, it was necessary to consider the causes of that hardship. In the present case, Wylie J concluded that subsection (1B) was introduced to do away with the year-by-year approach and mandate a global approach. His Honour found that in accordance with subsection (1B) the Commissioner is required to consider the taxpayer's financial position at the date on which the application for financial relief is made. Subsection (1B) does not, however, either expressly or by implication, require the Commissioner to depart from the causation approach discussed in _W_ and in _Larmer_.

In relation to the Commissioner's decision letter, Wylie J emphasised the absence of any express reference to Mr P's financial position as at the date of the application. Wylie J also considered that the decision letter was not clear as to which application was being considered. His Honour observed that the Commissioner's memorandum, which served as the background information upon which the Commissioner's decision was made, did not include any analysis of Mr P's financial position as at the date of the application. Further, he considered the letter appeared to be based on out-of-date information. Accordingly, his Honour concluded that the Commissioner had not abided with the relevant statutory provisions and had not, in her decision of 16 August 2013, considered Mr P's financial position as at the date on which his application for financial relief was made.

Further, his Honour found that the March 2013 application had been overtaken by a later application. Section 177(5) of the TAA states that if additional information is received out of date, that this information is to be considered an additional request. As Mr P did not respond to the request for further information that the Commissioner made on 30 May 2013 within the timeframe required (within 20 working days), his Honour found that a new application for financial relief was deemed to be made on 3 July 2013. It was on this date that Mr P provided, and the Commissioner received, the requested information.

Wylie J found the provision of this late information to be relevant because it meant that the Commissioner did not possess up to date information as to the applicant's financial position at the date of this deemed date of application. This was important as the Commissioner did not have, and could not know, Mr P's financial position as at the deemed date of the application, being 3 July 2013. The significance of this was that in an earlier statement of financial position as at 1 June 2013, one of Mr and Mrs P's properties was for sale which potentially could have impacted on the plaintiff's financial position and substantially reduced his mortgage outgoings.

His Honour noted that the provisions in section 177(5) are in his view odd and may enable a defaulting taxpayer to potentially abuse the process by providing requested information late and thereby obtaining a fresh application date. However, he did not suggest that to be the position in the present case.

In conclusion, his Honour held that the Commissioner had not properly applied the law as required by sections 177(1B) and (5). Wylie J referred to section 6(1) as requiring the Commissioner to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, recognising the right of taxpayers to have their liability determined according to the law, and the responsibility of those administering the law to do so according to law. His Honour held that that had not occurred in this instance and as a result the Commissioner had failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely Mr P's financial position as at the deemed date of his application. The Court allowed Mr P's judicial review and set aside the Commissioner's decision.

The Court also directed that the orders made by Venning J prohibiting publication of Mr and Mrs P's names and his identifying particulars were to continue on a permanent basis.

It was Wylie J's preliminary view that costs should lie where they fall. However, if this view was not accepted, then any application for costs by Mr P was to be made within 10 days of the release of the reserved judgment. The Commissioner was to respond and the application would be dealt with on the papers.

Judicial Review action against Commissioner struck out because disputes process not followed
============================================================================================

2009 case note - High Court struck out the proceedings because taxpayer did not follow disputes process in first instance - bankruptcy proceedings, judicial review.

Case

Raureti Reginald Ruka KORAKO v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The Commissioner took bankruptcy proceedings against the taxpayer, who then took Judicial Review proceedings against the Commissioner claiming abuse of process with assessments. The High Court struck out the proceedings because the taxpayer did not follow the disputes process in the first instance.

### Impact of decision

The case follows similar strike out cases which confirm that the courts are unlikely to consider a judicial review of the Commissioner's actions in relation to the disputes process unless the Plaintiff has correctly followed the statutory process set down for disputing assessments.

### Facts

The Plaintiff was the subject of amended income tax assessments and default income tax assessments for the years ending 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005. He did not challenge the assessments within the time periods prescribed in the Tax Administration Act 1994. A default judgment was obtained by the Commissioner and bankruptcy proceedings were commenced.

On 5 March 2009, the Plaintiff's tax agent filed tax returns for the years ending 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005. The returns contained no supporting material. Although contact was made with the investigator to establish that the returns had been received nothing further occurred. In particular no Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") or other response notice was made in relation to the assessments.

The Plaintiff commenced judicial review proceedings seeking:

1.  an order staying the bankruptcy proceedings, and
2.  an order that the Commissioner allow the plaintiff to dispute the tax assessments through the disputes process provided for in the Act.

The Commissioner applied to strike out the proceedings on the grounds that they were clearly untenable and that the proceedings amounted to an abuse of process.

The Plaintiff then applied for an interim order under section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972, staying the bankruptcy proceedings until the determination of the judicial review proceedings.

### Decision

On the facts of the case Allan J found that the Plaintiff's ignorance of the assessments stemmed from his decision to entrust the conduct of his business and tax affairs to others and his failure to pay proper attention to the conduct of his affairs. There was no evidence to say that the Plaintiff had no knowledge of the assessments. The evidence of the investigator that the Plaintiff failed to attend several meetings was also undisputed. Even now the Plaintiff has not formally responded to the Commissioner or engaged in the disputes process.

The affidavit evidence of the Plaintiff argued more about the derivation of the income which was assessed. The argument was irrelevant for judicial review purposes.

Allan J agreed that there was no breach of natural justice under the Bill of Rights Act (_Daganayasi v Minister of Immigration_ \[1980\] 2 NZLR 130) and that it cannot be argued that the Commissioner was bound to accept excessively late filing of self-assessment on behalf of the Plaintiff. Nor was there any foundation for a pleading that the Commissioner's refusal to accept the recent tax returns (which contained no supporting evidence or explanation) amounted to an abuse of process.

The remaining cause of action (directing Commissioner to engage in disputes process) was seen as premature as the Plaintiff could still engage the disputes process.

The strike out action succeeds and the Commissioner is entitled to costs.

Judicial review application dismissed
=====================================

2011 case note - judicial review proceedings, default assessments, provisional taxpayer, exercise of discretion, priority of applying funds.

Case

Hanh Duc Nguyen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The High Court dismissed the taxpayer's judicial review proceedings as the taxpayer failed to show that when making the default assessments the Commissioner could not have exercised a genuine and honest judgment, and that the Commissioner erred in considering the exercise of his discretionary powers to amend the assessments under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

### Impact of decision

No implications arise from this decision.

### Facts

The taxpayer in this proceeding ("the taxpayer") and associates came to the attention of Inland Revenue following a police raid at an Auckland hotel in October 2005, in which a large sum of cash ($137,980), money bags, four Lexus vehicles, methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia were found.

The taxpayer claimed ownership of the money. However, he gave multiple explanations of how he obtained it, including from a money-lending business, buying and selling scrap metal and from the sale of his grandmother's property in Vietnam.

On 16 December 2005, default assessments for income tax and goods and services tax (GST) were issued to the taxpayer, for the periods 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. He was advised that a total sum of $153,518.57 was owed to Inland Revenue, and that this amount would be deducted from the money held by the police.

The taxpayer failed to issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment and challenge the assessments pursuant to the applicable statutory procedures in the TAA.

Subsequently, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced in March 2010 on the basis of a default judgment in the District Court. The taxpayer sought to oppose the bankruptcy proceedings and requested the Commissioner correct the assessments under section 113 of the TAA.

Further information provided by the taxpayer to Inland Revenue was considered. However, it did not adequately show a clear and unambiguous error had been made in making the default assessments.

### Decision

Mallon J dismissed the taxpayer's judicial review proceeding.

#### _Issue 1: Whether errors in the default assessments are such that the Commissioner cannot have exercised a genuine and honest judgment when making those assessments_

The Court stated that in order to challenge a default assessment the taxpayer is required to follow the statutory procedures, and the scope for judicial review is limited. A purported assessment may be challenged in judicial review proceedings if it "is not an assessment at all" or if exceptional circumstances exist bringing it outside sections 109 and 114 of the TAA (_Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] NZLR 99).

Also, an assessment is not an assessment at all if the assessment was "no more than an arbitrary conjecture or was demonstrably unfair". The Commissioner is required to "exercise judgment" and make the assessment "on an intelligible basis" and not act "arbitrarily in disregard of the law or facts as known to him" (_Lowe v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1981\] 1 NZLR 326). However, there is not a "high threshold as to the material on which that judgment is based" (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Wool Board_ (1999) 119 NZTC 15,476). But there must be a genuine attempt to ascertain the income "even if carried out cursorily or perfunctorily".

The Court found that the taxpayer failed to show that in making the default assessments, the Commissioner could not have exercised a genuine and honest judgement or that any exceptional circumstances existed.

Mallon J also commented on several occasions that the taxpayer had the opportunity to dispute the default assessments under the statutory procedures but failed to do so.

#### _Issue 2: Whether the Commissioner erred in considering the exercise of the discretionary power to amend the assessments under section 113 of the TAA_

The Court stated that a decision not to amend an assessment under section 113(1) of the TAA is not a disputable decision for which there is a right to invoke the statutory dispute and challenge proceedings \[section 138E(1)(e)(iv) and 138E(2) of the TAA\]. Nor does section 113 confer a reviewable statutory duty or obligation to reassess on request by the taxpayer _(Lawton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,042). However, section 113 does confer a discretionary statutory power which can be exercised on the Commissioner's own motion or on request, in accordance with statutory criteria and the purpose of the legislation (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wilson_ (1996) 1 NZTC 12,512). The Commissioner is not obliged to reinvestigate the taxpayer's liability where the taxpayer provides information and/or seeks to have the Commissioner exercise the power under section 113.

In this case, the Court identified two points that warranted possible further consideration. However, the Court was not prepared to direct the Commissioner to reconsider the default assessments on those two points, as the two requests by the taxpayer were non-specific and incomplete. Further, the Commissioner had shown a preparedness to reconsider matters and use section 113 of the TAA to amend assessments where genuine errors were made.

#### _Issue 3: Whether the taxpayer was liable to pay interest in the income year ending 2005 for unpaid provisional tax_

The Court found that the taxpayer fell within the definition of provisional taxpayer in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and was therefore, correctly charged interest.

#### _Issue 4: Whether the Commissioner was correct to apply the taxpayer's money to his GST liability ahead of his income tax liability_

The Court accepted the Commissioner's explanation that the application of funds is applied according to the priority protocol, which lists GST above income or provisional tax.
