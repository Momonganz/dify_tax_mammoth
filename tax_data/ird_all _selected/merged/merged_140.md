Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1986
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1986 from PIB vol 151 Jun 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 151, June 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
Â 

This Act gives effect to the 20 August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform announcement of measures to:

*   Reduce personal income tax rates with effect from 1 October 1986 to coincide with the introduction of GST.
*   Replace the present family rebate available through the tax system and the Family Care Scheme and child supplement payments made by the Department of Social Welfare with a new Family Support Tax Credit (FSTC) scheme (which incorporates a guaranteed Minimum Family Income concept) with effect from 1 October 1986.
*   Abolish the principal income earner rebate with effect from 1 October 1986.
*   Introduce a transitional tax allowance as a personal tax rebate with effect from 1 October 1986.
*   Subject all basic income-tested Social Security benefits and income-tested war pensions to taxation with effect from 1 October 1986.

The Act received the Governor-General's assent on 6 May 1986 and is now law. Particular attention should be given to the dates from which the various amendments have effect.

**Part I** Deals with the personal income tax reform measures.

**Part II** Covers the provisions relating to the Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit schemes.

**Note:** The Minister recently announced the Government's intention to amend the FSTC scheme to enable provisional taxpayers to receive regular advance payments of Family Support through the Department of Social Welfare. It should be noted that this publication gives an explanation of the legislation that received the Governor-General's assent on 6 May 2986 and does not cover the proposed amendments. These will be explained in a subsequent publication which will be issued when the empowering legislation has been passed by the Government.

Amendments to PIB Number 147
----------------------------

The following are minor amendments relating to PIB 147 which provided a technical interpretation of the provisions of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1986.

### Page 13

The commentary on subsection (2) refers to qualifying expenditure incurred "on or after the 5th of May 1985". The commentary should read "on or after the 8th of May 1985".

### Page 22

The commentary on subsection (3) refers to the fact that the notice of election must be given to the Commissioner "before the taxpayer is required to furnish his or her return of income for the income year". This commentary should read "within the time within which the taxpayer is required to furnish his or her return of income for the income year".

(The previous wording may have led readers to conclude that the notice of election was required to be lodged prior to the lodging of the return of income. The correct position is that they may be lodged simultaneously).

### Page 33

The last two lines of the second paragraph read: "It ensures that the liability of such backpayments for both income tax and surcharge purposes is the same. The effect is that backpayments of foreign social security pensions will be liable for the national superannuitant surcharge in the year of receipt".

These two sentences should be deleted and the following inserted: "It ensures that the liability for income tax and treatment for surcharge purposes is the same. The effect is that backpayments of foreign social security pensions will be included in the calculation of net national superannuation in the year of receipt".

### Page 34

The commentary that refers to subsection (1) of section 29 ends with the following two sentences: "This ensures that the liability of such backpayments for both income tax and surcharge purposes is the same (ie, in the year in which such backpayments of national superannuation and specified foreign security pensions are received they are deemed to be 'other income' and therefore liable for the national superannuitant surcharge)."

These two sentences should be deleted and the following inserted. "This ensures that the liability of such backpayments for income tax and their treatment in the calculation of the surcharge is the same (ie, the calculation of a national superannuitant's "other income" takes into account all the income received in the income year, irrespective of the year to which it relates.)"

Section 1 - Short Title And Application
---------------------------------------

This section provides that the Amendment Act is to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

It also provides that the various amendments are to apply from the date on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent (6 May 1986), unless otherwise stated. It is important to check the commencement date when applying any of the amending sections. The commentary which follows will bring this out.

### Part I - Personal Income Tax

This Part of the Amendment Act contains 15 sections which deal with the personal income tax reform measures announced in the 20 August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform other than the new Family Support/Guaranteed Minimum Family Income schemes which are outlined in Part II. Details of each of the sections follow.

Section 2 - Interpretation
--------------------------

This section makes a number of amendments to section 2 of the principal Act, the interpretation provision, which relate largely to the proposal to subject all basic income-tested benefits and income-tested war pensions to tax with effect from 1 October 1986.

### _Subsection (1) - Amendments to existing definitions_

**(a) Employer"**

The present definition of the term "employer" includes within its meaning the Director-General of Social Welfare in respect of payments of national superannuation and unemployment benefit. The amendment made by section 2(1)(a) achieves two things:

1.  It replaces the reference to the Director-General of Social Welfare with references to the Social Security Commission and War Pensions Board. This change ensures that the Income Tax Act "employer" definition is consistent with the Social Security Act 1964 (which provides that all benefit payments are LEGALLY made by the Social Security Commission) and the War Pensions Act 1954 (which provides that pension payments are legally made by the War Pensions Board). The change has no practical effect as in practice all the powers of the Social Security Commission and War Pensions Board in relation to the payment of benefits have been formally delegated to the Director-General of Social Welfare.
2.  It extends the "employer" definition by providing that the Social Security Commission will also be an employer in respect of those income-tested benefits (including the unemployed benefit) that are to become taxable from 1 October 1986. The definition is similarly extended to provide that a War Pensions Board will also be an employer in respect of those war pensions which are to become taxable from that date.

**(b) "National Superannuation"**

The present definition of the term "national superannuation" excludes from its ambit (and thus from being subject to tax) all supplementary benefits which are paid in addition to, but along with, the basic rates of national superannuation. The supplementary benefits so excluded are child supplements, the accommodation benefit and the special benefit, being amounts paid under sections 61A, 61E and 61G of the Social Security Act 1964 respectively. The definition is being amended with effect from 1 October 1986 to remove the reference to child supplements (which are to be replaced by family support) and to include references to the disability allowance (which is payable under section 69C of the Social Security Act) and to certain lump-sum payments of benefits made after death (which are payable under Sections 61DC, 61DD and 61DE of that Act) which can also be paid as supplements to national superannuation.

**(c) "Salary or Wages"**

The present definition of the term "salary or wages" includes within its meaning payments of national superannuation and of the unemployment benefit. The amendment made by section 2(1)(c) extends that meaning to also include payments of those income-tested benefits and war pensions that are to become taxable from 1 October 1986.

This amendment is significant in that it allows (through the definition of "income from employment" which includes "salary or wages") the standard deduction (section 105 of the principal Act) to be claimed against those benefits and war pensions which are to become taxable in October, in the same manner as that deduction is allowed against national superannuation and the unemployment benefit (in those cases where it is presently taxed).

**(d) "Unemployment Benefit"**

This definition is repealed by section 2(1)(d) of the Amendment Act. By virtue of its inclusion in the term "income-tested benefit" (see commentary that follows) and the amendments made in sections 7 and 8 of the Amendment Act, a separate definition of "unemployment benefit" is no longer necessary.

### _Subsection (2) - New Definitions_

**(a) "Income-tested Benefit"**

This is a new definition which specifies those income-tested Social Security benefits that are to become taxable from 1 October 1986. The definition includes the following benefits:

*   Domestic purposes benefit
*   Invalids' benefit
*   Sickness benefit
*   Unemployment benefit (at present taxable only where the recipient has no dependent children)
*   Widows' benefit

These are the five main "income maintenance" benefits paid by the Department of Social Welfare and although they have different eligibility criteria, each is paid at the same rate subject to an income test.

Also included are those emergency benefits which are paid (usually at the same rates as the five main income maintenance benefits) where an applicant has failed to meet the qualifying criteria for those benefits in certain circumstances.

Those emergency benefits which are paid at the same rate as the family benefit or as the standard tertiary bursary (paid pursuant to the Tertiary Assistance Grants Regulations 1982) are excluded from being taxable.

Specifically excluded from the "income-tested benefit" definition are those supplementary payments which can be paid in addition to and along with the basic income-tested benefit rates. These benefits are the accommodation benefit, the special benefit and the disability allowance which are payable under sections 61E, 61G and 69C of the Social Security Act respectively. Similarly excluded are those lump-sum payments of benefits made after death, payable under Sections 61DC, 61DD and 61DE of that Act, which do not represent a continuation of those benefits for a short period after death (which are payable under Section 61DB of the Social Security Act).

**(b) "Specified War Pension"**

This is a new definition which specifies those war pensions that are to become taxable from 1 October 1986. The definition includes the following war pensions:

*   War service pensions
*   War veterans allowances and gratuities
*   Economic pensions

These are the war pensions which are paid by the Department of Social Welfare subject to an income test. By their exclusion, those war pensions which are not subject to an income test, namely the war disablement pensions (this is the most commonly paid war pension), war widows' pensions, and those war pensions paid from overseas countries, will continue to be exempt from tax. All age and dependent's supplements paid with war pensions are similarly excluded from the definition and remain exempt from tax.

### _Subsection (3)_

This subsection makes amendments consequential to those outlined above.

### _Subsection (4)_

This subsection provides that all the section 2 definition amendments are to apply from 1 October 1986. This means in the 1986/87 income year only 6 months of benefit/war pension income will comprise taxable income (except in the case of those unemployment benefits paid to those without dependent children). See also the commentary on sections 7 and 8.

Section 3 - Child Rebate
------------------------

At present section 50A of the Income Tax Act provides that in those cases where a child qualifies for BOTH the child and principal income earner rebates, that child is entitled to claim only one of those rebates, whichever is to his/her advantage.

As a consequence of the replacement of the principal income earner rebate with the transitional tax allowance from 1 October 1986, this section now provides that:

*   In the 1986/87 income year, children who qualify for the principal income earner rebate and/or the transitional tax allowance will have the choice of claiming either the child rebate, or a combined entitlement to the principal income earner rebate and transitional tax allowance, whichever is to their advantage (subsections (1) and (3)).
*   In the 1987/88 and subsequent income years, children who qualify for BOTH the child rebate and the transitional tax allowance will be entitled to claim only one of those measures: whichever is to their advantage (subsections (2) and (4)).

The approach to be adopted in respect of those who qualify for both the child rebate and the transitional tax allowance thus parallels the position which currently applies to children who qualify for both the child and principal income earner rebates.

Section 4 - Principal Income Earner Rebate
------------------------------------------

This section gives effect to the abolition of the principal income earner rebate with effect from 1 October 1986. In order to avoid the need for claimants to keep details of income earned in the six months to 30 September 1986, the income for the full 1986/87 income year will be taken into account but only HALF the annual amount of the rebate will be available. This is the approach normally adopted in respect of income-related rebates which are abolished part way through an income year.

Persons who do not qualify for the principal income earner rebate at any time during the six months ending on 30 September 1986 will be excluded from claiming that rebate in their 1987 tax returns.

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection amends the "qualifying person" definition for the purposes of entitlement to the principal income earner rebate in respect of the 1986/87 income year so as to exclude those persons who:

1.  Receive national superannuation at all times throughout the six months ending on 30 September 1986; or
2.  Are children in respect of whom the family benefit has been payable at all times throughout that six-month period; or
3.  Had a spouse (de facto or de jure) at all times throughout that six month period and the spouse earned more than the person during the full 1986/87 tax year; or
4.  Are entitled to the family rebate in respect of the 1986/87 tax year; or
5.  Had a spouse (de facto or de jure) at all times throughout the six months ending on 30 September 1986 who was entitled to the family rebate in his or her own right in respect of the 1986/87 tax year; or
6.  Are not taxpayers in respect of income derived in the six month period ending on 30 September 1986; or
7.  Are deemed to be non-residents at all stages during that six month period.

*   The first five of these exclusions are the same as those that currently apply to the principal income earner rebate with the exception that the references to annual periods are replaced by six months periods. The two new exclusions are in respect of non-taxpayers and non-residents. The former of these is particularly important in that it excludes from entitlement to the principal income earner rebate those Social Security beneficiaries who derive no other income (as their benefits are not taxable until 1 October, they are non-taxpayers in respect of the first six months of the 1986/87 tax year).

### _Subsection (2)_

This subsection provides that entitlement to the principal income earner rebate in respect of the 1986/87 income year shall be as follows:

| Assessable Income ($) | Rebate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $6,117 | 4.25% of income |
| $6,118-$12,000 | $260 |
| $12,001-$15,152 | 8.25 % of the difference |
|     | between income and |
|     | $15,152 |
| $15,153 and over | Nil |

This approach effectively retains the principal income earner rebate until 31 March 1987 but at half the full year rate.

### _Subsections (3) and (4)_

These subsections provide for the repeal of the principal income earner rebate section (section 50B of the Income Tax Act) and of all amendments made to that section since its introduction. All such repeals are to take effect on 1 April 1987 with the result that all references to the principal income earner rebate in the Income Tax Act will disappear from that date.

### _Subsection (5)_

This subsection simply provides that the changes to the qualifying criteria and rebate amounts described above will apply to the 1986/87 income year only.

Section 5 - Transitional Tax Allowance
--------------------------------------

This section introduces a new section 50C in the principal Act which provides for the transitional tax allowance to be claimable as a tax rebate with effect from 1 October 1986. Details of the new allowance follow.

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection inserts the new section 50C into the Income Tax Act.

**_Section 50C(1)_** - This is the definition subsection of the new section 50C. It outlines five definitions as follows:

*   **"Family Benefit"**

This has the same meaning as in the new section 374A (the family support definition section) - see the commentary on that section later in this publication.

*   **"Full-time earner"**

This term is defined in relation to periods of one week. A person is regarded as a full-time earner in any week where that person works (either as an employee or as a self-employed person, or both) at least 30 hours during that week. Persons who would have met that requirement but for their having suffered an accident (for which earnings-related accident compensation is payable) or having been unfit for work due to sickness (for which the sickness benefit is payable) are also included. The definition also provides that where a pay period is longer than one week any hours worked during the pay period are deemed to have been worked at a uniform rate throughout the period when considering the 30 hours requirement.

*   **"Qualifying person"**

This is the key definition of the section. To qualify for the transitional tax allowance a person must have been a full-time earner (as defined above) at some stage during the income year AND that person must NOT:

1.  Be a child in respect of whom the family benefit has been payable at all times throughout the income year: nor
2.  Be a non-taxpayer in respect of that tax year (this exclusion has practical significance in respect of the 1986/87 transitional year only - see commentary on section 5(2) of the Amendment Act): nor
3.  Be a non-resident at all stages throughout the income year (this exclusion also has practical significance in respect of the 1986/87 transitional year only); nor
4.  Be a person who is entitled to a tax credit pursuant to Part XIA of the Act (as inserted by Part II of this Amendment Act) in the income year; or
5.  At all stages in the income year be a spouse of a person who, in the income year, is entitled to any tax credit pursuant to Part XIA of the principal Act.

**NB:**The qualifying criteria are based on those which apply for the principal income earner rebate. Thus, where as at present a person cannot claim both the principal income earner rebate and the family rebate, this definition continues that approach by ensuring that people cannot claim both the transitional tax allowance and be entitled to the Family Support or Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credits at the same time (the apportionment formula used reflects this relationship).

*   **"Remunerative work"**

This definition, by referring to the performance of work from which income is derived, ensures that both employees and the self-employed can be "full-time earners" (as defined).

*   **"Spouse"**

This has the same meaning as in the new section 374A (the family support definition section) - see the commentary on that section later in this publication.

**_Section 50C(2)_** - this section specifies how to calculate a qualifying person's entitlement to the transitional tax allowance. This is calculated in accordance with the formula:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| y   | x   | z   |
| 52  |

where "y" is determined from the following table:

| Assessable Income ($) | Transitional Tax Allowance (y) |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $6,240 ($120 pw) | $728 ($14 pw) |
| $6,241 - $9,880 | $728 reduced by 20% of |
|     | income over $6,240 |
| $0 - $9,880 ($190 pw) | Nil |

and where "z" is the number of weeks in which BOTH the taxpayer is a full-time earner (ie, has worked at least 30 hours) and in which neither the taxpayer nor his/her spouse has been entitled to a family benefit and subsequently a tax credit pursuant to Part XIA.

The proviso to section 50C(2) contains provision for the deferral of the date of ceasing to receive family benefit in certain cases. This provision is identical to those which appear in sections 374D(1)(a) (family support) and 394E(2)(a) (guaranteed minimum family income) - see the commentaries on those sections later in this publication. It ensures that where a deferral applies to extend FSTC/GMFI entitlement, entitlement to the transitional tax allowance is correspondingly reduced so that no person can claim the transitional tax allowance and be entitled to a tax credit pursuant to Part XIA at the same time.

_**Section 50C(3)**_ - This section provides for an adjustment of assessable income in those cases where a person departs from, or arrives in, New Zealand during an income year. In line with similar provisions which currently apply with the principal income earner and family rebates in such cases, the assessable income derived in New Zealand will be grossed up to reflect the annual equivalent of the income the person derived in the number of days in the income year he/she was resident in New Zealand.

### _Subsection (2)_

This subsection contains those amendments required for the 1986/87 transitional year to reflect the fact that the transitional lax allowance will be first available from 1 October 1986.

The section provides:

*   the "qualifying person" criteria are to apply in respect of the six-month period commencing on 1 October 1986. This will ensure that a person cannot claim the transitional tax allowance unless he/she qualifies for it in the second half of the 1986/87 income year.
*   the amounts of the transitional tax allowance are to be halved. Calculation of item y in the transitional tax allowance entitlement formula for the 1986/87 income year will thus be as follows:

| Assessable Income ($) | Transitional Tax Allowance (y) |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $6,240 ($120 pw) | $364 |
| $6,241 - $9,880 | $364 reduced by 10% of |
|     | income over $6,240 |
| $0 - $9,880 ($190 pw) | Nil |

This approach effectively means that the transitional tax allowance is available from 1 April 1986 but at HALF the full year rate.

### _Subsection (3)_

This subsection inserts a reference to the new section 50C in section 57 of the principal Act which ensures that the transitional tax allowance is to be available as a personal tax rebate.

### _Subsection (4)_

This subsection removes the 1986/87 transitional year provisions with effect from the end of the transitional year.

### _Subsection (5)_

This subsection provides that the transitional tax allowance shall apply to the income year commencing on 1 April 1986 (1986/87 income year) and every subsequent year. It should be noted that, despite the use of the word "transitional" in the title no provision is made in the legislation for the phase-out of this allowance.

Section 6 - Family Rebate
-------------------------

This section gives effect to the abolition of the family rebate with effect from 1 October 1986. In order to avoid the need for claimants to keep details of income earned in the six months to 30 September 1986, the income for the full 1986/87 income year will be taken into account but only half the annual amount of the rebate will be available. This is the approach normally adopted in respect of income-related rebates which are abolished part way through an income year.

Persons who do not qualify for the family rebate at any time during the six months ending on 30 September 1986 will be excluded from claiming that rebate in their 1987 tax returns.

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection amends the "family income" definition for the purposes of entitlement to the family rebate in respect of the 1986/87 income year to require a "family" to be in existence in the six months ending 30 September 1986, and in such cases to take the family income for the full 1986/87 income year.

### _Subsection (2)_

This subsection in effect amends the qualifying criteria for the family rebate by requiring that they be met at some time in the first six months of the 1986/87 tax year for a claim to be eligible.

### _Subsection (3)_

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection ensure that a person must qualify for the family rebate in the first six months of the 1986/87 income year for his/her claim to be eligible. Paragraph (a) is particularly important in that it excludes from entitlement to the family rebate those social security beneficiaries who derive no other income (as their benefits are not taxable until 1 October, they are non-taxpayers in respect of the first six months of the 1986/87 tax year).

Paragraphs (c) to (e) provide that entitlement to the family rebate in respect of the 1986/87 tax year shall be as follows:

| Family Income ($) | Rebate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $9,800 | $962 |
| $9,801 - $14,000 | $962 reduced by 7.5% of income |
|     | over $9,800 |
| $14,001 - $20,470 | $647 reduced by 10% of income |
|     | over $14,000 |
| $20,471 and over | Nil |

This approach effectively retains the family rebate until 31 March 1987 but at half the full year rate.

### _Subsections (4) and (5)_

These subsections provide for the repeal of the family rebate section (section 53C of the Income Tax Act) and of all amendments made to that section since its introduction. All such repeals are to take effect on 1 April 1987 with the result that all references to the family rebate the Income Tax Act will disappear from that date.

### _Subsection (6)_

This subsection simply provides that the changes to the qualifying criteria and rebate amounts described above will apply to the 1986/87 tax year only.

Section 7 - Incomes Wholly Exempt From Tax
------------------------------------------

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection amends section 61(10) of the principal Act. It removes from the war pensions tax exemption those war pensions paid under the War Pensions Act 1954 which are to become taxable from 1 October 1986. Such pensions are referred to as "specified war pensions" - refer to the commentary on the definition of "specified war pensions" as inserted by section 2(2) of this Amendment Act.

### _Subsection (2)_

At present section 61(35) exempts from tax all social security benefits paid under Part I of the Social Security Act 1964 other than national superannuation and the unemployment benefit (which, by virtue of its definition in section 2 for the 6 months to 30 September 1986, refers only to those recipients without dependent children).

This subsection now also exempts payments made under Part IA of the Social Security Act, namely Family Care and Special Family Care payments. When Family Care was introduced, although it was intended such payments would not be subject to tax, their inclusion in a new Part of the Social Security Act meant that they were not covered by the general exemption for social security benefits. This amendment thus corrects that position with effect from 21 November 1984, being the date on which the Social Security Amendment Act 1984 (being the Act which first provided for Family Care) received the Governor-General's assent.

### _Subsection (3)_

This subsection also amends section 61(35) by extending the reference to the unemployment benefit not being exempt to all income-tested social security benefits which are to be taxable from 1 October 1986. Such benefits are referred to as "income-tested benefits" - refer to the commentary on that definition as inserted by section 2(2) of this Amendment Act. Note that from 1 October 1986 all payments of unemployment benefit will be taxable.

### _Subsection (4)_

Section 61(36) presently provides an exemption from tax in respect of overseas pensions to the extent to which they are deducted by the Department of Social Welfare from a recipient's entitlement to an income-tested Social Security benefit. Section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 provides details of how such reductions are to be made.

Arising from a change in wording to section 70 of the Social Security Act which was made in recent years, it was necessary to amend the wording in section 61(36) to reflect the original exemption.

### _Subsection (5)_

This subsection simply makes amendments consequential to those described above.

### _Subsections (6) to (8)_

These subsections contain the application dates of the amendments described above. In particular:

*   Subsections (1) and (3) are to apply from 1 October 1986
*   Subsection (2) is to apply from 21 November 1984
*   Subsection (4) is to apply from 1 April 1985

Section 8 - Items Included In Assessable Income
-----------------------------------------------

This section extends section 65(2)(d) of the principal Act (which presently includes in assessable income all payments of national superannuation and unemployment benefit) to include within the meaning of that term those income-tested social security benefits and war pensions that are to become taxable from 1 October 1986. Such payments are referred to as "income-tested benefits" and "specified war pensions" refer to the commentary on those definitions as inserted by section 2(2) of this Amendment Act. This section is to apply from 1 October 1986.

Section 9 - Amounts Of Tax Deductions
-------------------------------------

Section 343 of the principal Act determines how the amounts of PAYE tax deductions are to be calculated. With the advent of the taxation of income-tested social security benefits and specified war pensions, because it is proposed that such benefits will be grossed up to ensure recipients continue to receive the same net levels, it was necessary to introduce a provision to allow the Commissioner to liaise with the Social Security Commission or with a War Pensions Board (in practice, the Director-General of Social Welfare and the Secretary for War Pensions are in fact the same person) in calculating the PAYE deductions to be applied to benefit payments. This section is to apply to tax deductions made on or after 1 October 1986.

Section 10 - PAYE Tax Codes
---------------------------

This section deals with the changes to the PAYE tax codes which take effect from l October 1986 as a result of the abolition of the principal income earner and family rebates and the introduction of the transitional tax allowance.

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection substitutes a new section 344(1) of the principal Act, which lists the various PAYE tax codes which are to apply from 1 October 1986. The existing tax codes, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F", the first of which relates to the principal income earner rebate, the rest of which relate to the family rebate, will no longer be available with the repeal of those rebates.

A new tax code "T" has been introduced which is to apply in respect of those persons entitled to the transitional tax allowance which is available on a pay-period basis.

At the same time as introducing the new list of tax codes, the opportunity has also been taken to alter the wording in various places so as to clarify when the various tax codes can apply. In particular the changes made arise from the insertion in recent years of "primary employment earnings" and "secondary employment earnings" definitions in section 2 of the principal Act.

In relation to the taxation of those income-tested benefits and specified war pensions which are to become taxable from 1 October 1986, it should be noted that:

*   None of the PAYE tax codes listed can be applied to payments of those benefits. Instead those benefits will be notionally "grossed-up" using a formula relating to the "G" tax code and taxed so as to leave the net benefit level unchanged.
*   A new proviso to section 344(1) provides that where a taxpayer is receiving BOTH a payment of an income-tested benefit or a specified war pension and other income from which PAYE tax is to be deducted, the tax code "SEC" must be applied to that other income. In those cases (expected to be few) where such a treatment would mean tax was being over-deducted during the year, the taxpayer would be entitled to apply for a special tax code in respect of that other income (ie, not in respect of the income-tested benefit or specified war pension).

### _Subsection (2)_

This subsection consequentially amends section 341 of the principal Act as a result of the introduction of the new list of PAYE tax codes. This section details the amount on which PAYE tax deductions are to be calculated when payments to a qualifying superannuation fund are made.

### _Subsection (3)_

This subsection repeals section 344(1A) of the principal Act, which was the section which dealt with family rebate entitlement through the PAYE tax codes. The repeal is necessary as the rebate is no longer available through the PAYE system with effect from 1 October 1986.

### _Subsection (4)_

This subsection repeals a redundant provision of the existing section 344 of the principal Act. That provision has been superseded by the new wording in section 344(1) and because of the introduction of "primary employment earnings" and "secondary employment earnings" definitions in section 2 of the principal Act in recent years.

### _Subsections (5) to (7)_

These subsections consequentially amend the lists of PAYE tax codes contained in sections 344(9), 344(10) and 379(2) of the principal Act respectively, as a result of the new list of PAYE tax codes contained in section 344(1), with effect from 1 October 1986.

### _Subsection (8)_

This subsection deals with the requirement for employees to complete new IR 12 tax code declaration certificates prior to the introduction of the new PAYE tax codes from 1 October 1986.

Arising from the fact that the "A" to "G" primary tax codes will be replaced by the "G" and "T" primary tax codes and as the number expected to qualify for the transitional tax allowance (and to use tax code "T") is not expected to be great, this subsection provides that all "A" to "G" tax codes operative as at 30 September 1986 will automatically translate to "G" tax codes with effect from 1 October 1986 WITHOUT the need for an employee to complete a second IR 12 tax code declaration in respect of the 1986/87 income year. In particular, employees are deemed to have furnished a new IR 12 specifying the tax code "G" while in practice they will not be required to do this. The provision thus results in administrative savings for employers and employees as well as the Inland Revenue Department.

It should be noted that this automatic translation provision is subject to subsection (9) which is described below.

### _Subsection (9)_

This subsection provides that notwithstanding the automatic translations to "G" tax codes provision contained in subsection (8), an employee who expects that he will be entitled to claim the transitional tax allowance may elect to complete a new IR 12 tax code declaration specifying the "T" tax code so as to obtain the benefit of that allowance on a pay-period basis.

The first proviso restricts this election to primary employment earnings source deduction payments only. It also provides that shearers and shearing shed hands cannot use tax code "T". This is because of the flat 25 cents per dollar and 20 cents per dollar tax rates which apply to those two classes of earners.

The second proviso ensures that where an employee delivers a new tax code declaration specifying the "T" tax code, that tax code shall only apply until 31 March 1987 or earlier if that tax code ceases to apply in accordance with sections 344(7) or 344(9).

For the year ending 31 March 1988 a new IR 12 will need to be completed by employees in all cases specifying one of the tax codes listed in the new section 344(1), The tax codes available being "G", "T", "SEC" "SHR" and "SSH".

### _Subsection (10)_

This subsection consequentially amends section 15(1)(a) of the Social Security Act 1964, which details the calculations to be made in calculating rates of national superannuation. Reference in that section is made to setting the married couple rate at no less than 80 percent of the average ordinary time weekly wage after tax has been deducted therefrom using tax code "A". As a result of the repeal of the principal income earner rebate with effect from 1 October 1986, the reference to the tax code "A" in that section will be replaced by a reference to the tax code "T".

### _Subsection (11)_

This subsection makes amendments consequential to those described above.

### _Subsection (12)_

This is the application subsection for the section. It provides that all the changes described above are to come into force on 1 October 1986, applying to pay periods ending on or after that date.

Section 11 - Cessation Of Transitional Tax Allowance Tax Code
-------------------------------------------------------------

This section substitutes a new section 346 in the principal Act. The previous section 346 provided that the "A" or "B" to "F" tax codes would cease to apply where an employee expected that he/she would not be entitled to claim the principal income earner or family rebates respectively. With the repeal of those rebates that provision is no longer necessary from 1 October 1986. In its place, however, has been added a similar provision in respect of the transitional tax allowance. The new section 346 provides that the "T" tax code shall cease to apply where an employee expects that he/she will not be entitled to claim the transitional tax allowance.

Section 12 - Amount Of Tax Deductions Where Several Deductions Are Made For One Week
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section makes a minor amendment to section 347 of the principal Act, which is the provision which details the amount of total tax deductions where several deductions are made in one week. In particular, the second proviso to that section provides that the salary or wages of a shearer shall not be taken into account for the purposes of that section. The amendment in this Act extends that exclusion to the salary or wages of a shearing shed hand, as a consequence of the separation of the tax rates applying to shearers and shearing shed hands.

Section 13 - Pay Period Taxpayers And The Requirement To Furnish Tax Returns
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 356 of the principal Act defines who can and who cannot be "pay-period taxpayers" - persons whose tax liability is determined solely on the basis of PAYE deductions made during the year with the result that they are not required to furnish an annual tax return (unless they wish to do so in order to claim for various rebates not available on a pay-period basis during the year). Specifically excluded from being able to be pay-period taxpayers, and thus specifically required to furnish tax returns, are all persons who are, or whose spouses are, entitled to claim the family rebate.

Subsections (1) and (3) of this section maintain that provision in respect of the 1986/87 tax year, the last tax year in which the family rebate can be claimed. These subsections also provide that persons who have been, or whose spouses have been, issued with a certificate of entitlement for a tax credit pursuant to Part XIA are similarly excluded from being able to be pay-period taxpayers and thus will be required to furnish tax returns. As certificates of entitlement will be issued to applicants in all cases except where they are social security beneficiaries (where family support will be automatically paid with benefit payments), all recipients of a tax credit other than beneficiaries will be specifically required to furnish annual tax returns.

Subsections (2) and (4) remove the provisions relating to the family rebate with effect from the 1987/88 tax year since that rebate will no longer be claimable.

Sections 14 And 15 - Basic Rates Of Income Tax
----------------------------------------------

These sections specify the basic rates of income tax which apply to individual taxpayers in respect of the 1986/87 and subsequent income years. It should be noted, however, that the new tax rates cannot be applied to income tax assessments until they have been confirmed by the annual taxing Act.

The rates for the 1986/87 income year are composite rates reflecting six months of the present tax rates (which incorporate the temporary surtax) and six months of the tax rates proposed to apply from 1 October 1986. The composite 1986/87 tax rate scale is:

| On income | Tax rate per $1 |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $6,000 | 17.5c |
| $6,000 - $ 9,500 | 24.0c |
| $9,501 - $25,000 | 31.5c |
| $25,001 - $30,000 | 37.55c |
| $30,001 - $38,000 | 52.05c |
| Over $38,000 | 57.00c |

It should be noted that although these rates cannot yet be applied to income tax assessments (until the passing of the Income Tax (Annual) Act 1986) nor can they be taken into account in special tax code applications until October 1986, provision has been made for the composite tax rates to be used in respect of 1987 provisional tax payments where the taxpayer wishes to do so. Details of this option are contained in the 1986 IR 3 tax guide.

The basic tax rates for the 1987/88 and future tax years are those rates which apply from 1 October 1986. They are:

| On Income | Tax Rate per $1 |
| --- | --- |
| up to $9,500 | 15c |
| $9,501 - $30,000 | 30c |
| Over $30,000 | 48c |

Section 16 - Basic Tax Deductions
---------------------------------

### _Subsection (1)_

Clause 3 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act sets out the "no declaration" rate to be used by employers where an employee has not completed or has incorrectly completed an IR 12 tax code declaration. The no declaration rate is a flat 35 cents up to the income level at which the average tax rate on the "G" tax code scale equals 35 cents. Above that income level the "G" tax code should be used. The income level where this change-over presently occurs is $648 per week. This subsection increases this amount to $1,014 per week which is the new change-over level under the October 1986 tax rates.

### _Subsection (2)_

Clause 6 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act sets out the secondary tax rate to be applied to payments of secondary employment earnings. At present the rate to be used is 33 cents in the dollar which corresponds with the present standard marginal tax rate. This subsection reduces that rate to 30 cents In the dollar with effect from 1 October 1986 which corresponds which the standard marginal tax rate applying from that date.

### _Subsection (3)_

Clause 9 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act sets out the rate of tax to be applied to payments of extra emoluments. At present the rate to be used is 33 cents in the dollar which corresponds with the present standard marginal tax rate. This subsection reduces that rate to 30 cents in the dollar with effect from 1 October 1986 which corresponds with the standard marginal tax rate applying from that date.

### _Subsection (4)_

Appendix A to the Second Schedule to the principal Act sets out the weekly PAYE tax tables. This subsection replaces the current rates with the new rates which are to apply from 1 October 1986. With the reduction in the number of primary tax codes from 7 ("A" to "G") to 2 ("G" and "T") the format of these tables has changed from that which currently exists.

### _Subsection (5)_

This subsection makes amendments consequential to those described above.

### _Subsections (6) and (7)_

These are the application subsections for this section. They provide that the changes in the no declaration rate change-over level, secondary tax rate, extra emolument tax rate and weekly PAYE tax deduction tables are to apply from 1 October 1986 in respect of pay periods ending or payments made on or after that date.

Part II - Family Support (FSTC) And Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) Tax Credits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This Part contains a detailed explanation of the legislation that provides for the Family Support Tax Credit (FSTC) and the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Tax Credit (GMFI). It commences by outlining the operation of the schemes in general terms, and then examines each provision of the legislation in greater detail.

### Questions And Answers

Attached as Appendix A are a series of questions and answers which have been prepared to help explain the FSTC and GMFI schemes.

### General Outline Of The Schemes

The tax credits are provided for in a new Part XIA of the principal Act which is inserted by section 17(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1986.

### Family Support Tax Credit (FSTC)

It was announced in the Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform that the present Family Care Scheme, child supplements for beneficiaries and the Family Tax Rebate will be combined into a new form of family assistance, to be known as Family Support to apply from 1 October 1986. This scheme is to be administered by Inland Revenue.

The level of assistance will be $1,872 per year ($36 per week) for the first child and $832 ($16 per week) for each subsequent child. The entitlement will be reduced by 18 cents in the dollar on the joint household income in excess of $14,000 per annum. The legislation contains a wide range of provisions to cater for changes in family circumstances during the income year.

For the purpose of calculating the joint household income various adjustments will be made to the assessable income of the household members. These adjustments are designed to arrive at the level of income which more accurately reflects the actual, rather than taxable, household income for the income year. For a complete list and description of the adjustments, refer to the commentary on section 374B later in this publication.

### Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Tax Credit (GMFI)

In addition to providing the family assistance described above, the scheme will also ensure a guaranteed minimum family net income for all full-time earners with dependent children. For one-child families the minimum income will be $250 (after tax) per week (including FSTC and Family Benefit). This amount is increased by $22 per week (which equals $16 FSTC and $6 Family Benefit) for each additional child in the family.

This means that after taking into account receipts from FSTC and Family Benefit, the GMFI scheme ensures that the minimum family income of full-time earners will be $208 per week ($10,816 per annum) after tax, irrespective of the number of children in the family. Where the family income is less than this amount, a tax credit will be allowed in order to make up the difference for each week in which the taxpayer is a "full-time earner" The GMFI tax credit will be apportioned if the "full-time earner" criteria are met for part of the income year only.

### Eligibility

Eligibility is dependent on the parent, or in the case of a two-parent household one of the parents, receiving the Family Benefit (from the Department of Social Welfare) for the child in respect of which a tax credit is claimed. Both FSTC and the GMFI income tax credit will be split equally between the partners in a two-parent household and paid in full to the parent in a single-parent household.

### Method of Payment

Employees will receive payment in the pay packet wherever this is practical, while persons who are self-employed will be able to have their payments credited against their provisional tax instalments when these fall due.

People who qualify for a tax credit and wish to receive payment through the pay packet during the income year are required to make an application to Inland Revenue. On the basis of the information furnished in that application, the person's weekly entitlement will be estimated and a certificate of entitlement issued. A certificate of entitlement enables:

1.  an employee, upon delivering the certificate to the employer, to receive tax credit instalments through the pay packet.
2.  a non-earner or a part-time earner whose tax deductions are less than the tax credit entitlement, upon delivering the certificate to the Department of Social Welfare, to receive tax credit instalments from that Department.
3.  a provisional taxpayer to receive the tax credit by way of a credit against provisional tax instalments.

Social Security Beneficiaries will automatically receive their FSTC with their benefit payments and are not required to make separate application to Inland Revenue.

### Employers' Requirements

Employers to whom a certificate of entitlement has been delivered, are required to pay the weekly amount of tax credit with the employee's wages. The amounts paid may be funded out of the tax deductions made from the wages of all employees (including those who receive no tax credit instalments). Where the tax deductions held by the employer are not sufficient to fund the tax credit payments in full, the employer is still required to make the payments but may claim a refund from Inland Revenue.

### End of Year Adjustment

FSTC and GMFI instalments received during the income year will be treated as interim and are to be debited against the actual entitlement which will be calculated based on actual income when returns are filed at the end of the income year. If the end of year entitlement exceeds the amount received during the year by way of instalments it will be deducted from any income tax payable and any excess tax credit will be refunded. If the end of year entitlement is less than the amount received during the year it will be added to the income tax payable.

### Detailed Examination Of The Legislation

Section 17(1) of the Amendment Act inserts the new Part XIA into the principal Act.

The new Part XIA consists of sections 374A to 374P. A brief description of each section and where it can be found in this publication is contained in the Table of Contents.

Section 374A - Interpretation
-----------------------------

This section is the interpretation section and lists 13 definitions relevant to the new Part XIA of the principal Act. (Please note that Sections 2 and 18 of this Amendment Act also insert, into section 2 of the principal Act, new definitions of "certificate of entitlement", "income-tested benefit", and "specified war pension", which are directly relevant to this Part. These definitions are discussed in the commentary on those sections.) The definitions contained in section 374A are as follows:

(a) **"Director-General"**

This term means the Director-General of Social Welfare appointed pursuant to the Department of Social Welfare Act 1971 and includes any person acting under his delegated authority.

Its relevance is to the provisions contained in this Part as they relate to the payment of tax credits by way of interim instalments to beneficiaries, non-earners, and part-time earners whose PAYE deductions are less than the tax credit instalments. These persons will receive their instalments through the Department of Social Welfare.

(b) **"Employment"**

This definition is necessary for the purposes of the definition of "fully-employed person" contained in this section.

The term "Employment" is also defined in the new section 374E the principal Act for the purposes of that section, which deals with the GMFI. (Refer to the commentary on that section for a full explanation of the meaning of the term "employment" as used in that section).

Employment means an activity, the performing of which gives rise to a source deduction payment. However, for the purposes of this definition, a source deduction payment does not include any payment of the kind:

*   referred to in paragraph (ba) of the definition of "salary or wages", (payments made by any partnership to any working partner of the partnership to the extent that such payments are, pursuant to section 167B(2) of the principal Act, deemed to be expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income).
*   referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of "salary or wages" (which, as amended by section 2 of the Amendment Act, are all payments of national superannuation, income-tested benefits, and specified war pensions).
*   specified in Part E of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (contract payments to non-resident contractors).

The definition is expanded to cater for extraordinary situations where in any day a person works for a number of hours less than the number he or she would normally work in that day, but is paid as if the hours normally worked had been worked. This includes days on which annual leave or sick leave is taken and days such as statutory holidays. In these cases a person will be treated as being employed on those days for the number of hours that person is paid.

**Example:** Mrs Jones works at the local tavern serving counter lunches between the hours of 12 noon and 2.30 pm each working day. On Anzac day the tavern did not open for business until 1 pm but Mrs Jones is paid as if she worked from 12 noon. Mrs Jones will be deemed to have been employed on that day between the hours of 12 noon and 2.30 pm notwithstanding the fact she only worked from 1 pm to 2.30 pm.

(c) **"Family Benefit"**

The qualification criteria for the tax credits allowed under this Part are dependent upon a member of a household being entitled to receive a Family Benefit for the child or children in respect of whom the tax credit is claimed. For this reason it was necessary to define the term.

It should be noted that as the definition refers to "... Family Benefit payable ...", persons who have capitalised their Family Benefit entitlement will qualify for FSTC.

(d) **"Fully employed person"**

This definition has significance for the delivery method of the tax credit instalments to employees as provided for in section 374G(6). This definition differs from that of "full-time earner" (refer section 374E(1) for a commentary on that term) as it depends only on the number of hours worked by the individual and does not take account of any hours worked by any spouse of the individual.

In order to be considered a "fully employed person", a person must be either:

1.  a solo-parent and employed for at least 20 hours per week, or
2.  a member of a two-parent household and employed for at least 30 hours per week, -

by the person who is the primary employer.

(e) **"Net realisable value"**

When determining a person's assessable income in accordance with section 374B, in any case where standard or nil values in relation to livestock have been used, an adjustment to market values is required to be made. These market values are determined on the basis of the net realisable value of the livestock. Net realisable value is the amount that would normally be realised as a result of an arm's length sale, less any selling costs, killing charges etc that would normally have been incurred in such a sale.

(f) **"Qualifying person"**

The term "Qualifying person" establishes the link between the entitlement to a tax credit under this Part and the need for at least one member of a household to be entitled to receive a Family Benefit for the child in respect of whom a tax credit is claimed. A qualifying person is a person who receives a Family Benefit, but not a person who receives a war widows mother's allowance. Persons who receive this allowance (the definition of which is discussed later the commentary on this section) will continue to receive it free of tax after 1 October 1986 and will not therefore qualify for FSTC.

Note that a different definition of "qualifying person" is contained in section 374E(1) for the purposes of the GMFI tax credit only. (Refer to the commentary on that section),

(g) **"Separated person"**

This term is used in the definition of "spouse" and refers to persons who, although legally spouses, no longer live together in a relationship in the nature of marriage.

(h) **"Social Security Commission" or "Commission"**

This term is required in relation to the delivery of FSTC to persons who receive Social Security Benefit payments through Social Welfare. The Social Security Commission, established under the Social Security Act 1964, pays these benefits (not the Director-General of Social Welfare) and consequently that Commission will also be responsible for the delivery of FSTC to the beneficiaries.

(i) **"Specified income"**

This is the full year equivalent of the income derived during any specified period in an income year, the grossing up exercise being conducted in accordance with Section 374B(4). In short, in relation to a specified period, the specified income represents the figure that results when the income derived by a person in that specified period is grossed-up to an amount representing a full-year equivalent of that income. For example, if the income derived (after any necessary adjustments contained in section 374B(1)) in a specified period of 100 days is $5,000, the specified income in relation to that specified period is equal to:

$5,000 x (365/100) = $18,250

(j) **"Specified period"**

In any case where the family circumstances changed during the year, the tax credit entitlement must be calculated separately for the periods, in the income year, both before and after the change in circumstances occurred (sections 374D and 374E refer). This approach requires the use of periods other than the income year.

A specified period can be any unbroken period consisting of any number of CONSECUTIVE DAYS in the income year. It is generally used in relation to the period in which a person is a "qualifying person" and throughout which that person's marital status has remained unchanged.

(k) **"Spouse"**

The definition of spouse is required since the tax credits are to be split equally between the partners in a two-parent household. In this case the tax credit entitlement is to be calculated on the basis of the combined income of both spouses.

Two persons, in relation to each other, are spouses if they live in a relationship which is in the nature of marriage. De facto relationships are therefore treated in the same manner as de jure (legal) marriages. Where two persons are legally married but have separated and no longer live together, they are not considered to be spouses in relation to each other. (Refer also to the definition of "Separated Person".)

(l) **"War Pensions Board" or "Board"**

This term is required in relation to the delivery of FSTC to persons who receive Specified War Pensions through Social Welfare. A War Pensions Board, established under the War Pensions Act 1954, pays such pensions (not the Director-General of Social Welfare) and consequently that Board will also be responsible for the delivery of FSTC to such pensioners. The definition is expanded to include the Secretary for War Pensions, who is in fact (although not in legislation) the same person as the Director-General of Social Welfare.

(m) **"War widows mother's allowance"**

A war widows mother's allowance is an allowance paid to certain war widows under section 32(2) of the War Pensions Act 1954. This definition is needed because persons who receive such an allowance' are not entitled to receive FSTC or GMFI.

Section 374B - Determination Of Assessable Income
-------------------------------------------------

_**Subsection (1)**_ - This subsection is in effect another definition section. It describes the adjustments to be made to a person's assessable income as returned for tax purposes, in order to calculate the income on which FSTC and GMFI tax credit entitlements are based.

As assessable income is used as the base for the calculation of FSTC and GMFI it should be noted that assessable income means the income before any deduction for the life insurance/superannuation special exemption ie income net of the standard deduction, employment related expenses, interest/dividend exemption.

It should also be noted that the adjustments are required to be made to the person's ASSESSABLE INCOME for the year. This means that previous years losses that may be able to be brought forward and offset against the person's assessable income for tax purposes cannot be offset in calculating the income for family support purposes.

The adjustments may be categorised as follows:

**Paragraph (a)** - Kinds of income which, although exempt from income tax, are to be included in the assessable income for the purposes of calculating the tax credit entitlements. Included in this category are:

1.  income derived by way of interest, dividends, and investment society dividends up to the $200 exemption provided for under section 61(13). Any amount in excess of the $200 exemption is of course already included in the person's assessable income.
2.  income derived by way of interest on Post Office National Development Bonds or New Zealand Savings Certificates up to the $500 exemption provided for under section 61(14).
3.  income derived in the form of payments in the nature of alimony or maintenance received from a former spouse. Section 61(15) exempts such payments from income tax.
4.  bursary or scholarship income which is exempt under section 61(37).
5.  income derived from interest on any farm vendor finance bond or in respect of any farm vendor mortgage to the extent that that income is exempt from income tax under section 61(52).

**Paragraph (b)** \- Items in respect of which a deduction shall be allowed where there is no provision for any such deduction for income tax purposes. In calculating the assessable income for the purposes of Part XIA, a deduction shall be allowed of:

1.  any payments in the nature of alimony or maintenance (of the kind referred to in section 61(15)) made to a former spouse.
2.  any payments made to the Department of Social Welfare under section 27K of the Social Security Act 1964, relating to the liable parent contribution scheme.
3.  an amount equal to the difference between the "net realisable value" of any livestock at the end of the previous income year and the value of that livestock, calculated, at the end of that previous income year, using the standard or nil values adopted. In making this adjustment, net realisable values of livestock are to be added together to obtain the total net realisable value of all livestock on hand, and this total is to be compared with the total opening stock value for tax purposes. Note that if the total value of all livestock for tax purposes exceeds the total "net realisable value" of that livestock, no adjustment may be made.

**Paragraph (c)** - Items in respect of which no deduction is to be allowed even though they are deductible for income tax purposes. In calculating the assessable income for the purposes of determining the entitlement to a tax credit, no deduction shall be allowed (in other words deductions allowed for tax purposes must be added back) in respect of:

1.  depreciation on buildings of any kind.
2.  any development expenditure that has been allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes under:
    *   (A) sections 126 and 127, relating to certain expenditure on land used for farming or agricultural purposes.
    *   (B) section 127A, relating to certain expenditure on land used for forestry purposes.
    *   (C) section 128, relating to certain expenditure incurred by persons engaged in aquaculture.
3.  any amount paid on mining shares in respect of which a deduction for income tax purposes is provided for under:
    *   (A) section 159, relating to amounts paid on shares in mining holding companies to be used for mining specified minerals.
    *   (B) section 159A, relating to amounts paid on shares in mining holding companies used for petroleum exploration.
    *   (C) section 160, relating to amounts paid on shares in mining companies.
    *   (D) section 160A, relating to amounts paid on shares in petroleum mining companies.
4.  any amount deposited into an income equalisation reserve account to the extent that a deduction in respect of that amount is allowed under section 178.

**Paragraph (d)** \- other items to be included:

1.  income which is derived in the income year but which 1s allowed to be spread over other income years under any of the following sections of the principal Act:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| section 81A | \- spreading of income derived from the sale of timber from farms. |
| section 82 | \- spreading of income derived on acquisition of land by the Crown. |
| section 83 | \- sums received from sale of patent rights. |
| section 84 | \- spreading of income derived from assignment of or grant of interest in copyright. |
| section 92 | \- compensation in connection with outbreak of scrapie. |
| section 93 | \- spreading of excess income derived on sale of livestock where unduly lowstandard values or nil value adopted. |
| section 94 | \- excess income on sale of livestock where farmer forced to quit farm, or farming business adversely affected by fire, flood, etc. |
| section 95 | \- excess income on sale of livestock where sharemilker or lessee farmer quits farm and purchases another farm. |
| section 117 | \- revised assessments where assets sold after deduction of depreciation allowances. |
| section 172 | \- specified suspensory loans. |

2.  an amount equal to the difference between the net realisable value of any livestock at the end of the income year and the value of that livestock at the end of the income year, calculated using the standard and nil values adopted.

Stock is to be broken down into various categories for the purpose of determining the standard value or net realisable value of each category. In making this adjustment, net realisable values of livestock are to be added together to obtain the total net realisable value of all livestock on hand, and this total is to be compared with the total of the closing stock value for tax purposes.

Note that if the value of closing stock for tax purposes exceeds the "net realisable value", no adjustment is to be made.

**Paragraph (e)** - other items NOT to be included in the assessable income (ie the income returned for tax purposes is to be reduced by the following):

1.  any amount, not including any interest, received by way of refund from an income equalisation reserve account under any of the following sections of the principal Act:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| section 179 | \- refunds from income equalisation reserve accounts. |
| section 180 | \- refund from income equalisation reserve account on retirement of taxpayer. |
| section 182 | \- refund from income equalisation reserve account on bankruptcy of taxpayer. |
| section 184 | \- refund from income equalisation reserve account after expiry of 5 years. |

2.  any amount of income which, although derived in another income year, is deemed to be derived in the current income year as a result of that income having been allowed to be spread in accordance with Section 81 of the principal Act or the provisions of any of sections 81A, 82, 83, 84, 92, 93, 94, 95, 117, 172 of the principal Act referred to in paragraph (d)(i) above.

**Paragraph (f)** requires a person who carries on one or more businesses in the income year to make the specified calculation (ie make all the above adjustments) for that business or separately for each of those businesses. Where, after the adjustments are made, a business shows a loss, that loss is ignored for the purposes of this Part and cannot be offset against the income derived by that person from any other source.

**Example: One business + salary income.**

Mr White earned a salary of $20,000 during the income year. He was also a partner in a business enterprise which was in a loss situation. The share of the loss for tax purposes was $8,000, which after making the adjustments under this section was reduced to $5,000.

Assessable income for income tax purposes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Salary | $20,000 |
| Business | ($8,000) |
|     | $12,000 |

Assessable income for FSTC purposes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Salary | $20,000 |
| Business | nil |
|     | $20,000 |

Under paragraph (f), the $5,000 loss is deemed not to have been incurred for FSTC purposes.

**Example: Two businesses**

Mr Black declares three separate business interests when lodging a claim for Family Support. Income details for tax purposes are as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Business | $38,000 |
| Rental loss | ($1,500) |
| Share of partnership loss | ($10,000) |
| Assessable income | $26,500 |

After section 374B adjustments, the rental loss is turned into a profit of $2,100 while the partnership loss is reduced to $5,000. Assessable income for FSTC is therefore:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Business | $38,000 |
| Rental profit | $2,100 |
| Share of partnership loss | Nil |
| Assessable income for FSTC | $40,100 |

**Paragraph (g)** - applies to any person who, on the last day of the accounting year of a private company, is a major shareholder in that private company.

The term "major shareholder" has the same meaning as in section 336N(1) of the principal Act (part of the Fringe Benefit tax legislation). ie a person who owns, controls, or has the right to acquire 10 percent or more of the shares or voting rights in that private company. In determining that percentage, consideration is given to the interest in that company held by any nominee or relatives of that shareholder.

Two different approaches are applied in determining the assessable income of such a "major shareholder" in a private company.

Subparagraph (i) - sets out the approach to determine the assessable income for the purposes of FSTC.

Any such person must include in the assessable income, for the purposes

calculating any tax credit entitlement, (in addition to the total amount of income received during the income year by way of dividends in respect of the shares held in the private company) an amount calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Number of issued shares of the Company held by the person at the end of the year) | x   | Assessable Income of the Company after making adjustments required by section 374B) | \-  | Dividends received from the Company during the year |
| (Total issued shares of the Company at the end of the year) | 1   | 1   |

It should be noted that in determining the assessable income of the company in these cases, the adjustments required to be made in accordance with this section must be made to the income of the company.

**Example: Major Shareholder in Private Company.**

Mrs White holds 40 percent of the shares in a private company which derived assessable income of $50,000 (inclusive of adjustments for FSTC purposes) for the income year. Dividends of $5,000 were received by Mrs White during that year in respect of those shares. When determining her assessable income for the purposes of calculating the tax credit entitlement, the amount of $15,000 (being 40 percent of $50,000 less the $5,000 dividends returned for tax purposes) must be included as Mrs White's share of the company's profit, in addition to the $5,000 actually received as dividends.

Subparagraph (ii) - sets out the approach to determine the assessable income of a major shareholder in a private company for the purposes of GMFI. In this case the amount of the company's income to be added back is adjusted to recognise the tax paid by the company. The amount added back is an amount equal to the difference between the dividends received by the person and an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

| a   | x (c-d) |
| --- | --- |
| b   |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| "a" | is the number of issued shares in the company, held by the person; and |
| "b" | is the number of issued shares in the company; and |
| "c" | is the company's assessable income (after adjustments); and |
| "d" | is the income tax paid by the company |

**_Subsection (2)_** - This subsection clarifies certain issues which arise from paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of this section (denial of business losses).

**Paragraph (a)** - deals with the situation where a taxpayer carries on more than one business and incurs expenditure or is allowed depreciation in respect of an asset which is used in more than one business. It provides that only that part of the expenditure or depreciation as specifically relates to each business may be deducted when making the specified calculation for each business.

**Example: Asset used in more than one business.**

Mr Green owns a fast food takeaway bar and a fruit shop which are separate businesses. The fruit supply business is run at a loss even after the adjustments for Family Support purposes are made. The takeaway bar makes a profit. Mr Green has a truck which he uses both in the fruit supply business and the takeaway business to approximately the same extent. When making the specified calculation in respect of the takeaway business, only half the repairs and maintenance claimed and only half the depreciation allowed may be deducted in calculating the assessable income derived.

**Paragraph (b)** \- makes provision for two businesses, which are conducted by the same taxpayer, to be treated as one business, in any case where those businesses would normally be carried on in association with each other.

**Example: Two businesses treated as one.**

Mr Red has a motorcycle repair shop which also retails new bikes. The retail business and the repair business may be considered to be associated businesses and therefore treated as one for Family Support purposes. The specified calculation (as required by section 374B(1)(f)) is therefore made by treating both activities as the one single business.

_**Subsection (3)**_ - FSTC entitlement changes as family circumstances change during the income year (sections 374D(2) + (3) refer). It is therefore sometimes necessary to calculate the assessable income derived by a person not for the full income year but for part of the income year (a specified period) only. To make such an exercise more practical the following rules apply:

1.  Any salary or wages earned by an individual are deemed to be earned evenly throughout the period of that employment.
2.  Any income from an income tested Social Security benefit is deemed to be derived evenly throughout the period the beneficiary was in receipt of that benefit.
3.  Any income derived from any source other than one of the above is deemed to be derived evenly throughout the income year.

**Example: Determination of assessable income for period within the income year.**

Mr Brown has a lawn mowing business and works at a part-time job to supplement his income during the winter months. The details are as follows:

*   income from the business - $12,000 for the full year.
*   income from employment - $4,000 for the period 1 May to 31 August.

Mr Brown is eligible for the Family Support Tax Credit for the period, 1 July to 31 March (specified period). The assessable income deemed to be derived during this period is equal to $11,000, made up of $2,000 wages and $9,000 business income.

In every case the calculation is made on a daily basis.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - Determines the amount of the specified income which represents the full-year equivalent of the income derived in a specified period. It is this specified income which is the amount used to calculate the Family Support entitlement under the provisions of section 374D. The formula merely achieves this grossing-up to the full-year equivalent on the basis of the number of days in the specified period. The formula to be used is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | 365 |
| b   |

Where "a" is the amount off the income derived in the specified period, and "b" is the number of days in the specified period.

**Example: Calculation of "specified income".**

For the specified period 1 February to 31 March, a persons actual assessable income derived is equal to $3,000. The specified income is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $30,000 | x   | 365 | \=  | ($18,599) |
| 99  | (days in the period) |

_**Subsections (5) and (6)**_ - deal with the situation where the assessable income for an income year represents income derived in a period which is greater or less than 12 months. This situation will occur, for example, when a taxpayer changes his or her balance date. In each case the assessable income for the income year is adjusted to reflect a 12 month equivalent income for the purposes of calculating the Family Support entitlement.

_**Subsection (7)**_ - lines up every reference in this section to an income year with the accounting year of the taxpayer, where that accounting year ends on a day other than 31 March.

Section 374C - Determination Of "Net Specified Income"
------------------------------------------------------

The new Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) tax credit, which was announced in the Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform 1985, is calculated on the basis of "net (after tax) specified income". The formula used in the calculation of net specified income takes the following two factors into account:

1.  The GMFI tax credit entitlement is calculated for each specified period in the income year in order to allow a change in family circumstances to be recognised.
2.  The GMFI tax credit is allowed only in respect of the number of weeks in the specified period during which the recipient was a full-time earner. (Refer section 374E(1) for the definition of full-time earner.)

The "net specified income" is calculated using the following formula:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (a  | x   | 52  | )   | \- c |
| b   |

"a" is the portion of the assessable income derived by the person in the income year that was derived during the weeks in the specified period in which the person was a full-time earner. To determine this amount, it is necessary to find the number of weeks in the specified period in which the sufficient hours required to meet the definition of full time earner were worked. The income derived during each of those weeks is then added to determine the amount represented as "a" in the calculation.

"b" is the number that is equal to the number of weeks in which, in the specified period, the person is a full-time earner. (This is the number of weeks used in calculating the income to be included under "a" in the calculation.)

"c" is the amount of the tax payable by the person in respect of that income year. (This is the actual tax payable for the whole of the income year after deduction of all rebates but before deduction of any credits of tax).

**Example: Calculation of net specified income**

Mr and Mrs Green are a low income family who apply for a GMFI tax credit. Mr Green worked as a full-time wage earner for the whole of the income year. His income (after section 374B adjustments) was:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross | $12,000 |
| Tax payable | $2,159 |
| Net | $9,841 |

Mrs Green earned no income during the year.

The net specified income of Mr Green is calculated as

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ($12,000 | x   | 52  | )   | \- $2,159 | \=  | $9, 841 |
| 52  |

**Example: Variable employment status.**

Mr and Mrs Brown claim a GMFI tax credit at the end of the income year.

Mr Brown worked 25 hours in each week of the Income year in several jobs at different rates of pay, while Mrs Brown was employed casually. During 22 weeks in the income year, Mrs Brown did not work at all while in the remaining 30 weeks she worked at least 5 hours each week.

In aggregate the full-time earner criteria (refer commentary on section 374E) are therefore met for only 30 weeks in the income year.

When calculating the net specified income, only the income derived in those weeks in the income year in which the full-time earner criteria were met is considered. The specified incomes for both Mr and Mrs Brown, that relate to the 30 weeks in which the full-time earner criteria are met, must be calculated.

Mrs Brown earned $1,200 for the year. Mr Brown earned $8,000 for the year, of which $5,434 was earned during those 30 weeks. Mrs Brown's tax payable for the year was $175, while Mr Brown's tax on his total income (after rebates) was $860. The net specified incomes are as follows:

Mrs Brown - using the formula

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (a  | x   | 52  | )   | \- c |
| b   |

Where "a" = $1,200

Where "b" = $30

Where "c" = $175

Mrs Brown's net specified income is therefore:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ($1,200 | x   | 52  | )   | \- 175 | \= $1,905 |
| 30  |

For Mr Brown the calculation is:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ($5,434 | x   | 52  | )   | \- $860 | \= $8,558 |
| 30  |

The combined net specified income is therefore equal to $1,905 + $8,558 = $10,463.

Section 374D - Family Support Credit Of Tax
-------------------------------------------

This is the section which sets out the criteria governing eligibility for the FSTC and the method of calculation of the amount of the tax credit to which a person is entitled on an end of year basis.

The maximum amount of the tax credit for the full year is $1,872 for 1 child in the family and is increased by $832 for each additional child. The total of these amounts will be reduced by 18c for each dollar by which the combined family income exceeds $14,000. The table below illustrates the income levels at which the FSTC ceases.

| No Children | Family Income |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | $24,400 |
| 2   | $29,022 |
| 3   | $33,644 |
| 4   | $38,267 |
| 5   | $42,889 |
| each further child | an additional $4,622 |

The FSTC entitlement is tied to family circumstances and the scheme requires apportionments to be made in any case where these circumstances change during the income year.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - clarifies certain issues that arise when a person's circumstances change in such a way as to affect the FSTC entitlement.

**Paragraph (a)** - The entitlement to receive FSTC requires the recipient, or the spouse of the recipient, to be a qualifying person (ie receive Family Benefit). This paragraph provides for the period of entitlement to FSTC to be extended by 28 days from the day on which the entitlement to a Family Benefit ceased under the Social Security Act 1964. This provision only applies in cases where the entitlement to receive a Family Benefit in respect of a child is terminated by reason of:

1.  The child's age, or
2.  The child's death.

The current provisions regarding the cessation of the entitlement to a Family Benefit under the Social Security Act are as follows:

1.  Where a child reaches the age of 16 (or where the child is still at school, the age of 18), a Family Benefit in respect of that child ceases to be payable on the day after the day on which that child reaches that age.
2.  Where a child dies, the Family Benefit continues to be payable until the end of the pay period (of the benefit) in which that child dies. (Section 3 of the Social Security Act 1964 defines "pay period" as a period of 4 complete weeks commencing on such date as the Social Security Commission from time to time determines.)

In each of these cases the entitlement to FSTC will continue for 28 days after the day on which the Family Benefit entitlement ceased.

**Paragraph (b)** - provides for the situation where an entitlement to a Family Benefit in respect of a child is terminated for whatever reason, but is subsequently reinstated with effect from the point of termination. In this case the Family Benefit entitlement will, for FSTC purposes, be deemed never to have ceased. This provision is needed to cater for the situation where, for example, Family Benefit is terminated by reason of a child reaching the age of 16, but subsequently reinstated when Social Welfare establishes the child is still at school. In such cases the benefit is usually backdated to the day it was terminated.

**Paragraph (c)** - ensures that all specified periods are mutually exclusive. ie There can be no overlap of specified periods and no day in the income year can be part of more than one specified period.

**Paragraph (d)** - repeats the safeguard, contained in paragraph (c), in respect of eligible periods.

_**Subsections (2) and (3)**_ - provide for the FSTC to be allowed for each eligible period within each specified period in the income year.

The term "specified period" is defined in section 374A as meaning any unbroken period in any income year, whether that period consists of some or all of the days in the income year. The term "eligible period" refers to any part of a specified period during which at no time, except on the first day or last day of that period, the person's entitlement to a Family Benefit in respect of any child changed.

The use of specified and eligible periods allows the tax credit entitlement to be calculated separately for different parts of the income year as a recipient's changing circumstances dictate. Appropriate specified periods in respect of which separate tax credit entitlement calculations are made, always:

*   Commence on 1 April, or on the day during the income year on which the recipient's marital status (including de facto relationship) changed or the recipient's eligibility for the tax credit commenced, and
*   End on 31 March, or on the day during the income year on which the recipient's eligibility for the tax credit ceased or the recipient's marital status (including de facto relationship) altered.

In effect, a specified period is the period (or periods) in an income year throughout which a person (or a spouse of a person) receives the Family Benefit and throughout which the person's marital status remains unchanged.

An eligible period always commences on either the day on which the specified period commences or the day on which an entitlement to a Family Benefit in respect of a child changes, and ends on either the day on which the specified period ends or the day on which an entitlement to a Family Benefit in respect of a child changes. An eligible period is that part (or parts) of a specified period in which the Family Benefit entitlement of the person (or the person's spouse) remains unchanged. A separate tax credit entitlement calculation must be made for each eligible period to determine a person's entitlement for the year.

The eligible period is always the period in respect of which the tax credit entitlement is calculated. The specified period in which that eligible period falls is used to determine the amount of the assessable income to be used in the abatement of the tax credit payable for that eligible period.

**Example: Two eligible periods within one specified period.**

Mr and Mrs Green are married throughout the income year, and have one child. On 1 October Mrs Green gives birth to the couple's second child.

In this case the specified period used in calculating the couple's assessable income for FSTC purposes is the full income year, but the eligible periods in respect of which the tax credit entitlement is calculated are:

1.  1 April to 30 September, and
2.  1 October to 31 March.

The tax credit is calculated for each eligible period that falls within the specified period using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| y x z |
| 365 |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| "y" | is the amount of the tax credit the person would be entitled to if the eligible period was the full income year, and |
| "z" | is the number of days in the eligible period. |

It is important to note that a separate tax credit calculation must be made for each eligible period in each specified period, in each case using the specified income for the specified period in which the eligible period falls.

**Subsection (2)** applies in all cases where, throughout a specified period, a qualifying person does not have a spouse.

**Subsection (3)** applies in all cases where, throughout a specified period, a qualifying person does have a spouse. Any tax credit allowed under this subsection is divided equally between the eligible person and the spouse of the eligible person. The income used for calculations under this subsection is the joint income of both spouses.

**Example: Simple case (no change in circumstances)**

Mr and Mrs Orange have 2 children and remain married throughout the income year ending 31 March 1989. After appropriate adjustments are made in accordance with section 374B, details of assessable income for the year are as follows:

Mrs Orange - $1,000 and Mr Orange $16,000.

Their FSTC entitlements are calculated as follows:

**Step 1:** Determine the appropriate specified period(s), which in this case is the full income year.

**Step 2:** Determine the appropriate specified income for the specified period(s). In this case it is the full year's assessable income, ie $1,000 and $16,000 giving a total of $17,000.

**Step 3:** Identify any eligible period(s) within each specified period. Since, in this example, there has been no change in Family Benefit entitlement, the eligible period is the same period as the specified period, ie the full income year.

**Step 4:** Calculate the FSTC entitlements using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| y x z |
| 365 |

"y" =$1,872 (1st child) + $832 (2nd child) = $2,704

Reduced by 18c/$ for each dollar by which the combined assessable income exceeds $14,000.

ie $3,000 x 18c/$ = $540.

y is therefore equal to $2,704 - $540 = $2,164.

"z" =365 since the eligible period is the full income year.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | ($6-b) |
| 6   |

Mr and Mrs Orange are therefore each entitled to $1,082.

**Example: Child born during the income year.**

Mr and Mrs Smith have three children, the last of whom was born on 1 October, 1988. Details of assessable income for the year ended 31 March 1989 are as follows:

Mrs Smith - $1,000

Mr Smith - $16,000

The FSTC is calculated as follows:

**Step 1:** Determine the specified period. In this example this is the full income year from 1 April to 31 March.

**Step 2:** Determine the specified income for the specified period, which in this case is the full year's assessable income, ie $1,000 and $16,000 giving a total of $17,000.

**Step 3:** Identify any eligible period(s) within each specified period. In this example, there has been a change in Fatally Benefit entitlement by virtue of the birth of an additional child. There are therefore 2 eligible periods in the specified period. These are the periods 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March.

**Step 4:** Calculate the FSTC entitlements for each eligible period, using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| y x z |
| 365 |

_**Eligible period 1:**_

"y" =$1,872 (1st child) + $832 (2nd child) = $2,704

which is reduced by 18 cents for each dollar by which the combined specified incomes exceeds $14,000.

ie $3,000 x 18c/$ = $540.

y is therefore equal to $2,704 - $540 = $2,164.

"z" =182 which is the number of days in the eligible period.

The tax credit entitlement for the first eligible period is therefore $2,164 x (182 / 365) = $1,079-03.

_**Eligible period 2:**_

"y" =$1,872 (1st child) + $832 (2nd child) + $832 (3rd child) = $3,536

reduced by 18 cents for each dollar by which the combined specified incomes exceeds $14,000.

ie $3,000 x 18c/$ = $540.

y is therefore equal to $3,536 - $540 = $2,996.

"z" =183 which is the number of days in the eligible period.

The tax credit entitlement for the 2nd eligible period is therefore

$2,996 x (183 / 365) = $l,502-10.

This gives a total FSTC entitlement of $1,079-03 + $1,502-10 = $2,581-13. Mr and Mrs Smith are therefore each entitled to $1,290-57.

**Example: Parents separate during the income year.**

Mr and Mrs White separate on 1 July 1988. Mrs White retains custody of the couple's only child and receives the Domestic Purposes Benefit from Social Welfare. The full Family Benefit entitlement is paid to Mrs White during the whole of the income year. Mr White's income for the year ended 31 March is $18,000, while Mrs White received $8,500 from Social Welfare. Mrs White derived no income in her own right during the marriage. FSTC is calculated as follows:

Step 1: Determine the specified periods to be used. These are the periods l April to 30 June (in respect of which a tax credit is allowed to each parent under section 374D(3)) and the period 1 July to 31 March (in respect of which a tax credit is allowable to Mrs White only, under section 374D(2)).

Step 2: Determine the specified income for the specified periods. For the period 1 April to 30 June we must look at the combined specified income of both parents. This comprises only $18,000, being the income earned by Mr White during the period from 1 April to 30 June, grossed-up to a full year equivalent - (Mrs White did not receive any income during this period). For the period 1 July to 31 March we must look at Mrs White's specified income only in calculating her family support entitlement since she is now a solo parent. The gross amount of $8,500 she received from Social Welfare gives a specified income of $8,500 x (365 / 274) = $11,323.

Step 3: Identify any eligible period(s) within each specified period. Since, in this example, there has been no change in Family Benefit entitlement the eligible periods comprise the whole of each specified period.

Step 4: Calculate the FSTC entitlements for each eligible period, using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| y x z |
| 365 |

_**Eligible period 1 (1 April to 30 June)**_:

y =$1,872 (1st child) which is reduced by 18c/$ for each dollar by which the combined specified incomes exceeds $14,000.

ie $4,000 x 18c/$ = $720.

y is therefore equal to $1,872 - $720 = $1,152.

z =91, which is the number of days in the eligible period.

The tax credit entitlement for the first eligible period is therefore $1,152 x 91/365 = $287-21.

Mr and Mrs White are therefore each entitled to $143-62 in respect of this period.

_**Eligible period 2 (1 July to 31 March)**_:

y = $1,872 (1st child) since the specified income ($11,323) does not exceed $14,000.

z = 274 which is the number of days in the eligible period.

The tax credit entitlement for the 2nd eligible period is therefore

The tax credit entitlement for the 2nd eligible period is therefore $1,872 x 274/365 = $1,405-28, all of which is payable to Mrs White.

This gives a total FSTC entitlement of ($143-62 + $1,405-28 =) $1,548-90 for Mrs White and $143-62 for Mr White.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - provides for the apportionment of the FSTC entitlement in cases where the custody of a child is shared between different persons who, for the purposes of FSTC entitlement, are not spouses in relation to each other. In any such case where the custody of a child is shared, Social Welfare will split the Family Benefit between the eligible parties in the appropriate portions.

FSTC will then be apportioned in the same ratio as the Family Benefit by deducting from the amount of FSTC that each party or their spouses would otherwise receive, an amount calculated using the following formula:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | ($6-b) |
| b   |

Where

"a" = the FSTC the person would be entitled to receive if that person (or that person's spouse) had full custody of the child, and

"b" = the weekly amount of Family Benefit the person receives in respect of the child.

**Example: Shared custody**

Mr and Mrs Jones have separated on 1 July 1988 and their only child stays with the mother 4 days and with the father 3 days in each week. Social Welfare recognises the shared custody arrangement and pays $4 Family Benefit to the mother and $2 to the father. Mr Jones earned $18,000 for the full income year while Mrs Jones earned $16,000. In each case the income was derived evenly throughout the income year. FSTC is calculated as follows.

**Step 1:** Determine the specified periods to be used. These are the periods 1 April to 30 June (in respect of which a tax credit is allowed to each parent under section 374D(3)) and the period 1 July to 31 March (in respect of which each parent is eligible for a tax credit under section 374D(2)).

**Step 2:** Determine the specified income for each of the specified periods. For the period 1 April to 30 June we must look at the combined specified incomes of both parents. This comprises $18,000 earned by Mr Jones and $16,000 earned by Mrs Jones, giving a total of $34,000 (remembering that section 374B(3)(a) deems all income from employment to be derived evenly throughout the period of employment which in this example is the full income year). For the Period 1 July to 31 March we must look at the incomes of each party separately, ie the specified income for Mr Jones ($18,000) and that of Mrs Jones ($16,000).

**Step 3:** Identify any eligible period(s) within each specified period. Since, in this example, there has been no change in Family Benefit entitlement during a specified period. (because the change occurs at the same time as the specified periods change). The eligible periods comprise the whole of each specified period.

**Step 4:** Calculate the FSTC entitlements for each eligible using the formula -

|     |
| --- |
| y x z |
| 365 |

_**Eligible period 1 (1 April to 30 June):**_

Since the specified income is $34,000 the abated. , FSTC entitlement has fully abated.

_**Eligible period 2 (1 July to 31 March):**_

The FSTC basis of entitlement is calculated separately for both spouses on their individual specified incomes.

1.  Mrs Jones' entitlement: (Specified income = $16,000)
2.  "y" =$1,872 (1st child)
    
    reduced by $2,000 x 18c/$ = $360
    
    ie y = $1,512, "z" =274 which is the number of days in the eligible period.
    
    $1,512 x 274 / 365 = $1,135-03, which, in accordance with subsection (4), reduced by an amount calculated using the formula:
    

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | ($6-b) |
| 6   |

where "a" = $1135.03 and "b" = $4

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ie. $1135.03 | x   | ($6-4) | \= 378.34 |
| 6   |

Mrs Jones' full tax credit entitlement for the 2nd eligible period is therefore $1,135-03 - $378-34 = $756-69.

2.  Father's entitlement:
    
    *   "y" =$l,872 (1st child) reduced by $4,000 x 18c/$ = $720
        *   ie y = $l,152
    
    *   "z" =274
    *   which is the number of days in the eligible period. $1,152 x (274 /365) = $864 - 78, which, in accordance with subsection (4), is reduced by an amount calculated using the formula:
    *   |     |     |     |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | a   | x   | ($6-b) |
        | 6   |
        
        "a" =$864.78 and "b" $2
        
        |     |     |     |     |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | ie. $86478.78 | x   | ($6-2) | \= 576.52 |
        | 6   |
        

Mr Jones' full tax credit entitlement for the 2nd eligible period is therefore $864.78 - $576.52 = $288.26.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - deals with the situation which may arise when both spouses in a household receive a Family Benefit in respect of different children. This situation may occur in such instances as depicted in the example below. The legislation provides for such cases to be treated as if the Family Benefit in respect of all children in the household was received by one spouse only. The subsection has no practical effect on eligibility or entitlement levels. It is a machinery provision that enables the foregoing provisions to work in these circumstances.

**Example: More than one spouse receives a Family Benefit**

Mr and Mrs Grey separate on 1 July. They each retain custody of 1 of their 2 children after separation. Mr Grey shortly afterwards enters into a de facto relationship with a person who also has a child. Mr Grey receives a Family Benefit in respect of the child who remained in his custody while his de facto spouse receives a Family Benefit in respect of her child.

The FSTC entitlement is calculated as though either Mr Grey or his new spouse (but not both) received the Family Benefit in respect of both children. The actual calculation is of course on the basis of the combined specified incomes for the specified period in question.

Section 374E - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit Of Tax (GMFI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This section gives effect to the announcement in the Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform 1985 that there is to be a guaranteed minimum income for all full-time earners with dependent children. For one-child families the minimum income will be $250 (after tax) per week including FSTC and Family Benefit. This amount is increased by $22 per week (which equals $16 FSTC and $6 Family Benefit) for each additional child in the family.

If the FSTC and Family Benefit components of the family income are ignored, the minimum family income will be $208 per week ($10,816 per annum) after tax, irrespective of the number of children in the family. This minimum "earned income" of $208 per week will only be available for each of the weeks in the income year that the applicant meets the "full-time earner" criteria.

The following points should be noted in relation to the GMFI:

1.  The amount of the tax credit does not vary according to the number of children in the family. A one-child family with a net specified income of $10,000 would receive $816 GMFI ($10,816 - $10,000 = $816), as would a three-child family with the same income. The larger family is catered for through the higher tax credit by way of FSTC.
2.  The concept of "eligible periods", which is used in calculating the FSTC, is not required for GMFI This is a direct above consequence of (1) above.
3.  Entitlement to GMFI is apportioned on a weekly rather than daily basis. Only those weeks during which the "full-time earner" criteria are met constitute weeks in respect of which the GMFI is payable.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - defines three expressions for the purposes of this section only.

**"Employment"** - This definition is necessary for the purposes of the definition of "Full-time earner" contained in this section.

"Employment" simply means an activity, the performing of which gives rise to a source deduction payment. However, for the purposes of this definition, a source deduction payment does not include any payment of the kind:

*   referred to in paragraph (ba) of the definition of "salary or wages" (payments made by any partnership to any working partner to the extent that such payments are, pursuant to section 167B(2) of the principal Act, deemed to be expenditure necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income).
*   referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of "salary or wages" (which, as amended by section 2 of this Amendment Act, are all payments of national superannuation, income-tested benefits, and specified war pensions).
*   specified in Part E of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (contract payments to non-resident contractors).

and also excludes -

*   A payment made by a private company to any of its "major shareholders" (as defined in s 336N(1) of the principal Act).
*   A payment made by any person to his or her spouse.
*   A payment made by any partnership business to the spouse of any partner in that partnership.

The definition also caters for extraordinary situations where in any day a person works for a number of hours less than the number he or she would normally work in that day, but is paid as if the hours normally worked had been worked. This includes days on which annual leave or sick leave is taken and days such as statutory holidays. In these cases a person will be treated as being employed on those days for the number of hours for which that person is paid.

**"Full-time earner"** - in relation to any week, means a person who meets any one of the following conditions:

1.  is a solo parent and is employed (refer subsection (1) for the definition of "employment") for 20 or more hours in that week.
2.  has a spouse at any time during any week and is employed for 30 or more hours in that week.
3.  is, \[sic\] the spouse of a person who is employed for 30 or more hours in that week.
4.  is employed and has a spouse who is also employed and the combined hours of employment total 30 or more in that week.
5.  receives Accident Compensation and does not meet any one of the conditions in paragraphs (a)-(d) above but who would have met one of those conditions if that person had not been on ACC. It effectively deems the person on ACC to have worked the number of hours that would have been worked had the person not been incapacitated.

**Paragraph (f)** of this definition provides for cases where a person has a pay period longer than a week. It also caters for persons who are employed longer than a week and for persons who are employed on shiftwork or who have irregular shifts (eg 8 days on - 4 days off). In these instances the hours employed are spread evenly throughout the days in the pay period. The person will then be considered a full-time earner if the hours of employment even out to a number which is sufficient to meet the conditions in any one of paragraphs (a)-(d).

### _Self-employed persons_

Persons who are self-employed do not qualify for the GMFI tax credit unless the full-time earner criteria are met. This means that the self-employed person, the spouse of the self-employed person, or the two parents combined must derive income from employment (but not self-employment) for the required number of hours each week.

**"Qualifying person"** - is defined for the purposes of this section specifically, because its meaning in this section differs from the meaning of the expression elsewhere in Part XIA. As with the definition used elsewhere, a qualifying person is a person who is in receipt of a Family Benefit. The difference here is that a qualifying person, for the purposes of this section, does not include a person who receives an income-tested benefit, a specified war pension, or a war widows mother's allowance.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - This subsection covers the situations where the Family Benefit has been terminated during the year, which are similar to those contained in section 374D(1). For clarification of paragraphs (a) to (c), refer to the commentary on section 374D(1).

_**Subsections (3) and (4)**_ - contain the provisions to be used to determine the extent of an applicant's eligibility for the GMFI tax credit. Subsection (3) applies to solo parents, while subsection (4) applies to two-parent families.

The tax credit is calculated using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| X x Y |
| 52  |

"x" =the difference between $10,816 (the minimum net income level) and the net specified income as calculated under section 374C (see commentary on that section for details).

"y" =the number of weeks in the specified period the person met the full-time earner criteria.

**Example: Simple case**

Mr and Mrs Black have 1 child and the full-time earner criteria are met for all 52 weeks in the income year. Mrs Black does not earn any income and Mr Black's net specified income for the income year (as calculated according to section 374C) is $9,350. The GMFI entitlement is calculated by deducting $9,350 from $10,816 = $1,466. Half of this amount (ie $733) is allowed to each of Mr and Mrs Black as a tax credit.

Example: First child born during the income year

Mr and Mrs Blue become parents on 1 October. The family's net specified income for the period 1 October to 31 March is $9,500 (which is calculated by taking the family income for the six months ended 31 March and grossing it up in accordance with section 374C). The full-time earner criteria are met for each week in that period. The GMFI entitlement is calculated using the formula in section 374E(4), ie

|     |
| --- |
| XxY |
| 52  |

"x" =$10,816 - $9,500 = $1,316 and "y" = 26, being the number of weeks during the specified period that the full-time earner criteria are met.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| $1,316 X 26 | \= $658 |
| 52  |

of which $329 is payable to each spouse.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - is similar to section 374D(5) and deals with the situation which may arise when both spouses in a household receive a Family Benefit in respect of different children. The legislation provides for such cases to be treated as if only one parent received the Family Benefit in respect of all the children.

**Sections 374F To 374J** set out the delivery system for the FSTC and GMFI tax credits.

Section 374F - Allowance Of Credit Of Tax In End Of Year Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------

_**Subsection (1)**_ - provides for the following treatment in the end of year assessment, in respect of any FSTC or combined FSTC and GMFI entitlement:

1.  Where there is any tax payable by the person in respect of the income year, the tax credit will be set off against that tax payable.
2.  Where the tax credit entitlement exceeds the amount of tax payable by the person, the balance will be treated as if it were an amount of tax paid in excess.

When furnishing an income tax return, a person wishing to claim a tax credit will need to make an application. This application must be on a prescribed form and be signed by both spouses (or by the applicant in the case of solo parents).

_**Subsection (2)**_ - covers the situation where a person claims a tax credit at the end of the income year, but has already received all or part of his or her tax credit entitlement by way of interim instalments during the income year. This subsection ensures that the amounts already received are debited against the amount of the total entitlement claimed at the end of the year in the person's income tax return. Briefly, the subsection states that:

1.  where a person has received interim payments of his or her entitlement during the income year, and the amount received is greater than the actual tax credit entitlement calculated on an end of year basis in the person's income tax return, the excess is treated as if it were tax payable.
2.  where a person has received interim payments of his her entitlement during the income year and the or, amount so received is less than the actual end of year tax credit entitlement, the balance will be credited against any tax payable, with any excess paid to the person as if it were an amount of tax paid in excess.

_**Assessments**_ - as the FSTC/GMFI is to be treated as tax payable the notice of assessment will show the actual tax credit entitlement. This will allow a person to object, in relation to a tax credit, in the normal manner ie the rules applicable to objections to assessments will apply to FSTC/GMFI.

_**Subsection (3)**_ - is required to ensure that in any case where an overpayment of tax credit has been made as the result of incorrect information contained in an IR 12 tax deduction certificate, both the employer and the employee are jointly and severally liable to repay the amount of the overpayment. This would apply where the amount shown on the tax deduction certificate was less than the amount of the tax credit that had actually been paid to the employee during the income year. In general, it is envisaged that the amount would, in the first instance, be recoverable from the employee, with the employer being liable if the amount was not recovered from the employee and the employer had fraudulently or wilfully entered the wrong amount on the tax deduction certificate. The overpayment must be repaid by the 31st of May following the end of the income year to which the tax deduction certificate relates.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - allows the Commissioner to recover any overpayments tax credit as if the amount of the overpayment was an amount of tax credit payable. In the case of two-parent households both parents are jointly and severally liable for any amount overpaid to them, even if the of the overpayment has been received by only one of the parents.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - this subsection requires every person who has been issued with a certificate of entitlement for FSTC and/or GMFI to furnish a declaration of income at the end of the income year. This declaration will be in prescribed form and will require the person to show his or her assessable income and the assessable income of the spouse (if any), for the income year in respect of which they have applied for the tax credit. This declaration is to be furnished within the time period allowed for furnishing the return of income.

Section 374G - Credit Of Tax By Instalments
-------------------------------------------

_**Subsection (1)**_ - allows interim payments of FSTC and GMFI to be made regular intervals during the income year. Wherever a person expects to have a tax credit entitlement at the end of the current income year, that person may apply to the Commissioner to receive that entitlement by way of interim instalments.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - requires applications made under subsection (1) (by persons who have a tax credit entitlement and who wish to receive that entitlement by way of interim instalments throughout the remainder of the income year) to be made to the Commissioner in a "prescribed form". This subsection requires that, in addition to any information the Commissioner may require to support the application, the application must contain the following:

1.  The signature of the applicant or, where the applicant has a spouse, the signature of each spouse.
2.  The assessable income that each spouse estimates they will receive during the whole of the income year, and
3.  Where the application covers a period that is less than the whole income year, the expected assessable income of each spouse for the period covered by the application.

Any application for interim instalments must be accompanied by supporting evidence of earnings. This evidence would consist of the following:

1.  where a spouse (or each spouse) derives income from employment, wage slips or other evidence of the wages or salary earned in the previous month.
2.  where a spouse (or each spouse) derives business income, either the accounts of the business (or businesses) for the previous income year, or a set of budgeted accounts for the income year in respect of which the application is made.

It should be noted that where an applicant has a spouse at the time the application is made, the application must be completed by both spouses. The legislation does not permit the application for the tax credit to be made by one spouse only.

The application must also specify whether the interim payments of the person's tax credit entitlement are to be received through the applicant's pay packet or are to be credited against his or her provisional tax. This requirement is not specified in subsection (2) but is a requirement that is necessary for the provisions of subsection (3) to be complied with.

_**Subsection (3)**_ - requires the Commissioner, on receipt of an application to calculate whether the applicant is entitled to receive a credit of tax and if so, the amount of the interim instalments the applicant is entitled to receive during the period elected by the applicant. The Commissioner makes this calculation on the basis of the income estimates provided by the applicants and any other information that is available to him. The Commissioner will then issue a certificate of entitlement on which he must record:

1.  in the case of a provisional taxpayer, the amount that will be credited against each instalment of provisional tax.
2.  in the case of a person who is not a provisional taxpayer, the amount of the weekly tax credit entitlement that the person's primary employer, or the Department of Social Welfare, is required to pay to the person each pay day.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - sets out the basis on which the Commissioner is required to calculate the amount of any interim instalments of FSTC that the applicant is entitled to receive during the period in respect of which the application has been made.

Two terms in the legislation require some clarification. They are the "elected period" and the "specified part" of that elected period. When a person makes an application to receive interim instalments of tax credit, the person must elect the period (which could be the whole or only part of the income year) during which the person is eligible for a tax credit and during which he or she wishes to receive interim "elected period" that entitlement. This period is referred to as the "elected period".

On receipt of an application to receive interim instalment for an elected period, the Commissioner must determine whether a tax credit is expected to be allowable in respect of the whole of the elected period or part of it only. The part of the elected period in respect of which the applicant is expected to be entitled to a tax credit is referred to in the legislation as the "specified part". For the sake of simplicity we will refer to the specified part as the "period of eligibility" in the remainder of the commentary on this section.

**Paragraph (a)** of subsection (4) Provides that interim instalments are calculated on a full-year equivalent of the income that will be derived in the period of eligibility (this full-year equivalent income is referred to in the legislation as the "annual amount") just as tax credit entitlement for a specified period is, at the end of the income year, calculated on the basis of a full-year equivalent income (specified income - refer section 374B(4)). The annual amount is determined using the formula:

|     |
| --- |
| Xx365 |
| y   |

"x" is the assessable income the applicant expects to derive in the period of eligibility, and

"y" is the number of days in the period of eligibility.

**Paragraph (b)** - requires the Commissioner to determine which income band the annual amount (calculated under paragraph (a)) falls into. The income bands are contained in the 4th Schedule of the Amendment Act which inserts a new 11th Schedule in the principal Act. This Schedule is set out in Appendix B of this publication. If, for example, the Commissioner calculates that the assessable income for the full income year (the annual amount) is $23,000, the reference to the Schedule shows that this amount falls within the income band $22,499 to $24,499. The amount corresponding to this band in the Schedule (referred to as "the equivalent of the annual amount") is $24,500. It is this figure that is required to be used by the Commissioner in calculating the person's weekly tax credit entitlement.

**Paragraph (c)** - requires the Commissioner to calculate the amount of the tax credit that the person would be entitled to receive by way of interim instalments (using the calculation formula in section 374D) as if the equivalent of the applicant's annual amount (determined in accordance with paragraph (b) above), were the person's actual income for the period of eligibility.

In the example in paragraph (b) above, the amount used to calculate the interim instalments to which the recipient is entitled would be $24,500.

The income bands provide a protective margin to cater for unexpected pay rises that may occur during the year. If the margin proves to be too great and a recipient is underpaid during the year, a further credit will result at the end of the income year when the actual entitlement to the tax credit is established.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - requires the amount of the interim instalments recorded on a certificate of entitlement to be truncated (ie rounded down) to whole dollars only. The applicant's entitlement to FSTC will be added to any GMFI entitlement for the period. That total will then be divided by the number of weeks in the period to determine the weekly tax credit entitlement and the whole dollars of that amount will be shown in the certificate of entitlement. No certificate will be issued where the weekly entitlement is less than $1 per week.

_**Subsection (6)**_ - sets out the functions of a certificate of entitlement. A certificate of entitlement will:

*   require the employer of a fully-employed person (ie employed by the primary employer for at least 30 hours per week or 20 hours in the case of a solo parent) to pay to the person the interim instalment of the tax credit recorded on the certificate of entitlement. This means the employer must pay the full amount each pay period, regardless of the amount of income and PAYE deductions of the person to whom it was issued. (Paragraph (a) of subsection (6))
*   require the employer of a person who is not a fully-employed person to also make payment in full of the amount of interim instalments recorded on the certificate of entitlement. The proviso, however, requires the Commissioner, at the time an application for a certificate of entitlement is made, to estimate the amount of tax the employer would normally deduct from the employee's regular income. In any case where the tax normally deducted is estimated to be less than the amount of the tax credit payable each pay period, the certificate of entitlement is to require that the interim instalments be paid through the Department of Social Welfare rather than the employer. In other words, part-time earners whose PAYE deductions are less than their tax credit entitlement will receive their payments through the Department of Social Welfare. (Paragraph (b) of subsection (6))

It should be noted, however, that once a certificate has been issued requiring an employer to make weekly payments of the tax credit entitlement, that certificate remains in force notwithstanding that PAYE deductions may in fact be, or become, less than the tax credit entitlement.

*   require the Department of Social Welfare to make payments of tax credit instalments where it would be inappropriate for the employer to do so. This situation will arise in cases where persons derive income on an irregular basis. It will also apply where the Commissioner considers it would be inappropriate to require the employer to make the payments (eg IR 56 taxpayers). (Paragraph (c) of subsection (6))
*   state the amount of any tax credit to be credited account of a provisional taxpayer or the account of the person who would have an obligation to pay provisional tax but for:
    1.  the expected incurring of a loss.
    2.  the incurring of a loss from the immediately preceding income year.
    3.  the carrying forward and setting off of a loss incurred in a previous income year.
    4.  the commencement of the person to derive provisional income.
    5.  the person, being a recipient of assessable income from source deduction payments, interest, dividends, and rents only, being relieved of his or her obligation to pay provisional tax under the provisions of the proviso to section 377 (ie by virtue of his or her assessable income from interest, dividends, and rents not exceeding $1,000). (Paragraph (d) of subsection (6))
*   state the amount of tax credit to be paid by the Department of Social Welfare to any Person who does not derive any assessable income during the income year. (Paragraph (e) of subsection (6))
*   be in a prescribed form and allow the Commissioner to impose any directions as to its use, application, etc as he considers necessary. (Paragraph (f) of subsection (6))

_**Subsection (7)**_ - is required in order to cater for any case where more than one of paragraphs (a) - (d) of subsection (6) could apply. In such cases, the person must make a choice of which paragraph is to apply. For example, a person who is both a full-time salary earner and a provisional taxpayer must elect whether to receive the tax credit entitlement by way of interim instalments paid by the employer or by way of a credit against provisional tax payments.

_**Subsection (8)**_ - prohibits persons who receive an income-tested benefit (refer section 374A) from applying for a certificate of entitlement. Such persons are automatically to be paid the full amount of the FSTC entitlement through the Department of Social Welfare without the need to apply for a certificate of entitlement from Inland Revenue (refer section 374I).

_**Subsection (9)**_ - provides that where a certificate of entitlement issued to any person requires an employer of that person to pay the interim instalments of tax credit, the person can give the certificate only to the employer from whom he or she receives his or her primary employment earnings. For example, a person who has both a full-time and a part-time job may only receive interim instalments from the full-time employer.

_**Subsection (10)**_ - allows an employee who resigns from his primary employment, or has that primary employment terminated, to uplift his certificate of entitlement from the employer and deliver it to his or her subsequent primary employer. A certificate of entitlement is thus transferable from one employer to the next in any case where an employee resigns and/or changes employment. The new primary employer is then bound by the provisions of subsection (9) regarding payment of tax credits from the time of receipt of the certificate. The new employer is required to pay any instalments that fall due after the time at which he or she receives the certificate from the employee.

The proviso to subsection (10) makes it clear that this transferability is not extended to any person who is receiving interim instalments of both FSTC and GMFI tax credits. Certificates of entitlement which require the payment of interim instalments of both FSTC and GMFI will be addressed to the recipient's current employer and cannot apply in respect of any other employer. When changing employers, the recipient would need to reapply for a new certificate of entitlement.

_**Subsection (11)**_ - entitles a person, who has delivered to the Department of Social Welfare a certificate of entitlement which is addressed to that Department, to receive the interim instalments of the estimated tax credit entitlement at such intervals as Social Welfare considers appropriate.

_**Subsection (12)**_ - requires a person, to whom a certificate of entitlement has been issued, to notify the Commissioner of a change in circumstances where that change results in a reduced tax credit entitlement. The specific changes of circumstance covered by the legislation are:

1.  The loss of Family Benefit entitlement in respect of any child, if that loss is expected to last for more than 56 days. The period of 56 days is expected to be long enough to allow for temporary breaks in entitlement, such as the situation where the Family Benefit entitlement is terminated upon the child reaching the age of 16, but subsequently reinstated upon the child returning to school after the summer holidays.
2.  A marriage or a marital break-up (including the commencement break-up of a de facto relationship).
3.  Any other change in circumstances that has been specified on the certificate of entitlement as being a change which should be notified to the Commissioner.

The subsection further allows any person whose circumstances change in such a manner to change the amount of the tax credit entitlement or any person who suffers the loss or destruction of that certificate of entitlement, to notify the Commissioner. Notification in these circumstances is optional and would normally be accompanied by a request for a replacement certificate.

_**Subsection (13)**_ - gives the Commissioner the authority to require the return of a certificate of entitlement after receiving notification of a change in a person's circumstances. Irrespective of whether the Commissioner requires the return of the certificate of entitlement or not, he may:

1.  withdraw the certificate.
2.  withdraw the certificate and issue a replacement certificate.
3.  issue a supplement to a certificate issued earlier. For example, where a person notifies the Commissioner of the commencement of a Family Benefit entitlement in respect of a new born baby and the expectation of an increased tax credit entitlement, a supplement to the original certificate of entitlement could be issued requiring the employer to increase the tax credit currently delivered by $8 per week (or $16 in the case of a solo-parent).

_**Subsection (14)**_ - contains a number of miscellaneous items in a certificate of entitlement. relation to

**Paragraph (a)** \- requires an employer to whom a certificate of entitlement has been delivered to store that certificate in a safe place.

**Paragraph (b)** \- Prohibits any person from delivering a certificate of entitlement to more than one employer with the intention of obtaining interim instalments of tax credit from those employers simultaneously.

**Paragraph (c)** \- provides that a certificate of entitlement is not to be transferred by the person to whom it was issued, to any other person. In other words, no person may sell or trade a certificate.

**Paragraph (d)** - Provides that any certificate of entitlement which has been altered in any way shall be invalid.

**Paragraph (e)** - provides that all terms and conditions entered on a certificate of entitlement by the Commissioner shall apply in relation to that certificate.

_**Subsection (15)**_ - allows the Commissioner to withdraw a certificate of entitlement in any case where he has reason to believe that certificate should no longer apply to a person. In this case the person, or the employer of the person, must return the certificate to the Commissioner for cancellation within 7 days of the notice of withdrawal having been given to them.

Section 374H - Employer To Deliver Credit Of Tax.
-------------------------------------------------

This section sets out the employer's rights and obligations in relation to the FSTC/GMFI scheme.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - requires the employer to whom an employee has delivered a certificate of entitlement to pay the pay period equivalent of the weekly amount of tax credit recorded in that certificate. The employer must pay the amount at the time of paying any salary, wages or other source deduction payment (ie each payday). The legislation provides that the employer is acting as agent for the Commissioner in the making of each payment. Payments should be made only in respect of the period commencing with the latter of:

1\. the day specified in the certificate of entitlement, or

2\. the first pay day after the certificate has been delivered to the employer,

and ending with the earliest of:

1\. the day on which the certificate is, at the request of the employee, returned to the employee, or

2\. the day on which notification of the withdrawal of the certificate is given to the employer by the Commissioner, or

3\. the day specified in the certificate (normally the end of the income year).

The proviso to subsection (1) applies in the situation where an employer pays to one of his or her employees an interim instalment of tax credit of an amount greater than the amount stated in the employee's certificate of entitlement. In these cases, both the employer and employee are jointly and severally liable for the amount overpaid, and that overpayment is required to be paid to the Commissioner by the 20th of the following month. After the payment to the Commissioner has been made, the overpayment portion of the original payment shall be deemed not to have been made for the purposes of section 394F (which deals with the tax credit in the end of year tax assessment). This latter provision ensures that the employee obtains his or her full tax credit entitlement (after deduction of instalments received during the year) in his or her end of year assessment.

If the employer recovers the excess from the employee and does not attempt to recover the excess from the Commissioner, the proviso will not apply.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - sets out the basis on which an employer can calculate the pay period equivalent of the weekly tax credit entitlement shown on the certificate where the employee is not paid on a weekly basis. The amount of the instalment is simply grossed up or apportioned according to the length of the pay period as follows:

*   where the pay period is less than one week, by dividing the amount on the certificate by 7 and multiplying the resulting amount by the number of days in the pay period.
*   where the pay period is 2, 3, or 4 weeks duration, by multiplying the weekly entitlement by the number of weeks the pay period.
*   where the employee is paid monthly, by multiplying the weekly entitlement by the fraction 13/3.

**Example:** If the certificate of entitlement states a weekly amount of tax credit instalment of $15, and the pay period is monthly, the instalment paid each month is equal to $15 x 13/3 = $65.

For the purposes of this subsection, the employee is deemed to be engaged in the employment in each day of the pay period. For example, if the employee worked Thursday, Friday and Monday of a 5 day pay period, the employee is deemed to have been employed for 5 days and will receive 5/7ths of the weekly entitlement.

It should also be noted that the subsection applies on the basis of pay periods, not number of days worked per pay period. Thus, for a person who regularly works 3 days per week and who is paid fortnightly, the FSTC is to be paid fortnightly at the rate of two times the amount shown on the certificate.

The proviso to subsection (2) releases an employer from his or her obligation to pay the full amount of any tax credit instalment in any case where the amount of the instalment exceeds the amount of the PAYE deductions because the employee's pay has been reduced because of industrial action on the taking of leave without pay at any time during the pay period. In this case the amount of the instalment is limited to the amount of any tax deductions made for the pay period.

**Example: Employee on strike**

Mr X's pay is normally $200 per week. His weekly PAYE is $30 and tax credit instalment $25. Last week Mr X was on strike for two days and that week's pay was $120 from which $18 PAYE was deducted. The employer (in accordance with the proviso to section 374H(2)) is not required to pay the full amount of the tax credit instalment for that week, but is only required to pay the amount of $18.

_**Subsection (3)**_ - sets out the delivery of interim instalments of tax credit in any case where a person is in receipt of earnings-related accident compensation. Where this occurs, the person, or the person's representative, may apply for the Accident Compensation Corporation, and not the employer, to pay the instalments of tax credit during the period that accident compensation is payable. Where the person makes such a request, the employer will be required to notify the Accident Compensation Corporation of the amount of the instalment stated on the certificate of entitlement. The employer should retain the certificate in his or her possession unless requested to give it to the employee or the employee's agent.

When the period of incapacity terminates and the employee recommences employment the employer will also recommence paying the tax credit entitlement.

It is proposed that those employees who are to be paid earnings-related accident compensation directly by the Accident Compensation Corporation will be asked to apply to their employer for the tax credit to be paid by the Corporation during the period of incapacity. In those other cases where the employer has made arrangements to continue to pay wages to the person during this period the employer will also continue to pay the tax credit.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - provides that the employer shall deduct any tax credit payments, which he makes to his employees in any month in accordance with the certificates of entitlement he holds for those employees, from any tax deductions he is required to pay to the Commissioner by the 20th of the following month.

It is important to note that the legislation has the effect of treating that portion of PAYE tax deductions that has been used to pay tax credits to employees as if it had been paid to the Commissioner on the date(s) on which the tax credits were paid.

**Example:**

Mr White has 5 employees. The total tax deductions for the month amount to $2,400 and tax credit instalments paid as agent for the Commissioner amount to $1,300. The amount Mr White is required to pay by the 20th of the following month is therefore equal to $2,400 - $1,300 = $1,100. The tax deductions and the tax credit instalments will, however, be recorded separately.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - requires the Commissioner, upon written application by an employer who in any month has paid employees a larger amount of tax credit instalments than the total amount of tax deductions made from employees' wages, to refund to that employer the amount by which the tax credit instalments paid exceeds the amount of tax deductions made. It should be noted that refund applications cannot be made on a pay period basis. The legislation requires that they be made following the end of the month in which the overpayment occurs.

The proviso to subsection (5) requires application for such a refund to be made within 8 years of the tax credits having been paid.

**Example:**

X employs 4 workers. The total tax deductions for the month of July equal $1,900 and the tax credit instalments paid equal $1,950. X therefore has no tax deductions to pay to the Department by the 20th of August and may claim a refund of $50, being the amount by which the tax credits paid to employees ($1,950) exceeds the tax deducted from employees' wages ($1,900).

_**Subsection (6)**_ - requires the employer to take every reasonable step to ensure the name on the certificate of entitlement is in fact the name of the person to whom he or she pays the interim instalments of tax credit.

_**Subsection (7)**_ - deals with the situation where any refund, made to an employer under subsection (5) of this section, was made as a result of a false claim by the employer. Where this occurs, the amount of the refund that was obtained fraudulently is deemed to be PAYE tax deductions made by the employer during the month in which the refund was made. The effect is that if the amount is not paid to the Commissioner by the 20th of the following month, it is subject to the normal penalties and recovery actions that apply to unpaid tax deductions.

Section 374I - Director-General To Deliver Credit Of Tax
--------------------------------------------------------

This section deals with the obligations of the Director-General of Social Welfare and the Social Security Commission (as defined) who deliver interim instalments of tax credits to certain persons.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - requires the Director-General to pay interim instalments of tax credits to any person who has delivered a certificate of entitlement that requires the Director-General to make such payments. In these cases the Director-General will act as if he were the employer of the person, and pay the interim instalments on a regular basis (for example, housewives who have no income). This provision is required to cater for those persons who have no alternative means of receiving their instalments on a regular basis, such as non-working spouses. Certificates of entitlement which are to be delivered to the Director-General rather than an employer, will contain a direction to that effect.

On receipt of such a certificate of entitlement, the Director-General will arrange to deliver the tax credit instalments at such intervals as deemed appropriate.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - requires the Social Security Commission to pay the full amount of tax credit instalment (ie $36 pw for the 1st child and $16 pw for each subsequent child) to any person (and in the case of a two-parent household, one half to that person and one half to the spouse of that person) to whom an "income-tested benefit" is paid. In these cases the tax credit instalment will be paid automatically by Social Welfare without production of a certificate of entitlement and therefore without application to Inland Revenue.

**Example: Beneficiary receiving Family Support through Social Welfare**

Mr Grey is made redundant from his employment and on 23 September applies to Social Welfare for the unemployment benefit. Social Welfare approves the benefit and also ascertains that Mr Grey has two children. FSTC is paid at the rate of ($36 + $16 = ) $52 per week at the time the benefit is paid each pay period, $26 being paid to Mr Grey and $26 to his wife. Social Welfare will pay the full rate of FSTC notwithstanding the fact that because the recipient's family income for the income year may exceed $14,000 a smaller entitlement exists.

_**Subsection (3)**_ - requires the War Pensions Board to pay the tax credits in the same manner as in subsection (2) above.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - requires the Director-General, the Social Security Commission or the War Pensions Board to issue to every person, to whom one or more interim instalments of tax credit have been paid by them, and to whom they are not required to deliver an IR 12 tax deduction certificate, a certificate showing the total amount of tax credit delivered during the past income year. This certificate will be required for all persons to whom the Director-General or the Commission or the Board pays interim instalments of tax credit but who are not required to complete IR 12 tax deduction certificates. The certificate will be attached to the end-of-year income tax return by the person as evidence of tax credit payments received in the same manner as an IR 12 evidences income and PAYE tax deductions for the year. The certificates are required to be delivered to the person by the 20th of April following in the same manner as an IR 12.

In addition the Director-General, the Commission or the Board are required to deliver to the Commissioner copies of the certificates given to the recipients.

Section - 374J Credit Of Tax To Be Offset Against Provisional Tax
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This section deals with the delivery of interim instalments of tax credit to provisional taxpayers. The interim tax credit entitlement is calculated in accordance with section 374G (refer to the commentary on that section) and the instalments will be applied by the Commissioner as follows:

1.  In payment of the provisional tax the taxpayer has an obligation to pay in respect of the income year that contains the elected period, ie FSTC for the 1988 income year will be credited against 1988 provisional tax: or
2.  As a credit to the account of a person who would have been a provisional taxpayer but for any of the reasons contained in section 374G(6)(d). (refer to the commentary on that section).

The Commissioner will apply the tax credit entitlement in payment of the instalments of provisional tax, or as a credit to the person's account, on the LATER of either:

1.  1 month after the instalment of provisional tax became due and payable ie the day immediately preceding the day on which additional tax for late payment is imposed.
2.  the day the certificate of entitlement was issued to the taxpayer.

Every amount of interim instalment of tax credit applied in the above manner is deemed to be an amount paid by the person as provisional tax, irrespective of whether provisional tax was payable or not. If it exceeds any provisional tax the person was required to pay the person may request a refund in the same manner as if an overpayment had occurred.

The tax credit will be applied to each instalment of provisional tax, or credited to the taxpayer's account, in the same proportion as the instalment bears to the total provisional tax liability. This means that a provisional taxpayer who pays 1/3 of his or her provisional tax as a 1st instalment and 1/3 as the 2nd instalment will also have 1/3 of his or her total tax credit entitlement credited at the time of the 1st instalment and 2/3 at the time of the second. A farmer who pays provisional tax in three equal instalments will receive his or her tax credit entitlement in three equal instalments.

Where the certificate of entitlement is issued to the applicant after the last day for payment of any instalment of provisional tax, the relevant amount of tax credit is credited back to that date as if it had been a payment made by the person on the last day for payment. Accordingly any additional tax that has accrued in the meantime for non-payment of that portion of the person's provisional tax instalment will be cancelled.

_**Example: Certificate of entitlement issued after provisional instalment due**_

Mrs X applies for a certificate of entitlement to have her tax credit entitlement of $900 applied against her provisional tax liability, which is $1,200. The 1st instalment provisional tax of $400 must be paid by 7 September before imposition of additional tax but the certificate of entitlement is not issued until 30 September. In order to prevent additional tax for late payment arising in respect of that part of the provisional tax which will be offset by the tax credit, the instalment of tax credit is deemed to have been applied on 7 September. This means that $300 of the provisional tax liability of $400 is deemed to have been paid by the due date so any additional tax for late payment of that $300 will be cancelled.

Special transitional arrangements for the 1986/87 income year are contained in the commentary on section 17(2). Under these, the 1986/87 income year entitlement can only be credited against instalments of provisional tax that have a due date for payment of 1 September or later. The 6 months entitlement for the 1986/87 income year will be credited against that or those remaining instalment(s).

Section 374K - Money Payable Out Of Consolidated Account
--------------------------------------------------------

This section provides for Parliament to appropriate funds out of the Consolidated Account for the tax credits paid under this Part.

Section 374L - Arrangements
---------------------------

This section declares invalid any arrangements entered into by two or more persons for the purpose of arranging their affairs in such a manner that either (or any) of them gains a greater entitlement to a tax credit than would otherwise be the case. The entitlement to a tax credit of any person who stood to gain from the arrangement is limited to the amount the person would be entitled to receive in the absence of such arrangements.

Section 374M - Advice
---------------------

This section allows the Commissioner to obtain any information he requires from the Director-General of Social Welfare, for the purposes of determining a person's entitlement to a tax credit under this Part of the principal Act.

Section 374N - Offences
-----------------------

A separate offences section has been established for tax credits payable under this Part of the Act as there are a number of situations that arise in relation to the family support and guaranteed minimum family income tax credits that are not specifically covered in section 416 of the Income Tax Act. This approach is similar to that taken in Part XI of the Act, which deals with tax deductions.

This section does not limit the application of section 416 of the Act (General Offences) but creates a number of additional offences:

**Paragraph (a)** - makes it an offence for an employer or other person, to whom a certificate of entitlement has been delivered by a person, not to pay the amount of interim instalments of tax credit stated therein.

**Paragraph (b)** - makes it an offence for an employer or other person, to whom a certificate of entitlement has been delivered by a person, to wilfully pay an amount of tax credit instalment that differs from the amount stated in the certificate of entitlement.

**Paragraph (c)** - makes it an offence for an employer or other person. who is holding a certificate of entitlement and who receives a notice of withdrawal of that certificate under section 374G(15), not to deliver that certificate to the Commissioner within 7 days.

**Paragraph (d)** - makes it an offence for anyone to falsely claim to have paid any instalments of tax credits, and subsequently attempt to obtain a refund from the Commissioner under section 374H(5). (In addition, please note that Section 374H(7) deems any refund that is fraudulently obtained to be of the same nature as PAYE tax deductions, and therefore payable to the Commissioner accordingly.)

**Paragraph (e)** - makes it an offence for anyone to pay any interim instalment of tax credit in accordance with a certificate of entitlement where that person knows or suspects that:

1.  The certificate of entitlement had been altered in any way. (Even where the employee claims that the alteration was made by the Commissioner. All altered certificates are invalid); or
2.  The person receiving the credit of tax is not the person to whom the certificate of entitlement was issued by the Commissioner.

The offences contained in Paragraph (e) are in harmony with the requirements of sections 374G(14)(c) and (d).

**Paragraph (f)** - makes it an offence for any person to attempt to sell or transfer a certificate of entitlement to any other person. (This offence relates to the requirements of section 374G(14)(c)).

**Paragraph (g)** - makes it an offence for any person to -

1.  Attempt to obtain a certificate of entitlement or a tax credit by means of a false or misleading application or declaration.
2.  Give false information or mislead or attempt to mislead the Commissioner, any other officer, employer, or other person in relation to any matter which would affect a certificate of entitlement or a tax credit.

**Paragraph (h)** - makes it an offence for any person, who has been issued a certificate of entitlement for any income year, not to furnish a declaration (as required by section 374F(5)) with his or her annual tax return. (Section 374F(5) requires the furnishing of a declaration, containing a complete statement of the person's assessable income, and the assessable income of the person's spouse.)

**Paragraph (i)** - makes it an offence for any person to -

1.  Alter a certificate of entitlement.
2.  Falsely pretend to be the person whose name appears on the certificate of entitlement.
3.  Be in possession of an imitation of a certificate of entitlement without lawful justification.
4.  Cause or attempt to cause an employer to pay any tax credit by producing any document other than a certificate of entitlement issued by the Commissioner.

**Paragraph (j)** - makes it an offence for any person to deliver or attempt to deliver a certificate of entitlement to more than one person for the purpose of obtaining from each of those persons a tax credit in respect of the same period of time.

**Paragraph (k)** - makes it an offence to aid or abet any other person to commit any offence under this part of this Act. To aid or abet someone means to take some active step, by word or action, with intent to instigate any person to commit an offence.

Section 374O - Penal Tax
------------------------

This section introduces a new offence which is subject to penal tax. It does not in any way affect the other penal tax provisions contained in the principal Act.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - provides that where any person falsely pretends to have made any payment of tax credit to any person, and subsequently attempts to obtain a refund from the Commissioner of the whole or any part of that amount, under the provisions of section 374H (see also commentary on section 374N(d)), that person shall be chargeable with penal tax on the amount that he or she fraudulently attempts to obtain as a refund. Penal tax may be an amount of up to treble the amount of the attempted fraudulent refund, and is charged in addition to any other penalty to which that person may be liable.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - deems any penal tax assessed under this section to be income tax assessed for the year ended 31 March immediately preceding the year in which it is imposed and provides that it shall be recoverable accordingly.

_**Subsections (3) and (4)**_ - allow the Commissioner to amend, at any time, any assessment of penal tax in the same manner as any other assessment.

_**Subsection (5)**_ - protects the right of any person who has been charged with penal tax to object on the grounds that -

1.  The person is not chargeable with penal tax; or
2.  The amount of penal tax assessed is excessive. (In this case regard must be had to the nature and degree of the offence or the reason for the imposition of penal tax.)

The proviso to this subsection directs that, where a person has been charged with penal tax, no Taxation Review Authority or Court shall reduce the amount of penal tax assessed below the smaller of:

1.  The amount of penal tax assessed, or
2.  An amount calculated on the fraudulent amount at the rate of 10 percent per annum of the amount of the fraudulent refund for the period commencing on the last day of the year of assessment in which the person attempted to obtain the fraudulent refund and ending with the day the assessment of the penal tax is made by the Commissioner.

_**Subsection (6)**_ - states that, subject to subsection (5) of this section, all the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to objections shall also apply to any objections to assessments of penal tax under this section. It places the burden of proving the offence that gave rise to the imposition of penal tax on the Commissioner.

_**Subsection (7)**_ - provides that the other Parts of the Income Tax Act, "as far as they are applicable, and with any necessary modifications", shall apply to all penal tax imposed under this section as if -

1.  It were penal tax under section 420 of this Act; and
2.  It were tax payable for the year of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment in which it is imposed under this section; and
3.  The person chargeable with the penal tax were the "taxpayer" referred to in these provisions.

Section 374P - Credit Of Tax Deemed Not To Be Assessable Income
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides that FSTC and GMFI tax credits shall be deemed not to be assessable income.

### IN ADDITION TO INCLUDING THE SECTIONS 374A TO 374P DESCRIBED ABOVE, SECTION 17 OF THE AMENDMENT ACT ALSO MAKES THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS:

**Section 17(2)** of this Amendment Act adds an Eleventh Schedule to the principal Act. This new Schedule is contained in the Fourth Schedule of this Amendment Act (repeated in the appendix to this publication) and is used when calculating the amount of interim instalments of FSTC a person is entitled to receive. The full method of calculation is set out in the new section 374G(4) of the principal Act.

### _Transitional Arrangements For The 1986/87 Income Year_

**Section 17(3)** of the Amendment Act contains the transitional measures in relation to the introduction of the FSTC and GMFI tax credits. Since the scheme commences on 1 October 1986, certain conditions will apply in respect of the income year commencing 1 April 1986 only.

**Paragraph (a)** - limits any specified period to a period COMMENCING ON OR AFTER 1 OCTOBER 1986. This means that no tax credits are available in respect of any period commencing prior to 1 October 1986, irrespective of the qualification criteria under sections 374D and/or 374E having been met.

**Paragraphs (b)** **and (c)** - limit the application of sections 374D and 374E in any case where the family benefit entitlement ceased prior to 1 October 7986. These sections deem the entitlement to a family benefit to be extended by 28 days in certain cases (refer to the commentary on those sections for details). The effect of this paragraph is to avoid a situation where the tax credit is paid out in respect of a period after 1 October during which the recipient or the spouse of the recipient is no longer entitled to a family benefit.

**Paragraphs (d)** **and (e)** - relate to the delivery of the tax credit through the reduction in provisional tax (section 374J refers). The effect of these paragraphs is that any estimated tax credit entitlement in respect of the 1986/87 income year may be offset against any provisional tax payment which first becomes, or would have become, due and payable on or after 1 September 1986. The effect of these paragraphs is that no tax credit can be credited against any provisional tax instalment which has a last date for payment that falls before 1 October 1986.

**Paragraph (f)** - omits the first proviso to section 374J. The proviso determines that any tax credit entitlement for the income year must be credited against provisional tax instalments in the same proportion as those provisional tax instalments bear to the total provisional tax payable for that year.

In order to allow the whole of the 1986/87 tax credit entitlement (which represents the credit for the last 6 months only) to be credited against the instalment(s) due and payable after 1 October 1986 the proviso is ignored for the 1986/87 year.

**Section 17(4)** - provides that the new Part XIA, the new Eleventh Schedule, and the transitional provisions apply in respect of the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986 and future years. (As opposed to the day on which the Amendment Act receives the Governor-General's assent).

Consequential Amendments
------------------------

Section 18 - Interpretation
---------------------------

This section inserts the definition of the term "certificate of entitlement" into section 2 of the principal Act. This definition has been included in section 2 because it is also used in Parts of the Act other than Part XIA. (See sections 374G and 374H commentaries in relation to the certificate of entitlement).

"Certificate of entitlement" - means a certificate issued by the Commissioner under section 374G for the purpose of enabling interim instalments of tax credits to be made.

Section 19 - Annual Returns By Persons Who Receive A Credit Of Tax
------------------------------------------------------------------

This section inserts a new section 9A into the principal Act. It requires the furnishing of a tax return by any person who has either:

1.  been issued with a certificate of entitlement, or
2.  applies for a tax credit at the end of the income year.

This includes any person who does not derive any income in that particular income year, but does receive a tax credit under Part XIA.

Any person who has been issued a certificate of entitlement for any part of an income year must furnish a return, even if the person did not receive any interim tax credit instalments (for example, he or she did not deliver the certificate of entitlement to his or her employer). Details must be provided in this return of the amount of any tax credit received by way of instalments throughout the income year.

The provisions of the principal Act will apply to any return furnished under this new section 9A as if it were a return furnished under section 9 of that Act.

Section 20 - Application Of Part XI
-----------------------------------

This section amends section 337(1) of the principal Act. It substitutes a new subsection (1) which ensures that Part XI must now be read in conjunction with Part XIA (FSTC and GMFI). This is because the FSTC/GMFI system is closely interrelated with the existing tax deduction system, and as a result Part XI has been substantially amended to incorporate the new changes.

Section 21 - Special Tax Code Certificates
------------------------------------------

This section amends section 351 of the principal Act, by adding a new subsection (2A). This subsection ensures that when a person applies for a special tax code certificate, the amount of FSTC and GMFI tax credits that person is entitled to receive cannot be taken into account in determining that person's estimated tax liability for the year.

This provision is required to prevent a person from receiving any tax credit entitlement from his or her employer by operation of a certificate of entitlement as well as receiving those benefits by way of reduced tax deductions through a special tax code certificate.

Section 22 - Records To Be Kept By Employer
-------------------------------------------

This section amends section 352 of the principal Act which deals with records that must be kept by the employer.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - amends section 352(1) of the principal Act to ensure that where an employer makes a source deduction payment to an employee, he or she shall record not only the amount of the source deduction payment and tax deductions made from it, but also the amount of any tax credit paid to that employee pursuant to section 374D (FSTC) or 374E (GMFI) of the principal Act. (If a person is receiving both FSTC and GMFI tax credits, these are required to be shown as one total).

_**Subsection (2)**_ - amends section 352(2) to include certificates of entitlement in the list of documents that the employer must keep in safe custody. These records must be retained for seven years except to the extent that a person is required by the Income Tax Act to deliver any documents to the Commissioner or to any other person, and except where the employer has received notification from the Commissioner that retention is not necessary. In practice however, the employer will be required to send all certificates of entitlement held at the end of the income year to the Department with the end of year reconciliation statement. They therefore will not be required to be retained.

Section 23 - Payment Of Tax Deductions To Commissioner
------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 353 of the principal Act which deals with the employer's duty to pay tax deductions to the Commissioner. The amendments are required in order to incorporate the FSTC and GMFI tax credits in the administration of the PAYE system.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - substitutes a new section 353(1) to include within the employer's duties relating to PAYE tax deductions those duties relating to tax credits.

**Paragraph (a)** of the new subsection provides that on the 20th of the month following the month in which an employer makes any tax deductions, that employer must remit to the Commissioner the amount of those tax deductions, less the sum of any tax credits paid out to employees in the same month, accompanied by a monthly remittance certificate showing not only the total amount of source deduction payments and tax deductions made, but also the total amount of tax credits paid in that month.

**Paragraph (b)** - requires the employer to deliver to each employee a tax deduction certificate not later than the 20th of April in each year, showing -

1.  the total amount of source deduction payments made by the employer to the employee.
2.  the total amount of tax deductions made from those payments.
3.  the total amount of all tax credits (if any) paid to that employee.

**Paragraph (c)** - within seven days of the employee ceasing employment, the employer must deliver to that employee a tax deduction certificate showing -

1.  the total amount of all source deduction payments.
2.  the total amount of tax deductions.
3.  the total amount of all tax credits paid to that employee during the period of employment in the income year.

**Paragraph (d)** - provides that where an employer makes a final, or only, withholding payment to an employee or group of employees, he must deliver to that employee or group of employees within seven days a tax deduction certificate which shows -

1.  the total amount of the payments made.
2.  tax deductions made from that payment (or those payments).
3.  the total amount of all tax credits (if any) paid to that employee or employees.

**Paragraph (e)** - provides that all employers must, not later than 31 May in each year, deliver to the Commissioner a reconciliation showing -

1.  the total amount of all the tax deductions paid to the Commissioner in the preceding year.
2.  the total amount of all tax deductions shown in the tax deduction certificates delivered to employees.
3.  the total amount of all tax credits paid to employees in the preceding year.
4.  the total amount of refunds received from the commissioner (under section 374G of the principal Act).

If these totals do not tally, an explanation must also be furnished to the Commissioner.

Signed copies of all tax code declarations, tax code certificates and certificates of entitlement (that have not been uplifted during the income year) that have been delivered to the employer in the preceding year, and all notices cancelling relevant deductions under section 344 (10) must also accompany the reconciliation.

**Paragraph (f)** - provides that where an employer ceases to carry on a business in respect of which he/she makes any tax deductions or pays tax credits, that employer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) not later than the 15th day of the month after the month in which he/she ceases to carry on that business (as if the period from the beginning of that year to the date of the last of those tax deductions were a preceding year).

_**Subsection (2)**_ - repeals section 25(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1981. This section made amendments to the old section 353(7) which no longer apply.

Section 24 - Tax Deductions To Be Credited Against Tax Assessed
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends the proviso to section 362(2) of the principal Act which contains provisions that prevent credit for PAYE tax deductions being given to a shareholder/employee of a private company where that company has failed to account for PAYE to the Commissioner. In these cases the PAYE credit is limited to the PAYE actually received by the Commissioner.

This amendment ensures that the amount of any tax credit paid to the employer is treated as if it were PAYE paid to the Commissioner by the company.

Questions And Answers
---------------------

The following questions and answers have been prepared to help explain the Family Support (FSTC) and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) tax credit schemes.

Application
-----------

### _1\. Question:_

I expect to be an income-tested Social Security beneficiary for some time to come. My wife has a part-time job and earns up to $50 per week. How do I apply for FSTC and because my income is so low do I qualify for GMFI?

### _Answer:_

You do not have to apply for FSTC. Because you are a social-security beneficiary both you and your wife will be paid the full amount of FSTC automatically by the Department of Social Welfare (DSW).

You are not eligible for the GMFI as this is not payable to social security beneficiaries.

### _2\. Question:_

if I cease to be on a benefit I understand that I will have to apply to Inland Revenue (IRD) for my FSTC entitlement. As the benefit is now taxable income do I have to include in my estimated income the benefit and from what date should it be included?

### _Answer:_

Income-tested benefits will become taxable from 1 October 1986. If you apply for FSTC to be paid from your employer and you have received a benefit for a period after 1 October the amount of the benefit received after that date is to be included in your estimated income figure, in your application.

### _3\. Question:_

I am on the unemployment benefit and work part-time. I have a job to go to in December this year. I understand that while I am on the benefit my FSTC will be paid by DSW. When I get my job do I have to apply to IRD or will DSW just continue to pay the FSTC to both my wife and I?

### _Answer:_

DSW will cease payment to both you and your spouse of FSTC when your entitlement to the benefit ceases. You and your spouse will need to apply to IRD for a Certificate of Entitlement. A Certificate of Entitlement will enable you to receive FSTC from your employer and your spouse if not working, will receive FSTC from DSW. Please note your spouse will also require a certificate of entitlement before payment from DSW.

### _4\. Question:_

As my benefit will cease on say 12 December and my new job will not start until 17 December, who will pay FSTC to me during the gap between cessation of benefit and start of my job.

### _Answer:_

If it happens that there is a gap between the cessation of your benefit and the start of a new job there will be no interim payment of FSTC for that period. However the entitlement for that period will not be lost and will be covered during the "square up" assessment at the end of the year.

It is suggested that to deep any gap to a minimum applications are forwarded to the Inland Revenue Department as soon as possible, so that a certificate of entitlement can be issued quickly.

### _5\. Question:_

We are expecting our first child in November. How will I obtain an application form? Can we complete a form now?

### _Answer:_

Application forms will be available at each Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry office. They will also be available at each Post Office. If it is more convenient the IRD will send one to you.

The main qualifying criteria for FSTC is that Family Benefit must be payable in respect of the child. Until such time as you have received a Family Benefit number an application for FSTC cannot be actioned.

### _6\. Question:_

I have completed my part of the FSTC application form but my spouse for reasons I am not prepared to disclose will not fill in part. How do I get my FSTC entitlement?

### _Answer:_

You should fill in the application form as far as you can and give us details of how to get in touch with your spouse. We will contact your spouse and ask him to come in and complete the other part of the application. If this is not convenient a separate application could be completed by each spouse and the two forms will be associated in IRD.

### _7\. Question:_

I share custody of my child with my estranged wife on week with me, two weeks with my wife basis. Am I entitled to FSTC?

### _Answer:_

You will only be entitled to FSTC if you qualify for payment of Family Benefit in respect of your child. From 1 October DSW will apportion Family Benefit in shared custody cases. In such cases FSTC will be apportioned according to the proportion of Family Benefit received.

### _8\. Question:_

My husband has been working away from home for the past 3 months and will continue to do so for the next 4 months. Your "Notes for Guidance" says that spouse does not include a person from whom you are separated ie living apart. Is my husband still my spouse?

### _Answer:_

Yes, your husband will still be your spouse.

### _9\. Question:_

My husband left me 6 weeks ago and we are now separated although not legally. I receive money on a fairly regular basis to support the children. Who applies for FSTC? If I do, what income do I include?

### _Answer:_

In these circumstances you will make application for FSTC as you are the person who receives Family Benefit for the children. Your husband is not entitled to claim as the definition of spouse excludes separated persons. Your income will be the assessable income derived by you in your own right plus the amount of the maintenance, being received from your husband.

### _10\. Question:_

I am a self-employed farmer who works part-time for a contractor in town. If I elect to be paid my FSTC through my employer and because I work part-time will I be paid my FSTC regularly by DSW?

### _Answer:_

Yes.

### _11\. Question:_

If I qualify for GMFI how do I know whether I get it and if I do how much will I get?

### _Answer:_

IRD will calculate the amount of any persons GMFI entitlement. This amount will be included in the figure shown on the certificate of entitlement. If you wish to know the amount of GMFI please do not hesitate to contact IRD who will advise you of the amount.

### _12\. Question:_

The application form states that I have to estimate my income. At this stage, depending on the performance of my employer, I may receive a pay increase later in the year. Is my estimate to take into account a possible pay rise or do I use my existing wage?

### _Answer:_

You can elect whether to include an estimate of the pay rise. If you underestimate your income you will have to pay back the FSTC overpaid during the year. If your estimate is too high, your actual entitlement will be paid at the years end.

### _13\. Question:_

I care for a foster child. Can I claim FSTC for that child.

### _Answer:_

No. Although you receive a payment from DSW in respect of the child it is not Family Benefit therefore you are not eligible to claim FSTC.

### _14\. Question:_

My wife and I capitalised the Family Benefit in order to purchase our first home. Can we still claim FSTC.

### _Answer:_

Yes, although Family Benefit has been capitalised it is still payable in respect of the children, and you are therefore entitled to FSTC.

### _15\. Question:_

I am a grandparent who has recently taken over the full-time caring of my two grandchildren as my daughter is not in a position to care for them. I do not receive Family Benefit for them. Can I claim FSTC?

### _Answer:_

No. You cannot claim for FSTC until such time as you receive the Family Benefit in respect of the children.

### _16\. Question:_

My children work after school to earn money some of which is used to purchase day to day requirements for the family. Is this money to be included as income for FSTC purposes?

### _Answer:_

No, only the income derived by the parents of the family is to be included for the calculation of FSTC entitlement.

### _17\. Question:_

My two oldest children live at home and pay $30 board each per week. Is this to be included as income for FSTC?

### _Answer:_

No, board received from your children is not assessable income for tax purposes therefore is not to be included as income for FSTC.

### _18\. Question:_

One of my children is thinking of leaving school this year. At this stage however I am not sure what will happen. Should I claim for this child or not?

### _Answer:_

Yes, if you wish to receive the FSTC for that child for the period up to when the child may leave school. IRD will calculate the FSTC for the period up to the forseen date of leaving. If it happens that the child remains at school you can make a new application for the increased claim or wait for an end of year square up.

### _19\. Question:_

I see that I am required to support my estimate of business income by enclosing either my latest set of accounts or a set of budgeted accounts. My accountant informs me that he will not have my accounts ready until after 1 October and if I want budgeted accounts that it will cost me extra. What am I do to do? Will you accept an application without the supporting evidence?

### _Answer:_

The law is quite specific in this regard. A set of the previous income year's accounts or a budgeted set of accounts must be included in the application before a Certificate of Entitlement can be issued.

### _20\. Question:_

What does the Commissioner expect by way of budgeted accounts? Will a single sheet of paper signed by my accountant suffice?

### _Answer:_

Budgeted accounts will be accepted in a format which reflects an effort to estimate the business income.

### _21\. Question:_

My employer has told me that he disagrees with the FSTC Scheme and because it may cost him money he has said that we should not expect payment by instalments. What is my position?

### _Answer:_

Initially the choice is yours whether you wish to receive FSTC by instalments or wait until the end of the year. If you choose instalments your employer is required by law pay you your FSTC on a pay period basis.

### DELIVERY

### _22\. Question:_

My husband receives an income-tested social security benefit. I work part-time. What is my position after 1 October?

### _Answer:_

There are two aspects to consider. Firstly in relation to FSTC you will be paid automatically half of the entitlement by DSW from 1 October onwards.

Secondly from 1 October the benefit will be equally split between you and your spouse so that each of you is paid your individual portion. Income-tested benefits will be taxed from 1 October. You will however not receive any less benefit and will receive the advantages of being a taxpayer ie able to claim for the tax rebates and exemptions, by filing an annual return of income.

### _23\. Question:_

My husband has just recently left me. I am receiving FSTC from DSW based on a Certificate of Entitlement issued by IRD. I understand as my family income has dropped dramatically that I am entitled to more FSTC. I have applied to DSW for the domestic purposes benefit, but I have been told that this may take up to 3 months to approve. What now is my position? Do I still receive FSTC based on my previous application? Does my husband still receive his share of FSTC?

### _Answer:_

You will receive the FSTC based on the Certificate of Entitlement issued to you until the domestic purposes benefit has been approved. Once the benefit commences your present certificate of entitlement will be cancelled and you will receive the full FSTC entitlement automatically with your benefit payment.

Your husband's entitlement will cease from the date of separation. Please advise your separated husband present address.

### _24\. Question:_

I am changing my job. The Certificate of Entitlement issued to me is however addressed to my employer. I understand I must now reapply for FSTC. How quickly will it be before I can expect to receive my new certificate?

If there is a gap will I lose my entitlement?

### _Answer:_

IRD will process applications as quickly as possible. If a gap does arise the entitlement relating to that period will not be lost, the end of year square up will ensure this. Please complete a new application as soon as you can, so any gap is kept to a minimum.

### _25\. Question:_

The Certificate of Entitlement issued to me says that my FSTC will be paid from DSW and that payments will be credited to my bank account. It goes on to say that if this is my first contact with DSW that department will approach me for bank account details. I was unemployed for a while about a year ago. Will DSW still contact me? How long will they take to contact me and how long will it be before I actually start to receive FSTC?

### _Answer:_

DSW will contact you to confirm that the bank account number is still valid. The time taken to contact you by DSW cannot be given, however the FSTC when credited will be backdated to the date the Certificate of Entitlement was received.

### _26\. Question:_

I have just had an addition to my family. Family Benefit has been approved and I now wish to have my FSTC reviewed. Do I have to fill in a fresh application?

### _Answer:_

So that you may receive your new entitlement you should provide full details to your local IRD office. They will then issue an amended entitlement for you.

### _27\. Question:_

I have been living in a de-facto relationship for the past 3 months. I have 4 children from a previous relationship. The person who I am living with does not support the children. Why should I not receive the full FSTC entitlement? Why does my de-facto partner become entitled to 50% of the FSTC entitlement?

### _Answer:_

It was one of the Government's main policy objectives of the FSTC Scheme to recognise the contribution of both parents towards the support of the family. It would not be possible to differentiate between families where one parent may contribute more towards the support of the family than the other.

### _28\. Question:_

I have just commenced to derive income from self-employment. I am not liable to pay provisional tax until next year. How am I to be paid my FSTC entitlement?

### _Answer:_

You will be paid by way of a credit of provisional tax. As you will not be liable for provisional tax that amount will be refunded to you.

### _29\. Question:_

I have derived income from self-employment for the period from 1.4.86 to 31.8.86. Should I include as part of my income used to calculate my FSTC entitlement for the period from 1.10.86 to 31.3.87 that income?

### _Answer:_

Yes the assessable income for the period of self-employment should be included in your estimate of income for the period 1.10.86 to 31.3.87.

The income from self-employment is deemed to have been derived evenly throughout the year thus the need for inclusion. As the initial year's FSTC is for a half year only, you are to enter half only of the assessable income from self-employment.

### _30\. Question:_

I am on Accident Compensation being paid earnings related compensation for a work accident. I am presently being paid my normal salary from my employer and will continue to do so until my sick leave ends. As my accident will be long term I propose to resign and go onto full-time earnings related compensation.

What will my position be in relation to FSTC?

### _Answer:_

Your employer will continue to pay you your FSTC until such time as you resign. From that date onwards, if you are being paid by the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Corporation will be your employer and will pay your FSTC entitlement. Of course, if your income has decreased you are entitled to apply for a review of your entitlement.

### END OF YEAR

### _31\. Question:_

I am a housewife at home looking after my children. I receive no income and am being paid my FSTC based on a Certificate of Entitlement calculated using my husband's earnings. If my husband's earnings increase and I receive too much FSTC how am I expected to pay back the overpayment.

### _Answer:_

Where an overpayment has occurred you will have until February of the following year to pay the amount. If the amount cannot be paid by you, IRD has the authority to make the amount payable by your husband.

### _32\. Question:_

I am a domestic purposes beneficiary who works part-time. If I elect to furnish a return to claim for my life insurance premiums will I have to complete a declaration and therefore have my FSTC recalculated even if it has been fixed by DSW.

### _Answer:_

If you have elected to furnish a return you will be required to complete a declaration for FSTC purposes. The FSTC will be calculated based on your actual income, from all sources received during the year.

If you have been on the domestic purposes benefit for the full period you have no obligation to furnish a return.

### _33\. Question:_

I am a sickness beneficiary and my wife and I have received the benefit for the whole of the period from 1 October to 31 March. We are also in receipt of FSTC. Although I am not required to furnish a return I propose to do so as I wish to claim for donations. If I send in a return do I have to complete a FSTC declaration? What does my wife have to do?

### _Answer:_

You will need to complete a FSTC declaration if you send in a return. All persons who furnish a return and have received FSTC during the year irrespective of the source will have to complete a declaration.

You wife will also have to complete a return and both returns should accompany the declaration.

### _34\. Question:_

I am on an income-tested social security benefit. I also derived income from interest and dividends to the extent that my benefit is abated. My FSTC will be paid automatically at the full rate. Do I have to furnish a return? If I do will my FSTC be recalculated.

### _Answer:_

Yes, you are required to furnish a return because you receive investment income.

As you have received FSTC a declaration will be required and your FSTC will be recalculated based on your actual income for the year.

### A Farming And Forestry Taxation Amendments

### Section 5 - Interpretation

This section amends the definition of "herd livestock" given in section 2 of the Principal Act.

The definition has been amended to allow bailors to value their bailed livestock under the herd scheme. This was always intended but was not reflected in the legislation. A bailor is an owner of livestock who has allowed another person (the bailee) the use of the livestock for an agreed period under a bailment agreement.

### Section 19 - Treatment of Shortages of Bailed or Leased Livestock

In a normal bailment agreement the bailee, at the end of the bailment, has to replace or compensate the bailor for the livestock bailed. A shortage (or deficiency) of bailed livestock arises in any one income year when the bailee has less livestock, of the class bailed, on hand than the amount originally bailed. Such a shortage can occur if the bailee, for example, sells livestock of the class bailed.

Prior to the introduction of this Amendment Act there was no legislation specifically dealing with the treatment of shortages of bailed livestock by the bailee. The basis of accounting for bailed stock used by bailees was agreed to in discussions with the NZ Society of Accountants many years ago. An example of that basis is attached as Appendix 1.

The arrangement was that the bailee should adopt a value for bailed livestock at either the market value per head at the date of bailment, or an appropriate standard value; that value to be used in subsequent years during the term of the bailment. A deduction from income, for actual shortages in numbers of bailed livestock, at the value adopted, was allowed.

There are two methods that were prescribed for accounting for these shortages. Under method 1 the Livestock Account shows opening and closing bailed livestock at the adopted values. Under method 2 values of Bailed Livestock are not shown in the livestock account. In the latter case the livestock account has a provision for the replacement of deficient bailed livestock. Each year the existing provision is reversed and a new provision made. Both methods 1 and 2 arrive at the same figure for gross income.

On termination of the bailment the bailee returns the bailed livestock and compensates the bailor for any deficiencies. This compensation is usually set at the market price of the deficient stock numbers as at the date of termination of the bailment.

However, certain difficulties have arisen with this approach:

The method of determining adjustments to income following changes in the number of bailed livestock held by a bailee is not always equitable to the bailee.

1.  If the value of livestock increases over the term of the bailment then any adjustment made to income for deficiencies in the bailed stock numbers will become less in real terms. This means that where sales of livestock create deficiencies, the provision for replacement may not be a reasonable offset on the income from the sales.
    *   **Example 1 - Bailee**
    *   1970 - 100 ewes bailed.
    *   Value to be used by the bailee set at market value of $8.
    *   1974 - 80 bailed ewes on hand.
    *   20 ewes were sold for $18 each.
    *   Sales are 20 x $18 = $360.
    *   Deduction for deficient bailed livestock (provision for replacement) is 20 x $8 = $160.
    *   There is, therefore, taxable income of $200 resulting from the sale.
2.  If the standard values given to bailed livestock are higher than the standard values of other similar livestock owned by a bailee, then any deduction for deficiencies may be excessive.
    *   **Example 2**
    *   1980 - 100 ewe hoggets bailed.
    *   Value to be used by bailee is set at market value of $40.
    *   1981 - No ewe hoggets on hand (have aged to two-tooth ewes)
    *   100 two-tooth ewes with standard value of $3 on hand.
    *   Deduction for the replacement of the deficient bailed livestock is 100 x 40 = $4,000.
    *   Increase in income from value of two-tooth ewes is 100 x 3 = $300.
    *   Gain to bailee is therefore $3,700.

_**Aim of the Amendment**_

The aim is to produce a fairer system which accounts for bailees' deficiencies at annually adjusted market values which are equivalent to the values which owned livestock are valued at. It is also to ensure that in transition to the new livestock valuation regime, the effect of the revaluation of deficiencies is taken into account in the calculation of the write-off.

Under the amendment the bailee is required to value deficient bailed livestock under the same scheme as owned livestock. The bailed livestock are able to be broken down only into the authorised categories set out in the twelfth schedule to the principal Act.

Operation of the Amendment

Section 19 introduces a new section 85B to the principal Act. Section 85B provides that the specified livestock of a BAILEE is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

a \- b

a is the actual number of specified livestock of a particular class on hand at the end of the income year, including both owned and bailed livestock; and

b is the original number of specified livestock of that class which were bailed, as specified in the bailment agreement(s) currently in force (provided that under the agreement these bailed livestock have to be returned or compensated for in full at a later date).

This means classes of specified livestock which are deficient are shown as negative livestock numbers and deducted from the number of owned specified livestock on hand.

The effect of the amendment is that the deduction for replacement of deficient specified livestock is made automatically and at the new standard or herd values. This is a change to the previous arrangement whereby adjustments for deficient livestock were made in the accounts at adopted (standard) values. Therefore methods 1 and 2 for accounting for bailed livestock as set out in the Departments rulings will no longer be needed (an example of how to reconcile these methods with the new treatment is given in Appendix 1)

**Example**

Taxpayer valuing livestock using the trading stock scheme.

| Livestock on hand 01.04.86 |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owned | 4000 | Mixed Age Ewes (Std Value = $8) |
| Bailed | 1950 | Ewe Hoggets (Adopted Std Value = $8) |
| Livestock on hand 31.03.87 |     |     |
| Owned | 4000 | Mixed Age Ewes (AMV = $13.20) |
| Bailed | 1900 | Ewe hoggets (AMV = $17.20) |
| (The terms of the bailment agreement relate to 2000 ewe hoggets) |     |     |
| Sales: | 3500 | Lambs and Ewe Hoggets at $18 |
| Purchases: | 800 | Ewe Hoggets at $17 |
| Natural increase: | 200 | Ewe Hoggets |

New values for specified livestock at 31.03.87

Trading stock scheme

Ewe Hogget Class = $17.20 x 0.7 = $12.04

Mixed Age Ewe Class = $13.20 x 0.7 = $ 9.24

| Specified livestock at 01.04.86 | Specified livestock at 31.03.87 |
| --- | --- |
| Ewe Hogget Class | Ewe Hogget Class |
| a \- b | a \- b |
| 1950 \- 2000 = \- 50 | 1900 \- 2000 = \- 100 |
| Mixed Age Ewe Class | Mixed Age Ewe Class |
| a \- b | a \- b |
| 4000 \- 0 = 4000 | 4000 \- 0 = 4000 |

LIVESTOCK ACCOUNT - Year Ended 31 March 1987

| Class | Opening Stock on Hand | No. Bailed | Surplus (Deficiency) | Value | Total Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ewe Hoggets | 1950 | 2000 | (50) | $8  | (400) |
| Mixed Age Ewes | 4000 | 0   | 4000 | $8  | 32,000 |
| Opening Value |     |     |     |     | 31,600 |
| Class | Closing Stock on Hand | No. Bailed | Surplus (Deficiency) | Value | Total Value |
| Ewe Hoggets | 1900 | 2000 | (100) | $1,204 | (1,204) |
| Mixed Age Ewes | 4000 | 0   | 4000 | $9.24 | 36,960 |
| Opening Value |     |     |     |     | 35,756 |

This way of accounting for bailed stock, which has already been adopted by some accountants, calculates the movement in bailed stock during the years in question and brings in deficient bailed livestock at negative values.

**Calculation of Gross Profit**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sales 3500 Lambs and Ewe Hoggets at $18 |     | $63,000 |
| less: Cost of sales - Opening stock | $31,600 |     |
| + Purchase | 13,600 |     |
|     | $45,200 |     |
| less: Closing stock | 35,756 |     |
|     |     | 9,444 |
| Gross Profit (ignoring any transitional concessions) |     | 53,556 |

The amendment ensures that the net proceeds from any sale of specified livestock which increases the number of deficient bailed livestock will better reflect the actual return to the farmer, after allowing for the value of the deficient livestock.

### Section 20 - Standard Value of Livestock

This section amends section 86 of the principal Act. Section 86 provides for the operation of standard values. Two drafting corrections were required.

Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) deletes the word "specified" that was wrongly inserted in the last line of the definition of "deductible excess".

Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) deletes a repeated phrase in 86(4)(b)(i)(B) (this error does not appear in CCH).

### Section 21 - Valuation of Herd Livestock

This section amends section 86A of the principal Act by repealing subsection (3) and substituting a new subsection.

The former subsection (3) provided that where the value of any herd livestock of a taxpayer at the end of an income year is determined in accordance with section 86A then, regardless of section 85(3) of the Act, that value shall also be the value of the livestock at the beginning of the income year.

There is no change in substance to this. However, because the subsection required that a value be determined for livestock as at the end of the income year it did not appear to cover situations where the taxpayer ceased farming during the income year. The subsection has therefore been rewritten so that it will clearly apply whenever a taxpayer has elected to value livestock under the herd scheme.

### Section 22 - Deduction in Respect of Livestock Revaluation

This section amends section 86E of the principal Act. Section 86E provides a "write-off" of livestock revaluation income (resulting from the increase in standard values which farmers are required to adopt as at 31 March 1987) in the transitional (1987) income year or the 1986 income year.

_**Subsection (1)**_ makes a small change in the wording to 86E(2), which provides for the write-off in the case of a farmer ceasing farming after 12 December 1985 but in the 1986 income year. The referral to section 85(4C) has been replaced with a direct referral to the Estate and Gift Duties Act. The change in wording was necessary to make the section fully operative because section 85(4C) only comes into effect in the 1987 income year.

### Calculation of the Livestock Revaluation Write-Off

The principal change to section 86E is made by subsection (2). Part of section 86E(3) has been rewritten to provide that the write-off is calculated by aggregating the amounts of revaluation income calculated for each class of livestock.

### Base Number Calculation

In calculating the deduction given by section 86E(3) it should be noted that the section is affected by the new section 85B (introduced by section 19 of this Amendment Act) because deficient bailed livestock have to be taken into account in calculating base numbers.

**Example 1**

Taxpayer elects to calculate his base number as at 31 March 1985. Livestock on hand 31 March 1985:

Owned: 4000 mixed age ewes (standard value = $8)

Bailed: 1800 ewe hoggets (adopted standard value = $8)

(The terms of the bailment agreement relates to 2000 ewe hoggets).

Calculation, for base number, of the number of specified livestock on hand at 31 March 1985 (section 85B)

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a   | \-  | b   |     |     |     |
| (total livestock on hand) |     | (livestock specified in bailment agreement |     |     |     |
| 4000 | \-  | 0   | \=  | 4000 |     |
| Ewe hoggets: |     |     |     |     |     |
| a   | \-  | b   |     |     |     |
| (total livestock on hand) |     | (livestock specified in bailment agreement) |     |     |     |
| 1800 | \-  | 2000 | \=  | \-200 |     |
| Calculation of write off (section 86E(3)) |     |     |     |     |     |
| Mixed age ewes: |     |     |     |     |     |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| (base number) |     | (new standard value) |     | (old standard value) |     |
| 4000 | x   | (9.24 | \-  | $8.00) | \= 4,960 |
| Ewe hoggets: |     |     |     |     |     |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| (base number) |     | (new standard value) |     | (old standard value) |     |
| \-200 | x   | ($12.04 | \-  | $8.00) | \= -808 |
| Revaluation write off = |     |     |     |     | 4152 |

### Dealing with Write-Downs

The amount of revaluation income for a positive class of specified livestock will be negative where the new standard value is lower than the standard value previously adopted. In these circumstances the amount of revaluation income for that class of livestock is deemed to be zero. This is done so taxpayers with high standard values will not be disadvantaged. The zeroing is given by a new subsection 86E(3A) which is inserted by subsection (3).

**Example 2**

**Livestock on hand 31 March 1985:**

Owned: 200 Mixed age ewes (standard value = $12)

200 Ewe hoggets (standard value = $12)

Calculation of write off (section 86E(3)).

| Mixed age ewes: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| (base number) |     | (new standard value) |     | (old standard value) |     |
| 200 | x   | ($9.24 | \-  | $12) | \= - $552 but deemed to zero |
| Ewe hoggets: |     |     |     |     |     |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| 200 | x   | ($12.04 | \-  | $12) | \= - $ 8 |
| Revaluation write off = |     |     |     |     | 8   |

Note that where the value of DEFICIENT bailed livestock is being written down the ZEROING DOES NOT APPLY because it is treated as negative livestock. The negative times negative in the write-off calculation for a deficient class will give a positive amount. This is justified because it compensates such bailees for their decreased deduction for deficiencies.

_**Treatment of Total Revaluation Write-Off**_

Where the total amount of the write-off calculated using section 86E is less than zero, the write-off is deemed to be nil. This is to ensure that no taxpayer has their assessable income increased by the write-off (a negative write-off means income).

**Example 3**

Base number: Mixed age ewes = 200

Ewe hoggets = -200

Calculation of write off (section 86E(3))

| Mixed age ewes: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| (base number) |     | (new standard value) |     | (old standard value) |     |
| 200 | x   | ($9.24 | \-  | $8.00) | \= - $248.00 |
| Ewe hoggets: |     |     |     |     |     |
| a   | x   | (b  | \-  | c)  |     |
| (base number) |     | (new standard value) |     | (old standard value) |     |
| \- 200 | x   | ($12.04 | \-  | $8.00) | \= -808.00 |
|     |     |     |     |     | \-560.00 |
| Revaluation write off = 0 |     |     |     |     |     |

As a negative write off would result, the revaluation write off is deemed to be zero.

The application date for this section is the income year commenced on 1 April 1985.

### Section 23 - Spreading of Income From Livestock Revaluation

This section amends section 86F of the principal Act. Section 86F provides for a spread of livestock revaluation income.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends the definition of "livestock revaluation income" in section 86F(1) to allow taxpayers, in calculating the spread, the option of comparing 1987 opening and closing numbers of livestock of the SAME class. The more complicated method of comparing the closing classes of livestock with opening classes of livestock one class younger, which was previously specified in the legislation, can also be used. For further explanation of how the spread is calculated refer to pages 69-71 of the explanatory document on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1986.

Note that in calculating the spread, all negative amounts are taken into account. NO ZEROING APPLIES.

_**Subsection (2)**_ inserts a new subsection (1A) in section 86F. The new subsection provides that only one of the options given in the definition of "livestock revaluation income" can be used for each type of livestock. Once the option is exercised for any class of livestock all classes of livestock within the particular type of livestock must be treated in the same way. This is to prevent taxpayers gaining a greater spread than was intended.

_**Subsection (3)**_ inserts a new subsection (5A) which deals with matrimonial transfers in the 1987 income year. Both partners are deemed to own, at the beginning of the 1987 income year, for the purpose of calculating the spread, the amount of livestock owned by each of them after the matrimonial transfer.

### Section 24 - Valuation of Bloodstock

This section amends section 86H of the principal Act. Section 86H provides the basis on which bloodstock is to be valued from the 1988 income year onward.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends paragraph (a) of 86H to make the meaning clearer. The change was required to ensure that subsection (2) of the transitional section 212C will work as intended, ie, a broodmare used by a taxpayer for breeding prior to the 1988 income year will be treated for the purposes of section 86H as first being used by the taxpayer for breeding in the 1988 income year.

### Section 27 - Certain Expenditure on Land Used For Forestry Purposes

This section amends section 127A of the principal Act. Section 127A phases out existing deductions for forestry expenditure.

_**Subsection (1)**_ corrects a wrong date in 127A(4). The 30th day of December should be the 31st.

The amendment applies from 1 April 1987.

### Section 28 - Expenditure on Land Improvements Used For Forestry

This section amends section 128B of the principal Act. Section 128B allows a deduction by way of depreciation for forestry land improvements.

_**Subsection (1)**_ deletes the incorrect exclusion of categories (a) to (d) of Part II of the thirteenth Schedule. A deduction is allowed on all types of expenditure listed in Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule to the principal Act.

The amendment takes effect from the date the section applies, ie, the 1988 income year.

### Section 29 - Revised Assessments Where Land or Fish Farms or Certain Assets are Sold Within 10 Years of Acquisition After Deductions in Respect of Certain Expenditure

This section amends section 129 of the principal Act. Section 129 claws back deductions of interest and development expenditure when property is sold.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends section 129 so that ALL farm land sold after 12 December 1985, irrespective of ownership, is exempt from the clawback provisions. This means leasehold farm land will now no longer be subject to the clawback provisions.

The amendment takes effect from 12 December 1985.

### Section 30 - Loss Incurred in Specified Activities

This section amends section 188A of the principal Act. Section 188A is a loss containment provision which applies to certain specified activities. The containment has been lifted for all activities, except renting, in relation to losses incurred in the 1986 income year and following years. This was achieved by adding a proviso to subsection 188A(7). However, group companies were left out because they are dealt with separately by subsection (7A).

This section inserts an appropriate proviso in section 188A(7A) to remedy the situation.

The amendment applies to any loss incurred in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1986 or any following year. Losses incurred in previous years remain subject to the $10,000 per annum maximum offset.

### Section 40 - Twelfth Schedule

This section amends the Twelfth Schedule of the principal Act. The Twelfth Schedule sets out all the types and classes of specified and herd livestock.

The new schedule gives the previously announced consolidation of angora goat categories. The new schedule will take effect from the 1988 income year (the 1987 goat values have been averaged to take account of the consolidation).

### B Accrual Treatment Of Income And Expenditure

### Sections 9 to 18, 25, 26 and 39.

These provisions implement all but two of the recommendations made by the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure in its supplementary report to the Minister of Finance.

A comprehensive explanation covering the whole of the accruals provisions is to be issued shortly. The amendments made in this Amendment Act to those provisions will also be explained in that document.

### C. Family Support And GMFI

### Section 34 - Family Support Credit of Tax

Section 374D of the principal Act sets out the formula for calculating a person's family support entitlement. Section 34 amends subsections 374D(1) and (2) to provide that the income level at which the tax credit entitlement commences to abate will be increased from $14,000 to $15,000.

This results in an increased tax credit entitlement of up to $180 a year for families who currently receive an abated amount of family support.

The amendment first applies for the income year that commenced on 1 April 1987 but any increase in entitlement for the 1987/88 income year can only be obtained in the end-of-year assessment (refer also to the commentary on section 36 below).

_**Subsection (1)**_ - increases the income level, at which the family support entitlement commences to abate, from $14,000 to $15,000.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - is the application section and provides for the increased abatement level to apply for the 1987/88 and all following income years.

### Section 35 - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of Tax

This section increases the guaranteed minimum family income credit of tax (GMFI) provided by section 374E of the principal Act. The GMFI is increased from $208 a week ($10,816 per annum) to $228 a week ($11,856 per annum). Note that family support tax credits and family benefit payments are additional to the new weekly GMFI amount.

This means that a one-child family will now receive a guaranteed income of $270 a week after tax (including family support and family benefit). This amount is increased by $22 ($16 family support and $6 family benefit) for each additional child in the family.

The increase is backdated to 1 April 1987 although current recipients will need to reapply to the Department to have their entitlement increased. Similarly, any persons who have now become eligible for the GMFI will need to furnish an application. Any entitlement not received during the year (for example, for the period between 1 April 1987 and the date a new certificate of entitlement is issued based on the new annual net amount) will, of course, be paid at the end of the year when annual returns are furnished.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - amends section 374E of the principal Act to increase the annual net amount of GMFI tax credit from $10,816 to $11,856.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - provides for the increase to apply in respect of the 1987/88 and all subsequent income years.

### Section 36 - Credit of Tax by Instalments

This section adds a proviso to section 374G(4) of the principal Act, which sets out the method of calculating the amount of the weekly tax credit entitlement to be included in a certificate of entitlement. This proviso prevents any increased family support entitlement resulting from the increase in the family support abatement threshold (from $14,000 to $15,000) from being claimed during the year.

All family support applications for the 1987/88 income year will therefore be treated as though the threshold is still $14,000. Any increased entitlement must be claimed at the end of the income year in the taxpayers return.

The proviso is necessary to avoid large scale recalculations of family support entitlements during this year and applies only for 1987/88.

Applications for 1988/89 will therefore be processed on the basis of the new $15,000 abatement threshold.

_**Subsection (1)**_ - adds a new proviso to section 374G(4) of the principal Act to provide for interim instalments of family support tax credit for the 1987/88 income year to be determined on the basis of the "old" $14,000 abatement threshold.

_**Subsection (2)**_ - provides for the proviso to apply only in respect of the income year which commenced on 1 April 1987.

### Section 37 - Family Support Offences

This section amends section 374N which deals with the acts or omissions that constitute an offence in relation to the family support tax credit scheme.

Section 374N(d) and (f) as they currently stand, recognise only an attempt to commit an offence rather than the actual commission of an offence. The scope of the section is extended to include as an offence, the actual commission of the offence.

_**Subsection (1)**_ declares that a person who obtains a refund of family support tax credit under false pretences commits an offence against the Income Tax Act 1976.

_**Subsection (2)**_ states that a person who sells or otherwise transfers a certificate of entitlement to any other person commits an offence against the Income Tax Act 1976.

The amendment applies to offences committed on or after the date on which this Act received the Governor-General's assent (22 June 1987).

### Section 38 - Penal Tax

An amendment is made to section 374O(1) which contains a separate penal tax provision dealing with false tax credits in connection with the Family Support Scheme.

Section 374O previously provided only for the imposition of penal tax where a person ATTEMPTED to obtain a refund from the Commissioner by falsely pretending to have made a payment to any person by way of a credit of tax.

The amendment ensures that any person who actually OBTAINS a refund of family support tax credit under false pretences will also be subject to penal tax.

The amendment applies with respect to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1987 and in every subsequent year.

### D Double Dipping

### Section 31 - Companies Included in a Group of Companies

Section 31 amends section 191 of the Act to prevent dual resident companies from offsetting their losses against the income of group companies. The effect is that a dual resident company will only be permitted to carry forward its losses for offset against its future income.

As announced in the 1987 Budget, the amendments to section 191 are an interim measure pending the introduction of legislation to combat international tax avoidance. The purpose of the measure is to counter the "double dipping" of tax losses by dual resident companies. The new legislation will apply to all dual resident companies in a tax loss situation, whether or not they are engaged in "double dipping" of losses.

Dual residence occurs when a company is resident in two countries under those countries' respective tax laws. An example of a dual resident company is one which is incorporated in New Zealand and managed and controlled in Australia. This company meets the tests of residence in each country.

Double dipping schemes rely on the establishment of a dual resident company and the company group loss transfer provisions in each country.

### Example

Company DR is resident in both New Zealand and Australia under the tax laws of each country. It is wholly-owned by Company NZ, a company resident in New Zealand. Company DR borrows money to purchase the shares of Company OZ which is resident in Australia. At the end of the income year, Company DR returns a tax loss, mainly by virtue of the deduction claimed under section 106(1)(h)(ii) for interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire the shares in Company OZ. Prior to the amendment to section 191, the tax loss of Company DR could have been offset against the income of Company NZ under the grouping provisions of section 191. The loss could also be offset against the income of Company OZ under the Australian grouping provisions.

In this example, the amendments to section 191 will prevent Company NZ from obtaining the benefit of Company DR's tax losses. Company DR will be allowed to carry forward its losses under section 188 of the Act to be offset against its future income.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 31 inserts a new paragraph (f) into section 191(1). The new subsection (1)(f) defines a "dual resident company" as a company that is resident in New Zealand during all or part of an income year, and that is resident in another territory during all or part of the same income year. Where a company is resident in either country for part of an income year it is still a dual resident company if, in another part of the same income year, it is resident in the other country.

The definition also applies where a company is subject to tax in another territory by virtue of registration, domicile, nationality, or incorporation.

_**Section 31(2)**_ inserts a new subsection (7E) into section 191. The new subsection (7E) provides that -

*   (a) the loss or part of a loss incurred by a dual resident company cannot be offset against the income of a group company under section 191(5);
*   (b) any payment, that would be a subvention payment under section 191(7), made to a dual resident company in respect of a loss or part of a loss incurred in an income year -
    *   (i) is not allowable as a deduction to the paying company;
    *   (ii) is not assessable income of the dual resident company.

_**Section 31(3)**_ makes consequential amendments to subsections (5) and (7) of section 191.

_**Section 31(4)**_ provides that the amendments to section 191 apply to losses incurred by any company in accounting years that commenced after 17 December 1986. This is the date on which the Minister of Finance announced that legislation would be introduced to counter double-dipping.

### E National Superannuitant Surcharge

### Section 33 - Determination of "Specified Exemption"

Income derived by a superannuitant, other than National Superannuation, that is below the specified exemption is not subject to the surcharge.

Section 336BA of the principal Act sets out the procedure for calculating the specified exemptions for other income for the purposes of the surcharge.

Section 33 increases the specified exemption from $7,202 to $7,800 (single rate recipients) and from $6,006 to $6,500 (married rate recipients, giving a combined exemption of $13,000 instead of the present $12,012), as announced on Budget night.

The section does not come into force until 1 April 1988, but it will apply from 1 April 1987. Therefore superannuitants cannot take advantage of the new exemption levels on a pay period basis during the 1987/88 income year and will have to wait for the end of year assessment before getting the benefit of the increase. The retrospective application from 1 April 1987 will mean that benefits will be received when the 1988 tax assessment is issued.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts the increased specified exemption levels into section 336BA of the principal Act.

_**Subsection (2)**_ makes a consequential amendment to section 336L(1A) of the principal Act in order to specify the pay-period equivalents of the new $7,800 exemption for single rate recipients for the purposes of the "SAJ" code.

_**Subsection (3)**_ makes a consequential amendment to section 336L(2) of the principal Act in order to specify the pay-period equivalents of the new $6,500 exemption for married rate recipients for the purposes of the "MAJ" code.

_**Subsection (4)**_ - At present, National Superannuitants who receive more than $6,006 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation are excluded from being "pay-period taxpayers" as that term is defined in section 356(1) of the principal Act.

This subsection consequentially amends that definition as a result of the new specified exemption levels to ensure that only those National Superannuitants who receive more than $6,500 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation will be excluded from being "pay period taxpayers".

_**Subsection (5)**_ - This is the application date subsection. It provides for this section of the amendment Act to come into force on 1 April 1988 but to apply with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1987.

### F General

### Section 2, 3, and 4 - Annual Taxing Act

These sections are deemed to be the annual taxing Act for the 1987-88 income year.

**Section 2** confirms the rates of income tax for the 1987-88 income year. The rates are as set out in the First Schedule to the principal Act.

**Section 3** confirms the rate of excess retention tax for the 1987-88 income year. This rate remains at 35 cents as set out in clause 11 of Part A of the First Schedule to the principal Act.

**Section 4** repeals the Income Tax (Annual) Act 1986.

### Section 6 - When Objections May Be Referred in the First Instance to the High Court

**Section 6** amends subsection (11A) of section 33 of the Act to correct a drafting error made when section 33(11A) was inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1987 (the legislation relating to the new accruals regime).

The amendment deletes the reference to section 64E(5) and substitutes a reference to section 64E(6).

### Section 7 - Rebate From Tax Payable by Non-resident Companies in Respect of Income From Special Development Projects

Section 7 amends section 42 of the principal Act which provides for a special rebate for those non-resident companies which have been declared by Order in Council to be undertaking a special development project in New Zealand.

The rebate ensures that the non-resident company's New Zealand tax rate falls between a minimum of 42.5 percent and a maximum of 53 percent (the tax rate applicable to income derived in New Zealand by non-resident companies) during the "first specified period" and does not exceed 48 percent (the rate of tax applicable to New Zealand resident companies) during the "second specified period" on income derived from special development project activities. The first and second specified periods are as stipulated within the appropriate Order in Council.

The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the rebate will also apply when an Order in Council provides for a second specified period only. Previously section 42 required that prior to the commencement of the second specified period there must also have been a first specified period. This amendment to section 42 simply allows for the rebate to apply during a second specified period without there being a first specified period.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 7 merely adds the words "(if any)" into the definition of the term "first specified period". This has the effect of saying that there need not be a "first specified period" in an Order in Council.

_**Subsection (2)**_ adds a proviso to the definition of the term "second specified period". This has been inserted so that where an Order in Council declaring a non-resident company to be carrying on a special development project does not provide for a first specified period, but does specify a second specified period, that period is to commence from the accounting year to which that Order first applies. In other words, the second specified period is to commence at the same time as the first specified period, had there been one.

_**Subsection (3)**_ amends subsection (4) of section 42 in two ways:

First, paragraph (a) inserts some words into subsection (4) to provide that an Order in Council declaring an undertaking to be a special development project can apply to accounting years of the company carrying on the project that commences before, on, or after the Order is made. The entitlement to any rebate under section 42 will depend upon the periods actually specified in an Order.

Second, paragraph (b) merely adds the words "if any" into paragraph (a) of subsection (4). This subsection specifies the maximum length of time that the specified periods can run. By inserting "if any" into the legislation it implies that there need not be a "first specified period" before a "second specified period".

### Section 8 - Incomes Wholly Exempt From Tax

This section amends section 61 of the principal Act to provide an exemption from income tax for income derived by the trustees of the New Zealand Agent Orange Trust from the settlement fund awarded to the Trust by the United States District Court Eastern District of New York and accretions of income to that fund. Note that the exemption applies only to that part of the Trust's income derived from the original settlement and accretions thereto. It does not apply to the income earned on any other funds held by the Trust.

Any income derived by beneficiaries of the Trust by way of distributions from the Trust, is also exempt. In this case, all distributions, including those from funds of the Trust other than the original settlement and accretions thereto, are exempt.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts a new paragraph 56 into section 61 of the principal Act which exempts from income tax:

1.  income derived by any trustee of the New Zealand Agent Orange Trust from:
    1.  the settlement fund awarded to it by the United States District Court Eastern District of New York, or
    2.  from any accretions of income attributable to the settlement fund;
2.  any distribution made by the New Zealand Agent Orange Trust to any beneficiary of the trust.

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that this section shall apply from 1 April 1987.

### Section 32 - Special Partnerships

This section makes an amendment to section 211B(12) which is concerned with the duration of a special partnership.

Section 211B(12) provides that where a special partnership, first registered prior to 1 August 1986, is renewed or continued in conformity with the appropriate provision in the Partnership Act, then for the purposes of section 211B(2) that renewed partnership is regarded as having been first registered prior to 1 August 1986.

The purpose of this amendment is to correct a minor grammatical error. The word "it" is inserted after the expression "duration of the partnership" and before the expression "shall be deemed" in subsection (12).

The amendment applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1986 and in every subsequent year.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983 from PIB vol 126 Sep 1984.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 126, September 1984

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Section 1 - Short Title

This section provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with, and form part of, the Income Tax Act 1976.

Part I
------

General Provisions
------------------

### Section 2 - Application

This section provides that the provisions in Part I of this Amendment Act are to apply to the tax on income derived during the income year which commenced on 1 April 1983, **unless otherwise stated in the Amendment Act**.

It is important to check the commencement date when applying any of the amending sections. Many of the provisions of this Part have their own commencing dates. These are pointed out in the commentary which follows.

### Section 3 - "Superannuation Fund" Definition

In last year's Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2), the definition of the term "superannuation fund" was repealed and replaced by definitions of superannuation category 1, 2, and 3 schemes.

However, the principal Act still contained, in various sections, references to a superannuation fund, which in the absence of a specific definition, would have assumed its normal dictionary meaning.

Since the section 2 definition of a "superannuation fund", before last year's amendment, referred to only the Government Superannuation Fund and funds approved by the Government Actuary, the repeal of that definition left that term undefined in the Act and consequently capable of an expanded meaning.

This section simply reinstates the position as it was prior to the repeal of the former definition, by introducing a specific definition of "superannuation fund" to mean any superannuation category 1 scheme (includes the Government Superannuation Fund) or any superannuation category 2 scheme. That is, superannuation category 3 schemes are **excluded** from the definition of a superannuation fund, so that that term effectively refers only to **approved** schemes.

### Section 4 - Bonus Issues

This section amends section 3(3) of the principal Act which excludes certain bonus share issues from the definition of "bonus issue" for income tax purposes.

The exclusion of certain bonus issues, made on or after 1 April 1982, from the meaning of the term for income tax purposes has two important results:

1.  The bonus issue is not one to which section 4(1)(ca) applies and therefore any return of capital within 10 years after the bonus issue is not treated as a dividend because of that bonus issue having been made, and
2.  The bonus issue is not excluded from company distributions which can be taxed as dividends under section 4(1).

This amendment makes two changes to the exclusions from the meaning of "bonus issue".

**(a) Capital Profits to which Section 4(5A) Applies**

Paragraph (a)(i) of section 3(3) excludes from the definition of bonus issue any bonus issue from a capital profit arising from the realisation of an asset of the company. Last year legislation was enacted (to insert a new section 4(5A) in the Income Tax Act 1976) to prevent the "tax free" distribution of capital profits arising from the sale of company assets to related parties. However it was still possible to effectively distribute these capital profits by converting them into share capital, making a bonus issue and then subsequently reducing the share capital to its original level and distributing the amount of the reduction. Such a bonus issue was under the provisions of section 3(3)(a)(i) of the principal Act, excluded from the meaning of "bonus issue" for income tax purposes and therefore the return of capital did not fall within the provisions of section 4(1)(ca).

Section 3(3)(a)(i) is now amended by section 4 of this Amendment Act so that bonus issues made out of profits to which section 4(5A) applies will now be bonus issues for income tax purposes. This means that such bonus issues will now fall within the provisions of section 4(1)(ca) if redeemed within 10 years.

**(b) Bonus Issues from Revaluation Reserves**

The intention of section 4(5A) as enacted last year could also be circumvented by revaluing the capital asset to market price prior to transferring it to the related party, converting the revaluation reserve into share capital by a bonus issue and subsequently redeeming the increase in share capital.

Accordingly section 3(3)(b) is repealed by section 4 of this Amendment Act which means that bonus issues made from revaluation reserves will now be bonus issues for income tax purposes. It follows that when such bonus issues are made they cannot be taxed as a dividend under section 4(1). However if there is a return of capital within 10 years, after the bonus issue, that return will fall within the provisions of section 4(1)(ca). Any bonus issues from revaluation reserves which occurred prior to this repeal coming into effect will continue to be exempt from Bonus Issue Tax and the Department will not seek to tax them as dividends,

### Application Date

These amendments to section 3 of the principal Act apply from the 16th of December 1983, the date the Income Tax Amendment (No 3) Act 1983 received the Governor - General's assent.

### Section 5 - Meaning of the Term "Dividends"

This section makes several changes to section 4 of the principal Act in relation to the meaning of dividends for income tax purposes.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends section 4(1)(ca) of the principal Act in relation to returns of capital made within 10 years after the making of a bonus issue by defining the term "return of capital". This amendment will now remove any uncertainty on the meaning of that term for income tax purposes.

A return of capital now means any amount:

1.  Distributed by a company from any reduction of the share capital of the company.
    *   A "reduction of share capital" is the formal reduction of share capital contemplated under the provisions of the Companies Act 1955. It will include any reduction of preference share capital that is not "redeemable" and therefore cannot be repaid without the consent of the Courts. Note that formal approval of the Court, or lack of such formal approval, is not in this area a determinant for tax purposes and therefore an unauthorised reduction of share capital will fall within the scope of this paragraph.
2.  Distributed by a company on the redemption of preference shares where those preference shares:
    1.  were issued by way of bonus issue made on or after 1 April 1982, or
    2.  give the right to participate in any bonus issue made by the company on or after that date.
        *   A redemption of preference shares only applies to preference shares that are redeemable without a formal reduction of share capital in the Court pursuant to the Companies Act.
        *   Preference shares which are redeemable and which do not carry any rights to participate in bonus issues may be redeemed without falling within the scope of section 4(1)(ca) (provided the preference shares themselves were not issued by way of a bonus issue).
3.  Any return of paid up capital made on the winding up of the company to the extent that the return is in excess of share capital which is paid up in any way other than by making a bonus issue.
    *   This paragraph brings within the meaning of "dividends" that part of the paid up capital of a company which exists because of a bonus issue made on or after 1 April 1982 if that part is returned on the winding up of the company within 10 years after that bonus issue.

None of the types of "return of capital" described in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) is a "dividend" if it is an amount deemed to be a further bonus issue under section 263, ie, capital returned within 3 years of a bonus issue made **prior** to 1 April 1982, where the Commissioner is **not** satisfied that that return was not pursuant to an arrangement at the time the bonus issue was made.

It must be remembered that section 4(1)(ca) **only** provides for a dividend to arise when there has been a **bonus issue** made within 10 years before the return of capital. Bonus issue is a defined term for income tax purposes and it is common for companies to make bonus share issues from certain sources which are not considered to be bonus issues in terms of section 3 of the principal Act. Two common examples of bonus issues which are not bonus issues for income tax purposes are:

*   bonus issues from capital profits,
*   bonus issues from share premium reserves.

It is essential that section 4(1)(ca) is read in conjunction with section 3 of the principal Act when examining the taxation implications of any return of capital. Section 4 of this Amendment Act has a direct bearing on this issue.

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 5 of this Amendment Act extends section 4(1) of the principal Act to bring within the meaning of "dividend" any money advanced by a company to or for the benefit of any of its shareholders where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the advance is not a bona fide investment by the company but virtually a distribution of an amount capitalised by way of a bonus issue where the bonus issue:

*   is made on or after 1 April 1982; and
*   is made within 10 years immediately preceding the making of the advance.

Essentially, this amendment allows the Commissioner to treat advances to shareholders that he considers are not bona fide investments by the company as returns of capital for the purposes of section 4(1)(ca). This is an extension of the same provisions that have existed for some time whereby the Commissioner can treat advances which he considers are not bona fide investments as being distributions of profits.

The first proviso to section 4(1) will also apply to advances where the Commissioner is of the opinion that they are a distribution of an amount capitalised by way of a bonus issue. In other words, if the total advance is subsequently repaid to the company the Commissioner may issue an amended assessment excluding the deemed dividend.

The Department will take the same stance on advances that it considers are a return of capital as it currently operates in respect of advances it considers are distributions of profit. This means that the current rulings in respect of what constitutes a "bona fide investment", and "to or for the benefit of any of its shareholders", etc, will apply to both types of advances.

The Department's policy is that advances to shareholders that are on terms which would not be commercially supportable are to be treated:

1.  Firstly, as a distribution of profits (whether from revenue or capital reserves). This means the advance is treated as a dividend which may, or may not, be taxable according to the source of the profit distributed.
2.  Secondly, **and only after revenue and capital reserves have been exhausted** , as a return of capital to which section 4(1)(ca) applies.

### _**Subsection (3)**_

This subsection amends section 4(5) of the principal Act (which excludes certain capital profits from the meaning of the term "dividends") and qualifies the nature of the capital losses that must be taken into account in ascertaining the balance of any capital profit or gain that can be distributed "tax free". Where capital losses arise from the realisation of capital assets in transactions to which subsection 4(5A) would apply, ie, transactions between the company and related persons, this "intra - group" loss is excluded from those losses which must be taken into account pursuant to and for the purposes of section 4(5).

The effect of this amendment is to allow genuine capital profits, in excess of genuine capital losses, arising from the realisation of company assets to be distributed "tax free" without having to take into account "capital losses" arising from the realisation of assets in transactions with related persons.

### _**Subsection (4) - Application date**_

This section has the same application date as the amendment made last year to section 4 in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982, ie, it applies to returns of capital, distributions or bonus issues made on or after 1 April 1982.

### Section 6 - "Associated Persons" Definition

This section amends section 8 of the principal Act which contains a definition of the term "associated persons" which applies for the purposes of the various references to that term in the Act.

Prior to this amendment, the expression "associated persons" included the relationship between a company and a person (other than a company) who holds 25 percent or more of the paid - up capital of that company. The application of this associated persons "test", as between a company and a non - company, could be avoided where there was no paid - up capital in the company.

This amendment extends the definition of "associated persons" in section 8 to include the relationship between a company and a person (other than a company) who holds 25 percent or more in nominal value of the allotted shares of that company.

This amendment will apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1984.

### Section 7 - Returns by Partners, Co - Trustees, and Joint Venturers

At present, subsection (2) of section 10 provides that a husband and wife carrying on business together shall be deemed not to be carrying on business as partners unless they are carrying on business under a deed of partnership. This amendment removes that requirement with effect from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1983. For 1984 and future years, the determination of whether a husband and wife are carrying on a business as partners will be based on the facts of each case, with particular regard being given to the contributions made by each spouse by way of capital introduced and services performed in the carrying on of the partnership business.

In determining capital contributions, business assets owned by each partner following a transfer in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" (as defined - please see comments on section 43 of this Amendment Act) will, following the transfer, be treated as having been introduced by each spouse in the proportions now owned.

**Example**

*   Assume that husband and wife had contributed capital to the extent of 90 percent by the husband and 10 percent by the wife towards the purchase of the farm in 1957 and had been farming in partnership since then. If they entered into a "matrimonial agreement" on 20 September 1984 for the ownership of the farm to be settled at 50 - 50, and transferred 40 percent of the property in accordance with that agreement, then the Department would accept that the capital contribution of each partner on that date was 50 - 50.

Where separate accounts are not available for each period, the Department will accept an apportionment of the profit or loss which relates to each period based on the following formula:

With regard to the contributions of each partner by way of services it should be noted that this contribution must be by way of services performed in the carrying on of the partnership business. The contributions either spouse makes to the marriage itself cannot be taken into account.

### Section 8 - Back Pay Rebate

This section repeals the provisions in the principal Act which relate to the back pay rebate which, in accordance with the amendments made last year, can be claimed only in respect of payments of retrospective pay made on or before 30 September 1982.

The repeal is to be effective on 1 April 1984 in order to minimise any misunderstanding that the repeal of the provisions would mean that claims could no longer be made in tax returns **furnished** in the income year ending 31 March 1984. Furthermore, notwithstanding the repeal of the provisions, claims will still be accepted after 1 April 1984 so long as the payment of back pay was made on or before 30 September 1982.

A similar change has not yet been made in relation to the overtime and shiftwork rebates, which likewise do not apply to any time worked or shiftwork performed on or after 1 October 1982. This is because of the existence of the Overtime and Shiftwork Recognition Authority and the possibility of the need for that Authority to resolve disputes involving overtime or shifts worked before termination of eligibility for those rebates. The provisions which cover those rebates will be repealed in a later year when the Government is satisfied no further claims are likely to arise.

### Section 9 - Rebate in Respect of Gifts of Money and Payment of School Fees

This section amends section 56A of the principal Act.

Section 56A allows a tax rebate of 31 cents per dollar - maximum rebate $200 - for cash gifts, each of $5 or more, made by individuals to certain organisations.

This amendment adds the following to the qualifying organisations so listed:

*   The New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped (Inc);
*   Amnesty International; and
*   The Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund (TEAR Fund).

Donations of $5 or more to those organisations, made by individuals on or after 1 April 1983, will be eligible for the section 56A rebate.

### Section 10 - Exemption of Certain Income Derived by Disabled Persons

This section amends section 61(53) of the Income Tax Act which exempts from tax income of a "nominal" amount derived by a disabled person in respect of therapeutic activities undertaken in a sheltered workshop. The amendment increases the current "nominal" amount from $15 per week to $25 per week.

Section 10 amends section 61(53) also to clarify the basis upon which the determination of whether a taxpayer's income constitutes income of a "nominal amount" is to be made in practice. Currently, the position of a taxpayer whose income from a workshop may fluctuate on a weekly basis is unclear - in some weeks the income may exceed the stated limit, even though on average for the year it may be well below that limit.

The amendment ensures the determination of the "nominal" amount on the basis of **average** weekly income - calculated as the total income derived from therapeutic work divided by the number of weeks worked in the year. For example, a disabled person deriving $20 per week for 20 weeks of the year, and $30 per week for 15 weeks of the year (in the remaining 17 weeks no work is undertaken) would, under the amended section, qualify as deriving "nominal income" calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $20 x 20 = | $400 |     |
| $30 x 15 = | $450 |     |
|     | 850 | Total income for year |
| +   | 35  | Number of weeks worked |
|     | $24.28 | Average weekly income |

It should be noted that where the amount of income derived by a disabled person from therapeutic work exceeds the nominal weekly amount, **the full amount is taxable** , not just that amount received in excess of the limit.

The amendment to section 61(53) applies from and including the 1983/84 income year.

### Section 11 - Taxation of Land Sales

This section makes a number of amendments to section 67 of the principal Act which deals with the taxation of profits on sale of land in certain circumstances.

Details of the amendments made by each subsection follow.

### _**Subsection (1) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - "Associated Persons" Definition**_

Section 67(2) of the principal Act contains a definition of the term "associated persons", for the purposes of section 67, which differs from the general definition contained in section 8 of that Act.

As explained in relation to section 6 of this Amendment Act, the section 8 definition of "associated persons" has been amended this year by extending it to apply to the relationship between a company and a person (other than a company) who holds 25 percent or more in nominal value of the allotted shares in that company.

This subsection makes a similar extension to the "associated persons" test in section 67(2).

**Application of this "associated persons" amendment**

This amendment is to apply with respect to sales or other disposals of land made on or after the day on which the Amendment Act received the Governor - General's assent (16 December 1983).

### _**Subsection (2) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - Persons Associated With Property Developers and Subdividers - New subsection 67(4)(ba)**_

Previously, subsection (4) of section 67 specified 6 categories of land sale the profits or gains from which could constitute assessable income.

This subsection adds a further category of land sales to which section 67 can be applied. It inserts a new paragraph, (ba), to cover the situation where the seller or an associated person of the seller was a property developer or subdivider at the time the land was acquired **and** :

*   that land was acquired for the purpose of that business of property developing or subdividing, or
*   that land was sold within 10 years of acquisition.

It is expected that there will not be many cases which fail within the new paragraph. This is because had the property been developed in accordance with an original intention to develop, it would then have been subject to the provisions of sections 67(4)(e) or 67(4)(f). The new paragraph (ba) therefore covers situations where property is acquired by a property developer or subdivider, or an associated person of a property developer or subdivider, but the property is not actually developed or subdivided.

This amendment is to apply to sales of land made on or after the day on which this Amendment Act received the Governor - General's assent (16 December 1983).

### _**Subsection (3) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - Property Developments**_

This subsection amends section 67(4)(e) which treats land sale profits as assessable income where those profits arise from an undertaking or scheme carried on or carried out (whether or not an adventure in the nature of trade or business), involving the **development or division into lots** of that land where that development or division work (not being work of a minor nature) was commenced within 10 years after the date of acquisition of the land.

The intention was that that paragraph would apply only where land was developed as part of an undertaking or scheme for the purpose of deriving a profit from the subsequent sale of the land, in other words, to developments by way of subdivision for the purpose of resale. The High Court, in reaching its decision in the "ANZAMCO" case, by inference, considered that there was **nothing** in section 67(4)(e) which would require an undertaking or scheme to be sale/profit motivated before section 67(4)(e) could apply to it. The effect of the decision was that a profit on sale of land could be taxable where development work (including such work as farm or home development work) was carried out and the land was sold within ten years of the date of acquisition.

Subsection (3) of section 11 of this Amendment Act now restores the original intent. It adds a proviso to section 67(4)(e), to exclude from the types of development or division work to which that paragraph applies, developments, divisions or improvements that are, in the Commissioner's opinion, **for use in and for the purposes of** :

*   Any business carried on by the taxpayer (includes farming and other businesses carried on from the premises) except those businesses which are subject to the application of the paragraph, namely, land development businesses.
*   A private residence for the taxpayer and any member of his family living with him.
*   The deriving by the taxpayer of rents or similar revenues from that property.

**Points to note**

It should be noted that, for the proviso to apply, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the developments, divisions or improvements are "for use in" _and_"for the purposes of" the specified categories of land usage.

For example, the subdivision of a parcel of land into lots, one of which is retained by the taxpayer for, say, his own residential purposes, would not exclude subdivision sales from the effect of section 67(4)(e) since the development work could not meet the requirement of having been carried out **for use in** and **for the purposes of** that residence.

It should also be noted that the amendment excludes only three categories of land developments. Developments other than those specified, for example, development for hobby farming, could still come within section 67(4)(e). In most cases involving hobby farm development, however, the development work carried out is unlikely to be of more than a minor nature (the ascertainment of which depends essentially on the facts of the case).

A final point to note is that this amendment has been made only to section 67(4)(e) and not to section 67(4)(f) which also makes reference to the words "development or division into lots". This is because, as that paragraph comes into operation only in the case of development or division work involving "significant expenditure on earthworks, contouring, levelling, drainage, etc, being work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for industrial, commercial or residential purposes", it is considered that this type of development work could not be undertaken in respect of the categories which the new proviso to section 67(4)(e) now excludes for purposes of paragraph (e). That is, any such developments would clearly be major subdivisions to which the provisions of section 67(4)(f) should be applied.

_**Application of this amendment to section 67(4)(e)**_

In order to give full effect to this amendment, its application has been backdated so that it applies to all land sales made on or after 10 August 1973, the date from which the original land sale provisions now embodied in section 67 first applied under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954.

This means that any cases where profits from land sales have in the past been assessed under section 67(4)(e), and the development or division work on that land was of a type to which the new proviso applies, would need reassessment to give effect to this retrospective amendment.

However, it is believed that there are few, if any, cases which could come within this category since, until the ANZAMCO case, it was not the Department's practice to take cases under section 67(4)(e) in circumstances that involved farm development expenditure.

### _**Subsections (4) and (5) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - Consequential amendments to subsection (2)**_

These subsections make amendments to sections 67(4)(f) and 67(5) which are consequential to the introduction of the new paragraph (ba) in section 67(4), as introduced by subsection (2) of this amendment.

Subsection (4) makes it clear that paragraph 67(4)(f) (profits from major subdivisional developments) cannot be applied to profits on land sales which are covered by any of the preceding paragraphs of section 67(4), including the new paragraph (ba).

Subsection (5) extends the exemption given by section 67(5), from provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of section 67(4), in respect of business premises and domestic dwellings so that it applies the new paragraph (ha) also.

These amendments are to apply with respect to sales of land made on or after the day on which this Amendment Act received the Governor - General's assent (16 December 1983).

### _**Subsections (6) and (7) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - Farm Subdivisions**_

These subsections amend sections 67(6) and section 67(9) respectively, in relation to the exemptions which these sections provide in respect of subdivisions of land used in farming or agricultural businesses.

*   _**Section 67(6)** \- "rezoning betterment"_

Section 67(6) provides an exemption from the provisions of section 67(4)(d) which deals with land sold within 10 years of acquisition when at least 20 percent of the gain on sale is due to a rezoning betterment factor. That exemption applies, in part, to land acquired and used, or intended to be used, by the taxpayer primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by him.

*   _**Section 67(9)** - Division of farm land into economic farm units_

Section 67(9) provided previously an exemption from the provisions of sections 67(4)(e) and 67(4)(f) applicable to profits from land sold pursuant to undertakings or schemes involving the development or division (of more than a minor nature) into lots of that land where that development or division work commenced within 10 years of the date of acquisition of that land.

The exemption under section 67**(9)** applies to a **division** of farm land into units, where:

1.  The land that, after division, is sold was, immediately before that division, occupied or used by the taxpayer primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by him; and
2.  Each lot resulting from the division is itself an economic farm unit; and
3.  Each lot was sold for use in a farming or agricultural business.

*   _**The amendments now made to section 67(6) and section 67(9)**_

The amendments made by subsections (6) and (7) of section 11 of this Amendment Act **extend** the exemption, in each case, so that it applies not only to land acquired and used by the taxpayer, but also to land acquired and used by **the taxpayer's spouse or by both the taxpayer and his spouse** primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer or by his spouse or by both the taxpayer and his spouse.

*   _**Application of the section 67(6) amendment made by subsection (6) of section 11 of this Amendment Act**_

The amendment made by subsection (6), to section 67(6), applies to sales or other disposals of land made on or after 23 October 1974, the date from which the provisions of what is now section 67(4)(d) first applied under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954.

*   _**Application of the section 67(9) amendment made by subsection (7) of section 11 of this Amendment Act**_

Similarly, the amendment made by subsection (7), to section 67(9), applies to sales or other disposals of land made on or after 10 August 1973, the date from which the provisions of what are now sections 67(4)(e) and 67(4)(f) first applied under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954.

As both amendments are retrospective, taxpayers should apply for reassessments to be made where profits from the sale of land have previously been regarded as assessable under section 67(4)(d), 67(4)(e) or 67(4)(f) and which are not assessable by reason of the amendments made by subsections (6) and (7) of section 11 of this Amendment Act.

**Subsection (8) of section 11 of this Amendment Act** \-**Mortgagee Sales**

This subsection adds a new subsection (14) to section 67 of the principal Act.

At present, the provisions of sections 67(4)(b), 67(4)(c) and 67(4)(d) (and also the new section 67(4)(ba) as added by subsection (2) of this amendment) can only be applied in respect of land sold or disposed of by the taxpayer.

This amendment states that, for the purposes of those references to sales or disposals of land by the taxpayer, that phrase is deemed to include a sale or disposal of land by a mortgagee made on the default of the taxpayer under the mortgage to which that mortgagee is a party. That is, the mere fact that the land is actually sold by a mortgagee and not by the taxpayer himself will no longer exclude such sales from the application of sections 67(4)(b), 67(4)(c) and 67(4)(d) (and new subsection 67(4)(ba)).

It should be noted that a similar amendment has been made to section 129 of the principal Act in the new subsection (14) of that section (see section 20(3) of this Amendment Act).

*   _**Application of this "mortgagee sale" amendment**_

This amendment is to apply with respect to sales or other disposals of land made on or after 1 April 1983.

### _**Subsections (9) to (14) of section 11 of this Amendment Act - Application Dates**_

These subsections all deal with the application dates of the amendments previously explained in the commentary on this section.

### Section 12 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees

Section 68 of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides that where a qualifying retirement, redundancy, or loss of office payment has been made it attracts tax in the following manner:

*   Five percent of the "specified sum" is taxable plus the amount of the payment in excess of the specified sum.

The "specified sum" is, where the taxpayer has been employed for 10 or more years, the average remuneration received over the three years immediately preceding retirement, redundancy, etc. Where the period of employment is less than 10 years the average remuneration is multiplied by the total number of years employed and then divided by 10.

Section 12 makes amendments to section 68 designed to overcome problems associated with:

*   Early retirement;
*   Part - time employment;
*   Deemed retirement on death;
*   Payments to Directors;
*   Accrued Annual and Long Service Leave;
*   Mergers/Takeovers.

_**Subsection (1)**_ \- repeals the definition of the expression "appropriate retiring age".

With the provision for favourable tax treatment of payments made on redundancy and in respect of severance, the view that the concessional treatment of lump sum payments under section 68 was a reward for lengthy service is no longer relevant. An employee who retires at say 55 may have had a working life of 40 years and is no less deserving of the concessional treatment than an employee who retires at 60 and who may have worked for only 10 years. The Government considered that a "retiring age" criterion should no longer be a determinant of eligibility for the concessional tax treatment.

IT MUST BE NOTED THAT FOR THE CONCESSION TO APPLY THERE MUST STILL BE A "RETIREMENT" WITHIN THE NORMAL ACCEPTED MEANING OF THE WORD. PAYMENTS MADE ON RESIGNATION DO NOT APPLY.

_**Subsection (2)**_ \- removes the criterion that to qualify for the tax concession the retirement allowance must be in respect of "full time" employment or service.

The Government considered that retiring allowances paid to part - time workers should fall to be favourably considered under section 68. There was inequity in the fact that the tax concession was available to executive directors but not to non - executive directors of companies. The removal of the "full time" criterion restores equity between these two groups.

_**Subsection (3)**_ \- removes the "full time" and "appropriate retiring age" criteria from section 68(4) which deals with redundancy.

_**Subsection (4)**_ \- inserts a new subsection (4A) in section 68 to cover the situation of death in service.

In order to qualify for the tax concession in terms of section 68, lump sum payments by way of bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance must be made on the occasion of "retirement". Accordingly there has been no authority to grant the concessional tax treatment in respect of a payment made following the death of an employee. This amendment ensures that the legislation applies in those circumstances.

_**Subsection (5)**_

1.  Repeals section 68(5)(a) which excluded, from the concession, payments made by a company pursuant to its articles of association to any of its directors.
2.  Inserts a new subsection (5)(a) to exclude from the tax concession payments made to a director who receives the payment on behalf of his professional firm. This exclusion covers the situation where a director is a member of, say, a professional partnership where his directors' fees, etc, are paid into the partnership.

_**Subsection (6)**_ \- excludes from section 68(5) the "full time" criterion.

_**Subsection (7)**_

1.  Inserts in section 68(5) a new exclusion for payments in respect of rights which are not dependent on retirement.

In a recent case, in addition to receiving a retiring allowance an employee received a lump sum payment in lieu of long service leave to which he was entitled prior to retirement, but had not taken.

The Court of Appeal took the broad view that the payment was a "bonus" (being a payment in addition to the regular salary and allowances received over the years) and that as it was paid "on the occasion of retirement", it was a retiring allowance.

This amendment makes it clear that payments which do not arise directly from "retirement" do not qualify for the favourable tax treatment afforded by section 68.

1.  Inserts in section 68(5) a further exclusion, this time in respect of payments made as a consequence of a merger or takeover.

The Government considers that the application of the five percent of "retiring" allowances basis to employees who receive lump sums in a merger/takeover situation gives an unwarranted advantage. Such employees who continue in the same positions after the merger or takeover cannot logically be regarded as having retired. Lump sum payments made in such circumstances or where the employee is re - employed in the same overall organisation within six months (183 days) after the merger/takeover in substantially the same position as held previously are to be taxed in full.

_**Subsections (8) to (11)**_ \- make consequential amendments.

_**Subsection (12)**_ \- provides that the amendments are to apply in respect of payments made on or after 1 April 1984.

### Section 13 - Power to Exempt Employees' Allowances

In last year's Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2), a new section 73 was substituted in the principal Act. As in the case of the previous section 73, the new section enables the Commissioner to make determinations as to the portion of an employer/employee allowance (if any) that can be regarded as reimbursing and thereby exempt from tax.

Amongst the changes incorporated in the new section were provisions dealing with the application date of such determinations. In particular, section 73(5) provides that determinations are to apply from a date one month after the date of the Commissioner's written determination. However, notwithstanding that subsection, section 73(6) permits a deferral of that application date in certain cases.

In last year's legislation, although the deferral was stated to apply to all allowances paid under the provisions of an award, collective agreement or other instrument (as defined in the Wage Adjustment Regulations 1974), the tests specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of subsection (6) of section 75 to be applied in determining the deferred application date made references to only instruments **registered** with the Arbitration Court.

It has since been ascertained that many of the types of instrument in respect of which it was the intention to allow deferrals, were not specifically catered for in paragraph (e). In particular, some types of instrument were not registered but merely filed with the Arbitration Court while others were registered with the various industrial tribunals rather than the Arbitration Court.

Accordingly, this section substitutes a new paragraph (e) in section 75(6), which widens the types of industrial instruments to which deferrals can be applied to now include those instruments which are:

*   Made or approved or registered by the Arbitration Court, the Waterfront Industry Tribunal, the Agricultural Tribunal, the Aircrew Industrial Tribunal, any tribunal within the meaning of the State Services Conditions of Employment Act 1977 or any other tribunal.
*   Filed or required to be filed with the Arbitration Court pursuant to regulation 8 of the Wage Adjustment Regulations 1974. (In the main, these are the various "in - house" agreements negotiated between an employer and his employees. Note the use of the words "required to be filed", in recognition of the fact that despite the "filing" requirement many of these types of instrument are not actually filed with the Arbitration Court.)
*   Made pursuant to a decision of a compulsory conference or a committee of inquiry appointed under the Industrial Relations Act 1973.
*   Made as an Order in Council or regulation.

### Section 14 - Amounts Remitted to be Taken into Account in Computing Income

This section repeals and substitutes section 78 of the principal Act. Section 78 provided formerly that where any expenditure or loss incurred by a taxpayer has been allowed as a deduction in calculating his assessable income for any income year and subsequently the taxpayer's liability in respect of that expenditure is (wholly or partly) remitted, his assessable income for that income year is to be increased by the amount remitted, and subject to tax accordingly.

For several years an equivalent provision has been contained in section 188 (carry - forward of losses). That provision was (and still is), however, more extensive than the former section 78. Accordingly, section 78 (as now substituted) has been brought into line with section 188 by being made applicable to both "remitted" liabilities and "cancelled" liabilities and by incorporating the provisions that a liability is deemed to have been "cancelled" to the extent that:

1.  The taxpayer has been released from that liability by the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1908, the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1955, or the deed of composition with his creditors.
2.  The liability has become irrecoverable or unenforceable because of lapse of time (statute - barred).

### Section 15 - Spreading of Excess Income Derived on Sale of Livestock Where Unduly Low Standard Values or Nil Value Adopted

Section 93 of the principal Act in part applies where the Commissioner is satisfied that, upon the sale of a substantial part of the livestock of a farming business, the assessable income of the taxpayer is, by reason of the adoption of standard or nil values, increased to an amount that substantially exceeds his average assessable income.

The section provides for that excess to be spread over the year of sale and any previous income years (not exceeding 3) and assessed for income tax accordingly.

A recent review of the nature of bailments of livestock concluded that while leases or bailments of livestock constitute a business they do not constitute a "farming business". On a strict interpretation of section 93 there was accordingly no spreading relief available on the sale of bailed livestock.

The amendment to section 93 provides that the spreading relief (back) is to be made available where there has been a sale of leased or bailed livestock. The taxpayer must have disposed of a substantial part of all of the livestock he has bailed and that sale must have increased his assessable income to an amount substantially exceeding his average assessable income from bailing livestock. Average assessable income is determined having regard to the three years immediately preceding the disposal (or the period in which assessable income has been derived from bailing, if less than 3 years.)

### Section 16 - Payments of Excessive Salary or Wages, or Allocation of Excessive Share of Profits or Losses, to Relative Employed by or in Partnership with Taxpayer

Section 97 enables the Commissioner, in certain circumstances, to allocate excessive salary or share of profits for tax purposes between the partners in a partnership in such manner as he considers reasonable. Section 16 of the Amendment Act extends the scope of the section to enable him to allocate shares of losses in similar circumstances.

Section 16 also makes two minor amendments to section 97 to bring the wording into line with the new section 167B (please refer to comment on section 28 of the Amendment Act). The word "salary" has been changed to "salary or wages" in subsections (1) and (4)(e) of section 97, and the words "contract of employment or engagement", in subsection (1) have been amended to read "contract of service, employment or engagement".

### Section 17 - Limitation of Deduction for Expenditure to Amount at Risk

This section amends section 106A, which was inserted by section 15 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982. That section applies to certain limited recourse loans made to taxpayers to assist in the financing of the acquisition, production or marketing of a film. The legislation enacted last year applied only to limited recourse loans made to the **taxpayer** and did not apply where that type of loan was made to an associated person of the taxpayer and then passed on to the taxpayer as a normal commercial loan.

Section 17 of this Amendment Act includes, within the definition of "limited recourse loan" in section 106A, all loans received by a taxpayer which have been funded by means of a limited recourse loan made to an associated person of the taxpayer. It applies to all such loans made on or after 1 April 1983.

It should be noted that section 106A applies only to films commenced on or after 6 August 1982. The tax treatment of loans used invest in "pre - Budget" films will not be affected by this amendment.

### Section 18 - Additional Depreciation Allowance for Newly Constructed Private Rental Housing

### _**Introduction**_

This section inserts a new section 114C in the principal Act and gives effect to the Budget announcement that in order to stimulate the supply of private rental accommodation an accelerated depreciation allowance would be given for the first five years on newly constructed houses used exclusively for rental. The allowance is equal to, and additional to, the ordinary depreciation allowed by the Commissioner under section 108 of the principal Act.

The section also provides that where any taxpayer acquires any rental dwellinghouse in accordance with a matrimonial agreement, as defined in section 43 of this Amendment Act, the allowance may continue to apply in relation to the transferee (see later).

_**Subsection (1)**_ \- Inserts the new section 114C.

### _**Section 114C(1)**_ \- Definitions

**"Rental dwellinghouse"** - The main points in this definition are:

*   The dwellinghouse must be **new** (as defined).
*   The dwellinghouse must be owned for **use as a residence** .

Residence includes a house, flat, townhouse, home unit, unit of a multi - unit building or other similar dwelling.

*   The dwellinghouse which is let can be:
    1.  part of a new building, eg, a Granny flat or a 2 - flat property where the owner lives in one and lets the other, or
    2.  a new part of an existing building, eg, a self contained flat attached to the owner's own residence.

Where the dwellinghouse is a **part** of a building the determination of the cost price of the rental unit will depend on the facts of each case. Taxpayers should produce evidence to substantiate the cost attributed.

However if this is not available a pro - rata basis may be acceptable, eg, total cost $80,000 - rental unit is 1/4 area of total building - depreciation would be allowed on $20,000.

*   The dwellinghouse or the part, as referred to above, which qualifies for the allowance includes appurtenances, ie, garage, garden shed, etc, which belong to the dwellinghouse or the part of the building that comprises the dwellinghouse.

"**New** " - means "not having previously been occupied". For example, a house which was constructed in, say, 1979, yet has never been occupied will be regarded as new. On the other hand, the definition debars a dwellinghouse which has been renovated or a large home which has been reconstructed and divided into flats.

**"Depreciation period"**

1\. This defines the period for which the additional depreciation is allowable. The period is the **shorter** of:

*   Sixty months commencing with the letting date (as defined).
*   The period commencing with the letting date and ending on the day immediately preceding the day on which the rental dwellinghouse (as defined) is occupied **otherwise** than for the deriving of rental income.

2\. There is a maximum period for the allowance. This is five calendar years, or 60 months, from the date, after 28 July 1983, the dwellinghouse (having previously been unoccupied) is first used by the owner for the deriving of rents.

If at any time the dwellinghouse is occupied otherwise than for the deriving of rental income, the allowance ceases at that point and does not recommence even if the dwellinghouse is re - let at a later date.

This latter provision excludes the new holiday home which, having firstly been let is used by the owner at any time (however short the period) during the year. However, if the holiday home has not been previously occupied and is let for private rental purposes prior to the owner ever having resided in the home, for any period, then the period in which the home is first let will qualify for the allowance.

**"Letting date"** - This definition is divided into two parts, and prescribes the date which is the starting point for purposes of the "depreciation period".

**Part (a)** - specifies that where the taxpayer acquires a rental dwellinghouse (**otherwise** than by way of transfer under a "matrimonial agreement") or erects it, the "letting date" is the date on which the rental dwellinghouse, having **never before** been occupied, is first used for the deriving of rental income.

In this context a rental dwellinghouse will be first so **used** in the income year in which it is actually first let. Depending on the facts, that use might be considered as having started on the first day on which, in that income year, the rental dwellinghouse was first firmly offered for letting, even if it was not actually let until some time later in that income year.

The "letting date" cannot be a date earlier than 29 July 1983 (the day after Budget night), nor later than 31 March 1987.

It is not necessary that the rental property be **constructed** after 29 July 1983. If the new dwellinghouse has been constructed and completed prior to Budget night, but is first made available for private rental purposes after 29 July 1983, then the allowance will apply.

**Example** : If a newly constructed property is first available to be let, and is offered for letting, as a private residence on 20 November 1983 and, is first let on 1 January 1984 the owner will be allowed to claim the allowance for the period (maximum of 60 months) the property continues to be used for that purpose throughout the period up to 20 November 1988, ie, the owner can claim the accelerated rate for the:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Year ending 31 March 1984 for | 5 months |
| Year ending 31 March 1985 for | 12 months |
| Year ending 31 March 1986 for | 12 months |
| Year ending 31 March 1987 for | 12 months |
| Year ending 31 March 1988 for | 12 months |
| Year ending 31 March 1989 for | 7 months |
|     | 60 months |

The "letting date" in this example is 20 November 1983, the date of first "use" of the rental dwellinghouse for the purpose of deriving rental income.

**Part (b)** - specifies that where a rental dwellinghouse is acquired by a person in accordance with a transfer under a "matrimonial agreement", the "letting date" applicable to the transferee is to be the same "letting date" as applied in the first instance to the transferor. This will enable the transferee to gain the benefit of the allowance for the remainder of the depreciation period.

**"Rent"** defines rent as being from any lease and includes any premium or other consideration for the lease."

### _**Section 114C(2)**_

Provides that where the Commissioner is satisfied that a taxpayer has acquired or erected a rental dwellinghouse, the first occupant of which is a lessee, and that the taxpayer derives rental income from the rental dwellinghouse, he may allow a deduction of an amount equal to and additional to the amount of depreciation that would normally be allowable under section 108 of the principal Act, ie, double the existing depreciation rates. The new rates will therefore be:

| Types of Building | Existing Deprecuation Rates Under Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (on cost) | Additional Depreciation Rate Under New Section 114C (on cost) | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. Reinforced concrete Throughout, steel or reinforced concrete framed with brick walls or other permanent materials. | 1%  | 1%  | 2%  |
| 2\. Brick, stone or concrete walled buildings without steel or reinforced concrete frames, stucco, steeltex or similar construction with wooden frame. | 2%  | 2%  | 4%  |
| 3\. Other wooden framed buildings | 2 1/2% | 2 1/2% | 5%  |

The proviso to subsection (2) provides that where the first occupant of a rental dwellinghouse that is let, is acquired by a taxpayer (transferee) from a transferor by way of a transfer in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", is a lessee, that first occupant of that rental dwellinghouse will be deemed to be a lessee in relation to the taxpayer (transferee) also.

This proviso, in conjunction with section 111A (as introduced by section 54 of this Amendment Act) ensures that, provided all the other tests are satisfied from time to time by the transferee, the additional allowance will continue to be allowed, to the **transferee** .

_**Note**_ : Under section 111A a rental dwellinghouse transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" will retain, in the hands of the transferee, the same "new" building status that it had in the hands of the transferor.

### _**Section 114C(3)**_

This subsection lists the types of buildings which are excluded from the additional allowance. They are:

1.  Any building or a part of any building which is used for the purpose of conducting any:
    1.  boarding house;
    2.  convalescent home;
    3.  nursing home;
    4.  rest home;
    5.  guest home;

*   or any other similar type of establishment.

2.  Any building referred to in section 112(2)(e) of the principal Act, ie, employee accommodation provided by the employer.
3.  Any building or a part of any building used for the purpose of providing accommodation to the travelling public. This will exclude hotels, motels, cabins, holiday homes, or other similar types of establishment.
4.  Any building or a part of any building where that building or the part has been supplied by a company for use for the accommodation of a shareholder of the company or the use for the accommodation of the spouse or any child of any such shareholder.
5.  Any building that is an appurtenance, ie, garage, garden shed, etc, to any building or a in paragraphs (a) to (d) above.

_**Subsection (2)**_ (of section 18 of the Amendment Act)

This is a consequential amendment to section 117(1) of the principal Act. It inserts in paragraph (i) of the second proviso a reference to section 114C.

This amendment ensures that where a rental dwellinghouse is disposed of, there will be no recovery of the additional depreciation allowance.

### Section 19 - Deduction of Certain Expenditure incurred by Persons Engaged in Aquaculture

This section amends section 128 of the principal Act by:

1.  Extending the deductible kinds of development expenditure to include expenditure incurred in respect of sea cage - salmon farming.
2.  Making it clear that the various types of expenditure deductible in respect of freshwater fish farming are expressed in the alternative and not cumulatively.

### _**Subsection (1) - Sea - Cage Salmon Farming**_

This inserts, into section 128 a new paragraph (bb). It provides that any taxpayer engaged in the business of sea - cage salmon farming in New Zealand will be able to deduct the following kinds of capital expenditure incurred in that business in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1983 and ending on or before the terminating date, 31 March 1986. (Refer section 42.)

1.  The acquisition, preparation and mooring of pontoons, rafts or other floating structures for securing or protecting cages or other containment vessels; or
2.  The acquisition, preparation and placing of equipment or structures, including tanks, cages, nets, or other vessels, for the containment of live salmon; or
3.  The acquisition and placing of ropes and buoys used in the breeding or maturing of salmon.

### _**Subsection (2) - Freshwater Fish Farming**_

A strict legal interpretation on the provisions of paragraph (c) of section 128(2) was that the use of the word "and" in the various subparagraphs meant that the taxpayer had to incur all of the types of expenditure mentioned in a particular subparagraph to qualify for the incentive. For example, a taxpayer could not qualify in respect of expenditure incurred in constructing access paths in terms of subparagraph (v) unless he also incurred expenditure on the construction of walls, embankments, walkways and service paths.

The incongruous requirements that resulted from these legal consequences necessitated changes in order to make the requirements of that paragraph reasonable. This subsection makes those changes, to give freshwater fish farmers the same "flexibility" of development expenditure combinations as is accorded to other forms of aquaculture under the other paragraphs of section 128(2).

### _**Subsection 3**_

This subsection is consequential to the inclusion of sea - cage salmon farming in section 128. It amends section 188A (loss incurred in specified activities) of the principal Act by including sea - cage salmon farming in the definition of the expression "specified activity". This means that the loss containment provisions in section 188A will apply to the activity of sea - cage salmon farming in the same way that they apply to each of the separate specified activities of rock oyster, mussel, scallop, and freshwater fish farming.

The above amendments apply with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1983.

### Section 20 - Revised Assessments where Land or Fish Farms or Certain Assets Sold Within Ten Years of Acquisition

This section makes several changes to section 129 of the principal Act which provides for recovery of interest and development expenditure deducted for income tax purposes where land or certain assets are sold within 10 years of the date of acquisition. Under section 129 the amount of interest and development expenditure deductions that can be recovered is limited to the extent of any "profit" on sale of the land. The changes are discussed below under the relevant subsections.

### _**Subsection (1) - Determination of Profit on Sale of Land**_

This subsection repeals paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (2) of section 129 and substitutes new paragraphs (c) and (d). Paragraph (c) relates to sales of land without the improvements thereon while paragraph (d) relates to sales of land together with the improvements.

The two new paragraphs provide that in calculating the "profit" on sale of the land, a taxpayer may take into account all expenditure incurred in purchasing, holding and selling the land **that has not been allowed as a deduction against his assessable income** .

The types of expenditure that can be taken into account are specified in the legislation and include:

*   "Any expenditure incurred in acquiring the land". This would include valuation fee, solicitors charges, stamp duty, etc.
*   "Any expenditure incurred in acquiring, installing or effecting improvements" - self - explanatory.
*   "Any expenditure by way of interest". This is interest (that has not been allowed as a deduction) which could arise, for instance, where the Department has apportioned or limited deductions against rental income.
*   "Any expenditure by way of rates, land tax, insurance premiums ..." - self - explanatory - see comments above in relation to "interest" not allowed as a deduction.
*   "Any expenditure in the selling or other disposing of the land". This would include legal fees, land agents fees, etc.

It must be remembered that this section relates only to land from which assessable income was derived. For example where land is used partly for business and partly for private purposes, when deducting expenditure to calculate the "profit" on disposal the expenditure must relate only to that **part** of the land from which assessable income was derived.

### _**Subsection (2) - Income Year**_

This subsection merely replaces reference to the word "year" with the words "income year" so as to be consistent with the standard phraseology used elsewhere in the principal Act and to ensure uniformity within section 129 itself.

### _**Subsection (3)**_

Adds six new subsections to section 129 which are outlined below. Although subsection (10) is initially repealed you will notice that it is reinstated, unchanged, as subsection (16).

### **1\. Property Let While Owner Residing Elsewhere**

The new subsection (10) gives effect to the Budget announcement that section 129 will not apply, to recover any previously - deducted interest, on the sale of a person's home which is rented while that person is residing elsewhere and has not purchased and occupied another residence while the first is being let. The intention of this amendment is to ensure that people are not penalised when, for a variety of reasons (usually employment related), they lease their home while temporarily residing elsewhere.

This subsection applies to any sale of land within 10 years of the date of acquisition where the land that is vacated by the taxpayer has:

*   been used, by the taxpayer solely as the site of his own residence and occupied, by him solely as his principal place of abode, and
*   been leased, subsequent to vacating, by the taxpayer to derive assessable income from rents at some time during that 10 year period.

Interest allowed as a deduction in calculating the taxpayer's assessable income from renting out this former residence will not be recoverable under section 129, provided that during that rental period the taxpayer has not acquired, **otherwise than by lease** , other land which he next occupies as his residence and principal place of abode. In other words, this concession (of non - recovery of interest) will not apply to interest incurred after the date the taxpayer **buys** his next residence and principal place of abode.

There is one **exception** to this rule. It is that, provided when he buys his next residence the taxpayer is taking and continues to take every reasonable step to secure as quick a sale as possible of his former residence, the concession will apply to interest incurred during the period from the vacating of the former residence until the date it is ultimately sold.

**Example 1**

Taxpayer posted to another city, in the course of his employment, and leases his home until he is able to purchase a suitable home in that other city.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| First home purchased | 10 June 1976 |
| Home vacated | 26 September 1983 |
| Lease of first home commenced | 1 October 1983 |
| First home sold | 20 September 1984 |
| Next home purchased | 27 September 1984 |

Any deductions for interest would normally be recovered as the former home has been sold within 10 years of purchase. However, the new subsection (10) exempts any interest allowed as a deduction from rental income for the period of time 1 October 1983 to 20 September 1984 (the full term of the lease) as the taxpayer had not purchased another residence to be used as his permanent place of abode during that time.

**Example 2**

Taxpayer on overseas leave for 12 months and leases his home. On return to New Zealand he purchases a new home, continuing to lease the original home, and making strenuous efforts to sell it.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| First home purchased | 10 June 1976 |
| Home vacated | 26 September 1983 |
| Lease of first home commenced | 1 October 1983 |
| Next home purchased | 27 September 1984 |
| Lease of first home ceased | 31 October 1984 |
| First home sold | 1 November 1984 |

As the original home has been sold within 10 years, the recovery provisions would normally apply to any interest deducted. However, the new subsection (10) will exempt any interest allowed as a deduction for the period 1 October 1983 to 31 October 1984 when the lease ceased, as the taxpayer is entitled to the "_exceptional_" concession already referred to.

**Example 3**

Taxpayer on overseas leave for 12 months and leases his home. On return to New Zealand he purchases a new home, continuing to lease the first home but not deciding until a year later to sell the first home.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| First home purchased | 10 June 1976 |
| Home vacated | 26 September 1983 |
| Lease of first home commenced | 1 October 1983 |
| Next home purchased | 27 September 1984 |
| First home sold | 10 September 1985. |

As the first home has been sold within 10 years, the recovery provisions would normally apply to any interest deducted. However, the new subsection (10) will exempt any interest allowed as a deduction for the period 1 October 1983 (commencement of lease) to 27 September 1984 (next home purchased).

The subsection contains a proviso so that the concession will not apply where the Commissioner is of the opinion that, having regard to:

*   The date of acquisition of the land that is sold.
*   The date of vacating that land.
*   The length of time the taxpayer occupied the land.
*   Any other relevant circumstances.
*   The tenor of subsection (10),

the occupying of the land was of a temporary nature and was **entered into to obtain an unfair advantage for tax purposes** .

There are a number of points which need to be clarified. They are:

### _**(1) What is considered a "residence" and "principal place of abode"?**_

A residence is a house, flat, townhouse, home unit or similar dwelling.

"Residence" also means the taxpayer must **reside** in the home - there is no time limit, however see (3) below.

"Principal place of abode" means it must be the taxpayers "**principal** " as opposed to secondary residence, (ie, a holiday home would not qualify as it is not a taxpayer's **principal** place of abode).

### _**(2) What does the Commissioner consider are "such steps as are necessary to secure with expedition the sale ..."**_

Each case would have to be treated on its own merits; however, in general the property would have to be advertised for sale and at a realistic market price.

The "steps" taken would be the normal procedure taken when selling a house but the legislation includes the words "with expedition" which are important.

It would in many cases not be unreasonable to expect the property to be sold within a maximum of three months of being advertised. Depending on the general state of the property market, local conditions and the residence itself if a property remained unsold after that period consideration would have to be given to recovering any deductions for interest from the date the taxpayer purchased his new home.

### _**(3) Under what circumstances would the proviso be applied to deny a concession?**_

The proviso has been included to ensure a taxpayer does not manipulate his circumstances to defeat the recovery provisions, for example by purchasing a property with the intention of leasing it but residing in it for a short period prior to leasing.

In determining whether the "occupying of that land was of a temporary nature and was entered into to obtain an unfair advantage for tax purposes", the following points are relevant:

*   For what length of time was the home resided in by the taxpayer as his principal place of abode?
*   Why did the taxpayer vacate the property, (eg, work related transfer?)
*   Why was another residence not purchased shortly after vacation of the first home?
*   Has the taxpayer owned and let other rental properties in the past?
*   What is his past history of home occupancy?
*   Do the circumstances of the taxpayer fit the "tenor of this subsection"? The subsection was introduced so as to not penalise a taxpayer who temporarily leases his own home. When deciding each case, the Department will have regard to this aspect.

### **2\. Interest Allowed Against Home Study not Recoverable**

As enacted last year, section 129 permitted the recovery of interest allowed as a deduction as an employment related expense under home study expenses.

The new subsection (11) amends section 129 to deem interest allowed as a deduction as employment related expenditure under clause 7 of the Fourth Schedule (home study expenses) to have been not so allowed as a deduction (for the purposes of section 129) and so not subject to recovery.

### **3\. Compulsory Acquisition (new subsections (12) and (13))**

Subsection 9(a) of section 129 exempts from the recovery provision land that has been compulsorily acquired (or which if had not been sold, would have been compulsorily acquired) by the Crown or any Public or Local Authority.

The new subsections (12) and (13) qualify this exemption by providing that where:

*   "replacement land" is purchased within 12 months of possession being given to the Crown, etc, of the "original land", and
*   the Commissioner is satisfied the replacement land will be used primarily and principally in:
    1.  The carrying on of a business similar to the business carried on by the taxpayer on the original land, or
    2.  the deriving of income of the same class of income derived on the original land,

the replacement land is deemed to have the same acquisition date as the original land that was compulsorily acquired.

### _**What is a "similar business"?**_

When deciding what is a similar business a certain degree of flexibility will be allowed. Although retail premises should be replaced by other retail premises, a farm by a farm, rental property by rental property, etc, the nature of that business need not be exactly the same as previously, (ie, a hardware shop could be replaced by an electrical appliance shop or a horticultural farm by a pastoral farm).

If a taxpayer was originally in business on his own account and, following the compulsory acquisition of his business property, he subsequently goes into business in partnership on "replacement land", the provisions of the subsection will apply to any sale of his share of the partnership land **provided** the nature of his business being conducted in the partnership is primarily and principally the same as his original business. It should be noted that the exemption for replacement land will not be available to other partners unless they too had their previous business land compulsorily acquired and were previously carrying on a similar business activity.

### **4\. Mortgagee Sale**

Subsection (14) provides that a sale by a mortgagee of land in consequence of the default of the taxpayer under a mortgage shall be deemed to be a sale by the taxpayer.

### **5\. Accounting Year**

Subsection (15) is the normal provision for dealing with an accounting year that does not end on 31 March.

### **6\. Arrangements**

Subsection (16) re - enacts the former subsection (10) of section 129, relating to arrangements giving undue favourable advantage to the taxpayer.

### _**Subsection (4) - Application Date**_

Subsection (4) provides that this section is to apply to any sale of land on or after 1 April 1983.

### Section 21 - Farmers Expenditure on Tree Planting

This section amends section 134 of the principal Act which allows deduction, in the year incurred, of expenditure by **farmers** on non - commercial plantings of trees to provide shelter, prevent erosion, etc.

Under the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1981, farmers can be given by the Forest Service grants for the establishment and maintenance of farm - protection plantings that are designed to be, also, for eventual **commercial** utilisation. Section 134 was amended accordingly in 1981, to provide that the current - year deduction which it affords does **not** apply to expenditure for which a forestry encouragement grant is given.

The 1981 regulations have been superseded, from 1 April 1983, by the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1983. Section 21 of this Amendment Act accordingly amends section 134 to include also a reference to those latter Regulations.

Section 21 applies from and including the **1982/83** income year, in view of the fact that taxpayers with **late** balance dates may receive, under the 1983 Regulations, grants for expenditure that, although incurred after 31 March 1983, is incurred in their 1982/83 income year.

### Section 22 - Expenditure in Respect of Forestry Encouragement Agreements under Forestry Encouragement Act 1962

This section amends section 135(1) of the principal Act which specifies the permissible deductions of forest establishment, and maintenance expenditure, interest payments, and loan repayments, in the case of taxpayers who planted commercial forests with the aid of loans from the Forest Service under the Forestry Encouragement Act 1962.

Over the past few years some taxpayers who originally established their forests under that loans scheme have converted to grants, in relation to those plantings, under the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1970 (which have since been amended in 1981 and again in 1983). Accordingly, in 1977 a proviso to section 135(1) was inserted to ensure that deduction is not allowed, under section 135(1), of expenditure for which a forestry encouragement grant has been given by the Forest Service.

Section 22 of this Amendment Act now adds, to that proviso, references to the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1981 (which superseded the 1970 Regulations) and the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1983 (which supersede the 1981 Regulations).

This section applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1981/82 income year and subsequent income years, in view of the inclusion, in the proviso, of the reference to the 1981 Regulations.

### Section 23 - Donations by Public Companies

This section amends section 147 of the principal Act which provides a deduction for donations made by public companies (including private companies which are controlled by public companies, and public and local authorities) to qualifying charitable organisations (being those listed in section 56A(2) of the principal Act).

Section 147 contains two restrictions on the maximum amount of deduction claimable. These are:

**(a) Donations to Any One Donee**

Prior to this amendment, the maximum deduction allowable in respect of the total of all donations made by a public company in an income year to any one donee was $1,000.

This amendment increases this maximum from $1,000 to $4,000 with application to all donations made **on or after 1 april 1983** .

**(b) Donations to All Donees**

The maximum deduction allowable in respect of the total of all donations made by a public company in an income year, (ie, to all donees) is limited to the greater of:

1.  1,000,
2.  5 percent of assessable income of the company (computed before allowing deductions under sections 146 or 147).

It is important to note that this "overall" maximum remains unchanged.

As amended, section 147 applies to public companies as follows:

1.  **Public Companies with 31 March Balance Dates**
    1.  1983 and prior income years:
        *   In loss - maximum section 147 deduction $1,000.
        *   Assessable income up to and including $20,000 - maximum deduction $1,000.
        *   Assessable income of more than $20,000 - maximum deduction is 5 percent of assessable income but limited to $1,000 in respect of each donee.
    2.  1984 and future income years:
        *   In loss - maximum section 147 deduction $1,000. (Note the new $4,000 "each donee" maximum has no effect.)
        *   Assessable income up to and including $20,000 - maximum deduction $1,000. (Again the new maximum has no effect.)
        *   Assessable income of more than $20,000 - maximum deduction is 5 percent of assessable income but limited to $4,000 in respect of each donee. (Note if assessable income is less than $80,000, the full effect of the new $4,000 maximum for any one donee cannot be gained.)
2.  **Public Companies with Balance Dates other than 31 March**
    1.  1982 and prior income years:
        *   As for public companies with 31 March balance dates.
    2.  1983 income year:
        
        **Early balance dates (1 October 1982 - 30 March 1983).**
        
        *   As for public companies with 31 March balance dates. (See A(i) above.)
        
        **Late balance dates (1 April 1983** \- **30 September 1983).**
        
        *   See "transitional provisions" below.
    3.  1984 income year:
        
        **Early balance dates (1 October 1983 - 30 March 1984).**
        
        *   See "transitional provisions" below.
        
        **Late balance dates (1 April 1984 - 30 September 1984).**
        
        *   As for public companies with 31 March balance dates. (See A(2) above.)
    4.  1985 and future income years:
        *   As for public companies with 31 March balance dates.

### _**Transitional Provisions**_

Since the increased maximum deduction for donations to any one donee applies to all donations made to any one donee on or after 1 April 1983, transitional provisions (contained in section 23(2) of this Amendment Act;) will apply to public companies with balance dates other than 31 March.

In particular, the 1983 (late balance dates) and 1984 (early balance dates) income years are affected. In respect of those years, the following provisions apply:

1.  In respect of all gifts made to any one donee on or before March 1983, the maximum deduction is $1,000.
2.  In respect of all gifts made to any one donee on or after 1 April 1983, the maximum deduction is $4,000.
3.  In respect of all gifts made to any one donee in the accounting year that transverses 31 March 1983 the maximum deduction is $4,000.
4.  In respect of all gifts made in the accounting year that transverses 31 March 1983 the maximum deduction in respect of all deductions to all donees is the greater of $1,000 or 5 percent of assessable income (before taking into account deductions under sections 146 or 147).

**Example 1**

ABC Limited made a donation of $5,000 to Charity A on 15 April 1983. The company has a 30 June balance date and has a loss in respect of the year ended 30 June l983.

Pursuant to (ii), the company is limited to a maximum (in respect of gifts to each donee) of $4,000.

This amount is not, however, allowable under section 147 since, pursuant to (iv), the company is subject to the overall maximum of 1,000 or 5 percent of assessable income whichever is the greater.

As the company is in loss, the section 147 claim in the 1983 income year is limited to $1,000.

**Example 2**

XYZ Limited, a public company, made donations as Follows:

1.  $800 to Charity A on 3 January 1983
2.  $700 to Charity A on 29 March 1983
3.  $6,000 to Charity B on 2 April 1983
4.  $500 to Charity A on 18 November 1983

The company has a 31 December balance date. In the year ended 31 December 1983, the company's assessable income was $90,000.

Donations (a) and (b) add to $1,500 but are limited to $1,000 (pursuant to (i)). Donation (c) is limited to $4,000 (pursuant to (ii)). Donation (d) is limited by neither (ii) nor (iii) since that donation is less than $4,000 and since all donations to Charity A total less than $4,000.

XYZ Limited is thus limited in the first place to a maximum (in respect of the total of gifts to both donees) of $5,500. ($1,000 + $4,000 + $500.)

This amount is not, however, allowable under section 147 since, pursuant to (iv) above, the company is subject to the overall maximum of $1,000 or 5 percent of assessable income whichever is the greater. In this case, 5 percent of $90,000 is $4,500

The section 147 claim for the above company in the 1984 income year is therefore limited to $4,500.

**Example 3**

Same facts as in Example 2 above except that donation (d) is $3,500 instead of $500.

Donations (a), (b) and (c) are limited as in Example 2. Donation (d) is **not** limited by (ii) as the gift is less than $4,000. Donation (d) **is limited** by (iii) since when it is added to donations (a) and (b) as limited in Example 2, the total is $4,500 which is now limited to $4,000.

XYZ Limited is limited in the first place to a maximum (in respect of gifts to both donees) of $8,000 ($4,000 in respect of Charity A and $4,000 in respect of Charity B).

However, as in Example 2, pursuant to (iv), the section 147 claim is again limited to $4,500, ie, 5 percent of assessable income of $90,000.

### Section 24 - Contributions to Employees' Superannuation Schemes

This section amends section 150 of the principal Act which provides for the deduction by employers, for tax purposes, of contributions to employees' superannuation schemes.

Section 150(3), which specifies the maximum deduction allowable to the employer, was repealed and substituted last year; inadvertently, a reference was made at that time, in paragraph (b) of the substituted subsection (3), to "an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of the earnings paid by him **to all his employees** in that income year", whereas the reference should have been to 10 percent of the earnings paid by the employer **to such of his employees as are members** of the subsidised superannuation scheme (or schemes) to which the employees and the employer contribute.

Section 24 of this Amendment Act inserts the correct reference in paragraph (b), effective from the 1st day of the 1983/84 income year.

### Section 25 - Repeal of Spent Export Incentives

This section repeals the provisions in the principal Act that relate to those export incentives which can no longer be claimed. The three provisions repealed are those dealing with:

*   The increased exports taxation incentive (section 156).
*   The increased exports to new markets taxation incentive (section 157).
*   Tax credits in relation to export of goods (section 157A).

These incentives are the "old" export sales incentives which have now been superseded by the export performance taxation incentive contained in section 156A of the principal Act.

The repeal is to be effective on 1 April 1984. For this reason, reference is still made to the repealed provisions in the new Third Schedule to the principal Act (contained in the Schedule to this Act).

In addition, a number of other amendments (mostly repeals, and revocations of Orders in Council) are made in the section which are consequential to the provisions repealed above or are consequential to provisions which have been repealed in previous years.

### Section 26 - Export Earnings from Qualifying Overseas Projects

Section 158A of the principal Act allows a deduction, in calculating assessable income derived from the carrying on of a business, of 10 percent of the net foreign currency earnings remitted to New Zealand in respect of "qualifying projects" as defined in that section. An exclusion from "net foreign currency earnings" (also defined) ensures that a taxpayer cannot obtain the benefit of a deduction under section 158A and a deduction under section 156 ("increased exports of goods") in respect of the same goods and materials that are embodied in the qualifying project.

However a similar exclusion was inadvertently not made in section 158A to cover the situation where an exporter of qualifying services who qualifies for an incentive deduction pursuant to section 158A might also claim the Export Performance Incentive (tax credit) in terms of section 156A ("export performance incentive for qualifying goods").

Section 26 of this Amendment Act now remedies this omission by way of a new paragraph (aa), to subsection (1) of section 158A, to exclude from the definition of "net foreign currency earnings" all amounts received by the taxpayer in respect of goods or materials exported in relation to a qualifying contract where a credit of tax is allowed in respect of those goods or materials under section 156A.

To ensure that taxpayers cannot obtain an unfair advantage from this situation which has existed since section 156A was enacted in 1979 (effective income year commencing 1 April 1980) this amendment first applies with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on **1 April 1980** .

### Section 27 - Notional Interest on Loans Made to Employees under Employee Share Purchase Schemes

This section amends section 166 of the principal Act which provides an incentive for company employers by allowing them to claim notional interest on loans made by them to their employees for the purpose of enabling those employees to purchase shares under an employee share purchase scheme.

That section has its own "associated persons" definition in subsection (2), which differs from the general definition contained in section 8 of the principal Act.

Section 27 of this Amendment Act makes to section 166 an identical amendment to that made to section 8, (by section 6 of this Amendment Act) to the general "associated persons" definition; it extends the "associated persons" definition in section 166 to include the relationship between a company and a person (other than a company) who holds 25 percent or more in nominal value or the allotted shares of that company.

This amendment will apply from the income year commencing on 1 April 1984.

### Section 28 - Payments to Partners for Services Performed for the Partnership

### _**Introduction**_

In terms of general law a person cannot employ himself and a partnership cannot employ any of its partners. Payments made for any such "employment" are treated as an allocation of profits where such profits exist but cannot be recognised where losses are involved. The tax effect has been that where a salary is paid to a working partner, and the partnership suffers a loss for the year, the salary is not allowable as a deduction and is not taxed in the shareholders hands. The amendment provided by section 28 partially overcomes this problem by deeming the "salary" payment to be salary or wages for the purposes of the Tax Act, and deeming it to be deductible, where certain conditions are met. It should be noted that where the conditions specified in the new legislation are not met, the previous conditions will continue to apply (eg, if the partnership is in loss the payment is not deductible).

### _**Legislation**_

Section 28 of this Amendment Act inserts a new section 167B into the Act to enable payments akin to salary or wages made by a partnership to a working partner under a written contract of service to be allowable as a deduction in calculating the assessable income derived, or losses incurred, by the partners in a partnership. To qualify for this deduction, it will be necessary for the payment to be made on a similar basis to that which would apply where the partnership employed a person who was not a partner. To this end, the new section contains the following requirements:

*   The partner must be employed under a binding written contract of service which has been signed by all the partners in the partnership (definition of "contract of service").
*   The deduction will be available only in respect of amounts paid for services performed during the period commencing not earlier than the date on which the contract becomes binding and ending on the date on which it terminates (subsection (2)).
*   The contract must specify the amount payable to the working partner for services performed by him in carrying on the business of the partnership (definition of "contract of service"). (In the case of any end of year bonus, the amount of the proposed bonus and the basis on which it is payable must be set out in the contract of service. Provided these conditions are met, the bonus can qualify for a deduction under section 167B.) It should be noted that if any amount payable to the partner is not specified prior to the performance of the services the payment is not in the nature of salary or wages. It is an apportionment of profits and as such is not allowable as a deduction.
*   The deduction allowable cannot exceed the amount of the remuneration specified in the contract (subsection (2)). If the partners wish to increase the remuneration it will be necessary to renegotiate the contract. In this event, the increased deduction will be allowable in respect of increased payments made after the signing of the renegotiated contract.
*   The partner concerned must personally and actively perform services for the partnership as his principal occupation (definition of "working partner"). If the partner is also employed by employers other than the partnership then it is a question of fact as to whether the services which are performed for the partnership are performed as the principal occupation of the partner. It should also be noted that it is not possible for a person who performs services for two or more employers to perform those services as his principal occupation for more than one of them.
*   The services performed may be any of the duties required to be performed in the carrying on of the business of the partnership (definition of "working partner").

Where the requirements of the new section are met, the qualifying payments made to the working partner will be deemed to be an allowable deduction under section 104(b) of the Act in calculating the income (or losses) of the partnership.

It should be noted that:

1.  The section does not apply to payments made by an investment partnership, being a partnership which is engaged exclusively or principally in the investment of money or the holding of or dealing in shares, securities, investments or estates or interests in land.
2.  The payments made are subject to the provisions of section 97 where the working partner is a relative of any of the other partners in the partnership.
3.  Any payment made to a working partner which is, in terms of section 167B, deemed to be allowable as a deduction under section 104(b) is to be treated as salary or wages for the purposes of the Act. This is achieved by subsection (2) of the amendment which includes such payments within the definition of "salary or wages" in section 2. The effect of this amendment is two - fold.
4.  Firstly, it means that **all** payments of this type are to be treated in the same manner for income tax purposes as salary or wages paid to any other employee and PAYE deducted and accounted for in the normal way.
    
    Secondly, the partner in receipt of the payment will be entitled to the standard deduction of $52 or may claim employment - related expenses in the same manner as any other salary or wage earner when he furnishes his annual return of income.
    
5.  The payments are deemed to be salary or wages for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976 only. For example, they are not deemed be salary or wages for Accident Compensation Levy purposes. Therefore **Employer** Accident Compensation Levy is not payable on this type of payment. When employers are completing the Annual Reconciliation Statement, IR 68, the amount of the payment to the partner should be deducted from the Gross Wages figure before entering under total C. (Refer "Guide to Employers" Booklet.)

The partner in receipt of the payment will be required to pay self - employed Accident Compensation Levy on the total amount received by him from the partnership, including any amount paid to him under a contract of service to which section 167B applies.

In terms of the Accident Compensation Act 1982, the self employed levy is calculated on the partner's total assessable income (as determined under and for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1976) derived by him from the carrying on of a business. As payments to which section 167B applies are not "salary or wages" for the purposes of the Accident Compensation Act, the amount of such payments which are included in the taxpayer's assessable income are "assessable income derived from a business" and must be added to the partner's share of partnership income to determine the total amount on which self - employed levy must be calculated.

The practical effect is that where no salary or other payment to which section 167B applies is paid, the levy would be calculated on the partner's share of partnership income. Where any payment to which section 167B applies is made to the partner, it will be necessary to add to the share of partnership income the salary or other qualifying payment made, less any employment related expenses or standard deduction which is allowable as a deduction against that salary income. Where the partner is also in receipt of salary or wages from another source, it will be necessary for any standard deduction allowance to be apportioned rateably.

**For example** , assume a partner in XYZ partnership derived assessable income as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Share of partnership income - XYZ partnership |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 3,187 |
| Add - Salary from XYZ partnership |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 17,000 |     |     |
|     | Less standard deduction |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     | 17000 |     |     | x   | 52  |     |     |     |     |     |     | 44  |     | 16,956 |
| 20000 |     | 1   |
| Net assessable income for self - employed levy purposes |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 20,143 |

If any apportionment is necessary, a separate schedule should be included in the partner's return of income showing how the figure on which accident compensation levy has been calculated.

### Section 29 - Forestry Encouragement Grants

This section amends section 168 of the principal Act to reflect changes to the forestry encouragement grants scheme announced by the Government last year. Where previously section 74 of the principal Act allowed companies engaged in forestry activities to claim a deduction, in the year incurred, of forest establishment and maintenance expenditure, from 1 April 1983 the deduction was terminated and effectively replaced by a new scheme of forestry encouragement grants (refer to page 46 of PIB 120 for further details).

The regulations administering the new grants, the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1983, were promulgated earlier this year, to apply from and including 1 April 1983. Section 168 is now amended to cater for the fact that grants by the New Zealand Forest Service can now be given in respect of depreciation on plant or machinery (including motor vehicles) used in establishing or planting, and maintaining forests.

The payment of grants in respect of depreciation is a new concept, as depreciation is not "expenditure". However, as the Government assistance for **commercial** forestry expenditure of all taxpayers (except those to whom section 135(1) - "Forestry Encouragement Act 1962" plantings - still applies) is now to be in the form of a grant rather than in the form of allowances or deductions in calculating assessable income, it was necessary to provide also a grant payment in lieu of a deduction for depreciation allowances for plant or machinery acquired on or after 1 April 1985. In order to prevent a "double deduction", section 168 is amended to prevent any deduction of depreciation allowances in respect of assets for which a depreciation component is included in the forestry encouragement grant.

_**Subsection (1)**_ introduces a new definition to section 168 of the principal Act to define "depreciation portion". This "portion" is specified as being that part of the grant paid to any taxpayer that represents the amount of depreciation in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1983 in respect of qualifying forestry plant or machinery.

_**Subsection (2)**_ includes in section 168(2)(s) of the principal Act a reference to the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1983.

_**Subsection (3)**_ repeals subsection (4) of section 168 of the principal Act and substitutes a new subsection (4).

1.  Any payment in any income year to a taxpayer under the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations for the expenditure portion (if any) or the depreciation portion (if any) is **not** to be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer.
2.  **No** deduction for depreciation is to be allowed in respect of any asset, acquired or constructed on or after 1 April 1983, in any income year where that asset is used in preparing or developing land for forestry operations or in the planting, tending or maintaining of a tree crop **and** where the depreciation portion (in whole or in part) of any grant payment to the taxpayer is related to and is based on the capital expenditure incurred in acquiring or constructing that asset.

**Note:** Depreciation allowances may still continue to be deducted, in calculating assessable income, in respect of forestry establishment and maintenance plant or machinery acquired or constructed **before** 1 April 1983 - see section 74(2)(b), third proviso.

_**Subsection (4)**_ inserts new subsections (5A) and (5B) into section 168 to provide that any expenditure **of the kinds** for which a grant is given under regulation 5(1) or 5(2) of the Forestry Encouragement Grants Regulations 1983 will not be deductible for income tax purposes, to the following extent and on the following bases:

(**Note:** Commercial forestry establishment and maintenance expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1983 will, subject to the following, be deductible only under the "cost of timber" basis, when income is derived eventually from disposal of the forest.)

1.  **Regulation 5(1) grants**
2.  These grants are the normal forestry encouragement grants. The grant is equal to 45 percent of the qualifying forestry expenditure and 45 percent of the annual depreciation (wdv basis) on the cost of the qualifying plant or machinery, respectively:
    
    1.  In relation to the "expenditure portion" of the grant, the expenditure of the kinds to which that portion of the grant relates and on which it is based will constitute part of the cost of timber **only to the extent that** it **exceeds** 2 2/9th times the amount of that portion of the grant.
    2.  In relation to the "depreciation portion" of the grant, the capital expenditure to which that portion relates and on which it is based will, **to the extent that** it **equals** 2 2/9ths times the amount of that portion of the grant, _not_constitute part of the cost of timber.
    
    The point here is that the establishment and maintenance expenditure in respect of which the "expenditure portion" of the grant is given is, for purposes of quantifying that portion (by the Forest Service), taken into account **once only** .
    
    In the case of the "depreciation portion", however, the capital expenditure in respect of which that portion is given, is taken into account, by way of calculation of depreciation on the **diminishing value** , over a **succession** of years.
    
    **Examples**
    
    **AND SO ON**
    
3.  **Regulation 5(2) grants**
4.  These grants are what are known as "protection and production" grants. The grant is equal to 66 2/3 percent of the qualifying forestry expenditure and 66 2/3 percent of the depreciation on the cost of the qualifying plant or machinery, respectively.
    
    1.  In relation to the "expenditure portion" of the grant, paragraph (a)(i) above will apply as if the reference to 2 2/9th times were a references to 1 1/2 times.
    2.  In relation to the "depreciation portion" of the grant, paragraph (a)(ii), above will apply as if the reference to 2 2/9th times were likewise a reference to 1 1/2 times.

_**Subsection (5)**_ provides that this section (Section 29 of the Amendment Act) will apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1982/83 income year and subsequent income years.

This recognises that while the forestry encouragement grants to which this section relates apply only to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1983, where a taxpayer has a late balance date such expenditure may in fact be incurred in that taxpayer's **1982/83** income year.

### Section 30 - Grant Related Suspensory Loans

This amendment includes a new grant related suspensory loan entitled a "Fishing Vessel Construction Bounty" in section 173, with effect from 1 April 1981.

The bounty (loan) is 15 percent of the base price of certain commercial fishing vessels of between 10 metres and 18 metres, which are constructed in New Zealand for domestic use by New Zealand owners. The loan is to be written off provided the vessel operates for three of the first five years of its operations in the area for which it was approved.

Section 173 provides, via section 169, that for tax purposes the cost of the asset in respect of which the loan is made is to be reduced by the amount of the loan. The effect of this is to reduce the depreciation and investment allowance allowable on the asset.

Should any part of the loan subsequently be required to be repaid, section 173(3) permits the earlier reduction of claims for depreciation (and where appropriate, investment allowance) to be reviewed to allow, in the years of repayment, the deductions lost in earlier years because of the original reducing of the cost price of the asset by the amount of the loan.

### Section 31 - Losses Incurred in Specified Activities

This section makes four amendments to section 188A as enacted last year; the amendments contained in subsections (1) and (2) correct anomalies which were present in the existing legislation, while subsections (3) and (4) merely make minor changes to ensure the application of section 188A as originally intended. All four amendments apply with effect from the commencement of section 188A, (ie, the 1983/84 income year).

### _**Subsection (1) - Unrestricted Offset of Loss Against Interest and Farm Development Expenditure Recovery**_

This subsection inserts a new subsection (5A) in section 188A to enable a taxpayer to deem the assessable income arising from a section 129 interest and development expenditure recovery to be assessable income derived from the conduct of a specified activity (being an activity conducted on the land in respect of the sale of which the recovery is being made). Such deeming may enable the taxpayer to offset in excess of $10,000 of a specified activity loss against such income.

This amendment arises from an anomaly which became apparent during a review of the legislation enacted in 1982. Section 129 deems any deduction for interest and farm development expenditure allowed in respect of land sold within 10 years of purchase to be assessable income of the taxpayer to the extent of any profit arising on that sale. It does not, however, go as far as deeming that assessable income to be income derived from the activity (or activities) conducted on the land sold. Where that activity is a "specified activity" to which section 188A applies, the loss containment provisions of that section would apply in respect of the set off of a specified activity loss against the deemed assessable income as it would not constitute income from the specified activity. This would have been the case under the legislation as enacted in 1982, notwithstanding that the deemed assessable income represented recovered deductions of interest and development expenditure which might not yet have yielded tax benefits to the taxpayer due to the operation of section 188A. The result was that a taxpayer could be assessed for tax on the recovered interest and development expenditure deductions prior to the receipt of the tax benefits of those deductions (by way of loss offset).

That situation was considered to be inequitable and the legislation has been amended to provide that where any such "recoverable" deductions are allowed in respect of the conduct of a particular specified activity the assessable income deemed to arise on the recovery of those deductions should, for the purposes of the section 188A loss containment provisions, be treated as being derived from the conduct of that specified activity.

This amendment gives effect to that treatment where the following conditions apply:

1.  Land is sold by the taxpayer and, in respect of that sale, section 129 deems an amount of the gain on sale to be assessable income; and
2.  The taxpayer has, in **any** income year, conducted any specified activity on that land in the conduct of which (**on that land** ) the taxpayer has incurred a loss.

Where such circumstances exist, the new subsection (5A) permits the taxpayer to make an **irrevocable** election as to the extent to which the amount recoverable under section 129 shall be income deemed to be derived from the conduct of the specified activity - against which any losses (current or brought forward) from that activity **on that land** may be offset without limit.

While the taxpayer may, in any case, only make a maximum election equal to the amount of the "excess" determined in accordance with section 129, the proviso to the new subsection ensures that the amount elected cannot exceed the amount of loss or losses incurred in the conduct of the specified activity **on that land** that, at the time of sale, is available to be offset against other income.

As with the other election provisions in section 188A, (ie, subsections (4)(b)(i) and (7)(g)), the election in the new subsection, to be valid, must be made within the time within which the taxpayers' return of income for the year of sale is required to be furnished. Should no election be made for the purposes of subsection (5A), the assessable income deemed to arise from the section 129 recovery provisions is simply assessable income of the taxpayer ascribed to no particular activity and, as such, any offset of specified activity losses against that income will be subject to the section 188A provisions.

Where two or more specified activities have been conducted on the land sold, the taxpayer may make elections, in respect of each specified activity as described - provided that the amounts involved in those elections do not exceed, in total, the amount of assessable income arising from the section 129 recovery, and that each election does not exceed the amount of loss or losses, incurred in the conduct of the respective activity on that land, that have not, at the commencement of the year of sale, been offset against other income.

It is important to note that it is only the loss or losses incurred in the conduct of a specified activity **on the land sold** that can be offset without limit against the deemed assessable income arising from the section 129 recovery - losses incurred in the same kind of specified activity, but arising from conduct on land other than that subject to the section 129 recovery, are still "locked in" pursuant to section 188A.

**Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the application of the new section 188A(5A):

**Example 1:**

A taxpayer conducts two unrelated specified activities on separate blocks of land; horticulture and mussel farming. The mussel farm is sold (the lease constituting "land" for the purposes of sections 129 and 188A) within 10 years of acquisition and an "excess" arises that is deemed to be assessable income pursuant to section 129. The taxpayer's position prior to the subsection (5A) election in the year of sale of that farm is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Current year horticultural profit | $30,000 |
| Current year mussel farming loss | $5,000 |
| Prior years' mussel farming losses brought forward | $20,000 |
| Deemed assessable income (section 129 recovery) | $12,000 |

Had the amendment not been made, the taxpayer's mussel farming losses would have been subject to the loss containment provisions (section 188A) and would therefore have been able to be offset only to the extent of $10,000 against the taxpayer's assessable income arising from horticulture and/or the section 129 recovery. This year's amendment allows the taxpayer, on election, to offset the mussel farming losses against the assessable income arising from the section 129 recovery provisions **prior** to the application of the section 188A provisions, ie,

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Horticultural Profit |     | $30,000 |
| "Section 129" assessable income (Election by taxpayer deems it to be from conduct of mussel farming) | $12,000 |     |
| Less: Total mussel farming losses | $25,000 |     |
| Net mussel farming loss | $13,000 |     |
| Loss able to be offset (subject to section 188A limit) against assessable income from different specified activity |     | $10,000 |
| Net assessable income |     | $20,000 |
| Mussel farming loss to C/F | $ 3,000 |     |

**Example 2:**

A taxpayer conducts two unrelated specified activities (horticulture and viticulture) on the same block of land, both activities being in loss, and also derives investment income. As above, the taxpayer sells the land on which the specified activities are conducted within 10 years of acquisition and an "excess" arises that is deemed to be assessable income of the taxpayer (section 129).

In the year of sale, the taxpayers' position is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Net Investment Income | $30,000 |
| Accumulated Horticultural loss | $20,000 |
| Accumulated Viticultural loss | $15,000 |
| Deemed assessable income (section 129) | $12,000 |

As in Example 1, the taxpayer would previously have been limited by section 188A in respect of the offset of the specified activity losses against investment and "section 129" income to a total of $10,000. The amendment made by this section allows the taxpayer to elect an offset of the specified activity losses against the assessable income arising from the section 129 recovery **prior** to the application of the section 188A provisions. The taxpayer may make an election pursuant to the new subsection (5A) in respect of **either or both** of the specified activities conducted on the land sold. However, in respect of each activity the election may not exceed the amount of the loss incurred in the conduct of that activity on the land sold, and further, the total amount of losses offset may not exceed the amount of the assessable income arising from the section 129 recovery. The taxpayer may make elections along the following lines:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Net Investment Income |     | $30,000 |
| "Section 129" assessable income | $12,000 |     |
| Less: Elected horticultural loss to be offset (section 188A(5A)) | $ 7,000 |     |
| Less: Elected viticultural loss to be offset (section 188A(5A)) | $ 5,000 |     |
| Net "section 129" assessable income | NIL | NIL |
| Net Horticultural loss ($20,000 - $7,000) | $13,000 |     |
| Net Viticultural loss ($15,000 - $5,000) | $10,000 |     |
| Loss available to be offset | $23,000 |     |
| Loss able to be offset\* (Pursuant to section 188A) |     | $10,000 |
| Net assessable income |     | $20,000 |
| Total specified activity losses to be c/f | $13,000 |     |

\* An election may be made pursuant to section 188A(7)(g) in respect of how much of each specified activity loss will comprise the $10,000 loss actually offset.

**Example 3:**

A taxpayer conducts one kind of specified activity (horticulture) on two separate blocks of land (both activities in loss) and also derives investment income. The taxpayer sells **one** block of land (block A) within 10 years of acquisition and an "excess" arises which is deemed to be assessable income of the taxpayer (section 129). In the year of sale the taxpayer's position is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Net Investment Income | $30,000 |
| Accumulated Horticultural losses | $22,000 |
| Deemed assessable income | $12,000 |

For the purposes of the subsection (5A) election, the loss attributable to the conduct of the horticultural activity **on the land sold** (block A) must be identified separately from losses arising from the conduct of that activity on other land (in this case block B). Accordingly, assume the loss attributable to block A is $5,000, and to block B, $14,000.

Under the new subsection (5A) the taxpayer may make an election only in respect of the loss incurred in the conduct of the specified activity on the land sold (block A, $8,000). That election gives rise to the following position:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investment Income |     | $30,000 |
| "Section 129" assessable income | $12,000 |     |
| Less: "Block A" loss | $ 8,000 |     |
| Net "section 129" income | $ 4,000 | $ 4,000 |
|     |     | $34,000 |
| Balance of specified activity loss, (ie, block B) | $14,000 |     |
| Amount able to be offset (section 188A) |     | $10,000 |
| Net assessable income |     | $24,000 |

### _**Subsection (2) - Inclusion of "Cash Cropping" as Specified Activity (When Appropriate)**_

The existing definition of the term "specified activity" in section 188A excludes from that term "the business of growing trees or plants ... for the production of ... crops (other than flowers) in respect of which the preparation of the land, and the planting and cultivation of the tree or plant, and the harvesting of the crop is accomplished within a period of 12 months". For simplicity we will refer to such an activity as cash - cropping. This amendment provides that cash - cropping **will** constitute a "specified activity" for the purposes of section 188A where that inclusion results in a more favourable treatment of the taxpayer under that section.

Cash - cropping activities were specifically excluded from the $10,000 loss provisions on the basis that the farming of such crops did not lend itself as an avenue for tax avoidance. Since the enactment of the loss containment legislation, however, critical evaluation of that legislation has highlighted certain anomalies that arise as a result of the exclusion of cash - cropping from the term "specified activity".

The following examples illustrate two such anomalies:

**Example 1**

An established sheep farmer (farming prior to 11 October 1982) who has been undertaking substantial cash - cropping in conjunction with his farming activity would, under current legislation, be subject to the loss containment provisions of section 188A. That is, any loss arising from the farming activity would be subject to a $10,000 limit if offset against any cash - cropping income. The reason for this is that, as cash - cropping does not constitute a specified activity, the taxpayer cannot satisfy the "existing farmer"/"established activity" criteria in order to be excluded from the provisions of section 188A - his livelihood and sole or principal source of income must be **only** from the conduct of specified activities in order to gain exclusion.

**Example 2:**

A very recently established (ie, post 11 October 1982) horticulturalist who, among other (horticultural) activities, undertakes cash - cropping. Even though cash - cropping could, in the normal course, be regarded as being of the same kind as the other horticultural activities, it could not previously be classed as such for the purposes of section 188A (specifically, "related activity" definition) as the former is not a specified activity as defined.

In order to correct the above situations it was necessary to provide a facility to enable cash - cropping to be given the status of a "specified activity" in section 188A where this would be advantageous to the taxpayer. This would enable:

*   the taxpayer in **Example 1** to qualify as an "existing farmer" and both sheep farming and cash - cropping to qualify as "established activities"; and
*   the taxpayer in **example 2** to class cash - cropping as a specified activity related to his other horticultural activities in terms of the definition of "related activity" -

thereby providing, to both taxpayers, exclusion from the loss containment provisions in respect of their respective farming activities.

It is important to note that cash - cropping will **only** be included in the definition of the term "specified activity" where that inclusion results in a "**favourable** " treatment for the taxpayer. This determination of favourability of treatment must be made on a year by year basis, ie, the fact that cash - cropping constituted a specified activity for a particular taxpayer in one year does not mean that it must constitute one in the following year - it will only do so if, in that later year, it is to the taxpayer's advantage.

### _**Subsection (3) - Offset of Specified Activity Losses Carried Forward**_

This amendment alters paragraph (c) of section 188A(7) to ensure the correct application of the loss limitation provisions to any specified activity losses that are carried forward.

Paragraph (a) of section 188A(7) (as enacted last year) imposes the $10,000 limitation on the amount of specified activity loss that may be offset, in the year incurred, against a taxpayer's other income. Paragraphs (b) and (c) cover the situation where a loss, or the "contained" portion of a loss, brought forward from an earlier year is added to the current year loss (if any) from the relevant activity, which is then subject to the $10,000 limitation. However, paragraph (c), covering the offset of losses in "year 2", was deficient in that it did not specify a treatment (or limitation) in respect of any loss brought forward to a year in which a **profit** is derived in the conduct of the particular activity. The implication of this might have been that, under the legislation as originally enacted, a taxpayer sustaining a specified activity loss of $100,000 would, in the year incurred, be limited to the offset of only $10,000 of that loss against other income, whereas, in the year to which the remainder of the loss is carried forward, the offset of that amount carried forward would not be limited.

This amendment to paragraph (c) accordingly ensures the following treatment applies where any specified activity loss is incurred (in "year 1") and carried forward (to "year 2"):

1.  Where, in year 2, any **loss** is incurred in the conduct of the same specified activity as that in which the loss carried forward was incurred, those losses may only be offset, **in total** , to the extent of $10,000 against other income of the taxpayer (section 188A(7)(c)(ii) and (iv)).
2.  Where, in year 2, any **profit** is derived in the conduct of the same specified activity in which the loss carried forward was incurred, any remainder of that loss after (unlimited) offset against that profit, may only be offset to the extent of $10,000 against other income of the taxpayer (section 188A(7)(c)(iii) and (iv)).
3.  Where, in year 2, the taxpayer has **neither derived a profit nor incurred a loss** in the conduct of the specified activity in which the loss carried forward was incurred, (ie, has ceased to conduct activity, or revenues and expenses are equal), the loss carried forward may only be offset to the extent of $10,000 against other income of the taxpayer.

_**Note**_ that in all cases, any specified activity loss carried forward is able to be offset **without limit** against income derived from the conduct of the **same** specified activity in the year to which it is carried forward.

### _**Subsection (4) - Offset of Losses Among Group Companies**_

This section inserts a new subsection (7A) into section 188A to specifically restrict, to a maximum of $10,000, the amount of any specified activity loss incurred by a group company that may be offset (by election) against the income of another company in the same group.

The offset of losses among group companies can take two forms; subvention payments, and elections. In respect of the former, the general provisions of section 188A effectively restricted to $10,000 the amount of specified activity loss that may be "transferred" to another group company.

In respect of the latter (elections), however, doubt existed as to whether the legislation (as enacted) was specific enough to support the original intention with regard to "elected" loss offsets among "specified group" companies. Specific reference, therefore, is made to those losses in the new subsection (7A).

The new subsection provides that where a company included in a group of companies incurs a specified activity loss, the total amount that may be offset against both any other income of that company AND against the income of any other company in that group (by way of election made pursuant to section 191(5)) cannot exceed $10,000. The wording of the new subsection ensures that this will apply to an offset in "any income year", ie, it applies both to losses carried forward to, and losses incurred in, any particular year.

If the company undertakes only one of the above offset options, (ie, either offsets only against own income or only against another group company's income) the $10,000 maximum applies to that one offset.

Note that the $10,000 limit applies in respect of the company incurring the loss only; it is not a limit that applies to the group as a whole, ie, three loss companies in a group can each elect to offset up to $10,000 of loss - a total of up to $30,000 against the income of the other group companies.

Finally, to repeat, **all** the amendments detailed above apply from the commencement of section 188A, that is, the 1983/84 income year.

### _**Determination of Application of Section 188A - Summary**_

In order to assist in understanding the application of section 188A a diagram was provided in PIB 120 issued last year. The following is a revised version of that diagram - containing the amendments outlined above and those matrimonial property changes contained in section 61 of this Amendment Act.

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/6/364b6b804ff903b8b998ff5d802abedf/vol-126-itaa-3-1983-flowchart-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203129&hash=F8BC86786ED5A0D3213F95FF3C6AD129)

**Determination of Application of Section 188A**

### Section 32 - Transitional Provisions for Payment of Tax Arising from Application of Section 188A

This section amends section 188B of the Act to alter the rate of interest payable on the amount of tax deferred pursuant to the transitional measures introduced last year complementary to the $10,000 loss limitation legislation (section 188A). The monthly interest rate has been dropped from 1.25 percent to 1.0 percent - a change on an annual basis from 15 percent to 12 percent.

This amendment applies with effect from the commencement of the application of section 188B, ie, the 1983/84 income year.

### Sections 33 and 37 - Group Investment Funds

### _**Introduction**_

These two sections enact the new taxation regime for group investment funds which was announced in the 1983 Budget.

A group investment fund is a type of trust for investment purposes which can only be set up by a Trustee Company or the Public Trustee. There are five Trustee Companies in New Zealand and they operate under the ambit of the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The five companies are:

*   East Coast Permanent Trustees Limited;
*   New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited;
*   Perpetual Trustees, Estate and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited;
*   Pyne Gould Guinness Limited;
*   Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited.

The Public Trustee may set up group investment funds under the Public Trust Office Act 1957.

The facility to form a group investment fund was designed to enable the Trustee Companies to gather the moneys of numerous small investors into an administratively efficient entity. Those investors can be estates and trusts or other persons who request the Trust Company to invest funds as agent for the investor (agency funds). Most Trustee Companies currently operate a number of group investment funds. Those group investment funds are all trusts and should have been furnishing returns and taxed in accordance with sections 226 to 231 of the Act (for all income years up to and including that beginning 1 April 1983).

### _**Legislation**_

The legislation as now enacted by section 33 of this Amendment Act divides the income derived by a group investment fund into two categories: "category A income" and "category B income".

"Category B income" is essentially income generated by the "traditional" investment activities of group investment funds. They are:

1.  Investments in the group investment fund by:
    *   estates, statutory and court ordered trusts;
    *   superannuation category 1 schemes or superannuation category 2 schemes;
    *   agency funds up to the value (in real terms) of the level of investment of that type of funds on 22 June 1983.
2.  Group investment funds with investments wholly in -
    *   authorised trustee securities (except company equities);
    *   a forestry business, but only in respect of land owned or held by the group investment fund for the purposes of that forestry business on 22 June 1983.

"Category B income" continues to be taxed as income derived by a trustee in accordance with sections 226 to 231 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

"Category A income" is that derived from all of the funds of a group investment fund other than the funds set out above. The distinguishing feature of these funds will be in relation to the source of the funds (eg agency funds invested above the level of those that are protected), or to the type of investment (eg real estate). This Category A income is taxed as if it were derived by a company (ie it is taxed in the hands of the trustee of the group investment fund at 45 cents for every dollar of income **and** in the hands of the investor when it is distributed as if it were a dividend).

Section 36 of this Amendment Act provides for the situation where investors in a group investment fund are absentees by adding a new section 285A to the principal Act. In that circumstance the trustee of the group investment fund is the agent of the investor and is therefore obliged to make returns and is assessable and liable for income tax on the investor's dividends from the group investment fund.

### _**Comment**_

Because there are currently only 30 group investment funds operating in New Zealand and because of the relatively complex nature of this specialised taxation regime it has been decided that group investment fund tax returns will be handled by the Dunedin District Office.

### Section 34 - Specified Leases

Section 34 amends section 222A(1) of the principal Act **in respect of leases entered into on or after 28 October 1983** . There are two changes:

1.  _**Subsection (1)**_ introduces a third proviso to the definition of "cost price". This proviso permits the Commissioner to accept the market price of a lease asset as the cost price for the purposes of specified leases in situations where the Commissioner is satisfied a cost price cannot be determined in accordance with the normal provisions of the definition.
    
    This amendment is required for the isolated cases where the lessee is unable to determine from the lessor the cost price of the lease asset. If there is no market price or more than one, the Commissioner will determine the cost price at an amount he considers equitable, having regard to the facts in any particular case and the tenor of the whole of the definition of "cost price", including the provisos.
    
    This new proviso can only be used where the "cost price" of a lease asset **cannot** be determined by the provisions of the definition and the first two provisos and is not an alternative to those provisions. If the Commissioner can determine the cost price in the normal way from the lessor, he will do so.
    
2.  _**Subsection (2)**_ introduces the standard "associated persons" test to the definition of specified lease. The effect of this amendment is that where a lease asset is purchased at, or subsequent to, the end of the lease term by an associated person of the lessee the lease will be a specified lease for income tax purposes.

### Section 35 - New Incentive for Cost of Producing Films - Section 224D of the Income Tax Act 1976

### _**Introduction**_

Existing legislation (section 224A) requires the cost of producing or purchasing a film, or any right in a film, to be written off by the film owner as follows:

*   feature film - over 24 months,
*   non - feature films - over 2 income years.

This new section provides a tax incentive for the film industry by way of an accelerated write off for the costs of producing films, the principal features of which are:

*   Under the new provisions:
    *   The cost of producing a film certified by the New Zealand Film Commission as a New Zealand film may be claimed as a deduction in the year in which the film is completed.
    *   The cost of producing other films may be written off over 2 income years, commencing with the year of completion (on the same basis as currently applies to non - feature films under section 224A).
    *   Costs of production which are incurred in any year following the year of completion will be deductible in the year incurred for both New Zealand films and other films.
    *   Costs of producing advertising films or commercials may still be claimed in year incurred.
*   The new section makes no distinction between feature films and non - feature films. The distinction is simply between certified New Zealand films and other films.
*   The new section applies only to the costs of producing a film. The cost of acquiring any completed film or the rights in any completed film continues to be governed by section 224A. (Note, however, that expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in reimbursing any other person for costs incurred by that person in producing an uncompleted film is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in producing that film.)
*   The write - off of production costs in the year of completion of films certified as New Zealand films by the Film Commission will be allowable only on production of a copy of the "final certificate" issued by the Film Commission.
*   The Film Commission will also issue a "provisional certificate" to assist taxpayers in re - estimating provisional tax. Note, however, that the "provisional certificate" is not acceptable as evidence of eligibility for a 100 percent write - off in the year of completion of the film.
*   The new section is subject to section 106A (limited recourse loan provisions).
*   Section 224A is subject to the new section 224D. (Note however that taxpayers are not obliged to take advantage of section 224D if they do not wish to do so.)
*   The new section does not apply to "pre - Budget" films.
*   It applies to all other films completed on or after 16 December 1983.

### _**Legislation**_

Full details of the new legislation are as follows:

_**Subsection (1)**_ \- _**Definitions**_

"**Depreciation Loss** " - This definition is essentially the same as that used in section 224A. The expression "depreciation loss" means the amount of depreciation which would have been allowable as a deduction in a particular year had section 108 of the principal Act applied in respect of the assets used in the production of the film. The amount of the depreciation loss to be included in the total film production expenditure figure is the sum of the amounts of depreciation which would have been allowable as a deduction in the years up to and including the year of completion had a current year deduction for depreciation been allowable in each of those years.

"**Film Owner** " is the person who owns a completed film.

"**Film Production Expenditure** " means -

*   expenditure which is normally allowable as a deduction; but does not include the cost of depreciable assets;
*   any loss which is deductible under section 104;
*   being expenditure or loss incurred by the taxpayer in producing film of which he is, or is expected to become, a "film owner". The definition also includes any depreciation loss;
    
    **but does not include** :
    
    expenditure incurred by the taxpayer:
    
    1.  in the acquisition of a completed film from another person;
    2.  in the acquisition of any right in a completed film from another person.
    3.  directly in marketing or selling the film.
    
    In other words, the definition refers to all expenditure which is normally allowable as a deduction to the extent that it is incurred by a taxpayer in producing his film.
    
    It should be noted that the definition applies to both expenditure incurred prior to the completion of the film and that which is incurred after it has been completed. In addition, the provisions of subsection (3) should be noted in respect of the reimbursement of another person for film production expenditure where the reimbursement occurs prior to the completion of the film.
    

"**Final Certificate** " - This is the certificate which will be issued by the New Zealand Film Commission certifying that the film named therein has been approved by the Commission as a New Zealand Film. Production of a copy of this certificate is a prerequisite to eligibility for the 100 percent write - off of production costs in the year the film was completed in terms of subsection (6) of this section.

"**New Zealand Film** " - This is a film certified by the New Zealand Film Commission as being a film which the Commission is satisfied has a significant New Zealand content. The criteria to be used by the Commission in reaching its decision are those set out in section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978; viz,

"18. Content of films - (1) In carrying out its functions, the Commission shall not make financial assistance available to any person in respect of the making, promotion, distribution, or exhibition of a film unless it is satisfied that the film has or is to have a significant New Zealand content.

"(2) For the purposes of determining whether or not a film has or is to have a significant New Zealand content, the Commission shall have regard to the following matters:

*   "(a) The subject of a film:
*   "(b) The locations at which the film was or is to be made:
*   "(c) The nationalities and places of residence of -
    *   "(i) The authors, scriptwriters, composers, producers, directors, actors, technicians, editors, and other persons who took part or are to take part in the making of the film; and
    *   "(ii) The persons who own or are to own the shares or capital of any company, partnership, or joint venture that is concerned with the making of the film; and
    *   "(iii)The persons who have or are to have the copyright in the film:

*   "(d) The sources from which the money that was used or is to be used to make the film was or is to be derived:
*   "(e) The ownership and whereabouts of the equipment and technical facilities that were or are to be used to make the film:
*   "(f) Any other matters that in the opinion of the Commission are relevant to the purposes of this Act.

"(3) In carrying out its functions, the Commission shall in relation to the content of any film have due regard to the observance of standards that are generally acceptable in the community."

Any enquiries concerning eligibility should be addressed to:

The New Zealand Film Commission,

PO Box 11546

**WELLINGTON**

"**Provisional Certificate** " - is a certificate issued by the Film Commission certifying that an uncompleted or proposed film will, in the opinion of the Commission, qualify for certification as a New Zealand film when completed. The purpose of this certificate is to provide an independent appraisal to assist taxpayers who have invested in the production of the film in any estimation of provisional tax they may wish to make for the year in which the film will be completed. However, it should be noted that this certificate will not be accepted in support of a claim for a 100 percent deduction in the taxpayer's return of income as a final certificate is required as evidence of eligibility for the actual deduction.

_**Subsection (2)**_ \- This subsection contains further definitions which are used in this section and which have the same meaning as that contained in section 224A. These are as follows:

"**Completed** " means that the film has been completed to the double head finecut stage of production (as defined) or equivalent production stage.

"**Copyright** " includes all rights and choses in action in, or in relation to:

*   the film,
*   the prints in the film;
*   publicity material in relation to the film;
*   all other tangible assets in relation to the film.

"**Double Head Finecut Stage of Production** " is the stage of production where the film has been completely edited, shot by shot, to its final length.

"**Film** " means a cinematograph film; and includes a videotape, and any other material record of visual moving images that is capable of being used for the subsequent projection of those images in a fixed sequence on to any screen; and also includes any copy of the whole or any part of that film; but does not include:

1.  an advertising film or a commercial (the cost of producing these films is therefore allowable in the year in which the expenditure is incurred under the general provisions of the Tax Act);
2.  a film which the Commissioner determines under section 224C to have commenced on or before the 5th of August 1982. (This means that "pre - Budget films" cannot take advantage of the new provisions. Note, however, that if that "pre - Budget" status is withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of section 224C, the provisions of section 224D can apply in respect of the film - as can the provisions of section 106A and 224A).

The definition of film covers all films, including animated films, films of sporting events, documentaries, etc. It also includes videotapes, video cassettes and discs, audio - visual presentations and other similar property.

"**Right** " means any copyright (as defined) and any licence in respect thereof and any other right which subsists in or attaches to the film (including any right to income from the film) and includes any equitable right. The definition, in effect, covers all rights associated with a film.

_**Subsection (3)**_ caters for the situation where a person who has incurred expenditure in producing a film sells his interest in the film to another person prior to the film's completion. To the extent that the payment made by that other person represents no more than a reimbursement of "film production expenditure", it is deemed by subsection (3) to be film production expenditure incurred by that purchaser in producing the film. To the extent that it does exceed the reimbursement level, that excess is required to be written off in accordance with the provisions of section 224A.

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that section 224D shall apply subject to section 106A. This means that adjustments required under section 106A must be made before the allowance of any deduction under this section.

_**Subsection (5)**_ prevents a taxpayer from claiming a double deduction for expenditure to which this section applies. It provides that where a taxpayer incurs film production expenditure which is allowable as a deduction under this section (including any depreciation loss) no further deduction may be claimed under any of the other provisions of the Tax Act in respect of that expenditure.

_**Subsection (6)**_ permits the total film production expenditure to be written off in the year the film is completed where the film has been certified by the New Zealand Film Commission as being a New Zealand Film. The subsection provides that where:

1.  the taxpayer has, in any year, incurred any "film production expenditure" in producing any film of which he is a "film owner"; and
2.  the film has, by means of a "final certificate", been certified by the New Zealand Film Commission, as being a "New Zealand film",

the taxpayer is entitled to claim a deduction for that expenditure in the later of:

1.  the income year in which the film is "completed";
2.  the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

This means that any costs of producing a New Zealand film which are incurred in, or prior to, the year in which the film is completed, are allowable as a deduction in the income year in which the film is completed. Expenditure incurred in any subsequent year is deductible in the year incurred.

_**Subsection (7)**_ permits the cost of producing films which are not certified by the New Zealand Film Commission as New Zealand films to be spread equally over the year in which the film is completed and the subsequent year. It provides that costs of production incurred in the income year in which the film is completed or in any previous year must be accumulated and the total allowed over a two year period, 50 percent in the income year in which the film is completed and the balance in the subsequent year.

**The proviso** permits more than 50 percent of the costs to be written off in the year of completion where the income from the film (or from any right therein) which was derived in that year exceeds that 50 percent deduction which would otherwise be allowable under this subsection. Where such an excess occurs, this proviso increases the amount allowable as a deduction in that year to the lesser of:

*   the total film production expenditure which was incurred by the taxpayer prior to the end of that income year; or
*   the income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of that film (or that right) which was derived during that income year.

Any portion of the film production expenditure which is not allowed in the year of completion of the film is allowable in the following year. The maximum allowable for the two income years is, of course, the total film production expenditure incurred prior to the end of the income year following the year of completion of the film.

_**Note:**_ It is important to note that the deductions permitted under subsection (6) or subsection (7) of this section apply to "film production expenditure" only. Any costs of acquiring any completed film or any rights in a completed film are required to be written off in accordance with the provisions of section 224A.

_**Subsection (8)**_ provides that any film production expenditure incurred in any income year subsequent to the year in which the film is completed is allowable as a deduction in the year incurred.

_**Subsection (9)**_ provides that where a taxpayer (who is a film owner) sells or, by any other means or because of any other circumstances, ceases to own a film and/or **every** right in a film, any film production expenditure which has not previously been allowed as a deduction may be claimed in the year in which the taxpayer ceases to own that film or those rights. This is the same provision as that contained in subsection (7) of section 224A.

_**Subsection (10)**_ enables the Commissioner to determine the depreciation to be recovered where the asset on which the deduction was allowed is either sold or transferred to another activity. The normal rules for recovery of depreciation will be applied.

_**Subsection (11)**_ gives the New Zealand Film Commission the power to issue final certificates and provisional certificates. It requires that:

*   the application for the issue of either of these certificates must be in writing;
*   the applicant must supply such information as the Film Commission requires;
*   the certificates issued by the Commission must be in writing.

_**Subsection (12)**_ gives the Commission power to revoke any provisional certificate or final certificate which it has issued where, for any reason, it is satisfied that the certificate should not remain in force. Where a certificate is revoked by the Commission it is treated as void as from the time of its issue.

_**Subsection (13)**_ provides that where a provisional or final certificate has been issued by the New Zealand Film commission -

1.  A copy of the certificate must be sent to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue;
2.  the Commissioner must be given written notice of the revocation of any certificate by the New Zealand Film Commission.

_**Subsection (14)**_ sets out the basis on which a deduction is allowable for deferred fees and similar types of expenditure. It provides that where, in relation to a person who contributes towards the production of a film:

*   an amount (referred to as the "specified amount") is contributed by the taxpayer or is contingently liable to be contributed in payment towards the cost of producing that film; and
*   all or any of that specified amount relates to the provision of goods or the supply of services; and
*   the liability for payment of the cost of those goods or services has, in terms of an agreement entered into between the supplier and any other person, been deferred; and
*   the period between the time of the provision of those services or the supply of those goods and the time of the payment of the cost thereof is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, excessive, or the liability for payment of that cost is dependent on a contingency,

the expenditure in the acquiring of those services or those goods shall be deemed to be incurred at the time or times of the making of that payment or those payments.

This means that deferred fees, and other costs of producing a film for which payment is deferred beyond the period in which it would, in accordance with normal commercial practice, normally have been payable, are not allowable as a deduction until the year in which payment is made.

_**Subsection (15)**_ provides that where, in relation to any taxpayer who produces a film, the Commissioner is satisfied, having regard to the relationship between the film owner and the person who supplies goods or services which are used in the production of the film (or to any other relevant circumstances) that:

1.  the film owner and the supplier were not dealing with each other at arm's length, and
2.  the expenditure incurred by the owner exceeds the amount which would have been incurred had the film owner and the supplier dealt with each other on an arm's length basis,

the amount allowable as a deduction will be limited to the amount which the Commissioner considers might have been expected to have been incurred if the film owner and the supplier had dealt with each other at arm's length.

Effectively, this subsection prevents arrangements from being entered into for the purposes of artificially inflating the cost of producing a film. It limits the amount allowable as a deduction to that which would be expected to have been paid in a normal commercial negotiation entered into between parties acting on an arm's length basis.

_**Subsection (16)**_ is a general anti - avoidance provision which gives the Commissioner power to disallow any excess deduction where he is satisfied that arrangements have been made between the taxpayer claiming the deduction and another person to give an unfair advantage under the section.

_**Subsection (17)**_ provides that every reference in this section to any income year shall be deemed to be a reference to the taxpayer's accounting year.

_**Consequential Amendments**_ \- Subsection (2) of section 35 of the Amendment Act consequentially amends section 224A by making it subject to section 224D.

_**Application Date**_ \- The new section applies to all films (as defined) completed on or after the 16th of December 1983 (the day on which the legislation received the Governor - General's assent).

### Section 36 - Classes of Income Derived from New Zealand

This section amends section 243(2)(g) of the Act to provide that where income is derived from shares, etc, in a company **resident in New Zealand** , (ie, one that either is incorporated in, or has its Head Office in, New Zealand) that income is, in all cases, deemed to have a source in New Zealand.

The existing legislation, with its reference to a "New Zealand company", (ie, one that is incorporated in New Zealand) rather than to a "company resident in New Zealand" creates an anomalous situation whereby a company which has its Head Office in New Zealand but is incorporated elsewhere, (ie, resident in New Zealand but not a "New Zealand company") is assessable for New Zealand income tax on its world income but any dividends and/or interest it may pay are not deemed to have a New Zealand source. As a result, payments of such interest and dividends, when made to non - residents, were, before this amendment, not liable to either income tax or non - resident withholding tax in New Zealand.

In contrast, such payments made by "New Zealand companies" are subject to the deduction of non - resident withholding tax.

The above position conflicts with the treatment accorded by other countries to their resident companies - both Australia and the United States treat income derived from shares, etc, in their **resident** companies as having a domestic source.

This amendment corrects the above anomaly with effect from the date of the Governor - General's assent to this Act (16 December 1983).

Subsection (2) of this section amends section 243(2)(i) of the principal Act which gives a New Zealand source to pensions payable by the New Zealand Government or out of superannuation funds established in New Zealand. Because section 3 of this Amendment Act includes a definition of "superannuation fund" in section 2 of the principal Act and that definition only refers to superannuation category 1 schemes and superannuation category 2 schemes, it is necessary to omit the words "superannuation fund" in section 243(2)(i) and to refer to each type of superannuation scheme, viz, superannuation category 1 schemes, superannuation category 2 schemes and superannuation category 3 schemes. This amendment ensures that pension and annuity income from superannuation category 3 schemes is sourced in New Zealand.

### Section 38 - Liability as Agent of Employer of Non - Resident Taxpayer

This section makes an amendment to section 287 of the principal Act, which deals with the liability of employers as agents for non - resident taxpayers. In that section, an employer is required, on the application of the Commissioner, to deduct any tax payable on any pension or annuity payable out of a superannuation fund established in New Zealand, from instalments of the pension or annuity payable to the non - resident taxpayer recipient.

In view of the inclusion this year (in section 2 of the principal Act) of a specific definition of "superannuation fund" by section 3 of that term being restricted to **approved schemes** only, section 287 could not be applied to payments made from a superannuation category 3 scheme.

Section 287(4) has accordingly been amended to specify that superannuation category 1, 2, and 3 schemes are all types of superannuation schemes to which section 287 can apply.

### Section 39 - Credit for Tax Paid in Country or Territory Outside of New Zealand

This section amends section 293 of the principal Act in respect of the credit allowable for tax paid overseas against income tax payable in New Zealand. Any taxpayer who is resident in New Zealand is liable for New Zealand tax on all income derived (from New Zealand and overseas) while that New Zealand residence continues. Section 293 in its current form provides that credit is to be given against the amount of New Zealand tax payable for all tax paid in an overseas country on income derived in that country.

An amendment to section 293 has become necessary because some overseas countries impose a tax liability on the world income of their citizens and most countries impose a tax liability on the world income of persons who are resident or domiciled in the overseas country irrespective of the fact that they may reside elsewhere. Consequently when New Zealand residents are also citizens of, or resident or domiciled in those overseas countries they are taxed in both countries on their world income. When the overseas country imposes a higher tax liability than that imposed in New Zealand the credit for overseas tax allowed under section 293 extinguishes any New Zealand tax liability. As a result people in this situation do not pay any tax in New Zealand on the overseas income even though they are resident in this country.

These circumstances abrogated the internationally accepted principle that New Zealand has the prime right to tax persons resident in this country on their world income. The amendments to section 293 therefore limit the credit for tax paid overseas, on income subject to New Zealand assessment, to the same amount of tax that would be imposed in the overseas country on a New Zealand resident who was resident or domiciled in, or a citizen of that overseas country. While no person will be subject to any increased taxation liability, the tax paid will be more equitably divided between New Zealand and the overseas country.

In practice, this change only applies to income which is subject to non - resident withholding tax (or its equivalent) in the overseas country, ie, dividends, interest, royalties, etc. Where, as in most situations, an overseas country does not tax its nationals as such, a New Zealand resident who is a national of that country will not incur any further taxation liability in the overseas country. However, where the New Zealand resident is also a citizen of, or resident or domiciled in that overseas country and is taxed as such, the credit allowed in New Zealand will be limited to non resident withholding tax (or its equivalent) levied in that country as if that New Zealand resident had no connections with that country other than that source of income. The examples below outline the "before and after" situation in respect of a New Zealand resident who is also a citizen of a country that taxes the world income of its citizens.

The following countries are known to impose tax on a citizen basis:

*   United States
*   Philippines

When calculating the tax credit allowed in New Zealand for tax paid in these countries, the credit will not exceed the amount of tax which would be levied on a person who is not a citizen of the country. The terms of any Double Taxation Agreement between New Zealand and the country concerned will also be relevant.

**Application Date**

The amendment to section 293 of the principal Act will first apply the allowing of credits of income tax against New Zealand income tax for the income year commencing 1 April 1984.

### Section 40 - Deductions of Tax from Payment Due to Defaulters

This section makes four minor amendments to the provisions of section 400.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts a new definition of "amount payable" to make it quite clear that a notice issued under the section applies not only to amounts which are held or payable to the taxpayer at the time the notice is issued, but also to any moneys which become payable or are held at some future date while the notice remains in force. This has been achieved by expanding the definition to mean:

1.  Any amount payable to the taxpayer, on the date the notice is given, by the person to whom the notice is given.
2.  Any amount payable, or which becomes payable, to the taxpayer by that person on any day in the period following the day on which the notice is given and ending on the day on which the notice is revoked by the Commissioner.
3.  The expanded definition includes, in relation to any bank, any money (including interest thereon) that:
    1.  Is on deposit or is deposited with the bank to the credit of the taxpayer on the day on which the notice is given; or
    2.  Is on deposit or is deposited on any day in the period following the day on which the notice is given and ending on the day on which the notice is revoked.
4.  The definition includes (as was the case before this amendment) deposits with a bank irrespective of whether they are on current account, or so as to bear interest for a fixed term or without limitation of time, and whether the taxpayer has made any application to withdraw or uplift the money. However, it still does not include those accounts which were previously excluded, being:
5.  A Post Office Home Layby Account; or
6.  A Home Ownership Account; or
7.  A Farm Ownership Account;
8.  A Fishing Vessel Ownership Account.

_**Subsection (2)**_ inserts a new subsection (2)(a) to make it quite clear that the amount specified in the notice is the **maximum** amount required to be deducted. This paragraph now provides that the amount to be deducted from an amount payable to the taxpayer specified in the notice is the lesser of:

1.  The amount specified in the notice, or
2.  The amount payable to the taxpayer at the time the deduction is required to be made.

_**Subsection (3)**_ inserts a new subsection (4) into section 400. The effect of the new subsection (4) is to set a minimum amount which is required to be deducted from salary or wages in accordance with the notice. The minimum set is $10 per week, although of course where the final deduction required to be made to clear the amount specified in the notice is less than $10, only that lesser amount is to be deducted.

_**Subsection (4)**_ inserts a new subsection (6) to make it clear that the copy of the original notice sent to the holder of the amount payable, which must be sent to the defaulting taxpayer, must be sent to him **forthwith** upon the issue of the original notice.

### Section 41 - Keeping of Business and Other Records

This section amends section 428 of the principal Act.

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends subsection (3) Of section 428 to make it clear that business records and other specified records are to be kept and **retained** in New Zealand, unless the Commissioner authorises them to be kept and retained outside New Zealand.

_**Subsection (2)**_ states more positively the requirements relating to the retention of records that have been retained under the previous seven year retention period. One of the changes made to section 428 by section 41 or the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1982 was to increase from 7 years to 10 years the period for which business and certain other records are to be kept and retained. That section (41) was stated in that Amendment Act as applying to the keeping of records in the 1983/84 income year (or equivalent accounting year) and to future income (or accounting) years. This left doubt as to whether taxpayers who, on the first day of their 1983/84 year had in their possession earlier year records that they had retained for 7 years, were obliged to **retain** them for a further 3 years.

Section 40(2) of this Amendment Act now adds a new subsection (6) to section 428, to specify that where, on the day this Act received the Governor General's assent, a taxpayer had kept and retained records pursuant to the former 7 year rule and, notwithstanding that he may have already retained those records for 7, or, say, 8 years, he still has them in his possession, those records must be retained until the expiry of the period of 10 years after the end of the income year to which they relate.

Section 40 came into force on the day this Amendment Act received the Governor General's assent.

### Section 42 - Terminating Dates Of Taxation Incentives

This section substitutes a new Third Schedule to the principal Act which sets out the terminating dates for the various tax incentives and allowances.

The terminating dates which have been extended are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | Section of Tax Act | Extended Terminating Date |
| Investment Allowance |     |     |
| Farming and agriculture | 122 | 31 March 1985 |
| Development Expenditure |     |     |
| Farming and agricultural land | 127 | 31 March 1986 |
| Aquaculture\* | 128 | 31 March 1986 |

\*(which embraces rock oyster, mussel, scallop and freshwater fish farming and, by virtue of section 19 of this Amendment Act, sea - cage salmon farming.)

For incentives other than the above, the terminating dates remain the same as they were in the Third Schedule to the Income Tax Act, as amended last year.

This means that the regional, export and fishing investment allowances have now terminated, subject to transitional provisions introduced last year. Similarly, the high priority activity investment allowance has effectively been terminated.

The increased exports and increased exports to new markets incentives have also terminated and these will be repealed on 1 April 1984 (see section 25).

### Part II

### Provisions Relating to Matrimonial Property

### _**Introduction**_

On Budget night (28 July 1985) Parliament passed legislation, introduced that night, to provide an exemption from gift duty and estate duty for certain transfers of property between spouses made in accordance with agreements entered into under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, or transfers made in compliance with Court orders made under section 25 of that Act.

Part II of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1985 now gives extended revenue recognition to the social principles embodied in the Matrimonial Property Act by amending those provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 which have taxation effects that discourage such transfers. These amendments will apply to all property transferred in accordance with agreements or Court orders made under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 on or after 28 July this year.

The principal effect of the amendments is that in future such transfers of income producing property will, as far as is possible, not create a liability for income tax at the time the transfer is made, although of course any profit in excess of the transfer value on the subsequent realisation of the property by the transferee will be included in that person's income for tax purposes.

This facility is achieved by treating depreciable assets as having been disposed of at book value, enabling livestock to pass at standard value where such values are adopted, and permitting other trading stock to be transferred at the higher of the values adopted in the accounts of the transferor and transferee at the time of transfer. Other items of property, such as land, which are held in the taxpayer's accounts at cost price will be treated as having been disposed of at that value.

In other areas where special rules apply, the transferee will as far as possible, be placed in the position previously held by the transferor and subject to the same rules on the eventual sale of the property as would have applied to the transferor.

The effect of each of the amendments is discussed in detail below.

### Section 43 - Interpretation

Section 43 inserts a definition of the expression "matrimonial agreement" in the principal Act.

"Matrimonial agreement" in relation to any two persons, means:

1.  An agreement made on or after the 28th day of July 1983 by those persons under section 21 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976.
2.  An order of the Court made on or after the 28th day of July 1983 in relation to those persons under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976."

It should be noted that in all but one case the legislation contained in Part II of the Amendment Act does not apply to transfers of matrimonial property where the agreement or Court order was made **before** the 28th day of July 1983. The exception is in respect of section 58 of this Amendment Act which deals with pensions payable to former employees. That section applies to any pension **paid** on or after the 28th day of July **irrespective** of when the agreement or Court order was made.

### Section 44 - Items Included in Assessable Income

This section makes two amendments to section 65.

1.  Formerly, section 65(2)(k) provided that where a commercial bill was disposed of, other than by means of a redemption, the difference between the value of that bill on the day of disposal and its cost price was deemed to be assessable income. This meant that a transfer of a commercial bill between spouses in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" would have created a tax liability in the hands of the transferor.
2.  This amendment takes such transfers outside the provisions of that section.
    
    Subsection (3)excludes transfers of commercial bills made in accordance with matrimonial agreements (please see section 43 of this Amendment Act for definition of "Matrimonial Agreement") from those provisions of subsection (2)(k) which deal with disposals other than redemptions. As such transfers are not redemptions, this means that section 65 cannot be applied to the transferor.
    
    When the transferee subsequently redeems or disposes of the bill, person will be deemed to have acquired it at the cost price the transferor, in accordance with the new section 65(1)(b)(ii) (which is inserted by subsection (1) of this amendment).
    
3.  Subsection (2) of this amendment amends section 65(2)(a) of the principal Act by inserting a proviso that where any business is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" the value of the stock on hand shall be the amount that, under the new section 91A, the stock is deemed to have been sold at. (Essentially the greater of the values adopted in the accounts of the transferor and transferee.)
    
    Any excess of the amount at which the transferor is deemed to have sold the stock over the value of the stock recorded in the transferor's accounts will be included in the transferor's assessable income in the normal manner.
    
    For example, assume that a taxpayer who is in business transfers 40 percent of that business under a "matrimonial agreement". The value of the stock on hand to be transferred (determined from the transferor's accounts pursuant to section 85(3)) is $32,000. The amount that, under section 91A, the stock is deemed to have been sold for is $40,000 (the value to be adopted by the transferee because of that person's higher standard values). The amount to be included in the transferor's assessable income in the year of transfer is the difference between the amount at which the stock is valued in the transferor's accounts (pursuant to section 85(3)) and the amount the stock is deemed to have realised upon transfer (pursuant to section 91A), ie, $8,000 ($40,000 - $32,000).
    

### Section 45 - Profits or Gains from Land Transactions

This section adds to section 67 of the principal Act provisions which enable land to which section 67 would otherwise apply to be transferred, under a "matrimonial agreement", at cost price and deems it to have been acquired by the transferor on the date on which it was aquired by the transferor.

1.  A new subsection (9B) has been inserted in section 67 to apply this provision for the purposes of paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (4). Where land has been transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" the position will be that:
    1.  The **transferror** is deemed to have disposed of the land for an amount equal to the amount that would have been taken into account, as being the **cost** price of the land to him, for the purposes of calculating any profit or gain that the transferor would have made had he **sold** that land on the date of transfer.
        *   This "cost" would include the original purchase price plus any expenses capitalised to the land.
        *   The effect of the provision is that the transferor is not liable for income tax on the disposal of the land (in terms of section 67(4)(a) to (e)) as the deemed sale price equals the "cost" price and accordingly there is no "profit or gain" on which to assess income tax.
    2.  The **transferee** is deemed to have acquired the land at the price at which the transferor is deemed to have disposed of it (ie, original cost price plus capitalised expenses).
        *   As far as "cost" is concerned this measure effectively puts the transferee in the same position as the transferor would have been if the transfer had not occurred (see example).
    3.  The transferee is deemed to have acquired the land on the day on which it was acquired by the transferor.
        
        *   This provision is necessary to put the transferee in the same position as the transferor would have been had the transfer not been made. The date of acquisition is of importance in determining whether a taxable situation has occurred, eg, has there been a sale within 10 years of acquisition.
        
        **Example**
        
        |     |     |     |     |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | Spouse X (Transferor) | \- acquires land 1977 |     | $100,000 |
        |     | \- subdivides, etc, 1980 |     | $20,000 |
        |     | \- transfers land to Spouse Y 1983 |     |     |
        |     | (Matrimonial Agreement) land valuation 1983: $200,000 |     |     |
        | Spouse Y (Transferee) | \- subdivides, etc(subsequent to transfer) |     | $20,000 |
        |     | \- sells 1983 |     |     |
        | **Answer** |     |     | $270,000 |
        | Transfer to Y: | disposed of by "X" at "cost" |     | $120,000 |
        |     | acquired by "Y" at the same "price" |     | $120,000 |
        | **X** - "Sale" price |     |     | $120,000 |
        | Less Cost of land |     |     | $120,000 |
        | **Profit/Loss** |     |     | NIL |
        | **Y** - Sale price |     |     | $270,000 |
        | Less | \- Acquisition "price" | $120,000 |     |
        |     | \- Costs of subdivision by Y | $ 20,000 |     |
        |     |     |     | $140,000 |
        | Profit |     |     | $130,000 |
        
        **Had X not transferred the land but carried out the subdivision and subsequently sold**
        
        |     |     |     |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Sale Price |     | $270,000 |
        | Less - Acquisition | $100,000 |     |
        | Costs 1980 | $ 20,000 |     |
        | Costs 1983 | $ 20,000 |     |
        |     |     | $140,000 |
        | Profit |     | $130,000 |
        
2.  **A new subsection (9C)** has been inserted in section 67 to apply to this provision for the purposes of **paragraph (f) of subsection (4)** . Where land has been transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" the position wall be that:
    1.  The **transferror** is deemed to have disposed of the land for an amount equal to the sum of:
        1.  The value of the land at the commencement of the scheme; and
        2.  Expenditure incurred prior to the transfer in carrying out the scheme.
    2.  The **transferee** is deemed to have:
        1.  Incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the land of an amount equal to the value of the land at the commencement of the scheme (when undertaken by the transferor);
        2.  Incurred expenditure in carrying out the scheme of an amount equal to the expenditure incurred by the transferor prior to the transfer in carrying out the scheme.
    3.  Where the transferor had not commenced an undertaking or scheme (within the context of section 67(4)(f) the **transferee** is deemed to have acquired the land at the consideration for which the transfer is deemed (by section (9B(a)) to have disposed of it.

### Section 46 - Benefit from Share Option or Purchase Scheme

Formerly, section 69 of the principal Act provided that an employee was deemed not to have derived a benefit from shares purchased under an employee share purchase scheme provided certain restrictive provisions existed under the scheme to prevent the employee from dealing with the shares so acquired. Those restrictions are specified in the first proviso to subsection (4) of section 69, paragraph (a) of which requires that those restrictive provisions apply for a period ending not earlier than eight years from the end of the income year in which the benefit is deemed to have been received by the taxpayer or not earlier than the date of death of the taxpayer.

Section 46 of this Amendment Act amends subsection (4) by adding a fourth proviso which for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the **first** proviso, provides that where the restrictive provisions relating to any of the shares referred to above do not restrict the taxpayer from transferring those shares in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", but restrict the transferee spouse from disposing of those shares on the same basis as would otherwise have applied to the taxpayer, such a transfer is deemed not to be a breach of the restrictive provisions.

### Section 47 - Income Derived from Use or Occupation of Land

Section 74(3) of the principal Act provides that where any land with standing timber is sold, the sale is deemed to be a sale of timber and the amount of consideration on the sale which is attributable to the timber is to be determined by the Commissioner and taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the vendor and effectively, the purchaser.

To harmonise with the social principles of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 it was necessary to amend this section to provide that where land with standing timber is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" the timber is deemed to have been transferred at cost price.

To achieve this, section 47 of this Amendment Act inserts a new subsection (3A) in section 74 to deem the transfer of any land with standing timber made in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" to be a sale of timber for the purposes of section 74 and in every such case:

1.  The timber is deemed to have been sold at a price equal to the cost of the trees to the transferor, up to the date of transfer, and the consideration so attributable is deemed to be the consideration paid for the timber by the transferee; and
2.  The consideration which is so deemed to be paid for the timber is to be taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the transferor and in calculating the cost of the timber to the transferee.

This means that the transfer will not create a tax liability for the transferor as there will be no profit on the deemed sale of the timber, as the deemed consideration on "sale" will be exactly offset by the cost of the trees to date of transfer.

The proviso to the new subsection (3A) provides that subsection (3A) will not apply to trees used for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business to provide shelter or prevent erosion, or trees planted or maintained under a forestry encouragement agreement entered into under the Forestry Encouragement Act 1962. In other words this applies the same provision as that in section 74(3), that the transfer of such trees does not constitute a sale of timber.

### Section 48 - Sums Received from Sale of Patent Rights

This section amends section 83 of the principal Act which governs the taxation of profits derived from the sale of patent rights and sets out the basis on which the costs of acquiring those rights may be deducted.

This amendment inserts a new subsection (4A) in section 83 to provide taxation rules for the disposition of patent rights under a "matrimonial agreement".

Paragraphs (a) and (c) of subsection (4A) state that:

"(a) The transferor shall be deemed to have sold those patent rights in that income year for a consideration equal to the amount (if any) of the expenditure of the kind referred to in subsection (3)(a) of this section or, as the case may be, of the total cost of the kind referred to in subsection (3)(b) of this section, that has not been allowed as a deduction from the assessable income derived by the transferor." (Subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b) relate respectively to expenditure incurred in devising the invention to which the patent relates, and to the cost of patent rights otherwise acquired by the taxpayer who later sells them.)

"(c) The transferee shall be deemed to have incurred expenditure, in the acquisition of those patent rights in that income year, of an amount equal to the value of the consideration for which, under paragraph (8) of this subsection, they are deemed to have been sold by the transferor."

Paragraph (a) enables the patent rights to be transferred under a "matrimonial agreement" without creating a tax liability at the time of transfer, while paragraph (c) provides effectively that the cost price of the patent right that will be allowable as a deduction to the transferee, should that person subsequently sell the patent, will be an amount equal to so much of the cost, to the transferor of the rights transferred, as has not been allowed as a deduction to the transferor in the income years preceding the year of transfer.

Paragraph (b) provides that no deduction of the amount first mentioned in paragraph (a) is to be allowed from the assessable income derived by the transferor in any income year.

It thus prohibits the transferor from deducting from his assessable income the amount of the cost price to the transferee, as determined under paragraph (a), which is deemed to have been incurred by the transferee in accordance with paragraph (c).

It should be noted, however, that this would not restrict the rights of the transferor to claim a deduction for that portion of the cost of the patent rights which have been retained by him.

**For example** , assume the transferor incurred expenditure of $100,000 in devising an invention, and the Commissioner had agreed pursuant to section 83(3)(a), that the cost should be spread evenly over a ten year period. If that person transferred 40 percent of the rights to his wife in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" after three years, the portion of the cost which had not yet been written off would be $70,000. The effect of this amendment would be that:

1.  The portion of the cost price able to be written off by the husband over the balance of the life of the patent would be $42,000, which would be able to be written off at the rate of $6,000 per annum.
2.  The portion of the cost price able to be written off by the wife over the balance of the life of the patent would be $28,000, which would be able to be written off at the rate of $4,000 per annum.
3.  In the year of transfer, the husband would be entitled to write off costs of $6,000, and the wife $4,000, of the cost price in accordance with (a) and (b) above.

### Section 49 - Standard Value and Nil Value of Livestock

Section 52 of this Amendment Act (discussed later in this PIB) specifies the value at which trading stock (including livestock) is deemed to have been transferred. Section 49 of this Amendment Act amends section 86 of the principal Act by providing rules for the valuation of livestock which has been transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" and should be read in conjunction with section 52.

_**Subsection (1)**_ \- repeals paragraph (d) of subsection (2A). Paragraph (d) provided that the value taken into account by the taxpayer in terms of the progressive 3 year write down to standard value pursuant to subsection (2A) was deemed to be the "standard value adopted or last adopted by the taxpayer ..." for the purposes of section 86 and the other "livestock sections" in the principal Act. This repealed provision is replaced in a new subsection (2C) of section 86.

_**Subsection (2)**_ \- adds a proviso to subsection (2A) to ensure that the acquisition of livestock by way of a transfer in accordance with a matrimonial agreement:

1.  Will **not** of itself constitute the commencing or recommencing to derive income from livestock by the transferee;
2.  **may** , depending on the facts, be regarded as a commencement by the transferee to derive income from livestock, for the purposes of determining whether any subsequent acquisition of livestock by the transferee should be regarded as constituting such a commencement or recommencement, ie, subsequent livestock acquisition may not be regarded as a commencement.

_**Subsection (3)**_ inserts three new subsections in section 86 - A new subsection (2C) which, as mentioned above, replaces the previous paragraph (d) of subsection 2A; a new subsection (2B) which sets out rules for determining the value of livestock to be taken into account pursuant to section 85(2) of the principal Act; and a new subsection (2D) dealing with the acquisition date of land transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement.

(new)_**Subsection (2B)**_

Where a taxpayer acquires livestock by way of a transfer in accordance with a matrimonial agreement the value of that livestock to be taken into account by the taxpayer (transferee) shall be:

1.  Where the taxpayer (the transferee) was, **before** the transfer, deriving income from livestock, the value will be (at the end of the income year in which the transfer occurs):
    *   A value determined by the taxpayer in accordance with section 86 (excluding subsection (2B)(b))
2.  Â 
    *   ie the acquisition will be regarded as a normal purchase of livestock and where the taxpayer is, at the time of the transfer, already "locked into" the progressive write down to standard value, subsection (2A) of section 86 will apply.

2.  Where the taxpayer (the transferee) was **not** , before the transfer deriving income from livestock **and** the transferor was at the time of the transfer "locked into" the progressive writedown in relation to the livestock transferred **and** the taxpayer fixes a standard value in relation to the livestock transferred to him/her, the value will be:
    
    *   Where the livestock transferred were purchased (by the transferor) during the income year -
        1.  At the end of the first income year (the year the transfer is made) - a value not less than cost to the transferor reduced by one - third of the amount by which cost exceeds the standard value of the transferee.
        2.  At the end of the second income year - a value not less than cost to the transferor reduced by two - thirds of the amount by which that cost exceeds the standard value of the transferee.
        3.  At the end of the third income year - the standard value of the transferee.
    
    *   Where the livestock were transferred in the income year immediately succeeding the income year in which they were purchased by the transferor -
        1.  at the end of the income year of transfer - a value not less than cost to the transferor reduced by two - thirds of the amount by which that cost exceeds the standard value of the transferee.
        2.  at the end of the income year after the income year of transfer - the standard value of the transferee.
    *   Where the livestock were transferred in the second income year after the income year in which they were purchased by the transferor - the standard value of the transferee.

**Examples**

Spouse X has been farming for 1 year

Transfers 1,000 sheep to spouse Y

Spouse Y has:

1.  been farming for 5 years
2.  been farming for 1 year
3.  not farmed previously

and has in each case fixed a standard value of $6 per head.

Assume livestock transferred at $18 per head (pursuant to section 52 of this Amendment Act explained later in this PIB).

**Example (a)** Y has been deriving income from farming livestock prior to the income year of transfer, thus subsection (2B)(a) applies (see A above). As Y is not locked into subsection (2A) writedown, the livestock may be written down by Y to standard value $6, in the income year of transfer.

**Example (b)** Although Y has already commenced to derive income from farming livestock, and subsection (2B)(a) thus applies, Y is locked into subsection (2A) because the transfer occurs within the 3 year writedown (to standard value) applicable to Y.

As the livestock were acquired in the second income year (for the purposes of subsection (2A)) the value to be taken into account is cost ($18) reduced by two - thirds of the difference between cost ($18) and standard value ($6).

ie 18 - (2/3 x (18 - 6)) = $10

**Example (c)** As Y has not, prior to the transfer, derived income from farming livestock, subsection (2B)(b) applies (see B above).

Additional information: livestock transferred -

1.  Some in year in which purchased by X.
2.  Some in year following year in which purchased by X.

1.  Subsection (2B)(b)(i) applies ie - Cost, less one - third of the difference between cost and standard value.
2.  18 - (l/3 x (18 - 6))
    
    \= 18 - 4
    
    \= **$14.00**
    
3.  Subsection (2B)(b)(ii) applies ie Cost, less two - thirds of the difference between cost and standard value
4.  18 - (2/3 x (18 - 6))
    
    \= 18 - 8
    
    \= **$10.00**
    
    NB If the livestock had been transferred in the second or third income year following the income year of purchase by X, **or** X had been farming for more than 3 years and so was not locked into the progressive writedown, -
    
    Y would have been able to write the stock down standard value in the year of transfer.
    

(new) _**Subsection (2)(c)**_

As mentioned previously this new subsection replaces paragraph (d) of subsection (2A).

(new) _**Subsection (2D)**_

This subsection provides that land transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement is deemed to have been acquired by the transferee on the day it was acquired by the transferor. This is important in the context of determining whether the section 86(2A) progressive writedown is activated, ie, acquisition of additional land and purchase of livestock in next succeeding three income years.

### Section 50 - Income Derived from Disposal of Trading Stock

Section 90(3) of the principal Act operates where trading stock:

1.  has been disposed of otherwise than by sale; or
2.  has been sold for a consideration other than cash,

and deems a sale to have taken place at market value or such value as the Commissioner determines.

Section 49 of this amendment Act makes it clear that section 90 is **not** to apply where there has been a disposal (transfer) of trading stock in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement". (Section 52 of this Act provides the code for determining the value of trading stock so transferred.)

### Section 51 - Sale of Trading Stock for Inadequate Consideration

Section 91 of the principal Act applies where trading stock is sold or otherwise disposed of without consideration in money or money's worth for a consideration that is less than market price or its true value. It deems the disposal to have taken place at market value or at such value as the Commissioner determines.

Section 51 of this amendment Act makes it clear that section 91 is **not** to apply where there has been a disposal of trading stock in accordance with a matrimonial agreement.

### Section 52 - Alternative Value for Trading Stock Transferred in Accordance with Matrimonial Agreement

This section inserts a new section 91A in the principal Act to govern the value at which trading stock can be transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement". Trading stock in this context includes livestock.

1.  Where the trading stock transferred was:
    *   **used** by the transferor in any business; **and**
    *   **held** by the transferor at the commencement of the income year,
2.  it is deemed to have been sold by the transferor to the transferee on the date of transfer and the sale price is deemed to be the greater of:
    
    1.  The value taken into account, under section 85(2) ("valuation of trading stock including livestock") by the transferor at the end of the preceding income year;
    2.  The value to be taken into account by the transferee at the end of the income year.
    
    **NB** Where the trading stock is livestock the value under (ii) is the standard value fixed in accordance with section 86(2), and where the trading stock is **other than livestock** , the value under (ii) is fixed pursuant to section 85(4).
    

2.  Where the trading stock transferred was:
    *   **used** by the transferor in any business; **and**
    *   **acquired** by the transferor during the income year in which the transfer occurs:
3.  the deemed sale price is the price at which the trading stock was acquired by the transferor.
4.  Where the trading stock transferred was **not** used by the transferor in any business the deemed sale price is the cost price of the trading stock to him.
5.  These measures mean that the transferor disposes of the trading stock at a value which as far as possible equates the value in his accounts so that the transfer does not give rise to a tax liability in his hands. Where the value taken into account by the transferor and the transferee differ, thus giving rise to a tax liability, the liability is raised in respect of the transferor.

4.  Where the transferred trading stock **was** used by the transferor in the carrying on of a business but is **not** used by the transferee in any business and is subsequently sold by the transferee, the sale is deemed to be a sale of trading stock used by the transferee in the carrying on of a business. This provision is necessary to ensure that on ultimate sale of the livestock the realised profit is liable for income tax.
5.  **Examples**
    
    1.  Spouse X has been farming for 10 years and the standard value of his sheep has been fixed at $4 per head. Under a matrimonial agreement 5,000 sheep are transferred to spouse Y.
    2.  Spouse Y has an approved standard value for sheep of $6 per head.
        
        **Answer**
        
        The transfer is deemed to have taken place at the greater of the value taken into account by X, ($4) or the standard value Fixed by Y, ($6).
        
        **Thus $6**
        
        At this value X has generated income of $2 per head ($4 stock on hand: $6 sales), ie, $10,000 at the point of transfer.
        
    3.  Spouse X has been farming for 10 years and has a standard value for sheep of $4.
        
        Under a matrimonial agreement 5,000 sheep are transferred to Spouse Y.
        
        Spouse Y has a standard value of $6 per head. The stock transferred by X were purchased during the income year in which the transfer occurs, for $18 per head.
        
        **Answer**
        
        The transfer is deemed to have taken place at cost to the transferor, ie, $18 per head.
        
        At this value
        
        \- X has no tax liability, ie, purchases equal sales;
        
        \- Y has purchased at 18 per head (eligible for write - down to standard values - see comment on section 49 of this Amendment Act).
        
    
    NB Although these examples are in relation to farmers, the principle is the same for trading stock of other businesses carried on by a transferor.
    

### Section 53 - Revised Assessments where Assets Purchased and Resold after Deduction of Lease Payment

Previously section 107 of the principal Act provided that where a leased asset was sold or disposed of to an associated person, the Commissioner could recover lease payments previously allowed as a deduction (up to the profit on sale). Section 53 of this amendment Act amends section 107 to ensure that where an asset is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", the transferor will not be subject to the recovery provisions.

The amendments made by section 53 are:

*   Subsection (1) deems a transfer of a leased asset, that is made in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", not to be a disposition to which section 107 applies.
*   Subsection (3) deems transfers of assets in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" not to be a disposition to which section 107(3) (which provides for the consideration or disposal of the asset to be determined by the Commissioner in certain circumstances) refers.
*   Subsections (2) and (4) cover the situation where the person to whom the asset is transferred under the "matrimonial agreement" subsequently disposes of the asset.
    *   **Subsection (2)** inserts a new subsection (1A), to provide that where:
        1.  Any person has leased, rented, or hired any asset, being any plant or machinery (including a motor vehicle) or other equipment or a temporary building, and the Commissioner has allowed a deduction, in calculating the assessable income of that person in any income year, for the consideration paid or given in respect of that lease, rental, or hire; and
        2.  That person (or any other person where that person and that other person are associated persons) at any time purchases or otherwise acquires that asset; and
        3.  That person (or that other person) who purchases or otherwise acquires that asset (referred to as the "transferor") at any time transfers that asset to any further person (referred to as the "transferee") in accordance with a matrimonial agreement; and
        4.  The transferee sells or otherwise disposes of that asset for a consideration in excess of the amount at which, under the new paragraph (c) in subsection (3), that asset is deemed to have been sold by the transferor,
    *   the Commissioner may recover the excess as being assessable income of the **transferee** . The recovery is limited to the lesser of the excess or the total amount of the deductions allowed to the transferor in calculating his assessable income.
    *   **Subsection (4)** adds a further paragraph, paragraph (c), to section 107(3) which provides that where the asset is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", it is deemed to have been transferred at book value or, if the transfer takes place in the same income year that the asset was acquired by the transferor, then at cost price. In effect, this deems the transferee to have incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the asset, which in turn enables the Commissioner to determine (in the event of the asset being sold by the transferee) any profit on sale for the purposes of the new subsection (1A).

### Section 54 - Depreciation Allowance where Asset Acquired by Taxpayer as a Result of a Transfer Under a Matrimonial Agreement

This section inserts a new section 111A into the Act to govern the allowance of depreciation in respect of assets transferred in accordance with "matrimonial agreements". Effectively, it permits:

*   Assets to be transferred at book value;
*   The transferee to claim the same depreciation allowance as would have been available to the transferor if the transferor had retained the asset.

The legislation achieves these ends, for the purposes of all sections of the Act relating to the allowance of depreciation (sections 108 to 110 and 112 to 116), by providing that each of those sections shall apply as if:

1.  The transferee had incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the asset of an amount equal to the price at which the transferor is deemed to have disposed of it.
    1.  The transferee had, where appropriate, met the same requirements (for depreciation to be allowable) as to purchase, acquisition, erection, etc, as were met by transferor. For example, if the asset was altered by transferor, that alteration will be deemed to have been carried out by the transferee for the purposes of post - transfer depreciation allowances (eg, for the purposes of section 112(2)(i) which relates to buildings that are obliged to meet hygiene requirements for export fish processing or storing).
    2.  Where the asset was new when it was purchased, acquired or erected by the transferor, it was new when it was acquired by the transferee, (eg, for the purposes of section 112(2)(a) which relates to new plant and machinery purchased for business purposes).

The first proviso to the new section 111A ensures that the transferee cannot claim a greater depreciation deduction than that which would have been available to the transferor had he retained the asset, while the second proviso requires the Commissioner to allow depreciation, on any **building** transferred, on the basis of original cost price to the transferor, not the deemed transfer value.

It should be noted that these amendments simply place the transferee in the position of the transferor in regard to purchase, erection, alteration, etc, of the asset, and depreciation allowed in respect of it, in the period up to the point of transfer. They do not mean that the transferee is automatically entitled to the same deductions for depreciation, post - transfer, as could have been claimed by the transferor had the asset not been transferred. The transferee must still meet in his or her own right the other tests contained in the various sections dealing with depreciation (in particular, he or she must use the asset in the production of his or her assessable income before he or she can have any entitlement to depreciation allowances).

For example, assume a taxpayer engaged in a farming or agricultural business installed new plant and machinery to be used wholly for the purposes of that business, but transferred that plant or machinery, in the year of its purchase, under a "matrimonial agreement". (If the asset had not been transferred, the transferor would have been entitled to first year depreciation under section 112(2)(c).) Although, for the purposes of that section, the transferee will be deemed to have installed new farming or agricultural plant or machinery, that person must use that plant or machinery in a farming or agricultural business for paragraph (c) of section 112(2) to apply. If the transferee used that plant or machinery in any other business, then it would need to be considered under the provisions of section 112(2)(a).

### Section 55 - Revised Assessment where Assets Sold after Deduction of Depreciation Allowances

Section 117 enables the Commissioner to recover depreciation previously allowed as a deduction, where an asset is disposed of at a profit. Section 117 is amended by section 55 of this Amendment Act to provide special rules where an asset is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" (as defined - please see comments on section 43 of the amendment Act). Specifically, section 55 inserts a new subsection (6A) to section 117, which provides that:

*   The provisions of subsection (5) of section 117, which enable the Commissioner to determine the consideration for the sale in certain circumstances, will not apply in cases of such transfers. (The words "notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this section" in the first two lines of the new subsection (6A) are relevant).
*   The asset is deemed to have been disposed of by the transferor at the book value in the accounts at the commencement of the year of transfer. Where the asset was purchased by the transferor in the year of transfer, it is deemed to have been transferred at that purchase price (subsection (6A)(a)).
*   The transferee is deemed to have been allowed a deduction for depreciation of that asset of an amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts of depreciation allowed thereon to the transferor (subsection (6A)(b)).

The effect of these amendments is that where such a transfer of an asset takes place, no depreciation is recoverable to the transferor as the asset is treated as having been disposed of at the lesser of book value or cost price. If the transferee subsequently disposes of the asset for an amount in excess of the transfer value, depreciation is recoverable (to the transferee) up to the combined total of that allowed to the transferor and transferee.

For example, assume a taxpayer has owned an asset for five years. It cost $1,000 and as at 31 March 1984 it had a book value of $590. The asset is transferred on 28 April 1984 in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" at the book value of $590 and over the next two years the transferee claims depreciation of $112. On 25 May 1986 the transferee sells the asset for $900. The transferee would be assessable under section 117 not only for the depreciation written off by him (or her), but also in respect of $310 of the depreciation allowed to the transferor but deemed, in accordance with the new subsection 6A(b), to have been allowed to the transferee.

### Section 56 - General Provisions Relating to Investment Allowances

Section 118 of the principal Act sets out the general provisions applicable to all the investment allowances to which sections 119 to 123 apply. Subsection (3) of section 118 enables the commissioner to disallow any investment allowance, which would otherwise be allowable, in respect of an asset which is disposed of within 12 months of the date of its first use by the taxpayer.

**Section 56(1)** of this Amendment Act inserts a proviso in section 118(3) which provides that subsection (3) will not apply where the asset is transferred under a "matrimonial agreement". (But see note on new subsection (11) below.)

_**Subsection (2)**_ of section 56 inserts two new subsections, (10) and (11) in section 118. These new subsections set out the provisions which are to apply to the transfer of assets made in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" (as defined - see comments on section 43 of the Amendment Act).

The new subsection (10) provides that where the transfer takes place **in the income year** in which the asset was acquired, installed or extended by the transferor:

1.  The transferee shall be deemed to have acquired, (or installed or extended) that plant or machinery on the day on which it was acquired (or installed or extended) by the transferor.
2.  The transferee shall be deemed to have first used that plant or machinery:
    *   in the production of his/her assessable income; and
    *   in the same manner as it was first used by the transferor in the production of his assessable income,on the day it was first so used by the transferor;
3.  The transferee shall be deemed to have incurred (in the income year in which that transfer is made) capital expenditure in acquiring, installing, or extending that plant or machinery, of an amount equal to the amount of the expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the transferor in acquiring, installing, or extending that plant or machinery;
4.  That plant or machinery shall, where it was new when it was acquired, (or installed or extended) by the transferor, be deemed to be new on the date on which it was acquired by the transferee as a result of the said transfer;
5.  The transferor shall not be entitled to any deduction under any of sections 119 to 123 of this Act in respect of any of the capital expenditure incurred by him which is, under paragraph (c) of this subsection, deemed to have been incurred by the transferee.

**For example** , assume a taxpayer engaged in a farming or agricultural business, installed new plant or machinery, at a cost of $100,000, to be used wholly for the purposes of the business, but transferred a 40 percent interest in that plant or machinery in the year of installation under a "matrimonial agreement". If the asset had not been transferred, the transferor would have qualified for an investment allowance on that $100,000 pursuant to section 122.

The new subsection (10) enables the transferee to qualify for the section 122 allowance on $40,000 of the cost of the asset by deeming that person:

1.  To have installed that plant or machinery on the day it was installed by the transferor. (For the purposes of subsection (3) of section 122.)
2.  To have first used that plant or machinery primarily and principally and directly in and for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand. (For the purposes of subsections (1) and (3) of section 122.)
3.  To have installed NEW plant or machinery (where it was new when installed by the transferor), on the day it was installed by the transferor. (For the purposes of subsection (3) of section 122.)
4.  To have incurred expenditure of a capital nature of $40,000, in the installation of that plant or machinery. (For the purposes of subsection (3) of section 122.)

Finally, paragraph (e) of subsection (10) prevents the transferor from claiming any deduction under section 122 in respect of the 40 percent interest transferred.

The overall effect is that the transferor is entitled to investment allowance on $60,000 and the transferee to investment allowance on $40,000.

The new subsection (11) provides that where:

1.  As a result of any transfer made in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement", any plant or machinery is transferred **in the income year next succeeding the income year** in which that plant or machinery was acquired, installed, or extended by the transferor; and
2.  The transferee sells, disposes of, or otherwise ceases to use that plant or machinery (being plant or machinery in respect of which the transferor has been allowed a deduction by way of an investment allowance) in the production of assessable income in New Zealand within 12 months after the date on which the plant or machinery was first so used by the transferor;

the Commissioner may disallow the deduction allowed to the transferor.

Subsection (11) in effect treats the sale of the asset by the transferee within 12 months of the date on which the asset was first used by the transferor, as a disposition by the **transferor** to which section 118(3) would otherwise have applied. It enables the Commissioner to disallow the claim made by the **transferor** .

### Section 57 - Certain Expenditure Relating to Energy Conservation

This section amends section 125 of the principal Act which allowed a 100 percent write - off of certain capital expenditure relating to energy conservation incurred on or before 31 March 1982. Although the deduction is no longer available (except in situations where a binding contract for the purchase of a qualifying asset was entered into on or before 31 March 1982), subsection (4) of section 125 still applies to ensure that where any asset for which a deduction has been allowed is disposed of within five years of the date of acquisition by the taxpayer, the sale price is treated as assessable income of the vendor, up to the original cost of the asset.

This amendment provides that where any asset, in respect of which a deduction for energy conservation expenditure has been allowed under section 125, is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" subsection (4) will not apply to the transfer but the **transferee** will be assessable on the proceeds of any sae made within five years after the date of **acquisition by the transferor** . In addition, the section enables the deduction for energy conservation expenditure to be claimed by the transferee should any asset, in respect of which the transferor could have claimed the deduction through having entered into a binding contract for its purchase, be transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement". These are achieved as follows:

*   _**Subsection (1)**_ of section 57 inserts a proviso to subsection (4) of section 125 to provide that the subsection shall not apply to transfers of assets made in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement".
*   _**Subsection (2)**_ inserts new subsections(4B) and (4C). _**Subsection (4B)**_ provides that where an asset is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" in the year it was acquired by the transferor:
    1.  The transferee is deemed to have acquired it on the day it was acquired by the transferor.
    2.  If the asset was new when it was acquired by the transferor, it is deemed to have been new on the date on which it is acquired by the transferee.
    3.  The transferee is deemed to have incurred the same capital expenditure in the acquisition of the asset as was incurred by the transferor.
*   The effect of this new subsection is that where the transferor has satisfied the transitional binding contract provisions relating to the termination of the section 125 deduction, and the asset is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" in the year of purchase, then the provisions of section 125 will apply as though the words "(not being qualifying expenditure incurred after the 31st day of March 1982)" in subsection (2) were omitted, and as though the transferee had incurred capital expenditure on the purchase of that new asset on the date on which it was acquired by the transferor. This means that if the transferee meets the other provisions of the section, the transferee will be eligible for the 100 percent write - off of the qualifying energy conservation expenditure.

*   The new _**subsection (4C)**_ provides that where an asset, in respect of which the cost price has been allowed as a deduction to the transferor under section 125, is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement":
    1.  The transferor is deemed to have disposed of it for nil value;
    2.  The transferee is deemed to have acquired the asset for nil value;
    3.  Where the asset is disposed of by the transferee within five years of its purchase by the transferor, the consideration received on that disposal is assessable income of the transferee in the year of disposal.
*   The proviso then limits the amount assessable under (c) above to an amount equal to the original cost price to the transferor.

### Section 58 - Revised Assessments Where Land or Fish Farms or Certain Assets Sold Within 10 Years of Acquisition after Deductions in Respect of Certain Expenditure

Section 129 of the principal Act was substituted last year to give effect to the 1982 Budget proposals relating to sales of property (and certain assets) within 10 years of acquisition. It provides for the recovery of deductions allowed for:

1.  farm development expenditure, and
2.  certain development assets; and
3.  certain interest payments.

Section 58 of this Amendment Act varies the general rules under section 129, in cases of transfers of land and assets in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement".

The transfer of land in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" constitutes a "disposal" for the purposes of section 129. Prior to this amendment the disposal would have been deemed to have taken place at market value and the transferor would have been subject to the recovery provisions of section 129 on what in essence would have been an unrealised profit. The transferee would have been deemed to have acquired the land on the day of the transfer and the 10 year ownership period in relation to the transferee would have run from that time.

The amendments made in section 57 overcome this situation in regard to "matrimonial agreement" transfers by providing rules for the valuation of land and other assets referred to in section 129 and deeming the land or asset to have been acquired by the transfers on the day it was **acquired** by the transferor.

_**Subsection (1)**_ \- inserts a new subsection (3A) to apply where assets (other than land) in respect of which a deduction has been allowed under section 127 or section 128 are transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" (eg irrigation plant installed by farmers; pontoons, rafts and buoys acquired by mussel farmers).

The transferee is deemed to have:

1.  acquired the asset on the day it was acquired by the transferor; and
2.  acquired the asset at a cost equal to the cost to the transferor; and
3.  been allowed a deduction under section 127 or section 128 equal to the deduction allowed to the transferor in respect of the asset.

These provisions ensure that:

1.  In the event of subsequent disposal by the transferee, the 10 year recovery period runs from the date the asset was acquired by the transferor and **not** from the date of transfer;
2.  At the point of transfer, the transferor disposes of the asset at its cost to him and therefore derives no profit which can activate recovery of development expenditure or interest under section 129;
3.  If the asset is sold by the transferee within 10 years after it was purchased by the transferor, the transferee will be subject to recovery of the development expenditure and/or interest allowed as a deduction to the transferor.

_**Subsection (2)**_ \- inserts a new subsection (7A) to apply where **land** , whether **with** or **without** any improvements, is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement".

The transferee is deemed to have:

1.  Acquired the land on the day on which it was acquired by the transferor; and
2.  Acquired it at a price equal to the aggregate of the amounts of expenditure referred to in section 129(2)(c) and (d)
3.  ie original cost plus capitalised expenditure;
    
    **AND**
    
4.  Been allowed a deduction for interest and a deduction for development expenditure equal to the deduction(s) so allowed, in respect of or in relation to that land, to:
    1.  the transferor; or
    2.  any other person (being an associated person of the transferor); or
    3.  the transferor and that other person.

These measures have the same effect as that explained above in relation to the new subsection (3A) of section 129 (see comment on subsection (1) of this amending section).

**Example**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spouse X | \- purchased farm property 18.1.77 |     |
|     | Cost | $115,000 |
|     | \- Deducted farm development expenditure (s 127) | $15,000 |

Property transferred in accordance with matrimonial agreement 6.8.83 to Spouse Y.

New subsection (7A) deems the property to have been acquired by Y on **18.1.77** ((7A)(a)(i)) at a price equal to $115,000 ((7A)(a)(ii)). Further, Y is deemed to have incurred, and to have been allowed a deduction of, $15,000 development expenditure ((7A)(b)).

If Y sells the farm **before** 18.1.87 at a profit, ie within 10 years of acquisition, the $15,000 development expenditure will be recoverable.

_**Subsection (3)**_ amends section 129(9)(e)(i), by substituting for the former reference therein to section 25(2) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, a reference to section 25(l) of that Act.

### _**General**_

In regard to orders made under the Matrimonial Property Act 1963: ie where a widow or widower obtains a Court order **after the death** of a spouse, there are already provisions in section 129 that give tax relief. Section 129(9)(b) would exclude the disposition of land or an asset by the trustees in terms of the Court order, while subsection (9)(c) or (9)(d) could apply to a disposition by the surviving partner where the requirements of those subsection 8 are satisfied.

### Section 59 - Pensions Payable to Former Employees

Under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 a pension right is matrimonial property and as such is capable of being divided between both spouses.

Section 151 of the principal Act enables employers to gain a deduction for pensions paid to former employees. It does not however permit a deduction for pensions paid to the spouses of living former employees. To harmonise with the Matrimonial Property concept it was necessary to amend this section to enable the employer to continue to be entitled to a deduction where he is required to divide a pension between spouses in terms of a "matrimonial agreement".

Section 59 of this Amendment Act accordingly adds to section 151(1) a provision that where a pension payment is divided between spouses in terms of a "matrimonial agreement" the provisions of subsection (1) are to apply in the same manner and to the same extent as if the payment had been made in full to the former employee.

This section applies to all such payments made on or after 28 July 1983 irrespective of the date on which the agreement or Court order was made.

### Section 60 - Losses Incurred May be Set Off Against Future Profits

Section 188 of the principal Act provides that in order that losses of a company may be carried forward and set off against income derived in later years, a 40 percent common shareholding test must be met. This amendment ensures that a change of shareholding arising from a transfer of shares pursuant to a matrimonial agreement will not affect the continuity of shareholding required under section 188(7).

The amendment adds a new paragraph (c) to section 188(7) to provide that where the 40 percent test set out in paragraph (a) is not met (for reasons other than those set out in paragraph (b) of that subsection), the losses will still be able to be offset against profits of the relevant later year where the failure to meet that test was caused by the fact that the shares responsible had been transferred in accordance with a matrimonial agreement.

### Section 61 - Loss Incurred in Specified Activity

This section amends section 188A of the principal Act in two respects, to cater for transfers of land in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement": the first relates to the transfer of land upon which the transferor conducted an "established activity"; the second to transferred land on which the transferee commences to conduct a specified activity.

### _**Subsection (1) - Established Activity**_

The term "established activity" (as enacted in 1982) means any specified activity (or activities) currently conducted by an "existing farmer", where the conduct of that activity on 11 October 1982 constituted that taxpayer's livelihood and sole or principal source of income. That definition is now amended to include also the situation where land upon which an "existing farmer" conducts an "established activity" is transferred (by way of "matrimonial agreement") to another person who also is an existing farmer and who continues to conduct that specified activity on that land.

In order that a specified activity may, in any income year, constitute an "established activity" conducted by the transferee, the following conditions must be met:

1.  The land upon which that activity is conducted by the transferee must have been acquired by the transferee by way of a "matrimonial agreement" (made on or after 28 July 1983); and
2.  The transferee must, in relation to that income year, be an "existing farmer"; and
3.  The transferor must have conducted that activity on 11 October 1982 **and** it must have constituted his livelihood and sole or principal source of income on that date.

Note, in regard to paragraph (c), that where the transferor conducted, immediately before the transfer, 2 or more specified activities that **together** constituted an "established activity" in relation to **him** , the specified activity transferred to, and thereafter conducted by, the transferee need be only 1 of those specified activities. However, where, immediately before the transfer, the transferor conducts any combination of specified activities **and** non - specified activities, the requirements of paragraph (c) above will not be met - the transferred specified activity conducted thereafter by the transferee will **not** constitute therefore an "established activity" in relation to the transferee.

Where all of the requirements specified at paragraphs (a) to (c) above are met, the transferred specified activity conducted by the transferee will, in relation to him/her, constitute an established activity in any income year in relation to which the transferee qualifies as an "existing farmer". Accordingly, that "established activity" will not, in relation to that income year, be subject to the loss - containment provisions in section 188A(7) - see section 188A(6).

In no case will be above provisions apply where the specified activity conducted on the land transferred consists of the deriving of rents, etc - see paragraph (i) of the definition of "specified activity" - as that specified activity is specifically debarred for the purposes of both the "existing farmer" and "established activity" definitions.

### _**Subsection (2) - Specified Activity. Commenced by Transferee on Transferred Land**_

This subsection inserts a new subsection (4A) into section 188A of the Tax Act. The new subsection provides that where a taxpayer has acquired land pursuant to a "matrimonial agreement" and subsequently commences to conduct a specified activity on that land, the taxpayer shall, for the purposes of section (4) of section 188A, be deemed to have acquired that land on the date on which it was originally acquired by the transferor.

Subsection (4) enables an "existing farmer" to diversify into a specified activity (that is different from every other specified activity carried on at time of diversification) that is conducted on land that has been held by him for **five years** preceding the date of commencing to diversify, without that new specified activity being subject to the $10,000 loss containment provision.

The new subsection (4A) enables the recipient of land that is transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" to receive the benefit of this "5 year holding period" treatment where that transferee diversifies into a specified activity (that is different from every other specified activity conducted by that person at the time of diversification or conducted by the transferor at the point of transfer under the "matrimonial agreement" - see comment below on proviso to subsection (4A) - and that diversification specified activity is conducted on land held by the transferor and subsequently by the transferee for an aggregate period of at least five years.

**The proviso to subsection (4A)** ensures that the transferee cannot gain, through this "5 year holding period" treatment, a greater advantage than would otherwise have been available to the transferor had he retained that land. The proviso restricts the application of this new subsection (4A) to new specified activities which the transferee commences to conduct on the transferred land AND which are different from every specified activity carried on by the transferor on that land immediately prior to the transfer.

### Section 62 - Resident Mining Operators

Section 62 amends section 220 of the principal Act to stipulate the income tax consequences where assets are transferred **from** a resident mining operator in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement" and where assets are transferred **to** a resident mining operator in accordance with such an agreement.

The general effect of the amendments is briefly that:

*   The transferred asset is deemed to have been disposed of at the value (if any) at which it stands in the transferor's accounts immediately prior to the transfer.
*   The transferee is deemed to have acquired the asset at that value;
*   If the transferee subsequently disposes of that asset he/she is taxable on any profit on disposal, irrespective of whether, during the period of tenure of that asset, the transferee is a resident mining operator.

It should also be noted that where the asset transferred is one in respect of which depreciation has been written off by the transferor, the provisions of the new section IIIA and section 117(6A) apply in relation to the transferee in regard to the depreciation originally allowed as a deduction to the transferor.

A new subsection (7A), which is inserted in section 220 by section 62 of this Amendment Act, contains the following provisions in respect of any asset which is so transferred in accordance with a "matrimonial agreement":

1.  Where the **transferor** is a **resident mining operator** who, immediately before the transfer, has used the asset in deriving assessable income from mining, the asset is deemed to have been transferred for the lesser of:
    1.  Cost price.
    2.  Book value, where that asset is one in respect of which depreciation has been allowed as a deduction, eg, plant or machinery used in general office administration.
    3.  Where the cost of the asset has been written off under section 220 as exploration or development expenditure, the amount (if any) of the cost that has **not** been allowed as a deduction to the transferor. In most instances this amount will be "Nil".
2.  Where paragraph (a) applies to the transferor, the transferee is deemed to have incurred the same amount of expenditure in acquiring the asset as the amount for which the transferor is deemed, under (a), to have disposed of it.
3.  Where the **transferor** is a **resident mining operator** who transferred a mining asset in respect of the cost of which he has claimed a deduction by way of exploration or development expenditure, and the asset is transferred to a transferee who is **not** a resident mining operator, then the following provisions apply when the **transferee** subsequently disposes of the asset:
    1.  The transferee is deemed to be a resident mining operator in relation to that disposal;
    2.  The disposal is deemed to be one to which, in relation to subsections 12, 13 and 14 of section 216, subsection 7 of section 220 applies. (In effect, the transferee is taxable on the full amount of the consideration for the disposal.)
    3.  The consideration receivable for the purposes of section 216 is deemed to be the amount by which the disposal price exceeds the transfer value as determined under paragraph (a)(iii) above. (In effect the transferee is taxable on the excess of disposal price over the amount that was the value at point of transfer to him/her.)
4.  Where the **transferee** is, immediately prior to the transfer, a **resident mining operator** that person is deemed to have incurred expenditure in the acquisition of the asset of an amount equal to the lesser of:
    1.  The original cost price to the transferor;
    2.  The latest book value in the accounts of the transferor, where that asset is one in respect of which depreciation has been allowed as a deduction,
    3.  Where the cost of the asset has been written off under section 220 as exploration or development expenditure, the amount (if any) of the cost that has not been allowed as a deduction to the transferor.
5.  Where paragraph (d)(iii) applies, the **transferee** is deemed to have acquired the asset as a result of exploration or development expenditure incurred by the transferee, for the purposes of subsections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of section 216. (In essence, this entitles the **transferee** to claim a deduction by way of exploration or development expenditure in respect of the amount of the deemed value (if any) at which the asset is transferred to him/her, and for the **transferee** to be taxable on any consideration received on any subsequent disposal of the asset.)

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1986
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1986 from PIB vol 154 Aug 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 154, August 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
Â 

This Act gives effect to a number of the announcements made by the Minister in his 1986 Budget, which was delivered on the 31 July 1986 including:

*   The cessation of the cost limitation for motorcar depreciation.
*   The termination of the majority of the accelerated depreciation allowances.
*   The cessation of certain petroleum and mineral mining concessions.
*   The reduction in the rate of National Superannuitant Surcharge.

This Act also includes amendments relating to export incentives and to the Family Support delivery mechanism. (Part II of this Act).

**Note**

An amendment incorporated during the Committee stages of the Bill concerns the withdrawal of the one-third deduction on calls and subscriptions on petroleum and mineral mining shares. Whereas the Budget stated that the withdrawal would apply to payments made after Budget date, the Bill as enacted provides a cut off date of 30 September 1986 for Payments made on or before that date provided the call has been made on or before 31 July 1986. This measure effectively provides for commitments entered into ie, calls made on or before Budget date.

Various application dates apply to the different sections of this Act and care should be taken in ensuring the correct dates are used, particularly in view of the fact that a number of transitional measures have also been included. The Amendment Act received the Governor-General's assent on 6 August 1986 and is now law.

Section 1 - Short Title
-----------------------

**_Subsection (1)_** of this section provides that this Act shall be known as the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1986 and is to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

**_Subsection (2)_** provides that the provisions of this Amendment Act first apply with effect from 1 August 1986, unless otherwise stated in the Act. It is therefore important to check the commencement date when applying any of the amending sections, and it should be noted that various subsections may have different application dates.

A number of transitional measures have also been inserted into various sections for binding contracts or agreements entered into prior to the date of termination. These should be reviewed when applying any of the sections.

Section 2 - Rebate Of Tax Payable In Respect Of Certain Offshore Petroleum Mining Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 42A of the principal Act by repealing, FROM THE INCOME YEAR COMMENCING 1 APRIL 1986, the 10 percent rebate of tax payable in respect of assessable income derived from a deep-sea petroleum mining licence.

The 1986 income year will be the final year for which the rebate is allowable to petroleum mining companies and non-resident mining operators.

Section 3 - Rebate From Tax On Dividends Derived From Assessable Income From Petroleum Mining
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 47A of the principal Act by repealing, FROM 1 AUGUST 1986, the 20 percent rebate of tax on dividends paid out of assessable income from petroleum mining.

The rebate will apply only to dividends paid up to and including 31 July 1986 and not to dividends paid after that date.

Section 4 - Depreciation Allowances, Etc, On Motorcars
------------------------------------------------------

This section gives effect to the Budget announcement that the $11,000 cost limitation on motorcars for depreciation purposes is to be repealed with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1987.

For cars purchased during the 1988 income year and in any future year, the depreciation will be based on the actual expenditure incurred in the acquisition of the vehicle, ie, the cost price. This amount will also include all costs incurred in the installation of alternative fuel systems, as section 114B (which provided for depreciation on alternative fuel systems) will also terminate in respect of cars purchased after the end of the 1987 income year. Depreciation on these motorcars will be deductible, subject to adjustment for private use, under section 108 of the principal Act.

For cars purchased PRIOR to the 1988 income year and which were subject to the provisions of section 110, a formula has been inserted to enable the depreciation claimed in any year after the 1987 income year to be equal to that which would have been claimed had the limitation on cost not applied. Taxpayers will use the formula to calculate a deemed cost price for the purposes of calculating annual depreciation. This deemed cost price will also be used for calculating any amount of depreciation to be recovered under section 117 when the motorcar is sold and for the purposes of calculating any loss on disposal of the motorcar.

**_Subsection (2)_** of section 4 inserts the formula into section 110 by introducing a new subsection (3A). This formula, which calculates a deemed cost price of the motorcar, is:

|     |
| --- |
| X Ã (Y - Z) |
| (Y + Z) |

X =the "expenditure" incurred in acquiring the motorcar.

**Note:** "expenditure" is defined in section 110 for the purposes of that section. It is the cost price of the motorcar less any amount that was allowed as a deduction under section 125 (energy conservation expenditure) or which was "qualifying expenditure" (which may have been less than actual cost) under section 114B for the assembly-line costs of alternative fuel systems.

Section 114B will terminate at the same time as section 110. It will cease to apply in respect of vehicles acquired during or after the 1988 income year.

Y =the specified cost (as defined in section 110(1)) that was applicable when the motorcar was acquired (for example, $11,000 if acquired on, say, 10 February 1985 but $8,000 if acquired on 10 February 1980).

Z =the sum of the amounts of depreciation claimed, or which could have been claimed had there not been any adjustments for private use and had the full allowance been claimed each year. This is the amount of depreciation that would have been allowable as a deduction on the motorcar had it been used 100 percent for business purposes and had the taxpayer claimed the maximum depreciation allowable within the constraints imposed by section 110. The calculation does not necessarily use the depreciation actually allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer.

This formula gives a deemed cost price of the motorcar. To determine the book value which will be used to calculate the depreciation claim for the year, the actual accumulated depreciation (depreciation claimed as a deduction plus that added back for private use) is deducted from the deemed cost price. Depreciation for 1988 and future years will be allowable on this book value at the rate of 20 percent on a diminishing value basis. Depreciation recovered and losses on sale will be calculated on the basis the deemed cost price and book value for sales made in 1988 and future years.

**Examples:**

*   (a) Motorcar purchased 21 April 1982 for $15,000 and used 100 percent for business.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Book value as at 31 March 1987 | $3,605 |
| Accumulated depreciation to 31 March 1987 | $7,395 |

To Calculate the 1988 Depreciation

Firstly, calculate the deemed cost in accordance with the formula

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \=  | 15,000 x (11,000-7,395) | \+ 7,395 |
|     | 11,000 |     |

\= $4,916 + $7,395

\= $12,311

Secondly, calculate the book value at the commencement of the 1988 income year

\= $12,311 - $7,395

\= $4,916

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1988 Depreciation = | $4,916 | @ 20 percent |
| \=  | $983 |     |

Book value as at the end of the 1988 income year

\= $4,916 - $983

\= $3,933

To Calculate 1989 Depreciation

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Book value 1 April 1988 | $3,933 |
| less 20 percent depreciation | $787 |
| Book value 1 April 1989 | $3,146 |

*   (b) New car purchased 20 June 1985 for $20,000 (of which $1,200 is qualifying expenditure for the purposes of section 114B). The vehicle is used 50 percent for business.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Book value as at 31 March 1987 |     | $7,040 |
| Total Depreciation claimed |     | $1,980 |
| Private Adjustments |     | $1,980 |
| The vehicle was sold on 5 July 1988. Assume that the sale price was: | (i) | $18,000 |
|     | (ii) | $5,000 |

Deemed cost in terms of section 110(3A) is

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \=  | 18,800 x (11,000 - 3,960) | \+ 3,960 |
|     | 11,000 |     |

\= $15,992

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book value as at 1 April 1987 on motor-car |     | On Fuel System (Section 114B) |     |
|     | $15,992 - $3,960 | \=  | $ 768 |
| \=  | $12,032 |     |     |
| 1988 Depreciation on motorcar |     | On Fuel System |     |
|     | $12,032 @ 20 percent |     | $768 @ 20% |
|     | $2,406 less 50 percent |     |     |
|     | adjustment for private use | \=  | $154 less 50% |
|     | $1,203 | \=  | $ 77 |
| Book value as at 31 March 1988 on motorcar |     | On Fuel System |     |
| \=  | $12,032 - $2,406 | \=  | $768 - $154 |
| \=  | $9,626 | \=  | $ 614 |

Section 5 - First Year Depreciation Allowance On Plant And Machinery And On Certain Buildings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5 gives effect to the Budget announcement of the Government's decision to terminate the first year depreciation allowances. Two of these terminated on Budget night whilst others will continue to apply until 31 March 1988. A number of transitional provisions have also been inserted.

The effect of each of the transitional provisions is to deem the expenditure to have been incurred prior to the date of termination. They do not deem the assets to be qualifying assets nor do they deem the expenditure, plant, etc, to meet any of the other requirements of the section. It should also be noted that the claim for the first year depreciation allowance can only be made in the year the asset is first used in producing assessable income, not the year in which the asset is acquired. etc, or the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Therefore it is important to ensure that the claim is made only in the year the asset is so used and that no claim is made in respect of assets first used after 31 March 1990.

For capital expenditure incurred after the termination date for any first year depreciation allowance, only ordinary depreciation will be allowed under section 108 of the principal Act.

**Note**

The references In the legislation are to fixed dates, not to income years. For example, the legislation applies in respect of binding contracts entered into on or before 31 March 1988, not to binding contracts entered into prior to the end of the 1988 income year. Similarly, the assets must be first used on or before 31 March 1990, not prior to the end of the 1990 income year.

1.  First Year Depreciation Allowances terminated on Budget night in respect of expenditure incurred after that date:
    1.  The allowance for new and secondhand plant and machinery used in a business, other than that used in a farming or fishing business - section 112(2)(a) and (b).
        *   Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 112(2) no longer include plant and machinery acquired for use in a fishing business. Expenditure on such plant and machinery has been included in subsections (c) and (d) and will be treated the same as for plant and machinery acquired for use in a farming business (ie the amendment enables the later terminating date of 31 March 1988 to apply to plant and machinery used in a fishing business).
        *   Two transitional provisions have been inserted into section 112 in relation to expenditure incurred after 31 July 1986 in the acquisition of plant and machinery to which subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) apply:
            *   **_Subsection (3A)_** of section 112 provides that where a taxpayer has, on or before 31 July 1986. entered into a binding contract for the purchase of plant and machinery to which subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) apply, the first year depreciation allowance will continue to apply provided that plant and machinery is acquired or installed within a reasonable period after Budget night.
            *   **_Subsection (3B)_** provides that where the taxpayer had entered into a binding agreement on or before 31 July 1986 to lease any plant and machinery to which subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) apply, under a "specified lease" (as defined in section 222A), the first year depreciation allowance will apply provided the "lease term" of that lease commences within a reasonable time after 31 July 1986.

2.  First year depreciation allowances terminating as from 31 March 1988 in respect of expenditure incurred after that date:
    1.  The allowance for new and secondhand plant and machinery leased or purchased for use in an agricultural, farming or fishing business - section 112(2)(c) and (d).
        *   Paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 112(2) have been extended to include plant and machinery used in any fishing business. This amendment is required to ensure that plant and machinery purchased or leased for use in a fishing business will continue to be eligible for the allowance until 31 March 1988.
        *   Two transitional provisions have been inserted into section 112 to cater for taxpayers who, on or before 31 March 1988, enter into a binding contract for the acquisition or lease of qualifying assets. **_Subsection (3C)_** of section 112 provides that the first year depreciation allowance will be allowable where a taxpayer enters into a binding contract for the purchase of plant and machinery for use in an agricultural, farming or fishing business prior to 1 April 1988, and that expenditure is subsequently incurred, and the asset is used in the production of assessable income, on or before 31 March 1990. **_Subsection (3D)_** of section 112 provides that where a taxpayer, on or before 1 April 1988, enters into a binding agreement to lease plant and machinery for use in an agricultural, farming or fishing business, the first year depreciation allowance will continue to apply provided the "lease term" commences on or before 31 March 1990 and that plant or machinery is used in producing assessable income on or before 31 March 1990. Note that this provision applies only to plant and machinery leased under a "specified lease", as defined in section 222A of the principal Act.
    2.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in erecting or acquiring buildings for employee accommodation - section 112(2)(e).
        *   The transitional provisions mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) above (subsection (3C)) will apply for those taxpayers who prior to 1 April 1988 enter into binding contracts for the purchase of such buildings and who use them in the business on or before 31 March 1990. Refer to (b)(i) above for the explanation on how subsection (3C) of section 112 will apply.
    3.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in the erection of new farm buildings - section 112(2)(f)
        *   The same transitional provisions which apply for section 112(2) (e) will also apply to 112(2)(f). Please refer to paragraph (b)(i) above for the application of the transitional provisions.
    4.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in erecting new buildings or on building improvements in the fish export industry - section 112(2)(i)
        *   A transitional provision, subsection (3E) has been inserted into section 112. This subsection provides that where a taxpayer enters into the principal contract for the construction of a building or for improvements to a building on or before 31 March 1988, the first year depreciation allowance will continue to apply as if that expenditure had been incurred prior to 31 March 1988. As with farming plant and machinery, the depreciation will be allowable only where that building is first used in the production of the taxpayer's assessable income prior to 1 April 1990.
    5.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in erecting or improving buildings for the tourist accommodation industry. Only buildings erected or improved pursuant to a project, plan or scheme approved by the Minister are eligible for this allowance - section 112(2)(J)
        *   A transitional provision, subsection (3F), has been inserted into section 112. It is in two parts. The first part allows the first year depreciation allowance where a taxpayer is given approval by the Minister on or before 31 March 1988 for a project, plan or scheme of the kind mentioned in section 112(2)(J). Where this approval has been received, the allowance will be available in respect of a building erected pursuant to that project, plan or scheme provided the building is first used in producing assessable income on or before 31 March 1990. The second option provides that where a taxpayer has, prior to 1 April 1988, entered a main construction contract for the erection or improvement of any eligible building, and the Minister's approval of the project, plan or scheme under which the construction or alteration is to take place is given after 31 March 1988, the allowance will be available provided the building is first used in the production of assessable income prior to 1 April 1990.
    6.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in installing private facilities in hotels - section 112(2)(k)
        *   Subsection (3G) has been inserted to provide that where a taxpayer has entered into the principal construction contract for the installation of qualifying hotel facilities prior to 1 April 1988, the first year depreciation allowance will apply provided those facilities are first used to produce assessable income prior to 1 April 1990.
    7.  The allowance for expenditure incurred in the erection of new motels or hotels - section 112(2)(l)
        *   Again, transitional provisions have been inserted, in this case by the new subsection (3H). This subsection provides that where a taxpayer has, prior to 1 April 1988, entered into the principal contract for the construction of a qualifying motel or hotel, the first year depreciation allowance will apply provided the building is completed and used in the production of assessable income before 1 April 1990.

Section 6 - Additional Depreciation Allowance For Plant, Machinery, And Equipment Used For Scientific Research
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 113 of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the additional depreciation allowance, by way of a 5-year write-off, will not apply to plant, machinery, or equipment acquired, installed, or extended after 31 July 1986. As a transitional provision subsection (2) provides that where such plant, machinery, or equipment is acquired, installed, or extended, pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 31 July 1986, or is leased by a taxpayer under a specified lease (as defined in section 222A) after 31 July 1986 pursuant to a binding agreement entered into on or before that date, it is to be treated as if it were acquired, installed, extended or leased on or before 31 July 1986.

New provisions covering depreciation on assets used in connection with scientific research are contained in the new section 144 of the principal Act, as inserted by section 12 of this Amendment Act.

Section 7 - Depreciation Allowance For Approved Safety Frames Attached To Tractors
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 7 gives effect to the Budget announcement of the Government's decision to repeal, with effect from 1 August 1986, the 100 percent write-off for costs incurred in acquiring an approved safety frame and attaching it to a tractor, or for the cost of a safety frame already attached to a tractor purchased by the taxpayer (as was provided in section 114 of the principal Act).

Section 7 provides that where a taxpayer acquires and attaches a safety frame to a tractor after 31 July 1986 or acquires a tractor with a safety frame attached after that date, there will be no 100 percent depreciation allowance available under section 114. Depreciation on that asset will be allowed under section 108 of the principal Act at the normal rate.

**_Subsection 2_** of section 7 inserts two new subsections into section 114 which will allow the write-off for safety frames acquired and attached, and for tractors acquired with safety frames attached, after that date provided certain conditions apply.

*   **_Subsection (2A)_** of section 114 provides that where a taxpayer has entered into a binding contract on or before 31 July 1986 for the purchase of an approved safety frame or of a tractor with an approved safety frame attached, the 100 percent write-off will be allowed provided the safety frame or tractor is purchased within a reasonable time after 31 July. The year in which the deduction may be claimed, however, is dependent upon the provisions of subsection (3) of section 114.
*   **_Subsection (2B)_** of section 114 provides that where a taxpayer has entered into a binding agreement to lease a tractor with a safety frame attached on or before 31 July 1986, the cost of the frame will still be deductible under section 114. However, this concession will only apply where the lease is a specified lease (as defined in section 222A) and the "lease term" actually commences within a reasonable time after 31 July 1986.

If the conditions in subsections (2A) and (2B) of section 114 are met the safety frame is deemed to have been purchased or leased on or before 31 July 1986.

Section 8 - Depreciation Allowance For Approved Safety Devices Attached To Taxicabs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 114A of the principal Act provides for the 100 percent write-off of costs incurred in the acquisition and installation of approved safety devices for taxicabs. Section 8 of this Amendment Act gives effect to the Budget announcement to terminate this allowance as from Budget night.

Section 8 provides that the allowance will cease to apply in respect of any taxi safety device that is acquired and installed after 31 July 1986 and for any taxi with an approved safety device attached that is acquired after that date. Instead, depreciation will be allowed on the costs of acquisition and installation of the safety device at the ordinary rates of depreciation allowable under section 108.

**_Subsection (2)_** of section 8 inserts two new transitional provisions into section 114A:

*   **_Subsection (2A)_** of section 114A provides that where a taxpayer has, on or before 31 July 1986, entered into a binding contract for the purchase of a safety device or a taxicab with a safety device attached, the section will apply as though the safety device or the taxicab was acquired on or before 31 July 1986. This is, however, subject to the condition that the acquisition under that contract must occur within a reasonable period after that date.
*   **_Subsection (2B)_** of section 114A further provides that where a taxpayer has, on or before 31 July 1986, entered into a binding agreement to lease a taxicab with a safety device attached (being a lease that would qualify as a specified lease as defined in section 222A), and the "lease term" of that lease commences within a reasonable time after 31 July, the provisions of section 114A will apply as though the "lease term" had commenced on or before 31 July 1986.

Section 9 - Depreciation Allowance For Alternative Fuel Systems In Certain Motorcars
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 9 inserts a terminating date into section 114B of the principal Act. (Section 114B provides for depreciation on the assembly-line installation cost of alternative fuel systems in new motorcars.) The removal of the $11,000 limit for cars purchased in 1988 and future income years means that this provision is no longer needed to enable depreciation to be claimed on this expenditure.

The effect of section 9 is that where a new motorcar with an alternative fuel system is acquired AFTER the income year ending 31 March 1987, section 114B will not apply. It will therefore not be necessary to show the assembly line installation costs of an alternative system separately from the cost of these motorcars. In cases where a new vehicle is acquired during the 1988 income year or in any future income year, depreciation will be based on the cost of the total unit, ie, the total cost of acquiring that motorcar.

Where a new motorcar with an alternative fuel system installed was purchased PRIOR to the income year commencing 1 April 1987 (ie in 1987 or previous income years) the provisions of section 114B will continue to apply.

Depreciation in those situations for the 1988 income year and for future years will be based on the book value of the alternative fuel system. Depreciation on the remaining costs (being costs in excess of the maximum in section 114B) of the fuel system and of the motorcar will be allowed on its book value (see commentary on section 4 of this Amendment Act).

Section 10 - Additional Depreciation Allowance On Certain Capital Expenditure In Relation to Fishing Boats
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10 of this Amendment Act gives effect to the Budget announcement to terminate the allowance given to accelerate the write-off of the cost of capital expenditure on fishing boats arising from compulsory surveys.

This section provides that the accelerated depreciation allowance provided under section 115 of the principal Act will only apply in respect of capital expenditure incurred on or before 31 March 1988.

Should any capital expenditure of the kinds referred to in section 115 be incurred after 31 March 1988, depreciation will be allowed at the rate applicable to fishing boats under section 108 of the principal Act.

It should be noted that there are no transitional provisions in respect of this allowance.

Section 11 - Depreciation Allowance For Capitalised Demolition Costs And Residual Values Of Certain Buildings Used As Export Slaughterhouses And Packing Houses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 116 provides that where a building previously used as an export slaughterhouse or a packing house is demolished, the costs of demolition and the remaining book value of that building may be added to the cost of a new building or the costs of improvements to an existing building which will be used for the same purposes. The deduction is conditional upon the expenditure being necessary to satisfy hygiene requirements.

Section 11 terminates this allowance with effect from Budget night, 31 July 1986. These costs are capital losses and will in future not be deductible.

However, subsection (2) of section 11 inserts into section 116 a transitional provision, subsection (2A).

*   **_Subsection (2A)_** provides that where a binding contract for the demolition of an export slaughterhouse or packing house has been entered into on or before 31 July 1986 and that demolition is subsequently carried out within a reasonable time after that date, section 116 will continue to apply, provided that all other requirements of that section are met.

Section 12 - Expenditure On Scientific Research
-----------------------------------------------

This section extends section 144 of the principal Act to allow a deduction for depreciation in respect of assets used in connection with scientific research.

The new subsection (1)(a) repeats the existing section 144 provisions. It continues to provide that eligible expenditure consists of expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research carried on by the taxpayer for the purpose of deriving assessable income.

The insertion of subsection (1)(b) extends the scope of the section to include depreciation, allowable at ordinary rates, in respect of assets used for scientific research.

It replaces the accelerated write-off provisions of section 113 which no longer apply to assets purchased on or after 1 August 1986.

**Application Date**

The deduction for depreciation on assets applies from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1985. With the repeal of the accelerated depreciation provisions in section 113, from 31 July 1986, the retrospective application of the new provision in this section is intended to ensure that taxpayers with August or September balance dates who purchase assets after 31 July 1986 will be eligible for the depreciation deduction in their 1986 tax returns. However, it should be noted that taxpayers will still have the option of claiming the accelerated depreciation allowance available under section 113 in respect of assets acquired, installed, extended or leased on or before 31 July 1986.

Section 13 - Export-Market Development And Tourist-Promotion Expenditure
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 14 - Export-Market Development Activities Incentive For Self-Employed Taxpayers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sections 13 and 14 correct drafting deficiencies contained in sections 156F and 156G. The deficiencies result from amendments made to these sections by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1986. Those amendments gave effect to the Government's decision to phase-out the export-market development and tourist-promotion tax incentives and to increase the rate to take into account the increased company tax rate of 48 percent. The amendment to subsection (2) of each of these sections increased the rate of incentive from 67 1/2 percent to 69 percent and provided that this rate would not apply beyond the end of the 1987 income year. The drafting of the amendment, however, failed to make it clear that the 69 percent rate is to apply for the year ending 31 March 1987 only, with the rate of 67 1/2 being operative for 1986 and previous years. The amendments made by sections 13 and 14 of this Act make that point quite clear.

Sections 15, 16, 17 And 18 - Amounts Paid On Shares In Mining Companies And Mining Holding Companies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 amend sections 159, 159A, 160 and 160A respectively with the effect that any payment made after 30 September 1986 in respect of subscriptions or calls on shares will not qualify for the one-third deduction. In addition, any payment made on or after 1 August 1986 and on or before 30 September 1986 will not qualify for the deduction unless the call has been made on or before 31 July 1986.

### Examples

1.  Call made on or before 31 July 1986
    *   Payment made after 31 July 1986 and on or before 30 September 1986
        *   The payment qualifies for the one-third deduction.
2.  Call made after 31 July 1986
    *   Payment made on or before 30 September 1986
        *   The payment is not eligible for the one-third deduction.

**Note**

The date on which the Commissioner's approval is given is not relevant. It is the date on which the call is made that is important. A call is made on the date on which a resolution of Directors authorising the call is passed, in accordance with the Third Schedule to the Companies Act 1955.

Section 19 - National Superannuitant Surcharge Rate
---------------------------------------------------

**_Subsection (1)_** - amends section 336D(1) of the principal Act with the effect of reducing the surcharge rate from 25 cents to 18 cents in the dollar for each dollar of the national superannuitant's other income.

**_Subsection (2)_** - amends section 336J(2)(a) of the principal Act to allow surcharge deductions made from a national superannuitant's source deduction payments to be made at the new rate of 18 cents in the dollar.

**_Subsection (3)_** - provides for the national superannuitant surcharge to be assessed at a composite rate of 21.5 cents in the dollar for the 1986/87 income year.

**_Subsection (4)_** - provides that subsections (1) and (3) of this section will apply for the 1986/87 income year and every subsequent year.

**_Subsection (5)_** - provides for subsection (2) of this section to apply in respect of every source deduction payment made on or after l October 1986.

Part II - Family Support Credit Of Tax
--------------------------------------

This Part of the Amendment Act relates wholly to Part XIA of the principal Act which provides for the Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit schemes. Part XIA was inserted by section 17(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1986 - refer to PIB Number 151.

The amendments outlined in this Amendment Act are essentially a result of the announcement, in relation to the Family Support scheme, made in the "Government Statement of Rural Policy" of 2 July 1986.

In the statement it was announced that provisional taxpayers will now be able to receive their Family Support entitlement each month from the Department of Social Welfare.

Under the present legislation, although the non-earning spouse of a provisional taxpayer would receive payment monthly from the Department of Social Welfare, the provisional taxpayer would have received his or her Family Support entitlement at the same time as provisional tax is payable. This meant that families, in which both spouses are provisional taxpayers would not receive payment of Family Support until 7 March 1987.

The changes announced will allow any provisional taxpayer to whom Family Benefit is payable to be able to elect to receive Family Support each month from the Department of Social Welfare with the Family Benefit payments. In addition, any provisional taxpayer who is the spouse of a person receiving Family Benefit will be able to elect to have their Family Support paid to their spouse on their behalf by the Department of Social Welfare at the time that spouse's Family Benefit is payable. The election by a provisional taxpayer that his or her Family Support entitlement be paid to the spouse during the year will not effect each spouse's actual entitlement to Family Support which will still be determined on an end of year basis in respect of each individual. To achieve this, the legislation deems any payment received on behalf of a person's spouse to have been received by the spouse on whose behalf it was paid.

A detailed examination of the legislation follows:

Section 20 - Application Of This Part
-------------------------------------

This section provides that the amendments in Part II shall apply from the commencement of the Family Support Scheme, and therefore will affect the applications being made for the 1986/87 year prior to the scheme's commencement on 1 October 1986.

Section 21 - Determination Of Assessable Income
-----------------------------------------------

This section makes an amendment to section 374B(3)(c) of the principal Act to correct an omission. The subsection deems any income other than income from employment to be derived at a uniform daily rate throughout the year. The section should also refer to income other than income that is income derived by way of an income-tested benefit.

This amendment corrects that omission.

Section 22 - Credit Of Tax By Instalments
-----------------------------------------

This section makes various amendments to section 374G of the principal Act which sets out the rules relating to the application of a certificate of entitlement, the completion of that certificate by the Commissioner, its use by the person to whom it is issued and its withdrawal.

### **_Subsection (1)_**

This amends subsection (1) of section 374G and ensures that payment of a credit of tax may be made not only to any person but also to the spouse of any person on behalf of that person.

This amendment reflects the new delivery mechanism for provisional taxpayers. For further details refer to the commentary below.

### **_Subsection (2)_**

This subsection repeals and substitutes a new paragraph (b) of section 374G(2) of the principal Act. This amendment is complementary to the change to the delivery mechanism for provisional taxpayers in that it relaxes the requirements relating to the evidence that must be provided in support of the taxpayer's estimate of the assessable income that will be derived during the year.

Paragraph (b) now requires that an application for a business taxpayer be accompanied by either -

1.  A copy of the annual accounts of the business for the income year, or equivalent accounting year, that immediately precedes the year that contains the elected period. Example: For the 1988/89 Family Support application a person in business would be required to attach the accounts of the business for the income year ending 31 March 1988; OR
2.  Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the annual accounts referred to in subparagraph (i) above have not been completed, a copy of the annual accounts of the business for the income year, or equivalent accounting year, that precedes the year immediately preceding the income year that contains the elected period. Using the example in paragraph (i) above, the accounts of the business for the income year ended 31 March 1987 would be sufficient evidence. OR
3.  A set of budgeted accounts of the business for the income year, or equivalent accounting year, that contains the elected period, ie, budgeted accounts for the income year in relation to which the Family Support application has been made; OR
4.  Such other evidence as is acceptable to the Commissioner in relation to the business for the income year, or equivalent accounting year, that contains the elected period. As with subparagraph (ii) this is a relaxation which has been introduced to make it easier and less costly for business taxpayers to apply for Family Support. It will relieve the taxpayer of the necessity to provide a set of accounts or budgeted set of accounts for any year, provided the taxpayer can provide other satisfactory evidence. A signed statement by the agent of the taxpayer specifying the taxpayer's estimated income and substantiated by the reasons for the estimation will constitute acceptable evidence.

**_Subsection (3)_**

This makes an amendment to paragraph (d) of subsection (6) of section 374G to ensure that the term "current year" used in the new paragraph (da) (refer to subsection (4) below) has the same meaning as in paragraph (d). Essentially, the current year is the year in respect of which the application for Family Support is made.

**_Subsection (4)_**

This subsection adds a new paragraph (da) to subsection (6) of section 374G. This paragraph provides for a certificate of entitlement to be issued by the Commissioner to a provisional taxpayer, or a taxpayer who would have an obligation to pay provisional tax but for the reasons set out in paragraph (d) of subsection (6), requiring the Director-General of Social Welfare to pay the tax credit.

The paragraph is broken into 2 subparagraphs:

1.  enables the Commissioner to issue a certificate of entitlement that requires the Department of Social Welfare to make payment of the tax credit to a provisional taxpayer who is the qualifying person (by definition, the person to whom Family Benefit is payable) at the same time as payment of the Family Benefit is made to that person;
2.  enables the Commissioner to issue a certificate of entitlement that requires payment of the tax credit of a provisional taxpayer, who is the spouse of the qualifying person to be made by the Department of Social Welfare to the qualifying person on behalf of the provisional taxpayer at the same time as payment of the Family Benefit is made to that person.

For example, this will mean that where the husband has elected to receive payment from the Department of Social Welfare, his share of the entitlement will be paid to his wife together with their Family Benefit payments.

**_Subsection (5)_**

This section amends section 374G(7) of the principal Act, which caters for taxpayers who have more than one option of the delivery method they may choose for the receipt of their tax credit entitlement during the year. It requires provisional taxpayers to choose which option, including the new paragraph (da) (ie, monthly payment by the Department of Social Welfare), is to apply.

**_Subsection (6)_**

This amends section 374G of the principal Act by adding a new subsection (11A).

The new subsection enables a qualifying person who is entitled to receive payment of the tax credit on behalf of the spouse of the qualifying person, to deliver the certificate of entitlement to the Director-General of Social Welfare, and to receive the interim instalments of the tax credit on behalf of the spouse at such intervals as the Director-General considers appropriate.

Section 23 - Employer To Deliver Credit Of Tax
----------------------------------------------

This is a minor drafting amendment to section 374H(7) of the principal Act and reflects the correct position that a "penalty" is imposed for late payment of tax deductions, not "additional tax".

Section 24 - Director-General To Deliver Credit Of Tax
------------------------------------------------------

Both subsections (1) and (2) of this section make amendments to section 374(I) of the principal Act, which deals with the obligations of the Director-General of Social Welfare in relation to the Family Support and Guaranteed Minimum Family Income schemes.

**_Subsection (1)_**

adds a new subsection (1A) to the section. This requires the Director-General to pay interim instalments of tax credit to a qualifying person, on behalf of the spouse of that person, where the Commissioner has issued a certificate of entitlement that requires the Director-General to make such payments.

The Director-General will pay the interim instalments monthly to the qualifying person on the spouse's behalf.

It is important to note that every payment made to a person on behalf of the spouse of that person is deemed to be a payment received by the spouse, not by the person to whom the payment is made. This ensures the end of year calculations will not be affected and the payments made to the qualifying person on the provisional taxpayer's behalf will be credited to the provisional taxpayer in the end of year calculation.

Subsection (2) amends subsection (4) of section 374(1) to require the Director-General to issue a certificate to the person on whose behalf the tax credits have been paid, showing the total amount of tax credit delivered during the income year to the spouse of that person on his or her behalf. This certificate will be attached to the end-of-year income tax return by the person as evidence of the tax credit payments received on his or her behalf during the year.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1987
=====================================

Part I
------

Section 1 - Short Title
-----------------------

This section provides for this Act to be read together and be deemed part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

Section 2 - Dates by which Annual Returns to be Furnished
---------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 17 of the principal Act to bring forward the date by which provisional taxpayers must furnish their annual returns of income. The new dates are as follows:

1.  (a) If the taxpayer's balance date is in the period 1 October to 7 May, the return must be furnished not later than 7 July.
2.  (b) If the taxpayer's balance date is in the period 8 May to 30 September, the return must be furnished not later than 2 months after that balance date.

These changes were necessary to align the return furnishing dates with the date for payment of the first instalment of provisional tax which is also 7 July.

Subsection (2) provides for the new return furnishing dates to apply in respect of returns for the 1987/88 income year and all subsequent income years.

Section 3 - Income and Expenditure where Financial Arrangement Redeemed or Disposed of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section inserts two new subsections (7A) and (7B) into section 64F of the principal Act.

Section 64F(7A) provides that where an amount to be paid under a financial arrangement is forgiven under a testamentary disposition executed before 1 October 1987 the forgiveness is not to be dealt with under the accrual tax accounting regime.

Under the accrual tax accounting regime, if a debt owing is forgiven the amount forgiven may be assessable income to the debtor. This will be the case where the amount forgiven exceeds the cost of the borrowing, which is generally the case with debt used for estate planning purposes and forgiven in wills.

As a result of submissions to the effect that law practitioners are unable to take the necessary steps to ensure that wills are redrafted to avoid the consequences of debt forgiveness under the accrual tax accounting regime, the Government decided to ensure that the accrual tax accounting regime would not affect the forgiveness of debt in testamentary dispositions executed before 1 October 1987.

A testamentary disposition is an instruction given by a person regarding the disposition of his or her assets at death. As the testamentary disposition must be executed to satisfy section 64F(7A), it must be in writing: a will or a codicil to a will.

The instrument making the gift on the death of the testator must be executed before 1 October 1987: where there is a will executed before 1 October 1987 it is not possible to satisfy section 64F(7A) by executing a codicil to the will on or after 1 October 1987 to forgive the debt in the event of the testator's death.

Section 64F(7B) provides that where an amount owing under a debt (including accrued interest)is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection, the amount owing shall be deemed to have been paid when it is forgiven.

**Example 1:**

Daughter owes Father $200,000. Debt at call with interest payable on demand. The advance was made on 15 June 1988 and no interest has yet been demanded.

On 17 April 1989 Father forgives the debt. The debt is therefore deemed to be repaid at that time. There being no interest, the deemed repayment will not affect the income tax position of either party.

**Example 2:**

Daughter owes Father $200,000. Advance was made on 5 June 1988, repayable on 5 June 1998, interest of 19% per annum payable annually in arrears.

On 5 December 1988 Father forgives the debt including all accrued interest. The debt and all accrued but unpaid interest is deemed to be paid on 5 December 1988.

**Base price adjustment: Father**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | a   | \-  | (b  | +   | c)  |
|     | $219,000 | \-  | ($200,000 | +   | 0)  |
| \=  | $19,000 | (income) |     |     |     |

**Base price adjustment: Daughter**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | a   | \-  | (b  | +   | c)  |
|     | $219,000 | \-  | ($200,000 | +   | 0)  |
| \=  | $19,000 | (expenditure deemed to be incurred, which may be deductible depending upon the use to which the borrowed money was put) |     |     |     |

(expenditure deemed to be incurred, which may be deductible depending upon the use to which the borrowed money was put)

A forgiveness in a will may be made in consideration of natural love and affection, and if so it is to be treated according to section 64F(7B). Where a forgiveness is conditional it does not occur until the conditions are fulfilled, so that the amount forgiven is not deemed to be paid until the conditions are fulfilled.

Section 4 - Rural Debt Restructuring
------------------------------------

This section inserts into the principal Act a new section 64FA, which is intended to ensure that where in the course of the rural debt restructuring an amount owing under a variable principal debt instrument and borrowed before 2 July 1986 is forgiven before 31 December 1988, the forgiveness will not be affected by the accrual tax accounting regime.

Where the balance owing under the variable principal debt instrument is reduced on or after 2 July 1986, the amount for which the concession is available is also reduced. Where the debt under the variable principal debt instrument at 2 July 1986 is replaced with other debt and the other debt is later forgiven before 31 December 1988, the other debt also qualifies for the concession.

### Who qualifies for the concession?

### The concession under the new section 64FA is available only to:

1.  Farmers engaged in livestock farming, horticulture or cropping; and
2.  Agricultural contractors.

For the purposes of section 64FA "livestock farming" is defined in section 64FA(1) as follows:

"'Livestock farming' means the business of animal husbandry; and includes poultry-keeping, bee-keeping, and the breeding of horses (other than bloodstock):"

An agricultural contractor is a person who undertakes contract work in the agricultural sector. Examples are fencers, top-dressing firms, contract shearers and transport operators engaged chiefly in work for the agricultural sector. It includes contractors engaging in work that may be done for persons outside the agricultural sector, but which the contractor undertakes chiefly for persons in the agricultural sector.

### What debt qualifies for the concession?

The concession is available only for debt incurred in the course of business as a farmer engaged in livestock farming, horticulture or cropping or in the course of business as an agricultural contractor.

The concession is available only in relation to -

1.  Variable principal debt instruments, and then only in relation to the amount owing that was incurred before 2 July 1986 and, at the time of the forgiveness of debt, has not since been repaid (section 64FA(2) refers); and
2.  Debts that replace amounts that were owing under a variable principal debt instrument at the beginning of 2 July 1986, and then only in relation to the amount of the replaced debt that, at the time of the replacement, has not been repaid (section 64FA(3) refers).

To achieve this end the legislation applies the concession to the "specified principal" of the debt. "Specified principal" is defined in section 64FA(1).

When dealing with an amount owing under a variable principal debt instrument at 2 July 1986, the specified principal is the least amount owing under the variable principal debt instrument at the beginning of every day from and including 2 July 1986 to the day on which the forgiveness occurs. It is not necessary to consider movements in the balance owing during the course of a day.

When dealing with a debt that replaces an amount owing under a variable principal debt instrument at the beginning of 2 July 1986, the specified principal is the least amount owing under the variable principal debt instrument at the beginning of every day from and including 2 July 1986 to the day on which the amount owing under the variable principal debt instrument is replaced.

### In what circumstances is the concession available?

The concession is available where the debt is forgiven -

1.  Before 31 December 1988; and
2.  In the course of a rearrangement of the debtor's liabilities due to financial difficulties of the debtor that render doubtful the capacity of the debtor to carry on in the business of livestock farming, horticulture, cropping or agricultural contracting.

The concession is intended to be available for any rural debt restructuring before 31 December 1988. It is intended as an assistance to farmers and agricultural contractors in such severe financial difficulty that they may have to leave their businesses.

Section 5 - Deduction in respect of Livestock Revaluation
---------------------------------------------------------

### Death of Farmers in Period 12 December 1985 to end of 1986 Income Year

This section amends section 86E(2) of the principal Act, which gives a "write-off" to farmers ceasing farming after 12 December 1985 and before the end of the 1986 income year. The "write-off" given to such farmers is similar in principle to that allowed to continuing farmers in the 1987 income year when specified livestock were required to be revalued to new standard values.

The amendment ensures that the estates of farmers who died in the period between 12 December 1985 and the end of the 1986 income year receive the same concession as farmers who retired in that period. The write-off which will now be available to the estate of a farmer who died between 12 December 1985 and the end of that income year will be 70 percent of the difference between:

1.  the total ofâ
    1.  the sale proceeds of any of the specified livestock which were on hand at the beginning of the 1986 income year and sold during that income year before the date of death; and
    2.  the probate value of any of the specified livestock which were on hand at the beginning of the 1986 income year and still on hand at the date of death; and
2.  the value of specified livestock on hand at the beginning of the 1986 income year as taken into account for income tax purposes.

Prior to this Amendment the "write-off" did not apply to (a)(i) above.

It should be noted that this provision only applies where the farmer at date of death was still in the business of farming. In other words, the write-off does not apply where the farmer disposed of the farming business prior to 12 December 1985 and died subsequently but prior to the end of the 1986 income year. Similarly, the write-off does not apply to a farmer who retired or died prior to 12 December 1985.

Section 6 - Deferral of Income derived from Livestock in 1987 Year
------------------------------------------------------------------

This section gives effect to a decision by the Government to allow a deferral of revaluation income not covered by the existing legislation. In essence it allows a spread of revaluation income arising from the retention of natural increases in specified livestock during the 1987 income year.

To calculate the income which qualifies for the deferral, an adjustment has to be made for purchases of livestock in the 1987 income year which increase the total value of livestock on hand. A deduction is received for such purchases so revaluation income is increased.

The amount of livestock income which may be deferred ("deferrable livestock valuation income") is arrived at by using the following formula:

a - (b - c) - d

Where -

a is:

1.  the total value of all specified livestock (other than livestock deemed to be high-priced livestock by sections 86G(6) or 86G(7) of the Income Tax Act) to be taken into account for tax purposes at the end of the 1987 income year; less
2.  the total value of all specified livestock (other than livestock deemed to be high-priced livestock by section 86G(6) of the Income Tax Act) to be taken into account for tax purposes at the end of the 1986 income year.

b is the total amount spent in the 1987 income year on purchasing or capturing non high-priced livestock that were, at the beginning of the income year, herd class livestock. For this calculation herd class livestock are taken as any livestock, regardless of ownership or valuation, of the types shown in column 3 of the Twelfth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

c is the total amount received from the sale in the 1987 income year of non high-priced livestock that were, at the beginning of the income year, herd class livestock.

If c is greater than b then subsection (2) of section 6 deems b - c to be nil. This is done because such an amount would represent net cash income The deferral applies to unrealised revaluation income only.

d is:

1.  the amount of the livestock revaluation income "write-off" given by section 86E(3) of the Income Tax Act; and
2.  the amount of' livestock revaluation income able to be spread over 5 years by section 86F of the Income Tax Act. (This is the amount of "livestock revaluation income" defined in 86F(1)); and
3.  the amount of any loss available for tax purposes in the 1987 income year. This includes any past losses carried forward under the provisions of section 188 or 188A of the Income Tax Act.

The income which qualifies for the deferral may be spread over the 1987 income year and the two income years immediately succeeding that year. However, it need not be spread equally over the three years. In other words, the income may be allocated in whole or in part to any of the three years.

It should be noted that under the provisions of this amendment every taxpayer is required to elect, by notice in writing, the amount to be allocated to each of the income years. The election only becomes binding after 31 March 1988. It can, therefore, be amended, if desired, before this date.

_**Subsection (4)**_ requires that the notice of election be submitted by 31 March 1988.

### Example showing Calculation of the Deferral

In the example sheep numbers are being built up until the 1988 income year. The herd scheme is used to value qualifying animals, i.e., mature sheep.

| b = |     | $ 1,000 | (Purchase of Two Tooth Ewes |
| c = |     | $ 600 | (Sale of Old Ewes) |
| d = $ 8,500 + $2,500 = |     | $11,000 | (Write-off and spread) |
| so: a - (b - c) - d |     |     |     |
| \= $13,676 - (1,000 - 600) - 11,000 |     |     |     |
| \= $ 2,276 |     |     |     |

If the deferrable income is spread between the 1988 and 1989 income years, 1987 taxable livestock income will be:

$14,651 - 2,276 = $12,375

Section 7 - Farmers Expenditure on Tree Planting
------------------------------------------------

This section clarifies section 134 of the principal Act, which gives a deduction for the cost of maintaining and planting of trees on farm land. The amendment excludes from section 134 trees planted primarily and principally for the production of fruit. Such trees may be depreciated under the provisions of section 128A.

Section 8 - Accounting for Goods and Services Tax
-------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 140B of the principal Act. It ensures that the entire refund of Sales Tax under section 83(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act is included as assessable for income tax purposes.

As the registered person has been allowed an Income Tax deduction for the Sales Tax paid, it is logical that the refund of that tax should be assessable, thereby giving the net effect of a claim for the true final cost of those goods on hand as at 30 September 1986.

This adjustment should be made in returns for the income year which commenced on 1 April 1986, i.e., the 1987 income year.

Section 9 - Pay-Period Taxpayers
--------------------------------

This section amends section 356(1) of the principal Act. It increases the pay-period taxpayer's income limit from $11,500 to $20,000.

This change, which applies from the income year commenced 1 April 1987, means a taxpayer will not be required to furnish a return if that taxpayer's income does not exceed $20,000 and that taxpayer:

1.  did not derive income as a shearer or shearing shed hand; and
2.  does not receive, or has a spouse who receives, family support; and
3.  does not derive income from National Superannuation as well as income from other sources exceeding $6,500; and
4.  is not an absentee; and
5.  is not a person who is deemed not to be pay-period taxpayer by the Commissioner; and
6.  did not operate a special tax code; and
7.  did not use an incorrect tax code.

A pay-period taxpayer's tax liability is determined by the PAYE which has been deducted from that income. The PAYE becomes, in effect, a final tax.

Section 10 - Interpretation and Section 11 - Determination of Assessable Income
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Family Support and Livestock Valuation Income

These sections give effect to the changes in the determination of Family Support for farmers. There are three main changes in the amendment.

**Firstly -**

the amendment removes totally from income used for determining eligibility for Family Support, the amount of "livestock revaluation income" able to be spread over five years by section 86F of the Income Tax Act. Previous to this amendment this income had to be taken into account in full in the 1987 income year for family support purposes.

**Secondly -**

the livestock valuation income which may be deferred and spread over three years by section 86FA, as introduced by this Amendment Act, is to be taken into account in full as income for family support purposes in the 1987 income year. This is done because this income represents an increase in the total value of trading stock on hand.

**Thirdly -**

from the 1988 income year onwards, where livestock is valued under the herd scheme basis of valuation, stock will be required to be valued at the trading stock scheme standard values for determining assessable income for Family Support. This is to ensure that for family support purposes the assessable income factor is calculated on the same basis as farmers using the trading stock scheme.

### Example showing Calculations of Income for Family Support Purposes

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $16,213 | \-  | 1,138 | \-  | 500 | +   | 536 = $15,111 |
| (taxable livestock income) |     | (1988 portion of deferral - already accounted for) |     | (1988 portion of spread - not to be included) |     | (extra income that would be generated by using std values - see below) |

**Non High-Priced 1988 Herd Class Livestock**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Class | No  | Herd Value | Std Value | Difference | Total Value |
|     |     | Opening Livestock |     |     |     |
| Two Tooth Ewes | 200 | 24  | 16  | 8   | 1,600 |
| Mixed Age Ewes | 800 | 15  | 9   | 6   | 4,800 |
| Breeding Rams | 9   | 130 | 87  | 43  | 387 |
|     |     |     |     |     | 6,787 |
|     |     | Closing Livestock |     |     |     |
| Two Tooth Ewes | 200 | 24  | 17  | 7   | 1,400 |
| Mixed Age Ewes | 900 | 15  | 10  | 5   | 4,500 |
| Breeding Rams | 9   | 130 | 91  | 43  | 351 |
|     |     |     |     |     | 6,251 |
|     |     |     |     |     | 536 |

If standard values were used, the deduction of opening livestock would be reduced by $6,787. Income arising from valuation of closing livestock would be reduced by $6,251. The overall change to income for family support purposes would be an increase of $536.

Section 12 - Provisional Taxpayers
----------------------------------

This section amends section 377 of the principal Act. It increases from $1,000 to $3,000 the amount that any person, whose only other income is from source deduction payments, may earn from interest, dividends and rents in any income year before being required to pay provisional tax.

This section also consequentially amends section 17 (due date for furnishing returns) to allow such taxpayers to furnish IR5 returns of income.

Both changes will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1988. This will mean that such taxpayers will not be required to pay 1989 provisional tax, and will become IR5 taxpayers for the 1988/89 income year.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1985
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1985 from PIB vol 136 May 1985.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 136, May 1985

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

This Act gives effect to:

*   The announcement in the June 1985 Budget that the specified exemption levels for the National Superannuitant surcharge will be increased from $6,240 (single rate recipients) and $5,200 (married rate recipients) to $7,202 and $6,006 respectively with effect from 1 April 1986.
*   An expansion of the specified exemption section for the National Superannuitant surcharge to cater for cases where National Superannuation is received at rates other than the single or married rates and to clarify the exemption to be applied where a National Superannuitant is receiving the single rate by reason of his spouse having been in hospital for more than 13 weeks.
*   The announcement in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform that the fringe benefit tax rate will be increased to 48 percent from 1 April 1986.
*   The announcement in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform that the rate of tax for resident companies and resident company tax rate related taxpayers will be increased from 45 cents in the dollar to 48 cents in the dollar with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1986.
*   The announcement in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform that the rate of tax for non-resident companies and non-resident company tax rate related taxpayers will be increased from 50 cents in the dollar to 53 cents in the dollar with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1986.
*   The announcement in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform that the above two sets of increased tax rates be taken into account in relation to the provisional tax payments that are required in the 1986/87 tax year.

The Act received the Governor-General's assent on 7 December 1985, and the commentary which follows explains its effect.

### Section 1 - Short Title

This section provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with and form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Section 2 - National Superannuitant Surcharge Specified Exemptions

Provision is made to increase the exemption levels (as announced in the June 1985 Budget statement) which apply in respect of income other than National Superannuation derived by National Superannuitants in determining their liability for the National Superannuitant surcharge.

These levels were to be increased to $7,200 for a single person and to $12,000 per annum which will be the combined exemption for a married couple with effect from 1 April 1986. For administrative reasons (namely PAYE divisibility by 52 these amounts were altered to $7,202 and $12,012 respectively. The provision specifying the exemption levels is also expanded to take account of those situations where National Superannuitants receive National Superannuation at rates other than the married or single rate and to clarify the exemption to be applied where a National Superannuitant is receiving the single rate by reason of his spouse having been in hospital for more than 13 weeks.

Each subsection is explained in detail below.

_**Subsection (1)**_

At present section 336BA(1) of the principal Act outlines the specified exemptions available where:

*   National Superannuation is being received at the single rate by reason of the National Superannuitant being not married - the annual exemption in these cases is $6,240 (paragraph (a)).
*   National Superannuation is being received at the married rate - the annual exemption in these cases is $5,200 although provision is made for any unused exemption to be transferable to a National Superannuitant's spouse to give a combined exemption of $10,400 (paragraph (b)).
*   National Superannuation is being received at the single rate by reason of the spouse of the National Superannuitant not qualifying for National Superannuation, (ie, under age 60 or not having met the residential requirements) - the annual exemption in these cases is $6,240 although provision is made for this to be increased up to $10,400 where the non-qualifying spouse has little or no taxable income (paragraph (c)).
*   National Superannuation is not being received for part of a year for any reason _other than_ the national Superannuitant commencing to receive, dying, or permanently departing frown New Zealand. This provision ensures that a full year's "other income" is to be taken into account despite National Superannuation having been received for part of a year only (paragraph (d)).

Subsection (1) alters these expansions by replacing the present paragraphs (c) and (d) with new paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) which do the following:

*   Paragraph (c) - This is a repetition of the present paragraph (c) with _two_ changes having been introduced -  
      
    Firstly, the variable $6,240 to $10,400 exemption is specifically made available to those National Superannuitants who are receiving the single rate of National Superannuation by reason of their spouse having been in hospital for more than 13 weeks. In such cases, section 75 of the Social Security Act 1964 provides that after the expiry of 13 weeks, the spouse's entitlement to National Superannuation is to be reduced from the married rate to a rate which gives the spouse $10 per week (soon to be increased to $15 per week) after tax _and_ at the same time the non-hospitalised superannuitant's rate increases from the married rate to the single rate.  
      
    **Example:**  
      
    Two National Superannuitants are receiving the married rate of National Superannuation. One is admitted to hospital for a period of 21 weeks during the year. During this time the non-hospitalised superannuitant has received $9,000 of other income whereas the hospitalised superannuitant has received $4,500 of other income.  
      
    By virtue of section 75 of the Social Security Act, the non-hospitalised superannuitant will have received the married rate for 44 weeks (22 pay days), this including the first 13 weeks while his spouse was in hospital, and the single rate for eight weeks (four pay days).  
    The non-hospitalised superannuitant's specified exemption for the year will thus be:  
    ![Example of married rates of National Superannuation for two national superannuitants. ](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/2/920c1f80401a5b9b85f3ef5d802abedf/image-vol136-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318235012&hash=A8D51ECD2B86E8ACDC83B9EF72E49D96)  
    [Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/7/b/7b166480401a5fc385feef5d802abedf/image-vol136-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203130&hash=74906998596AD136D946ABDADE3185E9 "This link will open a new window.")
      
      
    Secondly, the wording relating to the description of item f has been altered to ensure that only a spouse's "other income" is taken into account when calculating a National Superannuitant's specified exemption in those cases where paragraph (c) applies.
*   Paragraph (d) - This is a new paragraph which provides an exemption in respect of that part of a year in respect of which a National Superannuitant is receiving National Superannuation at a rate other than the married or single rate. This can occur in those cases where:
    *   National Superannuation is being paid at a rate at the discretion of the Social Security Commission where, for example, the superannuitant is in a penal institution.
    *   The reduced $10 per week (soon to be increased to $15 per week) after tax rate is being paid to a superannuitant who has been in hospital for more than 13 weeks.
    *   The superannuitant is in receipt of a specified foreign social security pension with the result that the National Superannuation (as defined in Part XA of the principal Act) being received is less than the amount actually being paid to the superannuitant by the amount of the "top-up".
    *   A National Superannuitant has received the married income-tested rate of national Superannuation for part of the year.
*     
    In these situations, the specified exemption available is:
    *   Where the superannuitant is not married, the exemption available under paragraph (a).
    *   Where the superannuitant is married, the superannuitant's spouse is entitled to receive National Superannuation AND that spouse has not been in hospital for a period of 13 weeks, the exemption available under paragraph (b).
    *   In any other case, the exemption available under paragraph (c).
*   Paragraph (e) - This is a repetition of the present paragraph (d) with changes to the wording being made in subparagraph (i) to ensure that immigrants who have previously received National Superannuation obtain a full year's exemption (a similar amendment in the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 5) provides that a full year's "other income" will be taken into account in such cases) and in subparagraphs (iv) and (v) consequential on the introduction of the new paragraph (d).

The new paragraphs are to apply with respect from the income year that commenced on 1 April _1985_ being the date from which the National Superannuitant surcharge first applied.

_**Subsection (2)**_

This subsection increases the specified exemption levels for National Superannuitants with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April _1986_.

The exemptions were to have been increased from $6,240 to $7,200 (single rate recipients) and from $5,200 to $6,000 (married rate recipients, giving a combined exemption of $12,000 instead of the present $10,400) as announced in the June 1985 Budget, but these amounts have been increased slightly to ensure their divisibility by 52.

The new levels will be $7,202 and $6,006 (giving a combined exemption for married couples of $12,012) respectively.

_**Subsection (3)**_

This subsection makes a consequential amendment to section 336BA(2) of the principal Act resulting from the replacement of paragraphs (c) and (d) of the present section 336BA(1) with new paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) as detailed in subsection (1) of this Amendment Act.

_**Subsection (4)**_

This subsection specifies the pay-period equivalents of the new $7,202 exemption for single rate recipients for the purpose of the "SAJ" code.

_**Subsection (5)**_

This subsection specifies the pay-period equivalents of the new $6,006 exemption for married rate recipients for the purposes of the "MAJ" code.

_**Subsection (6)**_

At present, National Superannuitants who receive more than $5,200 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation are excluded from being "pay-period taxpayers" as that term is defined in section 356(1) of the principal Act.

This subsection consequentially amends that definition as a result of the new specified exemption levels to ensure that only those National Superannuitants who receive more than $6,006 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation will be excluded from being "pay-period taxpayers".

_**Subsections (7) and (8)**_

These are the application date subsections. They ensure that the expansion of the present specified exemption section will apply with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1985 (the date from which the surcharge first applied) while the increase exemption levels will only apply with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1986.

### Section 3 - Fringe Benefit Tax Rate

This section simply provides that, as announced in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform, the rate of fringe benefit tax will be increased from 45 percent to 48 percent with effect from 1 April 1986. The new rate, which is in line with the increase in the company tax rate (see below), is to apply to fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1986. It will thus first apply to payments of fringe benefit tax made in respect of the quarter which ends on 30 June 1986.

### Section 4 - Company and Company-Related Tax Rates

This section provides that, as announced in the August 1985 Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform, the rates of income tax payable by companies and certain other taxpayers are to be increased from 45 and 50 percent to 48 and 53 percent respectively with effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986. It also provides that those increases are to be taken into account in calculating the provisional tax payments that will be required in the 1986/87 tax year. Each subsection is explained in detail below.

_**Subsection (1)**_

Paragraph (a) provides that the income tax rate will increase from 45 cents in the dollar to 48 cents in the dollar for:

*   Companies resident in New Zealand.
*   Public authorities.
*   Trustees of "category 3" superannuation schemes.
*   Trustees of group investment funds in respect of "category A" income.
*   Non-resident mining operators with respect to income derived from mining operations.

Paragraph (b) provides that the income tax rate will increase from 50 cents in the dollar to 53 cents in the dollar for:

*   Companies not resident in New Zealand.
*   Non-resident insurers and non-resident insurance underwriters.
*   Non-resident mining companies with respect to income derived from activities other than mining operations.

_**Subsections (2) and (3)**_

These subsections provide that the above increased rates of tax are to be taken into account in calculating the amounts of provisional tax that are to be paid for the 1986/87 income year.

Although these subsections refer to provisional tax amounts otherwise determined being increased by 6 2/3 and 6 percent respectively (these amounts representing the respective 45 to 48 and 50 to 53 percent increases), in practice all that will be required will be for taxpayers to multiply their 1986/87 provisional income (which will usually be the taxable income derived during the 1985/86 year) by the new 48 or 53 percent rates.

_**Subsection (4)**_

This is the application date subsection. It provides that the increased income tax rates contained in subsection (1) are to apply with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1986.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1986 (Apr 1987)
================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1986 from PIB vol 162 Apr 1987.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 162, April 1987

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

This Act (which prior to being passed was part of the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 2) 1986) received the Governor-General's assent on 15 December 1986.

The Act gives effect to:

*   The changes to the income tax provisions dealing with primary sector taxation first announced in the Economic Statement of 12 December 1985 and set out in the Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation. Many of the original proposals were modified as a result of the Report of the Consultative Committee on Primary Sector Taxation.
*   The changes to the income tax treatment of Bloodstock Breeders, first announced in the 1986 Budget and outlined in the "Discussion Paper on the Taxation of Bloodstock Breeders". The Act reflects the changes made as a result of the subsequent consultation process.

Other important measures contained in the Amendment Act are:

*   New legislation which deals with information requisitions by the Commissioner in respect of offshore payments, as announced in the 1986 Budget.
*   New legislation which codifies the income tax treatment of GST.
*   The imposition of income tax on the new State-owned Enterprises, the Energy Trading Operators and Harbour Boards, as announced in the Statement on Government Expenditure Reform 1986.
*   The restriction on the offset of losses sustained by Special Partnerships, as announced in the 1986 Budget.
*   Amendments to provide for the payment of provisional tax in three equal instalments.
*   Amendments to provide for the payment of terminal tax by the 11th month of a taxpayer's accounting year and no later than the following 7 February for taxpayers with balance dates falling on or after 31 March.
*   The abolition of the one month's grace period after the due date for payment of both provisional tax and terminal tax before a late payment penalty is imposed.

Application
-----------

As many of the amendments apply from dates other than from the income year commencing 1 April 1986 particular attention should be given to the application dates of the various sections.

Part I - Introduction/Summary of Provisions
-------------------------------------------

Part I of the Amendment Act gives effect to the income tax changes in respect of:

1.  Taxation of Livestock.
2.  Taxation of Bloodstock.
3.  Development Expenditure.
4.  Forestry.
5.  Other Primary Sector Provisions.

The changes in relation to "A", "C", "D" and "E" were first announced in the Economic Statement of 12 December 1985 and outlined in full in the Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation, with many of the original proposals being modified as a result of the Report of the Consultative Committee on Primary Sector Taxation. The changes in relation to "B" are a result of the proposals outlined in the "Discussion Paper on the Taxation of Bloodstock Breeders" issued on Budget night and the subsequent consulting process.

A. Taxation of Livestock
------------------------

**Section 3** inserts new definitions relating to livestock in section 2 of the Income Tax Act.

**Section 5** outlines the different sections under which a taxpayer may elect to value livestock. The section also provides limitations for livestock valuation elections in respect of certain partnerships.

**Section 6** outlines the method by which taxpayers can elect to adopt the various schemes for valuing livestock. The section provides that notification of a change in valuation methods must be given to the Commissioner at least 12 months prior to the income year in which the change is to take effect.

**Section 7** outlines the new trading stock scheme for livestock valuation and outlines the circumstances in which a write-down to standard values must be spread over three income years.

**Section 8** inserts new sections in the Income Tax Act which set out how livestock will be valued under the new schemes and how the income write-off and income spread is to be calculated:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Section 86A | details the new herd scheme. |
| Section 86B | details the cost option. |
| Section 86C | details the high-priced livestock scheme |
| Section 86D | provides for the determination of average market values for livestock. |
| Section 86E | provides for the write-off of part of the livestock revaluation income. |
| Section 86F | provides for the spread of the balance of revaluation income. |
| Section 86G | provides for a number of transitional provisions. |

**Section 9** deals with minor consequential amendments.

The changes outlined below apply only to "specified livestock", namely:

*   Sheep
*   Cattle
*   Deer
*   Goats
*   Pigs

Any livestock other than of these livestock types will continue to be subject to the existing valuation provisions. That is, taxpayers can adopt cost price, market value, replacement price or an approved standard value in respect of such livestock.

Taxpayers owning "specified livestock" are required to revalue their livestock on hand at the end of the 1987 income year and all (in most cases) of the income resulting from the revaluation will be written-off for tax purposes.

Any revaluation income not written-off is eligible to be spread forward over 5 income years.

Taxpayers who cease farming after 12 December 1985 and prior to the end of the 1987 income year are also eligible for an income write-off.

For the 1988 and future income years taxpayers have the choice of 3 schemes for valuing livestock. They are -

1.  the trading stock scheme
2.  the herd scheme
3.  the cost option

A separate valuation scheme applies to high-priced purchased livestock.

### Election

Taxpayers may elect which scheme they want each type of livestock to be valued under. That is, they may elect that their sheep be valued under the Trading Stock Scheme and that their cattle be valued under the Herd Scheme. Where a taxpayer makes no election in respect of a particular livestock type they will be valued under the Trading Stock Scheme.

### Announcement of Standard Values

The Governor-General will, by Order in Council, declare an average market value each income year in respect of each class of specified livestock. Those values will be used for the purposes of valuing livestock under the trading stock scheme and herd scheme.

### Trading Stock Scheme

Under the trading stock scheme livestock will be valued at 70 percent of an average of the market values declared for the previous three years. Under this scheme the value of livestock will fluctuate from year to year according to movements in the market value. Any increase from year to year will be taxable and any decreases tax deductible.

### Herd Scheme

Under the herd scheme livestock will be valued at the declared market value for the income year. Under this scheme any increases in value from year to year will not be taxable at any stage (i.e. effectively an inflation-proofing of livestock). Conversely, any reductions in value between income years will not be tax deductible at any stage.

Immature livestock (e.g. ewe hoggets) or livestock kept only for meat production (e.g. steers) are not able to be valued under the herd scheme.

### Cost Option

Under the cost option livestock will be valued, at the taxpayer's option, at either its cost, its market value or the price for which it can be replaced. Taxpayers electing to value livestock at cost will be required to keep detailed records of stock movements and returns so that an accurate cost can be determined.

Under all three schemes all income from sales of livestock will be taxable and the cost of all purchases deductible. The new schemes simply alter the method of determining the opening and closing values of livestock.

### High Priced Livestock

High-priced purchased livestock will be subject to a separate valuation regime. "High-priced livestock" are defined as livestock that are purchased for not less than 3 times (or, for sheep, 4 times) the average market value declared for the income year prior to the year in which they were purchased.

The cost of high-priced livestock will be written-off at specified rates over the expected economic life of the animal. The specified rates are as follows:

| % of cost price |     |
| --- | --- |
| Sheep | 25  |
| Cattle | 20  |
| Stags | 20  |
| Deer (other than stags) | 15  |
| Goats | 20  |
| Pigs | 33 1/3 |

Immature high-priced livestock purchases must be valued at purchase price until they reach 2 years of age, or in relation to pigs, 1 year of age. After that time the annual write-down may commence.

B. Bloodstock
-------------

This Amendment Act introduces new provisions into the Tax Act to govern the tax treatment that is to apply to thoroughbred and standardbred horses for 1988 and future years. With effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1987 new rules will apply in relation to the valuation of bloodstock, the treatment of racing expenses and the treatment of horses raced by a stud. In addition, the legislation introduces a new provision to enable profits on sale of breeding stock or on insurance recoveries to be offset against the cost of the replacement animal. Briefly, the new treatment is as follows.

### Valuation of Stock on Hand

For 1988 and future years, bloodstock must be valued at its cost price. The only exception to this rule will be in cases where an accident, birth deformity or infertility reduces the market value of a horse by more than 50 percent. In these cases market value may be used.

The cost of breeding stock may be written-down to $1 over a set period that commences in the year in which the animal is first used by the stud for breeding purposes. For stallions, the write-down takes place over a 5 year period at the rate of 20 percent of cost price per annum. For broodmares the write-down is spread evenly over a period that enables the cost to be reduced to $1 in the year in which the mare attains the age of 14 years. For a broodmare first used by a stud for breeding purposes in the year she attains an age of 12 or more years, the write-down must be spread over a three year period.

Transitional rules have been inserted in the legislation for horses owned by the stud at the end of the 1987 tax year. The value at which these horses are brought into account as stock in hand at the end of that year is deemed to be their cost price at the commencement of the 1988 tax year. For horses which commenced to be used for breeding before the end of the 1987 tax year, the legislation enables their 'cost' as at the commencement of the 1988 tax year to be written-off evenly over the remainder of the 5 year period (for stallions) or over the remainder of the period that would have applied had the broodmare been first used for breeding purposes in the 1988 year.

The new legislation applies equally to those thoroughbred horses that are used in the sport horse breeding industry. This industry will be required to value its thoroughbred horses under the new section 84H, with its other horses being required to be valued at cost price, market value or replacement value under section 86(1A).

### Horses Raced by the Stud

For 1988 and future years expenses incurred by a stud in racing a horse will not be allowable as a deduction for tax purposes. An amendment has been made to section 106 to provide that the expenses incurred in preparing a horse for racing, the expenses of racing a horse, and all other racing expenses will not be deductible. The exemption from income tax for stake earnings will continue to apply.

The Amendment Act also introduces a new section 212A to deal with the situation where horses are raced by a breeder other than for business purposes. It treats horses that are incapable of being used for future breeding as being raced as a hobby and all other horses as being raced for business purposes. There is provision in the legislation for breeders who race a horse otherwise than for the reason provided in the legislation to apply to the Commissioner to have that reason recognised for tax purposes. For example, a breeder who races a colt could apply to the Commissioner to recognise that the horse is raced as a hobby rather than for business purposes. The application must be made in writing within the period of one month following the date on which the horse is first prepared for racing by the stud and good reasons will need to be supplied for approval to be granted. Wholesale treatment of stud horses as hobby interests will not be accepted.

Horses treated as being raced for business purposes will remain in the stud accounts at cost price and any sale while racing will be taxable income. Any horse treated as being raced as a hobby will be treated as having been sold by the stud at market value at the time that treatment commences to apply. Any income on the sale of the horse while it is being raced as a hobby will not be taxable. If the breeder decides that the horse should be used as a stud animal when it retires from racing it will be treated as a purchase by the stud at market value.

Transitional provisions contained in the legislation provide that horses held outside the stud accounts in a racing account at the end of the 1987 tax year will be required to remain there for the duration of their racing career. If the horse is subsequently used by the stud for breeding, it will be able to be treated as a purchase by the stud using the same basis of valuation as was previously used on its transfer out of the stud accounts.

### Purchases of Replacement Breeding Stock - Sales and Insurance Recoveries

Section 117(2) and (3) enable depreciation recovered on the sale of fixed assets or on insurance recoveries to be offset against the cost of replacement assets. A new section, 212B, will enable similar treatment to apply to profits on sale of breeding stock and to insurance recoveries on the death of, or permanent injury to, such bloodstock. Breeding stock is defined as being:

*   in the case of any sales of bloodstock, stock that has previously been used for breeding purposes;
*   in the case of any insurance recoveries, bloodstock that has previously been used for breeding purposes or bloodstock that was purchased for breeding purposes.

Where the breeding stock is sold and replacement stock purchased within 6 months after the end of the income year of sale, the profit on sale is not assessable in the year of sale but is instead applied in reduction of the cost price of the replacement animal. Where an insurance recovery is involved, and the replacement animal is purchased within 2 years following the end of the income year in which the loss or damage to the breeding stock occurred, the assessment for the year of recovery will be re-opened to exclude the profit element, and that amount will be applied in reduction of the cost price of the replacement animal. The same conditions as apply for the purposes of section 117(2) and 93) have been incorporated into section 212B.

C. Development Expenditure
--------------------------

### _SECTIONS 11 and 12: Farming and Forestry Development Expenditure_

These sections give effect to the announcement that the current year deduction in respect of farming, aquacultural and forestry development expenditure will be phased-out.

The present deduction for such expenditure is replaced with a depreciation regime which allows depreciation of land improvements to be written-off against assessable income.

The respective rates of depreciation are set out in the Thirteenth Schedule (Third Schedule of Amendment Act).

Forestry development expenditure that is incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 12 December 1985 will continue to be fully deductible until the end of the 1997 income year. This ten-year extension applies also to forestry development expenditure in relation to forests planted by 31 December 1986, but only if the land on which the forest is planted was acquired on or before 12 December 1985.

Under the new depreciation regime, instead of claiming the total amount of such development expenditure as a deduction only the percentage of that expenditure specified in the Thirteenth Schedule can be claimed as a deduction. In the next year the same percentage of the diminished value of that expenditure can be claimed as a deduction, in the same manner as plant and machinery is depreciated at present.

When farm or forestry land is sold, the balance of any development expenditure that has not been deducted by the vendor (by way of depreciation) can be deducted by the purchaser on the same basis as the vendor would have deducted the expenditure had he retained the land. In other words, the purchaser takes over the asset at it's \[sic\] diminished value (the vendor's book value) and continues to claim depreciation each year, at the rate specified, in relation to that asset.

The new treatment outlined will generally apply to all the categories of farming and forestry expenditure deductible under the existing development expenditure provisions, but in addition will apply to the cost of planting horticultural trees and vines. Any plantings of such trees or vines prior to the commencement of the 1 April 1987 income year will not be eligible for depreciation.

D. Forestry
-----------

### _SECTION 4: Forestry Planting and Maintenance Expenditure_

This section gives effect to the announcement that the current year deduction for most forestry planting and maintenance expenditure is to be phased-out so that in the 1992 income year the total amount of such expenditure must be capitalised to a "cost of forest" account and deductible only when income is derived from the forest.

Where such expenditure is incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 12 December 1985, that expenditure will continue to be deductible until the end of the 1997 income year. This 10-year extension will apply also to forestry planting and maintenance expenditure in relation to forests planted by 31 December 1986, but only if the land on which the forest is planted was acquired on or before 12 December 1985.

The following categories of expenditure will continue to be deductible in the year in which they are incurred -

1.  rent, rates, land tax, insurance premiums, administrative overheads or other like expenses.
2.  weed control (excluding releasing) or pest control or disease control undertaken subsequent to the planting of the forest.
3.  interest.
4.  repairs and maintenance on plant and machinery.
5.  repairs and maintenance on land improvements e.g. roads, fences, dams, etc..

E. Other Primary Sector Provisions
----------------------------------

### _SECTION 13: Interest and Development Expenditure Recovery Provisions (Section 129)_

This section gives effect to the announcement that the section 129 "claw-back" provisions will not apply to sales of land used by the taxpayer for the business of farming, agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, aquaculture or forestry, made after 12 December 1985.

The section also amends the "stepping-stone farmer" provision of section 129. Any replacement property purchased will no longer be required to be retained for 10 years in order to exempt the previous sale, notwithstanding that the previous sale may have occurred prior to 12 December 1985.

### _SECTION 14: Farmers Expenditure on Tree Planting_

This section phases-out the deduction in respect of all but the first $7,500 of expenditure incurred by farmers in relation to tree planting.

The present requirement that the trees must be planted for shelter or erosion control purposes has been abolished.

Where such expenditure is incurred pursuant to a binding contract (other than with a relative) entered into on or before 12 December 1985, that expenditure will continue to be deductible until the end of the 1997 income year.

### _SECTION 15: Losses Incurred In Specified Activities_

This section gives effect to the announcement that the $10,000 loss limitation provisions of section 188A will no longer apply to losses incurred in the 1987 or future income years by taxpayers in relation to primary sector specified activities.

Specifically, the exemption will apply to:

1.  Livestock farming
2.  Poultry-keeping
3.  Bee-keeping
4.  The breeding of horses
5.  The growing of annual flowers
6.  Horticulture

Any losses in relation to such activities that were incurred prior to the 1987 income year will continue to be subject to the $10,000 per annum offset of such losses.

F. Other Provisions
-------------------

### _Section 17_

This section empowers the Commissioner to disallow a deduction claimed by a taxpayer for an offshore payment where:

*   the Commissioner gives an information requisition in respect of the offshore payment to the taxpayer (or some other person) and
*   the taxpayer (or other person) fails to respond to the requisition within 90 days of the mailing of the requisition.

Where the taxpayer responds to the requisition within the time period, the only evidence admissible in any proceedings under Part III of the Act in relation to questions asked in the requisition concerning the offshore payment is

*   evidence provided in the person's response to the requisition if such evidence can be verified by the Commissioner, or
*   evidence provided by the taxpayer where the requisition was given to a person other than the taxpayer.

### _Section 18 - Rates to be fixed by Annual Taxing Act_

Section 18 amends section 39 of the Income Tax Act to provide that the rates of income tax need not be annually fixed in specific Acts passed by Parliament for that purpose, but can be fixed by Income Tax Amendment Acts.

### _Section 19 - Principal Income Earner Rebate_

This section amends section 50B of the Income Tax Act by adding a new proviso to restrict the amount of rebate claimed by any taxpayer who received an income tested benefit or specified war pension to the difference between the tax assessed and the PAYE deductions made from the benefit or war pension payments.

### _Section 20 - Transitional Tax Allowance_

Section 20 amends the provisions of the transitional tax allowance which under section 50C of the principal Act is claimable as a tax rebate.

The effect of the amendment is to reduce from 30 to 20 the number of hours a person must be engaged in remunerative work each week to qualify for the transitional tax allowance.

### _Section 21 - Family Rebate_

This section amends section 53C of the Act by adding a new proviso to restrict the amount of family rebate claimed by any taxpayer who received an income-tested benefit or specified war pension to the difference between the tax assessed and the PAYE deductions made from the benefit or war pension payments.

### _Section 22 - Incomes Wholly Exempt From Income Tax_

This section amends section 61 of the principal Act by -

1.  removing the reference to the "Cook Islands" from subsections (9) and (48) of that section. The reference to "Niue" remains.
2.  making exempt from income tax Jurors' and Witness' fees (other than expert witnesses fees) paid by the Crown.

### _Section 23 - Niue Development Projects_

This section substitutes a new section 62 in the principal Act and continues the exemption from tax of New Zealand companies deriving income from development projects in Niue.

### _Section 24 - Items included in Assessable Income_

This section amends section 65 of the principal Act by substituting and inserting a new subsection (1B). The purpose of this amendment is to correct a drafting point to make it clear that one-off gratuitous payments made to spouses or relatives of deceased employees are non-taxable.

### _Section 25 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees_

This section amends section 68 of the principal Act to enable redundancy payments made to seasonal workers to come within the provisions of the section and therefore receive the concessional tax treatment.

### _Section 26 - Power to Exempt Expenditure on Account of an Employee_

A new section has been introduced allowing the Commissioner to exempt from Income Tax certain amounts which are deemed under section 2 to be expenditure on account of an employee and assessable for income tax.

This exemption only applies where, had the expenditure been discharged by the employee, it would have been deemed to have been incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income.

### _Section 27 - Supplementary Depreciation Allowance for Plant and Machinery used in Two and Three Shift Industries_

This section amends section 113A of the principal Act to allow the supplementary allowance to be claimed in year one, in addition to years two to five, for qualifying plant and machinery in cases where the first year depreciation allowance cannot be claimed.

### _Section 28 - Recovery of Depreciation_

This section amends section 117 of the principal Act to allow a deduction against depreciation recovered on the disposal of an asset for the costs attributable to the disposal.

### _Section 29 - Accounting for the Income Tax Implications of GST_

Section 29 adds a new section 140B to the Income Tax Act which codifies the income tax treatment of GST. In general, GST is not taken into account in calculating assessable income except where a deduction of input tax cannot be made by the taxpayer, and except in respect of GST adjustments which arise from the operation of section 21(1), 21(3) and 21(5) of the GST Act.

### _Section 30 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees_

This section amends section 152 of the principal Act and is consequential to the amendment made to section 68 - refer to section 25 of the Amendment Act. Section 152 governs the deductibility of retiring allowances and redundancy payments in calculating the assessable income of employers making such payments.

### _Section 31 - Export-Market Development and Tourist-promotion Incentive_

Section 31 amends section 156F of the principal Act to exclude from the export-market development expenditure and tourist-promotion expenditure tax incentives credit, any expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1986, in relation to the Republic of South Africa. Provision is made for any such expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1986 under a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986 to qualify under the section.

### _Section 32 - Export-Market Development Activities Incentive for Self-Employed Taxpayers_

Section 32 amends section 156G of the principal Act to exclude export-market development activities (value of time) incurred by a self-employed taxpayer on or after 1 December 1986 in relation to the Republic of South Africa.

It will mean that a self-employed taxpayer cannot claim a tax credit for any export-market development activities performed on or after 1 December 1986, other than any performed pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986, where that expenditure is in respect of the promotion of export of goods or services to the Republic of South Africa.

### _Section 33 - State-owned Enterprises, Energy Trading Operators and Harbour Boards_

Section 33 inserts 3 new sections into the Income Tax Act namely -

*   Section 197B - State-owned Enterprises
*   Section 197C - Energy Trading Operators
*   Section 197D - Harbour Boards

This gives effect to the Government's policy that the above organisations are to be subject to income tax as separate entities.

### _Section 34 - Insurance effected with persons not carrying on business in New Zealand_

Section 34 amends section 209 of the principal Act to ensure that any insurance premium or any payment that is reimbursement of an insurance premium paid to any person not carrying on business in New Zealand by -

1.  any person resident in New Zealand, or
2.  any person not resident in New Zealand in respect of assets or risks situated in New Zealand,

is subject to tax in terms of section 209.

### _Section 35 - Special Partnerships_

This section provides that where a special partnership sustains a partnership loss in any income year no partner shall be allowed a deduction for any outgoing of the partnership nor shall any partner derive any income of the partnership.

The section shall apply to those special partnerships registered

1.  on or after 1 August 1986 or
2.  prior 1 August 1986 where the partnership obtains additional capital from any source on or after 1 August 1986. (Subject to two exceptions explained in the detailed analysis contained in this circular).

### _Section 36 - Application of Excess Retention Tax_

Section 36 amends section 248 of the principal Act to ensure that a New Zealand privately controlled investment company whose income is derived exclusively or principally from the Cook Islands or a company in respect of which an Order in Council has been made under section 62 of the principal Act, is no longer specifically exempt from the application of Part V (Excess Retention Tax) of the Act.

### _Section 37 - Value of Fringe Benefit_

This section substitutes the method of valuing subsidised transport benefits provided to employees of transport operators. As from 1 April 1987 such benefits are to be valued at the greater of 25 percent of the highest priced fare for that class of travel provided or the price payable by the employee to the benefit provided.

### _Section 38 - Regulations - Prescribed Rate of Interest_

This section provides that the prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the value of low interest loan fringe benefits can be set quarterly as opposed to annually. The amended section requires that if the rate is to be changed the regulations changing the rate must be made one month prior to the commencement at the next quarter.

### _Section 39 - Payment of Provisional Tax by Instalments_

Section 39 amends section 385 of the principal Act to provide for the payment of provisional tax in three equal instalments due on the 7th day of the months set out in the new Eighth Schedule introduced by this section. Special transitional arrangements are included for the first year of the new instalment system.

### _Section 40 - Payment of Terminal Tax_

This section provides for:

1.  the payment of terminal tax on the 11th month of a taxpayer's accounting year for taxpayers with balance dates on or before 31 March. Other taxpayers must pay terminal tax on 7 February each year.
2.  the abolition of the one month's grace after the due date for payment before a late payment penalty is imposed. This one month's grace is removed in respect of both provisional and terminal tax payments.

The provisions will apply equally in respect of individuals and companies.

### _Section 41 - Relief from Additional Tax_

This section amends section 413(4) of the principal Act which provides for the Minister of Finance to approve cases for remission of tax where the amount exceeds a certain limit.

The amendment increased the limit, which was last reviewed in 1977, from $1,000 to $5,000 and applies from 15 December 1986, the date this Amendment Act received the Governor-General's assent.

### _Section 42 - Relief in Cases of Serious Hardship_

This section amends section 414(5) of the principal Act and increases the limit under which cases have to be referred to the Minister of Finance for remission of tax in cases of serious hardship, from $1,000 to $5,000.

This section will apply from 15 December 1986, the date this Act received the Governor-General's assent.

### _Section 43 - Publication of Names of Tax Evaders_

Section 43 amends section 427 of the principal Act which requires the Commissioner to publish from time to time, in the Gazette, particulars of offenders against the Act.

The section has been amended to ensure:

1.  the names of persons convicted of aiding, abetting, or inciting tax deduction offences are published in the Gazette; and
2.  the names of persons convicted of certain offences relating to the Family Support Tax Credit scheme are published in the Gazette; and
3.  the names of persons who have penal tax imposed under section 374O of the Act (Family Support Tax Credit) are published in the Gazette.

### _Section 44 - Dates for Payment of Income Tax and Provisional Tax_

This section substitutes a new Eighth Schedule into the principal Act. This new Eighth Schedule contains, for each balance date, the months for payment of provisional tax instalments and the month for payment of terminal tax.

Part II - Livestock Valuation Provisions
----------------------------------------

### 1\. Outline

*   1.1
    *   The Amendment Act contains a number of provisions which give effect to the new methods for valuing livestock. The relevant sections are:
        *   **Section 3** - Inserts definitions into section 2 of the principal Act.
        *   **Section 5** - Sets out the various sections under which livestock can now be valued.
        *   **Section 6** - Sets out the method by which taxpayers can elect to adopt the various valuation schemes.
        *   **Section 7** - "Trading Stock Scheme/Standard Values Scheme".
        *   **Section 8** - Inserts 8 new sections -
            *   Section 86A - "Herd Scheme"
            *   Section 86B - "Cost Option"
            *   Section 86C - "High-Priced Livestock Scheme"
            *   Section 86D - Determination of Average Market Values
            *   Section 86E - Income Write-off
            *   Section 86F - Income Spread
            *   Section 86G - Transitional Provisions
            *   Section 86H - Bloodstock
        *   **Section 9** \- Consequential Amendments
            *   First Schedule - Livestock Classes
            *   Sixth Schedule - High-Priced Livestock Values
    *   The provisions relating to bloodstock are covered in Part III of this publication.
*   1.2
    *   This Part:
        *   summarises the old valuation scheme:
        *   explains the new valuation schemes:
        *   details the transitional provisions that apply in respect of the move from the old to the new schemes.

### 2\. Old Valuation Schemes

*   2.1 Prior to the enactment of the Amendment Act. farmers had two basic options for valuing livestock on hand at the end of any income year. They were:
    *   either cost price, market selling value or replacement price (the methods by which all other taxpayers must value their trading stock) (Section 84(5)); or
    *   a standard value (section 86).
*   By far the majority of farmers elected to adopt a standard value in respect of their livestock. The advantage for the farmer of the standard values scheme was that, once adopted, those values were fixed for the term of the farming business. For example, a farmer who adopted the $20 standard value for cattle in 1968 could still use that value in 1986 even though the market value for cattle may then be ten times that standard value.
*   2.2 One of the effects of the disparity between the farmer's book value and the market value was that when a substantial number of the farmer's livestock were sold a large income tax liability arose. This led to a number of provisions being enacted which minimised the tax liability in such cases. They are:
*   |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Section 89 | \-  | Allows a farmer to transfer livestock to a child at standard value thereby avoiding any tax liability. |
    | Section 93 | \-  | Allows the income from the sale of a substantial number of livestock to be spread back over three income years (or forward over 3 income years in the case of retirement from farming). |
    | Section 94 | \-  | Deferment of income arising from livestock sold as the result of an adverse event (e.g. flood,drought). |
    | Section 95 | \-  | Deferment from income of livestock sold where a sharemilker or lessee farmer quits his farm and purchases another farm. |
    
*   As well as the standard values scheme farmers could adopt a nil value for increases in livestock numbers (section 86).

### 3\. New Valuation Scheme

*   **3.1**
    *   As part of the Government's moves to restructure the primary sector it was announced in the Economic Statement of 12 December 1985 that the old standard values and nil values scheme would be abolished. They would be replaced with new livestock valuation schemes which would value the trading stock of farmers more in line with the valuation of trading stock in other sectors. Transitional provisions were announced that would minimise the tax consequences of the movement from the old scheme to the new schemes.
    *   A general overview of the new schemes and the transitional provisions is contained in Part I of this publication.
    *   A detailed section by section analysis of the legislation relating to the new livestock valuation schemes follows.
*   **3.2**
    *   Section 1 - Short Title
    *   This section provides the title of the Amendment Act and provides that the Amendment Act shall form part of the Income Tax Act 1976.
*   **3.3**
    *   Section 2 - Application
    *   This section provides that, except where otherwise stated, Part I of the Act applies in respect of the income year that commenced on 1 April 1986 and every subsequent income year.
    *   This means that the livestock provisions introduced in this Amendment Act first apply in the 1987 income year unless any of the relevant provisions have an alternate application date.
*   **3.4**
    *   Section 3 - Interpretation
    *   This section inserts three new definitions into section 2 of the Principal Act.
    *   "Bloodstock" (refer to Part III of this publication)
    *   "Herd livestock" in relation to any taxpayer, means any animal (being specified livestock) that is, -
        *   "(a) In relation to any of the classes of livestock set out in column (3) of the Twelfth Schedule to this Act, an animal of that class; and
        *   "(b) Owned by that taxpayer primarily for the purposes of production of progeny or wool or milk or velvet or fibre or primarily for any combination of those purposes:
            *   "'Specified livestock' means any animal that is, in relation to any of the types of livestock set out in the column (1) of the Twelfth Schedule to this Act, an animal of that type:"

### Specified Livestock Definition

*   Looking at the definition of "specified livestock", it is important to note that the definition relates to "types of livestock".
*   Column (1) of the Twelfth Schedule (as inserted by the First Schedule to the Act) lists the following types of livestock:
    *   Sheep
    *   Cattle
    *   Deer
    *   Goats
    *   Pigs
*   It will be seen from the ensuing analysis of the other relevant sections that the new valuation schemes apply only to the "specified" types of livestock as listed above, with separate rules applying to non-specified livestock types such as fitches and llamas.
*   Herd Livestock Definition
*   In relation to the definition of "herd livestock" the definition is limited to "specified livestock" with parts (a) and (b) of the definition further limiting the definition.
*   Paragraph (a) provides that the following classes of livestock (as set out in column (3) of the Twelfth Schedule) are herd livestock.
    
    | Type | Herd Livestock |
    | --- | --- |
    | Sheep | Two-tooth ewes |
    |     | Mixed-age ewes |
    |     | Five-year and six-year ewes |
    |     | Mixed-age wethers |
    |     | Breeding rams |
    | Cattle | Rising two-year and older heifers (maiden/first calving) |
    |     | Mixed-age cows (second and subsequent calving) |
    |     | Breeding bulls |
    | Deer | Rising two-year and older hinds (maiden/first fawning) |
    |     | Mixed-age hinds (second and subsequent fawning hinds) |
    |     | Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding) |
    |     | Breeding stags |
    | Goats | Rising two-year does \* |
    |     | Mixed-age does \* |
    |     | Bucks (non-breeding)/wethers over one year |
    |     | Breeding bucks |
    | Pigs | Breeding sows over one year of age |
    |     | Breeding boars |
    
    *   It has been decided that these two classes should be combined and referred to as "rising two-year and mixed-aged does". It is intended that an amendment to the Twelfth Schedule will be made to incorporate this decision.
    *   From the above list it can be seen that only "mature" livestock classes can be classified as herd livestock which means, for example, ewe hoggets are not herd livestock. It is not necessary that the livestock be breeding livestock (mixed-age wethers are herd livestock), but they must be of an age where, were they breeding stock, they would be capable of breeding.
*   Paragraph (b) of the definition provides that to be herd livestock they must be owned by the taxpayer primarily for the production of any of, or any combination of, the following products:
    *   progeny (all types)
    *   wool (sheep)
    *   milk (dairy cattle/milking goats)
    *   velvet (deer)
    *   fibre (goats)
*   In effect, this means that only animals farmed principally for the production of meat are not herd livestock. The obvious example of non-herd livestock is steers. They are not capable of producing progeny and do not produce any by-product. Other examples are bulls which are purchased for fattening and resale rather than for the production of progeny, and sheep that are fattening stock only.
*   The purpose of the limitations imposed by paragraphs (a) and (b) is to ensure that only animals which are purchased other than primarily for the purposes of trading are eligible for the herd scheme. The rationale of this distinction is explained in detail in the Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation. Briefly, the herd scheme recognises that herd livestock are more in the nature of a "machine" than trading stock. They are held for the production of progeny (e.g. lambs) or a by-product (e.g. wool) rather than for the purposes of sale as trading stock. In recognition of this difference a different method of valuation applies to livestock included in the herd scheme. Details of the method of valuation are outlined in full later in this publication.

### _3.5 Section 5 - Livestock Valuations - Controlling Section_

This section amends section 85 of the Principal Act by inserting new subsections (4A) to (4D).

Section 85 sets out the rules for valuing trading stock (including livestock). Before discussing the new subsections it is necessary to summarise the effect of the principal existing subsections.

*   _**Subsection (2)**_ provides that a taxpayer in business must take into account the value of his trading stock at the beginning and end of every income year for the purposes of determining that taxpayer's assessable income. Hobby farmers (farmers who do not meet the "business test" requirements) are therefore not affected by any of the amendments discussed in this publication dealing with the valuation of livestock.
*   _**Subsection (3)**_ provides that the value of opening stock shall be the value of the closing stock for the previous income year.
*   _**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the value of closing stock shall be, at the taxpayer's option, its -
    *   cost price;
    *   market value;
    *   or replacement price.

Additional subsections now inserted -

_**Subsection (4A) - Valuation of Livestock**_

*   This subsection overrides subsection (4) in relation to the valuation of closing livestock and is the controlling subsection for the various livestock valuation schemes available. Because of the lead-in words "Notwithstanding anything in subsection (4)" the new subsection (4A) is not simply an alternative to subsection 4, but it means that subsection (4) can no longer apply to livestock.
*   Note also in the lead-in that subsection (4A) applies to all livestock (not just specified livestock), but the subsection does not apply to "livestock used in dealing operations". Therefore taxpayers buying and selling livestock as a business, rather than farming the livestock, are limited to the valuation options outlined in subsection (4). Livestock dealers were excluded also from the old standard values scheme.
*   Each of paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (4A) deal with a separate valuation scheme and state how the closing value of livestock included in that scheme is to be determined. The various schemes are explained in detail later in this publication.
    *   Paragraph (a) provides that all livestock other than specified livestock (e.g. fitches, llamas) are to be valued under the appropriate provisions of section 86 (the "standard values scheme").
    *   Paragraph (b) provides that, unless the taxpayer elects otherwise, specified livestock are to be valued under the appropriate provisions of section 86 (the "trading stock scheme").
    *   Paragraph (c) provides that, where the taxpayer so elects (explained later), specified livestock are to be valued under section 86A (the "herd scheme").
    *   Paragraph (d) provides that, where the taxpayer so elects, specified livestock are to be valued in accordance with section 86B (the "cost option").
    *   Paragraph (e) provides that "high-priced livestock", as defined in section 86C, are to be valued under that section (the "high-priced livestock scheme").
*   Note the effect of paragraph (b). Unless the taxpayer elects otherwise, the trading stock scheme will apply automatically.
*   Note also that paragraphs (b) to (d) state they do not apply to high-priced livestock, meaning that such livestock cannot be valued under any scheme other than the "high-priced livestock scheme".

_**Subsection (4B) - Partnership Restriction**_

*   This new subsection overrides subsection (4) and the new subsection (4A) of section 85 in relation to livestock owned by certain new partnerships. It provides that where a new partnership is formed in any income year and:
*   the new partnership owns a type of specified livestock (e.g. cattle): and
*   more than 50 percent of the property of the new partnership is owned by partners that own or owned, either in that income year or in the preceding income year, all the property of another partnership; and
*   the other partnership owned the same type of specified livestock (i.e. cattle), then the new partnership must value that type of livestock under the same valuation scheme as the other partnership.

The purpose of this provision is to ensure that taxpayers in partnerships cannot change valuation schemes (and thus circumvent the 2 years notice requirement - see commentary under section 6) simply by forming another partnership of principally the same partners.

**Example**

Husband/wife partnership own sheep which are in the trading stock scheme. They decide it would be more profitable to have their mature sheep in the herd scheme but do not want to give the required two years notice. They dissolve the partnership and form a new partnership with their son, each having a one-third interest. The new partnership owns sheep and cattle.

As more than 50 percent of the property of the new partnership is owned by taxpayers who owned all the property of another partnership, the new partnership must adopt the trading stock scheme in respect of its sheep. As the previous partnership did not own cattle the new partnership can adopt any scheme it wishes in respect of its cattle.

Note the following features of this provision:

*   The "other partnership" would need to be dissolved more than one income year prior to the income year in which the new partnership is formed in order for the new partnership to be exempted from this provision;
*   It will apply only where all of the partners of the other partnership form part of the new partnership;
*   It applies only to the type of specified livestock owned by the other partnership in the income year the new partnership is formed or in the preceding income year.
*   It applies regardless of whether the other partnership is dissolved, the only requirement being that the new partnership is formed after the other partnership.

_**Subsection (4C) - Valuation of Livestock at Date of Death**_

*   This new subsection overrides the other provisions of section 85 to provide that, where a taxpayer dies, the closing value of livestock in the tax return to date of death shall be the value determined for the purposes of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Generally this is a market value determined by a livestock valuer and is known as the probate value. If the livestock is then transferred to the trustee of the estate who continues the farming business, being a new taxpayer the estate will be subject to the other provisions of section 85 in relation to the valuation of livestock. The livestock would enter the books of the estate at probate value and would be valued at balance date according to the valuation scheme adopted by the estate.

_**Subsection (4D) - Death of a Partner**_

*   This new subsection provides that, where a partner of a farming partnership dies and the executor carries on the business in partnership with the surviving partner, the partnership livestock will be valued at probate value (market value at date of death) for the purposes of determining the assessable income of the deceased in the return to date of death. It should be noted that any increase or decrease in the value of livestock as a result of the application of this provision is treated as partnership income rather than the income of the deceased partner only. That is, the total partnership livestock is valued at probate value in the partnership accounts to date of death and the deceased's share of the partnership income reflected in those accounts is included in the deceased's return to date of death. However, this adjustment has no net effect on the income of the surviving partner who continues in partnership with the executor, as at the end of that income year the closing livestock will be valued according to the valuation scheme the partnership had previously adopted. The partnership income for that year would then be calculated on the basis of those values rather than probate values.

_**Subsection (2) - Valuation of Bloodstock**_

*   Subsection (2) of section 5 of the Amendment Act adds another valuation method to section 85(4A) of the principal Act, and applies to bloodstock (refer to Part III of this publication).

**Schedule Inserted**

Subsection (3) of section 5 of the Amendment Act inserts a Twelfth Schedule into the principal Act. The Twelfth Schedule (First Schedule to the Amendment Act) sets out the various -

*   types of livestock (column 1)
*   classes of livestock (column 2)
*   herd livestock classes (column 3)

As explained earlier in this publication, the types of livestock listed are the types that come within the definition of specified livestock, and the herd livestock classes are the classes eligible to be valued under the herd scheme.

Column (2) of the Twelfth Schedule lists the following various livestock classes for which values will be set each year:

|     | Growing pigs over 17 weeks of age (baconers) |

### Classification in Tax Returns

*   For the 1987 income year and subsequent income years farmers will be required to classify their livestock (for income tax purposes) according to these classes. However, farmers may, if they wish, further break down their livestock schedules although this will not affect the values that will be placed on the livestock. For example, a sheep farmer may wish to show three-year and four-year old ewes as separate categories, but both categories will have the same value for income tax purposes (the value announced for mixed-age ewes).
*   Note that in the preceding list of livestock classes there is a lesser number of categories and classes for goats than shown in the Twelfth Schedule. This reduction results from a decision to consolidate the angora goat categories and include rising two-year does as mixed-age does. It is intended that the Twelfth Schedule will be amended in the next legislative round to give effect to this decision, although there will be no effect on the livestock values to be announced in respect of the 1987 income year. Each of the classes which are to be amalgamated will simply be given the same value which will be struck on the basis of the average of all those classes.

### Application

*   _**Subsection (4)**_ of section 5 of the Amendment Act provides that the section applies from the income year commencing on 1 April 1987 (i.e. the 1988 income year). This means that for the 1987 and prior years the new valuation schemes are not available. However, as discussed later, transitional provisions apply in respect of the 1987 income year.

### _3.6 Section 6 - Livestock Valuation Elections_

*   Section 6 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 85A into the Principal Act which allows a taxpayer to elect to adopt any of the various livestock valuation schemes, and sets out the procedure to be followed when doing so.
*   Right of Election
*   _**Subsection (1)**_ is the operative subsection which gives taxpayers the right to elect to adopt a particular valuation scheme.
    *   "Any taxpayer who is required to take into account the value of any specified livestock ... (exclusive of any high-priced livestock ...) on hand at the end of any income year ..."
*   The right of election applies only to taxpayers who are required to take into account the value of closing stock. As discussed earlier in this publication, only taxpayers in business are required to value opening and closing stock. This means that taxpayers not in business (e.g. hobby farmers) do not have the rights of election available under section 85A. Referring back to section 85(4A) (as inserted by section 5 of the Amendment Act), paragraph (b) provides that, where a taxpayer has not made an election in accordance with section 85A, the closing value of that taxpayer's specified livestock is to be determined under section 86 (trading stock scheme). Therefore one of the effects of subsection (1) of section 85A is that the herd scheme and the cost option are not available to taxpayers not in the business of livestock farming.

### Election Irrevocable

*   "... (which election shall, after the end of the income year in which it is made, be irrevocable) ...."
*   The election can be revoked at any time during the income year in which it is made but after that time it cannot be revoked. Any revocation of an election should be given in writing and must be in the hands of the Inland Revenue Department prior to the end of the income year in which the election was received by the Department.

### Effect of Election

*   Subsection (2) determines what livestock of a taxpayer the election applies to. Paragraph (a) provides that where the election requests that a type of livestock be valued under section 86 (trading stock scheme) or section 86B (cost option), that election shall apply to all livestock of that type owned by that taxpayer other than herd livestock in relation to which the taxpayer has separately elected to have valued under section 86A (herd scheme). For example, if a taxpayer elects to value his sheep under the trading stock scheme all the sheep owned by that taxpayer must be valued under that scheme. However if he has made a separate election to value his "herd livestock" (as defined) in relation to sheep under the herd scheme, then only the remaining classes of sheep would be valued under the trading stock scheme.
*   Paragraph (b) states the same requirement in respect of an election to value a type of livestock under the herd scheme. Any election must apply to all "herd livestock" of that type. For example, a taxpayer who owns both dairy and beef cattle cannot elect to adopt the herd scheme in respect of, for example, dairy cattle only. The election would apply to all "herd livestock" that are cattle.

### Election Procedure

*   Subsection (3) sets out the procedure for the making of an election to adopt a particular livestock valuation scheme. It provides that the notice of election -
    1.  shall be in writing:
    2.  shall state the income year in relation to which it is to first apply:
    3.  shall state the section of the Act (i.e. the scheme) in relation to which it applies.

### Time Limits for Election

*   Paragraph (d) sets out the time by which the election must be given to the Department.
*   Subparagraph (i) relates to the situation where the election first applies in a year in which a taxpayer commences to derive income from a type of livestock which the taxpayer has not owned in either of the two preceding income years. In those situations the notice of election must be filed with the Department by the time in which the taxpayer is required to file the return of income for the year in respect of which the election applies, "or within such further time as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may allow". This means that new farmers or farmers commencing (or recommencing) to farm a particular type of livestock in any year can include their notice of election with the income tax return for that year and the election will apply from that year so long as the return is filed by the due date (which includes any extension of time). Any notice of election made after that time may still be accepted if the Commissioner exercises the discretion given to him to do so. Any decision to allow a late election can only be made on a case by case basis after consideration of the reasons given for the late notice.
*   Subparagraph (ii) relates to existing farmers who are not commencing to farm a new type of livestock (i.e., all taxpayers other than those covered by subparagraph (i)). It provides that, where subparagraph (i) does not apply, the notice of election must be given to the Department "prior to the end of the income year that precedes, by one income year and one day," the first day of the income year in which the election is to apply.

### _Example_

*   If a taxpayer wishes to adopt the herd scheme for cattle in the 1990 income year, and the taxpayer has owned cattle in one of the two preceding income years, the notice of election must be given to the Department prior to the end of the 1988 income year. If the taxpayer operates a 30 June balance date the notice of election would have to be furnished on or before 30 June 1988. However, if the taxpayer had not previously owned cattle the notice of election could be forwarded with the 1990 income tax return.
*   Note that the notice of election can be furnished in any number of years prior to the year to which it first relates. However, as previously outlined, the notice cannot be revoked after the end of the income year in which it is made.

### Application Life of Election

*   _**Subsection (4)**_ provides that an election shall continue to apply (as stated by the taxpayer in the notice of election) up until, but not including, the income year in which a subsequent election first applies.

### Election by Partnership

*   _**Subsection (5)**_ provides rules for elections by partnerships. Paragraph (a) states that where any specified livestock are owned by two or more persons Jointly, the valuation of that livestock shall not be affected by an election made by one of those persons in relation to livestock owned in that person's own right.

### _Example_

*   A farmer owns 200 deer in his own right and 100 in partnership, all of which are valued under the trading stock scheme. If the farmer elects to adopt the herd scheme in respect or the 200 deer the 100 deer owned in partnership are not affected by that election.
*   Paragraph (b) provides that partnerships, or any other taxpayers who jointly own livestock, are entitled to make a joint election in respect of that livestock.

### Election Must Have Consent Of All Partners

Paragraph (c) provides that the Commissioner can disregard a joint election if he is not satisfied that at the time the election is made, "it is made by all the persons who, at that time, Jointly own the specified livestock". This means every partner of the partnership or every co-owner of livestock under any arrangement must agree to the election. Note that the unanimous agreement must be from the persons who are the owners of the livestock at the time the election is made. Therefore, if subsequent to the election one partner sells his share of the livestock to a new partner the consent of the new partner is not required in order for the election to continue to apply.

The purpose of paragraph (c) is to ensure that one partner of a partnership cannot make an election in respect of partnership livestock without the consent of the other partners. Although subsection (1) of section 85A provides that an election becomes irrevocable after the end of the income year in which it is made, that provision would have no effect if the Commissioner is not satisfied that all partners consented to the election. This unanimous consent requirement will be applied also in relation to a notice asking for a prior notice of election to be revoked. If the Commissioner is not satisfied that the notice of revocation is consented to by all the co-owners then the original election will stand.

Generally, any notice of election in respect of partnership livestock will be accepted by the Department as being made by all the partners unless information is presented to the contrary. This policy will ensure elections by partnerships are not subject to additional compliance requirements but at the same time allows any partner who was not party to the election to apply to the Commissioner to have it disregarded.

**Subsection (6)** is the normal accounting year provision which provides that references in the new section 85A to an income year will be deemed to refer to an accounting year where the taxpayer has other than a 31 March balance date.

### Examples of the effect of Section 85A

From the preceding commentary it can be seen that the only scheme that requires no initial notice of election is the trading stock scheme. New farmers, or farmers who commence to farm a new type of livestock, are required to give notice of the scheme they wish to adopt and if they don't they will automatically be subject to the trading stock scheme. Once any scheme is adopted, including the automatic adoption of the trading stock scheme, an election must be made to adopt any alternative scheme. It is of no consequence what scheme was being applied, and what scheme is being adopted - the election requirements are the same in each case. The following are examples of the effects of section 85A:

### Example 1

*   New farmer - first year 1990.
*   Owns sheep only.
*   Wishes to adopt trading stock scheme.
    *   No election required - trading stock scheme applies automatically.

### Example 2

*   New farmer - first year 1990.
*   Owns sheep and cattle
*   Wishes to adopt
    *   trading stock scheme for sheep
    *   herd scheme for "herd class" cattle
    *   trading stock scheme for other cattle
*   No election required for sheep or 'non-herd class" cattle.
*   Election to adopt herd scheme for herd class cattle to be filed by the time within which the 1990 return of the taxpayer is required to be furnished (taking into account any extension of time given).
*   Herd scheme will apply from and including the 1990 income year and until the taxpayer makes a subsequent election to adopt an alternative scheme (i.e. cost option or trading stock scheme).

### Example 3

*   Existing farmer
*   Sheep included in trading stock scheme
*   Commences to farm deer in 1991 income year
*   Wishes to adopt cost option for deer for 1991 and future years
*   Election to adopt cost option for deer to be filed by 1991 return filing date. Provided that, if farmer has owned deer in either of two preceding income years election to be filed by end of 1989 income year.

### Example 4

*   Existing farmer
*   Owns deer which are valued under cost option
*   Wishes to adopt herd scheme for herd class deer and trading stock scheme for other
*   Election to first apply in 1992 income year.
*   Two notices of election required both of which must be filed by end of 1990 income year.

### _3.7 Section 7 - Standard Value of Livestock_

This section repeals the whole of section 86 of the Principal Act, which provided for a standard values system of livestock valuation, and substitutes a new section which:

*   introduces a trading stock scheme in respect of specified livestock:
*   retains the old standard values scheme in respect of other types of livestock.

Under the trading stock scheme livestock will be valued at a "standard value" which (in effect) will be determined each year by Order in Council.

In relation to livestock that are not specified livestock they also can be valued using a standard value system. However the value will not be revised each year and will be determined by the Commissioner (i.e. the old standard values system continues to apply where appropriate).

**Subsection (1)** of the replacement section 86 contains two definitions.

*   "Deductible Excess" (see commentary under subsection (2) on page 35)
*   "Standard Value"

### Definition of Standard Value

Paragraph (a) of the definition of "standard value" relates to specified livestock and provides that, in relation to any income year, the "standard value" is to be determined by the following formula.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VALUE | x   | 100 |
| 70  | 3   |

*   Value =the sum of
    1.  the average market value declared for that income year for that class of livestock.
    2.  the average market value declared for the previous income year for that class of livestock.
    3.  the average market value declared for the income year immediately preceding that previous income year for that class of livestock.

For example, say the following average market values have been declared in respect of two-tooth ewes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1988 | $20 |
| 1989 | $23 |
| 1990 | $23 |
| Sum | $66 |

The "standard value" of two-tooth ewes for 1990 is calculated as follows:

*   $66/3 x 70/100
*   \= $22 x 70%
*   \= $15.4

The effect of the formula is to determine a standard value based on 70 percent of a three-year average market value.

If in the above example the 1991 average market value declared for two-tooth ewes was $29 the standard value for that year would be calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1988 | $23 |
| 1990 | $23 |
| 1991 | $29 |
|     | $75 |

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 75  | x   | 70  | \=$25 x 70% | \= $17.50 |
| 30  | 10  |

Note that an average market value will be declared in respect of each of the livestock classes listed in the Twelfth Schedule, and therefore a separate calculation will be required for each of those classes. However, each year when the values are declared two sets of values will be announced in respect of each class of specified livestock:

*   the average market value (100%)
*   the standard value (70% of 3 year average)

Taxpayers operating the trading stock scheme will then only need to ensure their closing livestock are classified into the correct livestock classes and multiply the number of closing livestock in each class by the appropriate standard value.

Paragraph (b) of the definition of "standard value" provides that, in respect of livestock that are not specified livestock, the standard value is "such value as is agreed to by the Commissioner".

The effect of paragraph (b) is that taxpayers farming livestock other than sheep, cattle, deer, goats or pigs can apply to the Commissioner for a standard value for their livestock which, rather than being adjusted each year according to market changes, will, like the old standard values system, remain as a static standard value. Rather than set national minimal standard values for such types of livestock as fitches and llamas, until the farming of such livestock becomes more established, it is more appropriate that the standard value be set on a taxpayer by taxpayer basis. Such taxpayers who are not already operating a standard value for their "non-specified" livestock but wish to do so, should make application to the Department.

### Standard Value for Non-Specified Livestock

_**Subsection (1A)**_ is the operative subsection for the valuation of "non-specified" livestock. It gives taxpayers the option of valuing such livestock at either

*   cost price;
*   market value;
*   replacement price; or
*   standard value.

That is, such taxpayers have the same option available to all other traders with the addition of the option of using a standard value.

### Standard Value for Specified Livestock

_**Subsection (2)**_ is the operative section for the valuation of specified livestock on hand at the end of any income year and in respect of which the taxpayer has elected to value under the trading stock scheme (or has made no election at all and therefore is automatically subject to the trading stock scheme).

Paragraph (a) provides that specified livestock (other than pigs) which are less than 12 weeks of age at the end of the income year shall be valued at 50 percent of the standard value of such livestock for that income year. Paragraph (b) provides that pigs and other types specified livestock which are 12 weeks of age or more at balance date shall be valued at the standard value of such livestock for that income year.

The age distinction ensures that taxpayers who have very young stock on hand at balance date, are not required to value such livestock at values which are set for more mature livestock. Examples of farmers who may have livestock of less than 12 weeks of age on hand at balance date are farmers who have October to December balance dates and town milk supply dairy farmers who have autumn-born calves on hand at a 31 May balance date. The distinction is not required for pigs as there is a separate valuation class for weaners less than 10 weeks of age.

### 3-Year Write-Down

_**Subsections (2) and (3)**_ provide for a 3-year write-down to standard value in certain circumstances. A similar provision applied under the old standard values scheme and the replacement subsections now modify that provision. Subsection (2) relates to non-specified livestock and subsection (3) to specified livestock with both subsections essentially having the same effect.

The intent of the 3-year write-down is to spread over 3 years the tax deduction that may arise from writing livestock down from the purchase price to standard value.

**Example**

If a herd of 20 deer is purchased for $1,000 per head and the standard value is $500 the taxpayer would receive a tax deduction of $10,000 calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase price (deductible) | 20 x $1,000 = | $20,000 |
| Closing value (taxable) | 20 x $ 500 = | $10,000 |
|     | Deduction | $10,000 |

The effect of subsections (2) and (3) is to ensure that, in certain circumstances, the deduction is spread over 3 income years.

The following commentary explains subsection (3). which applies to specified livestock, however, paragraphs (a), (b) (e) and (f) apply equally to non-specified livestock (subsection (2)). The provision outlines four situations (paragraph (a) to (d)) where the 3-year write-down will be applied.

*   (a)
    *   Where a taxpayer "commences or recommences during an income year to derive income from specified livestock"
    *   The word "commences" relates to taxpayers who commence farming for the first time.
    *   The word "recommences" contemplates a situation where a farmer, having derived income from livestock, takes up some other occupation and then at a later date decides to return to farming. Each situation will be considered separately taking into account the facts of the case. However, it is not intended that the 3-year write-down apply where a taxpayer may not derive income from livestock in any one year but the taxpayer's principal occupation does not change from that of a farmer. For example, a farmer decides to reduce the size of his farming operations, sells his farm, takes a 1-year overseas holiday and purchases a small farm unit on his return. The 3-year write-down would not be applied in such situations.

*   (b)
    *   Where a taxpayer -
        *   "(i) Brings into production or substantially increased production any land for the purpose of deriving income from specified livestock; or
        *   "(ii) Acquires any additional land for that purpose."
    *   The term "brings into production" means that the existing farmer develops, and thereby facilitates the farming of, land that he already owns but has not, for some reason such as the existence of native bush or lupin, farmed previously.
    *   The term "brings into substantially increased production" means that the existing farmer develops, and thereby facilitates substantially more intensive farming of, land that he already owns but has previously farmed only to minimal capacity.
        *   **For Example: -**
            *   Swampland that previously was virtually waste land is drained, ploughed, and sown in grass.
            *   Land that over a period of years has reverted to scrub is cleared and resown.
        *   In either of the situations covered in paragraphs (a) and (b) the 3-year write-down applies to purchases of livestock in the year that situation occurs, and purchases in the 3 succeeding income years. However the provision excludes replacement livestock meaning that it applies only to increased livestock numbers in those years.

*   (c)
    *   Where a taxpayer purchases any type of specified livestock which that taxpayer did not own in either of the two preceding income years.
    *   For example, a sheep farmer who diversifies into deer will be subject to the 3-year write-down in respect of the deer unless the taxpayer owned deer in either of the two preceding income years.

*   (d)
    *   Where a taxpayer values specified livestock under the trading stock scheme and in the previous year that livestock was valued under a different scheme (i.e. herd scheme or cost option).
    *   For example, where a taxpayer operated the herd scheme for herd class sheep and then elects to have them valued under the trading stock scheme, the 3-year write-down will apply.

*   Paragraphs (e) and (f) determine how the 3-year write-down applies in respect of the livestock it applies to as outlined in paragraphs (a) to (d).
*   Paragraph (e) provides that the value of such specified livestock to be taken into account at the end of the year of purchase (or where paragraph (d) applies, at the end of the year in which the change of valuation scheme occurs) shall be the value that would otherwise be determined under the section (i.e. the standard value) "increased by an amount equal to the deductible excess in relation to that specified livestock".
*   Paragraph (f) provides that the value of that specified livestock to be taken into account at the following income year shall be the standard value for that income year increased by one-half of the deductible excess in relation to that specified livestock.

### Definition of "Deductible Excess"

Deductible excess is defined in subsection (1) as,

*   (a)(i) In relation to specified livestock purchases:
    *   (purchase price - standard value) x 2/3
*   (a)(ii) In relation to specified livestock that were, in the preceding income year, valued otherwise than under the trading stock scheme:
    *   (opening value - standard value) x 2/3
    *   Note that this calculation does not apply to opening livestock that is not on hand at the end of the year (the provision does not apply to replacement stock purchased during that year).
*   (b) In relation to livestock other than specified livestock:
    *   (purchase price - standard value) x 2/3

### Examples of 3-year write-down

**Example 1**

Sheep farmer commences deer farming in 1989 by purchasing 50 deer at $1,000 per head. The "standard value" for that class of deer is -

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 | \-  | $400 |
| 1990 | \-  | $450 |
| 1991 | \-  | $420 |

3-year write-down applies section 86(3)(c)).

| 1989 Closing value = standard value + deductible excess (section 86(3)(e)) |
| --- |
| \= $400 + (purchase price - standard value) x 2/3 |
| \= $400 + ($l,000 - $400) x 2/3 |
| \= $400 + $400 |
| \= $800 |
| 1990 Closing Value = standard value + \[deductible excess / 2\] (section 86(3)(f)) |
| \= $450 + 400 / 2 |
|     |
| \= $450 + 200 |
| \= $650 |

Note that the amount of deductible excess does not alter.

|     |
| --- |
| 1991 closing value = standard value |
| \= $420 |
| (The closing value for year 3 is not affected). |

Note that in this example, any additional purchases in the 1990, 1991 and 1992 income years would similarly be subject to the provision.

Note also that the same procedure would apply if the 50 deer were purchased as a result of the purchase or the bringing into production of additional land, or the taxpayer had not previously derived income from livestock.

**Example 2**

Taxpayer is operating the herd scheme for his herd class goats and elects to adopt the trading stock scheme with effect from the 1993 income year. Values set for that class of goats were -

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1992 | herd value | $400 |
| 1993 | standard value | $250 |
| 1994 | standard value | $255 |
| 1995 | standard value | $260 |

3 year write-down applies (section 86(3)(d))

| 1993 Closing value = standard value + \[deductible excess / 2\](section 86(3)(e)) |
| --- |
| \= $250 + (opening value - standard value) x \[2 / 3\] |
| \= $250 + ($400 - $250) x 2 / 3 |
| \= $250 + 100 |
| \= $350 |
| 1994 Closing value = standard value + \[deductible excess / 2\] (Section 86(3) (f)) |
| \= $255 + \[100 / 2\] |
| \= $255 + 50 |
| \= $305 |
| 1995 Closing value = standard value |
| \= $260 |

### Matrimonial Transfers

_**Subsection (4)**_ of the replacement section 86 deals with transfers of livestock by way of a matrimonial agreement and although the wording is lengthy and complex, the effect is reasonably simple.

*   Paragraph (a) provides that where a taxpayer acquires livestock under a matrimonial agreement which is to be valued under section 86 and that taxpayer was, immediately before that transfer, deriving income from livestock then the other provisions of the other subsections of section 86 apply.
*   This means that if the taxpayer (the transferee) is operating the trading stock scheme in respect of the type of livestock transferred then the closing value of that livestock will be valued at standard value regardless of the valuation scheme being operated by the transferor in that year.
*   Paragraph (b) provides for the situation where a taxpayer acquires livestock under a matrimonial agreement which are to be valued under section 86, and that the taxpayer was not, immediately before the transfer, deriving income from livestock. In such cases, if the transferor would have been subject to the 3-year write-down in respect of those livestock then the transferee is also subject to that provision to the same extent as the transferor would have been affected had the transfer not taken place.
*   This means that where the transferee elects to adopt the trading stock scheme (or makes no election and is therefore automatically subject to section 86) in respect of the livestock transferred, the transferee obtains with those livestock the requirement to continue any 3-year write-down imposed on the transferor in respect of those livestock.
*   Note that subsection (4) applies only where the livestock transferred is to be valued in the hands of the transferee under the trading stock scheme (or the standard values scheme in respect of non-specified livestock).

_**Subsection (5)**_ relates also to matrimonial property transfers.

*   Paragraph (a) provides that where a taxpayer acquires livestock under a matrimonial agreement and by virtue of that transfer the taxpayer commences or recommences to derive income from livestock, the 3-year write-down will not be applied for that reason (the 3 year write-down may still apply by reason of subsection (4)(b)). This is achieved by deeming the taxpayer not to so have commenced or recommenced for the purposes of the 3-year write-down provision in relation to that transfer.
*   Paragraph (b) provides that a taxpayer who acquires land under a matrimonial agreement shall, for the purposes of the section, be deemed to have acquired the land on the day the transferor acquired that land. This ensures that the land transfer does not in itself result in the application of the 3-year write-down provision.
*   The following flow-chart summarises the application of subsection (4).

**Matrimonial Transfer of Livestock**

The replacement section 86 is inserted by subsections (1)-(3) of section 7 of the Amendment Act. The remaining subsections of section 7 are:

*   _**Subsections (5) and (6)**_
    *   Repeal spent provisions of previous Amendment Acts.
*   _**Subsection (7)**_
    *   Provides that the 3-year write-down provision in respect of non-specified livestock (section 86(2A)) and the repeal of the old 3-year write-down provision, apply in respect of livestock purchased in the 1987 income year and every subsequent income year.
*   _**Subsections (4) and (8)**_
    *   See commentary on bloodstock

### Application Date - Specified Livestock

As subsection (3) has no separate application date the general application date (commencement of 1987 income year) applies. This means that, where the taxpayer is subject to the 3 year write-down, purchases made in the 1987 income year must be valued at closing balance date announced to subsection (3). Where a taxpayer was, prior to the 1987 year, already in the process of writing-down livestock over three years that write-down will cease in the 1987 income year and those livestock will be valued at the trading stock value announced for 1987. Only further purchases made in the 1987 income year would be subject to the write-down provision in that year.

### _3.8 Section 8 - New Livestock Valuation Sections_

Section 8 of the Amendment Act inserts 8 new sections (sections 86A - 86H) into the Principal Act all of which relate to the valuation of livestock. Parts 3.9 - 3.16 of this publication discuss the effect of those sections.

### _3.9 Section 86A - Herd Scheme_

This section introduces the new herd scheme which is an alternative livestock valuation scheme and applies in respect of mature livestock which are farmed principally for production rather than held for sale as trading stock.

_Subsection (1)_ provides that the expression "herd value" means, in relation to herd livestock, "the average market value of that herd livestock declared for that income year ..."

### Closing Herd Value

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that the closing value of any herd livestock which a taxpayer has elected to value under section 86A (the herd scheme) shall be the herd value of that herd livestock for that income year. (The matter of elections and the definition of herd livestock were discussed earlier in this publication.)

The effect of subsections (1) and (2) is that, where a taxpayer makes the appropriate election to adopt the herd scheme in respect of any type of livestock, the herd livestock of that type of livestock will be taken into account at the end of each year at the average market value declared in respect of each of those classes. That valuation procedure will continue to apply to that taxpayer until a further election (if any) is made to adopt an alternative scheme (i.e. trading stock scheme or cost option).

Note that the "herd value" is the average market value declared for that income year - this differs from the standard values set for the trading stock scheme which are based on an average taken over three income years.

### Opening Herd Value

_**Subsection (3)**_ overrides section 85(3) of the principal Act in relation to the value of livestock to be taken into account at the beginning of an income year (i.e. the opening value). Section 85(3) states that the opening value of trading stock (including livestock) shall be the closing value of that trading stock for the previous income year. Example 1 demonstrates the effect of section 85(3) and Example 2 the effect of section 86A(3).

**Example 1** (static livestock numbers but increasing values)

| Income Year | Opening Value (Section 85(3)) | Closing Value (Section 85 (4A)) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 | $18,000 (1988 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $20 = $20,000 |
| 1990 | $20,000 (1989 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $23 = $23,000 |
| 1992 | $23,000 (1990 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $24 = $24,000 |
| Taxable (closing less opening) |     |     |
| $2,000 - 1989 |     |     |
| $3,000 - 1990 |     |     |
| $1,000 - 1991 |     |     |

Subsection (3) overrides section 85(3) by providing that the opening value of herd livestock shall be the closing value (i.e. the herd value) for that income year.

**Example 2** (static livestock numbers but increasing values)

| Income Year | Opening Value (Section 86A(3)) | Closing Value (Section 86A (2)) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 | $20,000 (1989 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $20 = $20,000 |
| 1990 | $23,000 (1990 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $23 = $23,000 |
| 1992 | $24,000 (1991 closing value) | 1,000 sheep at $24 = $24,000 |
| Taxable (closing less opening) |     |     |
| Nil - 1989 |     |     |
| Nil - 1990 |     |     |
| Nil - 1991 |     |     |

The effect of subsection (3) is that any increase in the value of livestock over an income year is not taxable. In the above examples it can be seen that the provision effectively exempts $6,000 of income tax that would otherwise accrue. This is in contrast to the trading stock scheme where such increases are taxable. However, under the trading stock scheme the closing values are set at 70 percent of a 3-year average market value rather than at 100 percent of the market value as required under the herd scheme.

### Opening Herd Value in Year of Election

There is one exception to the above treatment of opening stock and that is in relation to the income year the election to join the herd scheme first applies. In that income year the provisions of section 85(3) are not overriden and thus the opening value for that year must equal the closing value for the previous income year.

### Matrimonial Transfers

_**Subsection (4)**_ deals with transfers of livestock under a matrimonial agreement where that livestock was valued under the herd scheme by the transferor in the year prior to the transfer, and the transferee is to value the livestock under the herd scheme in the year of transfer.

In such cases subsection (4) overrides section 91A to provide that the transferee will be deemed to have acquired the livestock at the herd value (i.e. average market value declared) for the income year in which the transfer takes place. Without this provision the transferee would be deemed, pursuant to section 91A, to have acquired the livestock at the transferor's closing value for the income year prior to the year of transfer. This would have given rise to a tax liability in the hands of the transferee if the herd value for the year of transfer exceeded the deemed purchase price.

_**Subsection (5)**_ contains the normal accounting year provision.

### Effect of Herd Scheme

The overall effect of section 86A is to provide different rules for the valuation of opening and closing stock. It does not override the provisions of section 85 which treat closing stock as income (section 85(4)) and opening stock as a deduction (section 85(7)), nor does it affect the treatment of sales (taxable) and purchases (deductible).

What the herd scheme achieves is an effective inflation proofing of herd class livestock by ensuring that the increase in value of livestock over an income year does not attract tax. However, the herd scheme also has the effect of not allowing any deduction for any decrease in value of livestock over an income year.

Note that the herd scheme only exempts the increase in value of livestock over an income year and does not exempt increases in numbers. The following example demonstrates this point.

**Example 3** (increasing sheep numbers/increasing values)

| Income Year | Opening Value | Closing Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 | 1,000 at $20 = $20,000 | 1,200 at $20 = $24,000 |
| 1990 | 1,200 at $22 = $26,400 | 1,400 at $22 = $30,800 |
| 1991 | 1,400 at $24 = $33,600 | 1,600 at $24 = $38,400 |
| Taxable (Closing less Opening) |     |     |
| $4,000 - 1989 |     |     |
| $4,400 - 1990 |     |     |
| $4,800 - 1991 |     |     |

### _3.10 Section 86B - Cost Option_

This section contains what has been termed as the "cost option" for valuing livestock. In fact it provides for the valuation of closing livestock at either -

*   cost price;
*   market value; or
*   replacement price.

It has been termed the cost option as it is anticipated that most taxpayers adopting this option will use cost price as the basis of valuation.

These options have always been available in respect of the valuation of livestock under section 85(4). Section 86B now provides a separate section for those three valuation options in respect of specified livestock but at the same time introduces several related provisions.

_**Subsection (1)**_ provides that where a taxpayer elects that the value of specified livestock is to be determined under section 86B, the closing value of that livestock shall be "at the option of the taxpayer, its cost price, its market value, or the price at which it can be replaced".

### Cost Price

Cost price can be difficult to determine in relation to livestock. In the past, because the standard values set were generally below cost, the option of valuing livestock at cost was seldom used. However, now that standard values will be set at 70 percent of average market values (average of 3 income years) the cost option may be a more attractive proposition for some taxpayers who farm livestock which have a cost price of less than the new standard values.

The adoption of cost price as a valuation method will require the maintaining of detailed records of farm costs and livestock identification. The New Zealand Society of Accountants together with officials from Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have formulated guidelines as to what farm costs must form part of the "cost price" of livestock. Details of the procedure to be followed in determining "cost price" and the record keeping requirements are contained in Appendix B of this publication.

### Market Value

The market value of livestock can be used as an alternative to cost price. Market value is the value at which the livestock would be worth on the open market if they were available for sale in the normal course of business to an arms-length party at balance date.

Market value should not be reduced by any selling costs such as the cost of transport from farm to saleyards or slaughterhouse.

The use of market value as opposed to the trading stock scheme would be advantageous to taxpayers who farm livestock which are worth less than 70 percent of the declared average market value.

### Replacement Price

The replacement price of livestock is the price the taxpayer would pay at balance date for livestock of the same class and quality as the livestock on hand at that balance date which are to be valued at replacement price.

Replacement price would be advantageous to taxpayers who can acquire replacement stock at a price less than 70 percent of the declared average market value.

### Movement Between Valuation Methods

Note that the restriction of movement between livestock valuation schemes imposed under the election requirements, as outlined earlier in this publication, applies to the "cost option" as a collective option incorporating cost price, market value or replacement price. It does not apply to these individual valuation alternatives which form the "cost option". That is, a taxpayer, having adopted the cost option, is free to value closing livestock at cost, market or replacement price and may alternate between those three alternatives at will from year to year on the same basis as applies for trading stock other than livestock.

### Bailors

_**Subsection (2)**_ qualifies subsection (1) by providing that the alternative of valuing livestock at cost price within the "cost option" is not available to livestock that have been bailed or leased by the taxpayer during the income year. That is, bailors of livestock who elect to value their bailed livestock under section 86B are restricted to the alternatives of market value or replacement price.

### Record Keeping

_**Subsection (3)**_ also qualifies subsection (1) to provide that the cost price alternative will not be available 'where the Commissioner is not satisfied that the taxpayer has sufficient records to accurately determine the cost price of that specified livestock'. As already noted, details of the record keeping requirements when using cost price are outlined in Appendix B.

### Opening Value

_**Subsection (3A)**_ provides that where a taxpayer elects to change to the cost option from another scheme (i.e. trading stock scheme or herd scheme), the opening value in the year the cost option first applies is deemed to be the cost price of that livestock at the commencement of that income year.

The effect of this provision is that, if the taxpayer adopts the cost price alternative within the cost option the "cost" is fixed and the taxpayer does not need to examine past records to try and determine the historical cost of the livestock.

_**Subsection (4)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

### _3.11 Section 86C - High-priced Livestock Scheme_

Definition of High-priced Livestock Section 86C introduces the new high-priced livestock valuation scheme.

_**Subsection (1)**_ defines "high-priced livestock" as specified livestock purchased for equal to or more than 3 times (or, for sheep, 4 times) the average market value determined in relation to that class of livestock for the income year preceding the income year of purchase.

*   Note that the definition, and therefore the high-priced livestock scheme, applies only to livestock purchases and not high-valued livestock such as stud stock which are bred by the taxpayer.

In determining whether an animal purchased in any income year is "high priced livestock" the purchase price must be compared to the declared value for the class of livestock "in which that specified livestock is able to be classified at the end of that income year, ..."

**Example**

A rising one-year bull purchased at the commencement of an income year will be a rising two-year bull at the end of the income year. The purchase price should be compared with the value determined for the income year preceding the year of purchase in respect of rising two-year bulls not rising one-year bulls.

A comparison is made with the previous year's value so that the taxpayer knows at the time of the purchase whether the livestock will be classed as "high-priced livestock".

### Closing Value

_**Subsection (2)**_ is the operative subsection which determines how the closing value of high-priced livestock is to be determined. It provides that the closing value should be:

1.  In the year of purchase, its cost price reduced by the "assigned percentage" of that cost price;
2.  In relation to any succeeding income year, the opening value for that income year, reduced by the "assigned percentage" of the cost price.

"Assigned percentage" is defined in subsection (1) as being:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sheep | \-  | 25 percent |
| Cattle | \-  | 20 percent |
| Stags | \-  | 20 percent |
| Deer (other than stags) | \-  | 15 percent |
| Goats | \-  | 20 percent |
| Pigs | \-  | 33 1/3 percent |

The combined effect of subsections (1) and (2) is shown in the following example.

**Example**

A taxpayer makes the following purchases in the 1991 income year. He has elected that the trading stock scheme is to apply to all livestock types.

*   10 pedigree mixed-age ewes at $100 per head
*   1 breeding boar at $600 per head
*   1 Wapiti breeding stag at $12,000

Average market values declared as follows:

|     | 1990 | 1991 | 1992 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mixed-age ewes | $ 15 | $ 20 | $ 22 |
| breeding boars | $ 120 | $ 130 | $ 135 |
| Wapiti breeding |     |     |     |
| stags | $5,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 |

The livestock accounts of the taxpayer should record the following values:

| Income Year | Opening Value |     | Purchases |     | Closing Value |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1991 | Nil | Ewes | $ 1,000 | Ewes | $ 750 |
|     |     | Boar | $ 600 | Boar | $ 400 |
|     |     | Stag | $12,000 | Stags | $3,500 |
| 1992 | Ewes | $ 750 | Nil | Ewes | $ 500 |
|     | Boar | $ 400 |     | Boar | $ 200 |
|     | Stag | $3,500 |     | Stag | $3,500 |

The amount of write-down is a fixed amount regardless of the market fluctuations subsequent to the income year which determines that amount (i.e. the income year preceding the year of purchase).

In this example the stag is not "high-priced livestock" (the purchase price does not exceed three times the average market value) and therefore is valued according to the valuation scheme the taxpayer has elected for that livestock type, which in this example is the trading stock scheme. (The example assumes the declared value for Wapiti breeding stags in 1989 and 1988 was $5,000 and therefore the 3-year rolling average produces a constant value ).

### Matrimonial Transfers

_**Subsection (3)**_ relates to high-priced livestock which are transferred under a matrimonial agreement. It deems such livestock to have been acquired by the transferee on the same day and at the same cost to the transferor. It provides also that the closing value (transferee's accounts) of that high-priced livestock in the year of transfer shall be -

*   the value at which the livestock is deemed to be transferred under section 91A (the opening value (transferor's accounts) in the year of transfer)

**REDUCED BY**

*   the assigned percentage of the original cost to the transferor

The effect of subsection (3) is that the transferee continues the same write-down in respect of the livestock that the transferor would have been entitled to had the transfer not taken place.

### Restrictions to Write-Down

_**Subsection (4)**_ qualifies subsections (2) and (3) to provide that no write-down of high-priced livestock will be allowed in any year where the livestock -

1.  Was purchased within 6 months of the end of that income year; or
2.  In relation to pigs, was less than one year of age at the end of that income year; or
3.  In relation to livestock other than pigs, was less than 2 years of age at the end of that income year.

In such cases the high-priced livestock must be valued at its cost price until the first income year in which the above provisions are no longer relevant. In relation to (a) and (b) above obviously the provision can apply only to the year of purchase. However, in relation to (c) any livestock which are less than 1 year of age at the closing balance date in the year of purchase will be required to be valued at cost price in the subsequent year also.

### Minimum Closing Value

_**Subsection (5)**_ provides that the closing value of high-priced livestock shall not be less than $1.

**Example**

A stud ram is purchased in the first half of an income year for $400. The write-off for each year the animal is owned would be calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year of purchase | \-  | purchase price | $400.00 |
|     |     | less write-off |     |
|     |     | (400 x 25%) | $100.00 |
|     |     | Closing value | $300.00 |
| Year 2 | \-  | opening value | $300.00 |
|     |     | less write-off | $100.00 |
|     |     | Closing Value | $200.00 |
| Year 3 | \-  | opening value | $200.00 |
|     |     | less write-off | $100.00 |
|     |     | Closing value | $100.00 |
| Year 4 | \-  | open value | $100.00 |
|     |     | less write-off (Ss(5)) | $ 99.00 |
|     |     | Closing value | $ 1.00 |
| Year 5 | \-  | Opening value | $ 1.00 |
|     |     | Closing Value | $ 1.00 |

### Determination of Cost Price

The high-priced scheme is based on the "cost price" which is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase Price | +   | Cost of transporting the stock to the farm |

Under the cost option "cost", in relation to immature livestock, includes costs incurred in holding an animal to maturity. For the high-priced scheme only the purchase price plus transport costs will be included. This means that where subsection (4) applies to restrict the write-down to mature animals, costs incurred in holding animals to maturity will not be required to be included as part of the cost price.

### _3.12 Section 86D - Declaration of Annual Values by Order in Council_

This section provides that the Governor-General shall, by Order in Council, declare an average market value in relation to each of the classes of specified livestock set out in column (2) of the Twelfth Schedule (First Schedule of the Amendment Act) in respect of the 1987 and future income years.

Although 1988 is the first full year of operation of the new valuation schemes, the values announced for the 1987 income year are necessary for the purposes of the transitional provisions.

As discussed earlier, the value of herd livestock is based on the valuation announced under this section and the value of livestock under the trading stock scheme is based on 70 percent of a 3 year average of the values so announced.

It is intended that the values will be announced in late March of each year except for cattle based on the auction system for which the values will be announced in May of each year.

The values announced will be in respect of an income year and will apply to the value of closing livestock in that income year only regardless of the taxpayer's balance date.

The Department will publish the values in a Public Information Bulletin after the values are announced. For simplicity the trading stock value (70 percent of 3-year average) will be shown as well as the herd value.

The announced values will be based on one of two types of data. For livestock classes which are predominantly sold through the auction system rather than as prime stock ultimately destined for slaughter, average auction prices will be used. For all other classes, the values will be based on meat schedule prices for prime stock.

All values used for deriving the standard values will be exclusive of goods and services tax.

### _3.13 Example of New Valuation Schemes_

The following is an example of the new valuation schemes in operation by a sheep and cattle farmer. For simplicity, only three classes have been used for each livestock type.The example assumes the following values have been announced:

| Year | Livestock Class | Standard Value | Herd Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $   | $   |
| 1990 | Ewe hoggets | 14.00 | 20.00 |
|     | Mixed-age ewes | 10.00 | 15.00 |
|     | Breeding rams | 98.00 | 140.00 |
|     | Rising one-year heifers | 154.00 | 220.00 |
|     | Mixed-age cows | 266.00 | 380.00 |
|     | Breeding bulls | 1,260.00 | 1,800.00 |
| 1991 | Ewe hoggets | 15.00 | 22.00 |
|     | Mixed-age ewes | 11.00 | 16.00 |
|     | Breeding rams | 101.00 | 150.00 |
|     | Rising one-year heifers | 150.00 | 210.00 |
|     | Mixed-age cows | 266.00 | 380.00 |
|     | Breeding bulls | 1,295.00 | 1,900.00 |
| 1992 | Ewe hoggets | 16.00 | 24.00 |
|     | Mixed-age ewes | 12.00 | 20.00 |
|     | Breeding rams | 105.00 | 160.00 |
|     | Rising one-year heifers | 156.00 | 240.00 |
|     | Mixed-age cows | 270.00 | 400.00 |
|     | Breeding bulls | 1,330.00 | 2,000.00 |

The farmer is operating the trading stock scheme but decides that for the 1990 income year and future income years the breeding cattle are to be valued under the herd scheme. In the 1991 income year two stud rams are purchased at the commencement of the income year - one for $400 and one for $600. At the commencement of that income year the farmer also purchases 10 rising one-year red deer hinds at $1,000.00 per head and decides they will be valued at cost. Other livestock numbers remain static by way of the sale of cull stock and the purchase of the same number of replacements. The 1990 opening stock is shown as follows:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | ewe hoggets | x   | $12.00 |
| 100 | mixed-aged ewes | x   | $10.00 |
| 9   | breeding rams | x   | $90.00 |
| 10  | rising one year heifers | x   | $150.00 |
| 10  | mixed-age cows | x   | $250.00 |
| 1   | breeding bull | x   | $1,200.00 |

The farmer operates a 30 June balance date.

### Election Requirements (Section 85A)

In relation to the cattle, the farmer must -

*   Advise the Department in writing of the intention to change to valuation schemes
*   State in the notice the election first applies for the 1990 income year:
*   State in the notice the election applies in respect of section 86A (herd scheme);
*   Give the notice to the Department by 30 June 1988 at the latest.

In relation to the deer purchased in the 1991 income year the farmer must -

*   Advise the Department in writing of the intention to adopt the cost option in respect of deer;
*   State in the notice the election first applies for the 1991 income year;
*   State in the notice the election applies in respect of section 86B (cost option);
*   Give the notice to the Department by the time in which the 1991 return of income is required to be filed.

The farmer's livestock schedules should reflect the following valuations.

| 1990 Return | Closing Stock |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trading Stock Scheme |     |     |     |
| ewe hoggets | 100 | x   | $14 |
| mixed-aged ewes | 100 | x   | $10 |
| breeding rams | 9   | x   | $98 |
| rising one-year heifers | 10  | x   | $154 |
| Herd Scheme |     |     |     |
| mixed-age cows | 10  | x   | $380 |
| breeding bulls | 1   | x   | $1,800 |

**1991 Return**

| Class | Opening Stock | Closing Stock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trading Stock Scheme |     |     |
| ewe hoggets | 100 x $14 | 100 x $15 |
| mixed-age ewes | 100 x $10 | 100 x $11 |
| breeding rams | 9 x $98 | 10 x $101 |
| rising one-year heifers | 10 x $154 | 10 x $150 |
|     | Herd Scheme |     |
| mixed-age cows | 10 x $380 | 10 x $380 |
| breeding bulls | 1 x $1,900 | 1 x 1,900 |
| High-priced Scheme |     |     |
| breeding rams | 1 x $450 (note 1) |     |
| Cost Option |     |     |
| red deer - rising |     |     |
| two-year hinds | NIL | 10 x $1,100 (note 2) |

Note 1 - only one of the stud rams purchased was high-priced livestock.

Note 2 - $100 holding costs included.

**1992**

| red deer - rising one-year hinds | 10 x $1,100 | 10 x $1,100 |

### _3.14 Section 86G - Transitional Provisions_

This section provides for a number of transitional provisions in relation to the move to the new livestock valuation schemes.

### APPLICATION DATE

_**Subsection (1)**_ provides that no election made under section 85A to join a particular livestock valuation scheme can be made in respect of the 1987 income year or any preceding income year.

The effect of this provision is to override the general application date of the Amendment Act (commencement of 1987 income year) by not allowing taxpayers to make an election to join a particular scheme in respect of the 1987 income year. This means that taxpayers cannot adopt the herd scheme or the cost option for 1987 thus leaving the trading stock scheme as the only available option for that income year. (However see commentary on subsection (3) below).

### Time for Filing 1988 Election

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that any notice of election to adopt a particular livestock valuation scheme for the 1988 income year shall be furnished to the Department within the time in which the taxpayer's 1987 return is required to be filed. The provision overrides the two year notice requirement of section 85A.

### 1987 Closing Value - Herd Scheme Adopted

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that taxpayers who elect to adopt the herd scheme for the 1988 income year must value their 1987 closing herd class livestock (in respect of which the election applies) at the average market value to be declared for the 1987 income year.

This means that taxpayers who make such an election will have a greater amount of income (difference between herd value and standard value) than taxpayers who do not so elect. As discussed earlier, the additional income arising from the revaluation of livestock which exceeds the income write-off can be spread over five income years.

### 1988 Opening Value - Cost Option Adopted

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that where taxpayers elect to adopt the cost option for the 1988 income year the opening value for that income year (i.e. the standard value for the 1987 income year) shall be deemed to be the cost price.

The effect of this provision is that, if a taxpayer adopts the cost price alternative for the 1988 income year the "cost" is fixed and the historical cost does not need to be determined.

### Stud and Pedigree Stock

_**Subsection (5)**_ deals with the closing value of stud and pedigree specified livestock for the 1987 and future income years. It provides that where -

1.  The livestock was owned by the taxpayer at the end of the 1986 income year: and
2.  Was used for the purposes of stud or pedigree farming; and
3.  The taxpayer's 1986 closing value is greater than the average market value for that class of livestock declared for the 1987 income year, -

the taxpayer must continue to use the 1986 closing value until (but not including) the income year in which the declared value equals or exceeds the 1986 closing value.

The effect of this provision is that taxpayers who were using market-related closing values for such livestock cannot write those values down to the declared national average value for that class of livestock - the declared values would be substantially lower than the market value of stud or pedigree stock.

Instead, such taxpayers must continue to use the 1986 closing value for the 1986 closing livestock until those livestock are sold or until the income year in which the declared value meets that closing value.

Note that the provision applies only to the actual livestock that were on hand at the end of the 1986 income year. Any replacement animals purchased or bred after that date are subject to the normal valuation rules. Although this requires the separate identification of such 1986 closing livestock until they are subsequently disposed of this should not be a problem with this type of livestock.

### High-priced Livestock

_**Subsection (6)**_ deems any closing 1986 livestock which is valued at equal to or greater than three times (or, for sheep, four times) the average market value for the 1986 income year (as specified in the Sixth Schedule) to be "high-priced" livestock.

The effect of the subsection is to require such high-priced livestock to be written down at the rate specified in section 86C and thus they cannot be written down to the declared value for 1987 to create a large tax deduction in that income year.

Note that this subsection applies to any specified livestock including stud or pedigree stock and therefore it has a correlation with subsection (5). The following flow chart demonstrates the application of these two subsections.

### _1986 Closing Livestock_

![A flowchart showing the 1986 closing livestock process](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/3/13867580413534f5bffcfffe04fb91e3/flowchart-vol-162-86-closing-lstock-small.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203138&hash=20CD8F8362C2579ABED24EFC8552976A)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/d/2d23dc004135361f8003e1fe04fb91e3/flowchart-vol-162-86-closing-lstock-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203133&hash=FE8D52349C3AA14F47A561C81FE7AC5B "This link will open a new window.")

### High-priced Purchases in 1987

_**Subsection (7)**_ provides that livestock purchased in the 1987 income year for an amount equal to or greater than 3 times (4 times for sheep) the value listed in the Sixth Schedule shall be deemed to be "high-priced" livestock.

Note that the purchase price must be compared with the value listed in the Sixth Schedule for the class in which the livestock will be classified at the end of the income year.

The effect of this provision is that high-priced purchases in the 1987 income year cannot be written down to the declared value in that year but instead must be valued (closing 1987 value) at the purchase price reduced by the appropriate "assigned percentage" as specified in section 86C.

### Standard Value for 1987 and 1988

_**Subsection (8)**_ provides the formulae for determining the 1987 and 1988 "standard value".

As outlined earlier in this publication, the "standard value" for a particular year is determined at 70 percent of the average of the declared value for that income year and the two preceding years. However, as there will be no declared value for the 1986 or the 1985 income years it is not possible to apply the calculation for the purposes of determining the 1987 and 1988 standard values.

This subsection provides for the following transitional formulae for determining the standard value for a particular class of livestock.

| 1987 Standard value |
| --- |
| 1987 declared value x \[70 / 100\] |
| 1988 Standard value |
| Sum of 1987 &1988 \[declared value /70\] x \[2 / 100\] |

_**Subsection (9)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

### _3.15 Section 9 - Consequential Provisions_

This section contains a number of amendments to various sections of the principal Act which arise as a result of the enactment of new livestock valuation provisions.

**Section 88 - Bailed Livestock**

Section 88(3) allowed bailors (lessors) of livestock to value the bailed livestock at either market value, the taxpayer's standard value in force at the date of the bailment, or any other higher standard value that was less than the market value.

Section 9(1) of the Amendment Act adds a subsection (6) to section 88 which provides that nothing in subsection (3) of that section shall apply to the value of closing stock to be used in the 1987 income year or any subsequent year.

The effect of this provision is that for the 1987 and subsequent income years no special valuation rules will apply to bailed livestock (except the exclusion from the cost option).

Note that the provision in section 88(2), which deems bailed livestock to continue to be livestock which is used by the bailor in a business, has not been amended. This means that bailors will continue to include livestock which they have bailed as closing livestock in their annual accounts and will value them according to the valuation scheme adopted for that type of livestock.

**Section 91A - Matrimonial Transfers**

Section 91A(2) determined a deemed sale price for trading stock which is transferred pursuant to a matrimonial agreement. In relation to livestock it provided that the deemed transfer price would be the greater of:

*   "the transferor's closing value for the income year preceding the transfer; or
*   the transferee's standard value.

As taxpayers will no longer have individual standard values the provision has been amended to remove reference to the transferee's standard value. Specified livestock that are transferred under a matrimonial agreement will now be deemed to have been transferred at the transferor's closing value for the income year preceding the year of transfer.

The amendment is achieved by substituting a new section 91A(2) and applies with respect to the 1987 income year and future years.

**Section 93 - Spreading of Income on Sale of Livestock**

Section 93 of the principal Act allows for the spreading of income arising from a sale of substantial number of livestock where that income arises by reason of the adoption of low standard values.

**Section 9(4)** of the Amendment Act amends section 93 to provide that the section shall apply only to sales of livestock that occur in the 1987 income year or in any preceding year.

**Section 9(5)** of the Amendment Act further amends section 93 to provide that the section shall not apply to any assessable income that is written-off under section 86E or spread under section 86F.

The effect of the amendments to section 93 is that, in respect of substantial sales of livestock in the 1987 income year, there will be very little (if any) balance of income remaining to spread under section 93. However, where the substantial sale takes place in the 1986 income year, initially there will be an amount of income to spread back under section 93 as the income write-off and section 86F income spread and will not be determined until the end of the 1987 income year. Once that deduction and spread are determined the amount initially spread back under section 93 must then be reduced by the amount of income write-off and income spread which is attributable to the numbers of livestock sold (the back-year returns affected would be reassessed accordingly). The following formula should be applied in respect of each class of livestock sold to calculate the portion of income write-off attributable to that livestock.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of that class sold | x   | Income write-off for that class |
| Number of that class that class included in "base number" |

Although the amendments to section 93 require any section 86F income spread attributable to the livestock sold to be deducted also, in relation to section 93, sales made in the 1986 income year there will never be an amount to be so deducted. This is because the section 86F spread calculation is based on 1987 opening and closing numbers and of course any livestock sold in the 1986 income year will not be included in the 1987 opening or closing livestock.

**Section 94 - Adverse Event**

Section 94 of the principal Act allows for the spreading of income arising from the sale of livestock due to an adverse event (drought, flood etc.). The income arising from the forced sale can be deferred until the income year in which replacement livestock are purchased. The income that can be deferred is termed the "assessable excess" and is the difference between the sale proceeds and the taxpayer's standard value in relation to those livestock.

**Section 9(6)-9(8)** of the Amendment Act make amendments to section 94 with the principal amendment contained in section 9(7).

**Subsection 9(7)** provides that section 94 shall apply only to sales of livestock made in the 1987 income year or any preceding income year. The effect of the amendment is that section 94 will not apply to adverse events which occur in the 1988 income year or future years and therefore the past procedure of "declaring" adverse events will no longer be necessary.

**Section 9(6)** of the Amendment Act amends the definition of "Assessable excess" in section 94 to provide that only the balance of assessable income, after deducting any income write-off allowed under section 86E and any income spread allowable under section 86F, can be deferred until the income year replacement livestock are purchased.

The provision applies from and including the 1987 income year (as provided by section 9(14)) but only has application in the 1987 income year for the reason that the section 94 provision applies only to sales of livestock made up to and including the 1987 income year.

The provision requires the allocation of a portion of the income write-off to the livestock disposed of, and this can be achieved by using the following formula in respect of each class of livestock sold.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of that class sold | x   | Income write-off for that class |
| Number of that class included in "base number" |

The resultant figure is deducted from the assessable income arising from the sale and the balance is the "assessable excess" which can be deducted from 1987 income and returned in the year the livestock are replaced.

**EXAMPLE**

**2-Tooth Ewes**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base Number | \-  | 1,000 |     |
| Write-off | \-  | $11,000 |     |
| Number sold | \-  | 300 |     |
| Sale proceeds | \-  | $ 6,000 | (300 x $20) |
| Opening value | \-  | $ 900 | (300 x $3) |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assessable Income From Sale | $6,000 \- $900 | \= $5,100 |
| Write-off To Be Deducted (see formula above) | \[$3,00 / $1000\] x 11,000 | \= $3,300 |
| Assessable Excess | $5,100 \- $3,300 | \= $1,800 |

Situations may arise where the total livestock numbers have increased subsequent to the base number determination and prior to the forced sale. This means a number of the livestock sold may not have an associated income write-off. In order to determine the amount of income write-off that is to be deducted in such cases a "Last in first out (LIFO)" method can be used. The earlier example assumes that all the livestock sold came from the base number (i.e. assesses the 1987 opening number for 2-tooth ewes was 1,000 or less). If however the 1987 opening number was 1,200, using the LIFO method, of the 300 sold 200 of them are deemed to be additions since the base number determination. The amount of income write-off to be deducted would therefore be -

\[$100 / $1000\] x 11,000 = $1,100

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Assessable Excess | \= $5,100 \- $1,100 = $4,000 |

Note that section 9(6) requires that as well as deducting a proportion of the income write-off, any assessable income in relation to the livestock sold which is spread forward under section 86F should also be deducted. However, section 86F requires that the lesser of 1987 opening numbers or 1987 closing numbers be used for the purposes of determining the income spread. Any forced sale of livestock in the 1987 income year will mean that the closing number will be reduced accordingly; the net effect being that no income spread is attributable to the livestock sold.

Section 9(8) of the Amendment Act further amends section 94 to provide that any taxpayer with an "assessable excess" still to be brought to account may, instead of being required to return the amount as assessable income in the year replacement livestock are purchased, apply to have that amount returned as assessable income in the 1987 income year.

The effect of this provision is that taxpayers with an "assessable excess" arising from a forced sale made prior to the 198V income year can now return the assessable excess in the 1987 income year instead of being required to return the income in the year replacement livestock are subsequently purchased. This gives such taxpayers the opportunity to take advantage of the reduced income (or loss) that is likely to arise in the 1987 income year as a result of the income write-off available.

### _Section 95 - Sales of Livestock by Sharemilkers and Lessee Farmers_

Subsections (9) and (10) of section 9 amend section 95 of the principal Act which is a provision similar to section 94 except that it relates to the assessable income arising from the sale of livestock by a sharemilker or a lessee farmer.

_**Subsection (9)**_ provides that the assessable income arising from the sale shall be reduced by any income write-off and income spread attributable to the livestock sold. The same procedure for calculation of the "assessable excess" under section 94 should be applied in calculating the "assessable excess" under section 95.

_**Subsection (10)**_ provides that section 95 will not apply to sales which occur subsequent to the 1987 income year.

### Family Support

Subsections (11)-(13) of section 9 make amendments to the Family Support legislation. They are generally of a consequential nature and simply make reference to a number of new sections which should be taken into account when determining a taxpayer's income for family support purposes.

There is however one significant amendment and that is the repealing of the legislation which required livestock to be valued at "net realisable value" for the purposes of determining a taxpayer's income for family support purposes. This amendment applies with effect from the commencement of the 1987 income year so that the determination of family support income for the 1987 and future income years will be based on the taxpayer's opening and closing livestock values as reflected in the tax accounts for that income year. In respect of the 1987 income year the income write-off allowed will offset the additional income arising from the livestock revaluation and no adjustment should be made in respect of the income write-off for the purposes of calculating income from family support.

The following is a summary of the effect of subsections (11) - (13) on sections 374A and 374B of the principal Act.

*   **Subsection (11)** - Repeals definition of "net realisable value".
*   **Subsection (12)**
    *   (a) Repeals a provision relating to the use of net realisable value.
    *   (b) and (d) Provide that income spread under section 86F will not be recognised for the purposes of determining family support income.
    *   (c) Repeals a provision relating to the use of net realisable value.
*   **Subsection (13)** adds references to three new sections to the provision which disregards deductions allowed for farm/forestry development expenditure for the purposes of determining family support income.

### 4\. Transition

4.1 As discussed in Part II of this publication, the new livestock valuation provisions first take effect in the 1988 income year. The transition from the old to the new schemes takes place in the 1987 income year and the relevant provisions are contained in sections 86E-G as inserted by section 8 of the Amendment Act.

The transition is achieved by requiring taxpayers to revalue their closing 1987 livestock to the new standard value (70 percent) to be set for the 1987 income year. There are only two exceptions to this rule. Where the taxpayer elects to adopt the herd scheme for the 1988 income year the classes of livestock to be included in the herd scheme will be revalued to the average market value (100 percent) to be declared for the 1987 income year. The other exception is where the taxpayer is subject to the 3-year write-down in respect of purchases of livestock in the 1987 income year. In such cases the 1987 closing value will be the new standard value increased by the "deductible excess" (two-thirds of difference between purchase price and standard value).

The income arising from the revaluation (or a substantial part of that income) will be written-off with any balance of income being available to be spread over the 1987 income year and the four succeeding income years.

### _4.2 **Section 86E - Income Write-Off**_

This section provides for the writing off of an amount of income that arises from the transition.

**Definition of Base Number**

Subsection (1) provides a definition of "base number" which is the number of specified livestock that will qualify for the income write-off. The "base number" is, at the taxpayer's option, either -

1.  The number of specified livestock owned by the taxpayer at the end of the 1985 income year:
2.  The lesser of -
    *   The number of specified livestock owned by the taxpayer on 12 December 1985 (excluding livestock aged 12 months or less on that date).
    *   The number owned at the end of the 1986 income year.

The effect of part (ii) of the definition is that taxpayers who commence farming after 12 December 1985 (the date the income write-off was announced), or who increase livestock numbers after that date, will not receive an income write-off in respect of the livestock purchased after that date.

**Example**

|     | 30 June 1985 | 12 December 1985 | 30 June1986 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sheep | 1,200 | 1,200 | 1,000 |
| Cattle | 200 | 210 | 220 |
| Deer | NIL | NIL | 20  |
|     | 1,400 | 1,410 | 1,240 |

In this example the taxpayer's "base number" of livestock is, at the taxpayer's option, either 1,400 or 1,240.

Taxpayers cannot select different income years for the purposes of calculating the base number for each type of livestock. That is, the base number is the total number of all types of specified livestock owned at a particular date. The base number, once selected, then determines the numbers of each type of livestock owned that will qualify for the income write-off. If in the preceding example the taxpayer chose the total closing 1986 number (1,240) as the base number the income write-off would apply in relation to:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| sheep | 1,000 |
| cattle | 220 |
| deer | 20  |

### Base Number - Adverse Event

Paragraph (c) of the definition of "base number" provides a further option for taxpayers who have sold livestock as the result of an adverse event. Where the sale was made in the 1985 income year or in either of the two preceding income years the number of livestock on hand at the commencement of the income year in which the sale took place will be that taxpayer's base number. Where more than one such sale took place in those three income years (e.g., two summers of drought) the taxpayer can choose the opening number of livestock in any one of those three income years as the base number.

### Income Write-Off - Farmers Who Cease in 1986

Subsection (2) provides an income write-off for taxpayers who cease to derive income from specified livestock after 12 December 1985 and during the 1986 income year.

Taxpayers who ceased farming prior 12 December 1985 do not qualify for any income write-off. Taxpayers who cease farming after the end of the 1986 income year are dealt with under subsection (3).

To qualify for the income write-off under subsection (2) taxpayers must completely cease to derive income from specified livestock and not just substantially reduce the size of the farming operations. Generally the provision will apply to taxpayers who cease farming and sell their land but will apply also to farmers who sell their livestock but retain their farm land (e.g., convert to horticulture or employ a 50 percent sharemilker).

The formula for calculating the income write-off under subsection (2) is

| (a x b) \- (c) |
| --- |
| Where |
| a = the sale proceeds of the 1986 opening livestock numbers |
| b = 70 percent |
| c = the 1986 opening livestock values |

**Example**

| 1986 Opening Values |     | Sale Proceeds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $   | $   |     |
| Sheep | 2000 x $3 = $6,000 | 2,000 x $15 = $30,000 |
| Cattle | 200 x $60 = $12,000 | 200 x $300 = $60,000 |
| Deer | 20 x $150 = $3,000 | 20 x $500 = $10,000 |
|     | a = Sheep | $30,000 |
|     | Cattle | 60,000 |
|     | Deer | 10,000 |
|     |     | $100,000 |
|     | b = 70 percent |     |
|     | c = Sheep | $6,000 |
|     | Cattle | 12,000 |
|     | Deer | 3,000 |
|     |     | $21,000 |

*   ($100,000 x 70%) - $21,000
*   \= $70,000 - $21,000
*   \= $49,000

In this example the income write-off available is $49,000.

Note that the additional livestock purchased during the 1986 income year (2 deer) do not qualify for the income write-off (the calculation is based on 1986 opening numbers).

Where the cessation of farming is due to the death of the taxpayer the probate value (market value) and not the sale proceeds is used in calculating the income write-off.

In determining the amount realised on the sale of livestock where the sale is for less than market value (e.g. sale to a related party) it is the amount actually received that is to be used for the purposes of the calculation and not the amount that other provisions of the Income Tax Act may deem the taxpayer to have received.

Note also that the base number provision has no application to taxpayers who qualify for the income write-off under subsection (2).

### Income Write-Off - Farmers who Continue After 1986

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides an income write-off for taxpayers who derive income from specified livestock at any time during the 1987 income year. The formula for calculating the income write-off under subsection (3) is applied to each relevant class of livestock.

The formula is

| a x (b \- c) |
| --- |
| Where |
| a = the number of that class of livestock included in the taxpayer's base number |
| b = the 1987 standard value for that class of specified livestock (i.e. 70 percent of the annual market value to be declared for the 1987 income year) |
| c = the 1987 opening value for that class of specified livestock. (Where the taxpayer had no livestock of that class on hand at the commencement of the 1987 income year,the value that the taxpayer would have used will be used for the purposes of the calculation). |

**EXAMPLE**

| Base Number (a) | 1987 Standard Value (b) | 1987 Opening Value (c) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sheep 2,000 | $ 10.50 | $ 6.00 |
| Cattle 200 | $280.00 | $60.00 |

**Income Write-Off**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Sheep | \=2,000 x (10.50 - $6.00) |
|     | \=2,000 x $4.50 |
|     | \= $9,000 |
| Cattle | \= 200 x ($280 - $60) |
|     | \= 200 x $220 |
|     | \= $44,000 |

**Total Write-Off = $53,000**

The income write-off applies to all taxpayers who derive income from livestock in the 1987 income year regardless of whether they cease farming during that year. Also, the write-off is calculated on the classes and numbers of livestock included in the taxpayer's base number regardless of any subsequent change in numbers, classes or types of livestock. For instance, in the preceding example the same write-off would be given even though in the 1987 income year the taxpayer may have sold all his sheep and cattle and purchased deer and goats.

### Write-Off Calculated by Class

The preceding example, for simplicity , shows the write-off calculated by type of livestock, however, the legislation requires the calculation to be made in relation to each class of livestock included in the base number. There may be situations where the taxpayer has no breakdown of the respective classes of livestock owned at the date the base number is determined (e.g., the taxpayer's 1985 closing livestock may simply show - sheep 2,000). In such cases the base number may be broken down into the classes shown in the 1987 closing livestock and on the same proportional basis.

**EXAMPLE**

| Base Number | 1987 Closing Numbers |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sheep 2,000 | ewe hoggets | 1,000 (40%) |
|     | 2-tooth ewes | 1,000 (40%) |
|     | mixed-age ewes | 500 (20%) |
| Base Number by Class |     |     |
| ewe hoggets | 2,000 x 40% = 800 |     |
| 2-tooth ewes | 2,000 x 40% = 800 |     |
| ewe hoggets | 2,000 x 20% = 400 |     |

Where a taxpayer has more than one 1987 opening value applying to any class of stock (for example. a standard value and a nil value). the 1987 opening value for the purposes of calculating the income write-off will be the **weighted average** of the 1987 opening values.

**EXAMPLE**

Taxpayer's 1987 opening livestock consists of 1,000 ewe hoggets at a standard value of $6 and 200 at nil value. The weighted average value of the ewe hoggets is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| total value  <br>number | \=  | (1,000 x $6) + (200 x $0)  <br>1,200 |
|     | \=  | $6,000  <br>1,200 |
|     | \=  | $5  |

The 1987 opening value of ewe hoggets which the taxpayer will use for the purposes of calculating the income write-off is therefore $5 per head.

The proviso to subsection (3) ensures that a taxpayer who receives a deduction under subsection (2) (ceases farming in the 1986 income year) cannot also receive an income write-off under subsection (3).

### Base Number - Matrimonial Transfers

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides additional rules for determining the base number in relation to taxpayers involved in a matrimonial transfer in the 1986 or 1987 income years. Put simply, it provides that in such situations the transferee is deemed to have owned a share of the livestock owned by the transferor on each of the relevant dates for determining the base number (i.e., closing 1985, 12 December 1985, closing 1986). The transferor's base number is then reduced accordingly. In determining the share of livestock deemed to have been owned by the transferee the Commissioner can have regard to:

*   the tenor of the matrimonial agreement.
*   any wishes of the parties expressed therein
*   the marital status of the transferor and transferee at all material times
*   such other information as in his possession ..."

Generally matrimonial agreements recognise a 50/50 ownership of matrimonial property and therefore in most cases it can be expected the transferee will be deemed to have owned one-half of the livestock owned by the transferor at the those relevant dates. However, if for example, the transferor owned closing 1985 livestock and married subsequent to that date (but prior to 12 December 1985) then it would not be appropriate to deem the transferee to have owned a share of the transferor's livestock as at the transferor's 1985 balance date.

Note that the provision does not require both parties to a matrimonial agreement to adopt the same date for the purposes of calculating their base number.

### Arrangements

_**Subsection (5)**_ is an anti-avoidance provision which allows the Commissioner to disregard any amount of income write-off that may arise due to arrangements entered into by a taxpayer which gave rise to a greater income write-off than the taxpayer would otherwise be entitled to.

_**Subsection (6)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

### _**4.3 Section 86F - Income Spread**_

This section provides for the spreading of any balance of additional income arising from the revaluation of livestock which has not been written-off under section 86E.

### Determination of Amount of Spread

_**Subsection (1)**_ contains two definitions which determine the amount of income available to be spread.

The definition of "assessable excess" determines the income spread available under subsection (2) to persons who cease farming after 12 December 1985 and prior to the end of the 1987 income year.

The formula for determining the "assessable excess" is:

| (a - b) - income write-off |
| --- |
| a = the actual amount realised by the taxpayer from the sale or other disposal of the opening livestock |
| b = the opening value, in the year the taxpayer ceases farming, of the livestock disposed of. |

**EXAMPLE**

Taxpayer ceases farming during the 1987 income year.

| 1987 Opening Livestock | Sale Proceeds |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | $   |     | $   |     |
| Sheep | 2000 @ $6 = | $12,000 | 2,000 @ $15 = | $30,000 |
| Cattle | 200 @ $60 = | $12,000 | 200 @ $300 = | $60,000 |
|     |     | $24,000 |     | $90,000 |

*   a = $90,000
*   b = 24,000
*   Income write-off = $53,000 (say)
*   ($90,000 - $24,000) - 53,000
*   \= $66,000 - $53,000
*   \= $13,000
*   The income spread available in this example is $13,000.

The definition of "livestock revaluation income" determines the income spread available under subsection (3) to continuing farmers.

The formula for determining the "livestock revaluation income" is calculated in relation to each class of livestock owned by the taxpayer at the end of the 1987 income year. The formula is -

| \[a x (b \- c) \] - income write-off |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| a   | is the lesser of:<br><br>1.  1987 closing numbers of that class of livestock.<br>2.  1987 opening numbers of that class of livestock (Note 1) |
| b   | is 1987 closing value used for that class of livestock (i.e., 1987 standard value or, where the herd scheme is to be adopted in 1988, the 1987 herd value). |
| c   | is 1987 opening value used for that class of livestock. |

**EXAMPLE**

| Classes of Livestock | 1987 Opening Livestock | 1987 Closing Livestock |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | (Standard Value) | (Standard Value) |
| two-tooth ewes | 600 x $6 = $3,600 | 500 @ $15 = 7,500 |
| mixed-age ewes | 900 x $6 = $5,400 | 1,000 @ $10 = 10,000 |

| Two-tooth Ewes |     | Mixed age Ewes |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a   | Lesser of<br><br>1.  500 or<br>2.  600<br><br>**\=500** | a   | Lesser of<br><br>1.  1,000 or<br>2.  900<br><br>**\=900** |
| b   | \=$15 | b   | \=$10 |
| c   | \=$6 | c   | \=$6 |
| 500 x ($15 \- $6) |     | 900 x ($10 \- $6) |     |
| **\=$4,500** |     | **\=$3,600** |     |

Similar calculations would be made for each class of 1987 closing livestock so that a total is obtained. The total income write-off allowed to the taxpayer is then deducted from that total to give the income eligible to be spread (the "livestock revaluation income ").

NOTE 1

The actual wording of the legislation provides that "a" of the livestock revaluation income shall be the lesser of:

1.  1987 closing numbers of one class of livestock (e.g., two-tooth ewes); or
2.  1987 opening numbers of the class of livestock into which the closing livestock in (i) above would have been classified at the commencement of the 1987 income year (i.e., ewe hoggets ).

The strict application of that provision would, however, result in the situation of no income spread being given in respect of 1 year old stock on hand at the end of the 1987 income year (e.g., ewe hoggets). As there is no younger class of livestock such cases "a" will always be nil.

In practice therefore it is acceptable that the calculation "a" be based on a comparison with 1987 closing numbers of one class with 1987 opening number of that class (e.g., closing number of ewe hoggets should be compared with opening number of ewe hoggets). It is expected that most taxpayers will adopt this approach. However, where the taxpayer wishes, the calculation of the income write-off can of course be made in strict accordance with the legislation. Situations where this approach may be more appropriate with farmers who are building up a breeding herd by purchasing and retaining immediate livestock.

### Farmers Who Cease In 1986 or 1987

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that taxpayers who cease to derive income from livestock after 12 December 1985 and before the end of the 1987 income year may apply to apportion the taxpayer's "assessable excess" between the year of cessation (1986 or 1987, as appropriate) and all or any of the 4 succeeding income years. Any such application must be in writing and must be forwarded to the Department within the time in which the relevant return (the return for the income year in which the taxpayer ceases farming) is required to be filed (the date depends on what balance date is used and whether any extension of time for filing of the return has been granted).

### Continuing Farmers

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that taxpayers who continue farming (i.e. have closing 1987 livestock) may apply to apportion the taxpayer's "livestock revaluation income" between the 1987 income year and the 4 succeeding income years.

The same application procedure as outlined for subsection (2) must be followed.

### Minimum Amount to Spread

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that any amount of income apportioned under subsection (2) or subsection (3) shall not be less than 20 percent of the total income available to be spread (i.e. the total "assessable excess" or the total livestock revaluation income").

Where in any income year the remaining balance of income to be spread is less than 20 percent of the total that balance must be brought to account in that income year.

_**Subsection (5)**_ gives the Commissioner power to cancel any such apportionment of income to any income year and requires the income instead to be returned in the income year prior to the income year to which it was to be apportioned.

This provision will be applied where a taxpayer dies before the full amount of the income spread is brought to account, with the balance being included as income derived in the return to date of death.

_**Subsection (6)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

Part III - Bloodstock
---------------------

### Outline

The legislation contained in this Act introduces new rules for the treatment of certain aspects of the taxation of bloodstock. It introduces legislation governing the valuation of stock on hand, the writing down of the cost of breeding animals, the racing of stud stock and the treatment of profits on sale or insurance recovery. In all other respects, the treatment that has applied in the past remains unchanged.

The new legislation applies with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1987. The effect of each of the new provisions is as follows.

### _Section 3 Definition of "Bloodstock"_

Section 3 inserts a definition of "bloodstock" into section 2 of the Act. The expression is defined as meaning any standardbred or thoroughbred horse and as including any share or interest in any such horse. The definition covers not only standardbred or thoroughbred horses used in the bloodstock breeding industry but extends to these horses where they are used in the conduct of any business. In general, however. the provisions of the legislation affecting bloodstock apply only to bloodstock used in a breeding business. However the provisions relating to the valuation of bloodstock can apply not only to thoroughbred and standardbred horses used in the business of bloodstock breeding, but also to bloodstock used in any other business.

The extension of the definition to include any interest or share in any bloodstock means that any such interest or share is treated in the same way for tax purposes as full ownership of the horse. The principal effect of this inclusion will mean that the cost of the share in any breeding stock will be able to be written down over the appropriate term, depending on whether the horse is a stallion or broodmare, at the same rate as applies for outright owners of breeding stock.

### Valuation of Bloodstock

### _A. Year Ending 31 March 1987_

The new legislation affecting bloodstock valuation does not apply until the year commencing 1 April 1987 and for the year ended 31 March 1987 the old rules continue to apply. However, as the general rules for valuation of livestock have been amended in this Amendment Act it is necessary to explain the way in which the legislation achieves that effect for the 1987 year.

Section 85(4) of the Income Tax Act has required, in previous years. that all trading stock (including bloodstock and other livestock) be valued at cost price, market value or replacement value. The valuation rules for bloodstock in those years have been developed from that base. From the income year commencing 1 April 1986, section 85(4) has a series of different options in relation to livestock to cater for the new basis on which "specified livestock" is to be valued. The new subsection provides, at paragraph (a), that all livestock other than specified livestock is to be valued under section 86 of the Act. The new section 86(1A) provides that these livestock are to be valued at cost price, market value, replacement value or standard value. No standard value has been approved for bloodstock and accordingly the same three valuation options as have applied in previous years will continue to apply for the year ending 31 March 1987. There will be no practical effect resulting from the change to the legislation, the only difference being the position in which the authority for the treatment is contained in the legislation.

### Valuation of Bloodstock

### _B. Year Ending 31 March 1988 and Future Years_

The legislation that applies for the year ending 31 March 1987 and previous years will not apply for 1988 and future years. Section 7(4) of the Amendment Act amends the new section 86(1A) by excluding bloodstock from its coverage for the year commencing 1 April 1987, meaning that bloodstock cannot be valued under section 86 for 1988 and future years. Instead, section 5(2) of the Amendment Act inserts a new paragraph (f) into section 85(4A) to require that the valuation of bloodstock is to be determined under section 86H, the new section 86H being inserted into the Act by section 8 of the Amendment Act with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1987.

The new section 86H(2) provides the basis on which bloodstock is to be valued. Paragraphs (a) and (b) deal with bloodstock used for breeding by the taxpayer as part of the taxpayer's business, while paragraph (c) deals with bloodstock not yet used for breeding or not used in the conduct of a business. Subsections (3) and (4) then qualify this treatment in certain limited circumstances.

Subsection (2)(a) applies in the first year in which bloodstock is used by a taxpayer for breeding purposes in the course of the conduct of the taxpayer's business. It provides that the value at which that bloodstock is to be brought into account at the end of the year is to be its cost price reduced by the "specified write-down" This expression is defined in subsection (1) as meaning:

*   for stallions, 20 percent of cost price;
*   for broodmares, an annual amount that will reduce the cost to $1 in the year the mare attains the age of 14, with a maximum rate of 33 1/3 percent of cost price. It is achieved by application of the formula -
*   |     |
    | --- |
    | Y   |
    | 15 - Z |
    

*   Y being the cost of the horse; and
*   Z being 12, or the age of the horse (in whole years) in the year the horse is first used by the taxpayer for breeding if that age is 11 or less.

For example, a broodmare purchased at a cost of $40,000 is first serviced by a stallion during the year ending 30 June 1988. She was aged 5 years 11 months at that date. The value of which the mare is to be brought into account at 30 June 1988 is its cost price reduced by the following amount:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $40,000 | \=  | $40,000 | \=  | $4,000 |
| 15 - 5 | 10  |

ie, she is brought to account at $36,000.

Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) then provides that the value of that breeding stock may be written down by that "specified write-down" in every subsequent year until the year in which the write-down reduces the cost of the horse to Nil. In that year, subsection (4) provides that the horse is to be valued at $1. This means that in the example shown previously, the broodmare would continue to be written down by $4,000 per annum until the year ending 30 June 1997, in which year the write-down would be $3,999 to reduce her cost to $1. In every subsequent year, she must be valued at that $1 level.

Paragraph (c) provides that all other bloodstock must be valued at its cost price. This means that:

*   Bloodstock purchased specifically for use as breeding stock but not used for breeding in the year of purchase (say, because it was purchased after the end of the breeding season) will not be able to be written down in the year of purchase. It must be valued at its cost price.
*   Bloodstock bred for future use as breeding stock cannot commence to be written down until it is first used for stud duties. It must be valued at the amount it has cost the breeder to breed and rear it.
*   All bloodstock that is used by the owner for breeding, or that is used for breeding but not as part of any business activity of the owner, must be valued at cost price.

Additional points to note in relation to the interpretation of subsections (2) and (4) of this section are:

*   The requirement that bloodstock be used for breeding purposes means that the stud must actually put the mare to the stallion during the year in a normal businesslike manner. It is not necessary for the mating to be successful but it is essential that a serious attempt be made and be able to be substantiated by reference to the stallions' service records.
*   Mares purchased in foal may commence to be written down in the year of purchase. They will be regarded as having been used by the new owner for breeding purposes in that year. However, a mare which is not in foal and is purchased with a foal at foot would not be treated as having been used by the new owner for breeding purposes and the new owner will need to commence to use her for breeding purposes to be entitled to any write-down.
*   The commencement of the write-down is dependent upon the horse having been used by the current owner for breeding purposes. The fact that a horse has previously been used for breeding by a previous owner does not entitle a new owner to commence to write-down its cost. The new owner must use the horse for breeding before the write-down can commence and, in the case of a stallion, the period of 5 years commences at that point.
*   Paragraph (b) envisages the situation where a stud has used a horse for breeding, then used it for hobby racing, and subsequently recommenced to use it for breeding. In these cases, the write-down recommences immediately, but is a write-down of the new cost price over the same period as would have applied had the horse been purchased and first used for breeding in that subsequent year of recommencement.
*   Once a horse has been used for breeding by any taxpayer that taxpayer may continue to write-down its cost every year, provided the horse is still being held for breeding purposes notwithstanding that it may not be used for breeding purposes in any of those subsequent years. However, if the horse has ceased to be used for breeding purposes, it raises the question of whether it has commenced to be used for private purposes. This question is reliant on the facts of each case but where the animal has commenced to be held for private reasons it must be treated as having been disposed of by the business at its market value.

### Exception

Subsection (3) of section 86H provides the only exception to the cost price valuation method for bloodstock. This subsection enables market value to be adopted where the market value of any horse reduces, as a direct result of accident, birth deformity or infertility, to less than 50 percent of the market value that would have applied had that accident, birth deformity or infertility not occurred. The taxpayer is not required to adopt market value, but once market value has been adopted it must be used in every subsequent year. The provisions of subsection (2), including the write-down provisions, cease to be available when the taxpayer has elected to use market value in accordance with this subsection.

### Horses Raced By a Stud

Section 10 of the Amendment Act introduces a new paragraph (n) to section 106 of the Act to debar a deduction for expenditure incurred in racing a horse. In accordance with the new paragraph, the following expenses will not be allowable as a deduction, even where they are incurred by a breeder in carrying on the business of breeding bloodstock:

*   the cost of preparing a horse for racing, e.g., training fees
    *   **Note:** The Department regards the cost of breaking in a horse as not being a cost associated with preparing the horse for racing. However, other expenses related to, for example, preparing a horse for racing preparatory to a ready to run sale would be treated as a cost of preparing the horse for racing, notwithstanding that the owner had no intention of racing the horse on his or her own account:
*   the cost of racing a horse:
*   any other costs incurred in relation to the racing of a horse.

The amendment first applies to expenditure incurred during the year ending 31 March 1988. Expenditure not directly related to racing (for example, the cost of feeding or maintaining a horse)will continue to be deductible to the stud owner. Income derived by any person from racing stakes continues to be exempt from tax in accordance with the provisions of section 61(31).

Section 16 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 212A into the Act to deal with horses raced by a stud. In the past it has been the practice of some studs to treat horses raced by the stud as a transfer to a non-taxable racing account at cost price or market value. The Government has decided that this treatment is not appropriate in cases where the horse is not being raced as a hobby and has inserted the new section 212A to ensure that it ceases for 1988 and future years. The intention of the legislation is that horses raced by a stud to enhance their value, the value of their progeny, or otherwise in furtherance of the interests of the stud, should remain in the stud accounts and that only horses raced as a hobby should be permitted to be transferred to a non-taxable racing account. Because, in general, the majority of fillies raced by studs are raced for business purposes the legislation deems all horses capable of future breeding to be raced as part of the stud business, while all horses known to be incapable of use for future breeding are regarded as being raced as a hobby. There is provision in the legislation for the stud to convince the Commissioner that the treatment provided in the legislation does not reflect the reality of a given situation. If the Commissioner is convinced, there is provision for the legislation to reflect the true position.

The legislation applies to taxpayers engaged in the business of breeding or rearing bloodstock for sale. It does not apply to persons who are not in business nor to persons engaged in a different business (e.g., leasing of bloodstock). It also does not apply to persons who are not yet in the business of breeding bloodstock but who are racing a horse or horses they intend to use in a breeding business at some future date.

**Horses Incapable of Breeding**

_**Subsection (1)**_ of section 212A provides that any bloodstock of any taxpayer that is expected to be unable to be used for future breeding is to be regarded as no longer being used in the stud business if it is raced by the stud. Subsection (6) then provides that it is treated as having been sold by the stud at market value on the day in which it commenced to be used as a racehorse.

**Horses that are Capable of Future Breeding**

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that where any bloodstock that is capable of future breeding is raced by the taxpayer, it is deemed to be raced as part of the stud business. This means that the horse is not able to be treated as being involved in a non-taxable activity and is therefore to be retained in the stud accounts and not transferred to a non-taxable racing account. It also means that if the horse is sold while racing, the consideration received on the sale is taxable income.

**Non-Breeders Raced for Business Purposes**

_**Subsection (3)**_ enables the taxpayer to convince the Commissioner, in an application made under subsection (5), that a horse that is unable to be used for future breeding is being raced as part of the stud business activities. Where the Commissioner is convinced of this, whether as a result of the application or otherwise, the horse will be treated in the same manner as one to which subsection (2) applies. It is difficult to envisage the type of circumstances in which subsection (3) could apply and each case will therefore be treated on its own merits.

**Hobby Racing**

_**Subsection (4)**_ enables the taxpayer to convince the Commissioner that a horse that is capable of future breeding is being raced as a hobby and not as part of the business. Where the Commissioner is convinced of this, the horse will be treated in the same manner as one to which subsection (1) applies. The subsection can also be applied where the taxpayer does not make an application but the Commissioner is nevertheless satisfied that the horse is being raced for private enjoyment. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that where a horse is genuinely raced as a hobby it is not treated as being owned by the business. It is not intended as a provision that will enable studs to continue their past practice of transferring horses in and out of the stud accounts. For this reason strong argument will need to be provided to convince the Commissioner that a horse is being raced for private purposes. It is difficult to envisage circumstances where major studs would race any horses as a hobby and well-bred fillies could not generally be regarded as being hobby propositions. Once again, each case will fall to be considered on its own merits.

**Rules for Applications Made Under Subsection (3) or (4)**

_**Subsection (5)**_ sets out the conditions with which applications made to the Commissioner under subsection (3) or (4) must comply. Each such application must:

1.  be in writing:
2.  be given to the Commissioner within one month following the earlier of the day on which the horse is first prepared for racing and the day on which it is first raced by the taxpayer,
3.  be supported by any information the Commissioner may require.

Horses no Longer Used for Business Purposes

em>**Subsection (6)** provides that any racehorse that is treated as no longer being used in the business of bloodstock is deemed to have been disposed of by the taxpayer, on the day it ceased to be used in the business, at its market value on that day. The day on which it ceased to be used for business purposes is the earlier of the day on which it was first prepared for racing or the day on which it was first raced by the taxpayer. The market value of the horse on that day must be included in the stud's assessable income for the year in which that day falls.

**Horses Transferred from Private Account to the Stud Business**

_**Subsection (7)**_ caters for the situation where a horse that has previously been regarded as not being part of the business activities of the taxpayer subsequently commences to be used as part of the stud business. In general, it would cater for horses which have previously been treated as a deemed sale by the stud business at market value as a result of the application of subsection (1) or subsection (4) of this section. It applies where the horse commences to be used as a stud stallion or broodmare and deems the horse to have been acquired by the stud, at market value, on the day it commenced to be so used. The amount of the market value on that day will be treated as the purchase price and will be depreciable in the same manner as if the horse had been acquired by the stud on that day for that amount.

_**Subsection (8)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

This new section applies for the income year commencing 1 April 1987. Please see the commentary on the transitional provisions for the treatment that is to apply from that date for horses that are raced by a stud prior to the commencement of that year.

**Transitional Provisions**

Section 16 of the Amendment Act introduces a new section 212C to provide transitional provisions for the charges in the method of valuing livestock and the treatment of horses raced by the stud.

**Deemed Cost Price for 1988**

_**Subsection (1)**_ of the new section sets a cost price for all bloodstock on hand at the end of the income year ending 31 March 1987. It deems those horses to have had a cost price, at the commencement of the taxpayer's 1988 accounting year, of the amount at which they were valued in the taxpayer's accounts at the end of the previous accounting year. For example, a broodmare purchased for $300,000 in 1986 and written down to $200,000 at the end of the year ended 31 March 1987 is deemed to have a cost price of $200,000 as at the commencement of the taxpayer's 1988 accounting year.

The subsection is required because bloodstock will in future be required to be valued at cost price and it is necessary to establish an opening cost value. For stallions and broodmares, it is this opening cost value that will be able to be written-off in 1988 and future years in accordance with section 86H. For other bloodstock, this deemed cost is the amount the horse is regarded as having cost the taxpayer to breed and rear, or purchase and rear, as at that date.

**Transitional Cost Write-down Provisions**

_**Subsection (2)**_ sets out the basis on which this deemed cost may be written-off in respect of horses first used for breeding prior to the commencement of the 1988 year. Section 86H permits stallions and broodmares to be written down to $1 on a straight line basis, the write-down to commence in the year in which the horse is first used for breeding purposes by the taxpayer. However, that section applies only to horses that commence to be so used on or after the commencement of the 1988 accounting year so transitional measures are needed to provide a write-down, of the deemed cost as determined under subsection (1) of section 212A, for horses that commenced to be used by the taxpayer for breeding prior to the start of the 1988 year.

The legislation provides a formula for stallions that enables the deemed cost to be written down evenly over the remainder of the 5 year period that commenced in the year the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding. For example, if a horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ended 31 March 1985 and had a deemed cost of $200,000 as at the end of the 1987 year, it has 2 years remaining in the 5 year period that commenced in the year it was first used for breeding. The deemed cost of $200,000 may be written down to $1 in the years 1988 and 1989, $100,000 being written-off in 1988 and $99,999 in 1989. If the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ending 31 March 1987, the five year period commencing with that year expires with the 1991 tax year and the write-down of the deemed cost as at the commencement of the 1988 tax year would be spread evenly over the four years 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991.

The formula specified in the legislation to achieve these results is as follows:

|     |
| --- |
| Y   |
| 15 - Z |

where

*   Y is the deemed cost price of the horse determined under subsection (1) of the new section 212A; and
*   Z is -
    1.  The number 1 where the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ending 31 March 1987.
    2.  The number 2 where the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ended 31 March 1986.
    3.  The number 3 where the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ended 31 March 1985.
    4.  The number 4 where the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ended 31 March 1984 or in any previous year.

The formula for broodmares is different. Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) provides that where a broodmare commenced to be used by the taxpayer for breeding purposes prior to the start of the 1988 accounting year, the horse is deemed to have been first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the 1988 year. This means that it's deemed cost at the start of the 1988 year is written down evenly to $1 over the period that commences with the 1988 year and ends with the year in which the horse attains the age of 14 years.

It is important to note that the legislation, both in section 212A and section 86H, deals with the year in which the horse was first used by the taxpayer for breeding in the course of the conduct of a business. For example, if a horse was used by the taxpayer for hobby breeding in 1984 and 1985 but commenced to be used in a business of breeding when the taxpayer expanded his activities into a business in 1986, that horse is treated as having commenced to be used by the taxpayer for breeding in 1986, not 1984. Similarly, it is important to note that the legislation refers to first use by the taxpayer for breeding. Thus a broodmare that had been used for breeding by a breeder since 1984, was purchased by the taxpayer in 1986 and first used by the taxpayer for breeding during the year ending 31 March 1987 is, as far as the current owner is concerned, treated as being first used for breeding in 1987, not in 1984.

**Horses Held in Racing Account at the End of 1987 Income Year**

_**Subsection (3)**_ deals with situation where a horse owned by the stud has been transferred to a non-taxable racing account and is still recorded in that account at the end of the 1987 year. The horse has effectively been treated as not owned by the business at the end of the 1987 year. Subsection (3) provides that it will continue to be treated as not comprising part of the business activities of the taxpayer until such time as the Commissioner is satisfied that it has ceased to be used as a racehorse. If it is sold as a racehorse the rules governing sales from racing, that applied prior to the passing of this legislation, will continue to apply.

_**Subsection (4)**_ deals with the situation where any horse to which subsection (3) applies ceases to be used as a racehorse and commences to be used for stud duties. Where this occurs, the horse must be transferred back into the business accounts using the same valuation method as applied when it was transferred into the non-taxable racing account. This is the same as the treatment that would have applied had section 212A not been introduced.

_**Subsection (5)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

Profit Offset Against Replacement Breeding Stock

_**Section 16**_ of the Amendment Act introduces a new section 212B to enable profits on sale of, or insurance recovery on death or permanent injury to, bloodstock held for breeding to be offset against the cost price of the replacement animal. The amount so offset is not taxable to the stud and the cost of the replacement is treated as being reduced by the amount offset. The provision is similar in its effect to the provisions in section 117 in relation to the recovery of depreciation.

**Definitions**

_**Subsection (1)**_ is the definition section.

The expression "assessable gain" defines the amount that is available for offset against replacement stock. It is defined as meaning -

*   in the case of sale of breeding stock, the amount by which the consideration on sale exceeds the value at which the horse was valued in the taxpayer's accounts at the end of the previous year;
*   in the case of an insurance recovery, the amount by which that recovery exceeds the value at which the horse was valued in the taxpayer's accounts at the end of the previous year.

Note that one of the implications of this definition is that the section cannot apply in respect of any bloodstock purchased during the year in which the sale or insurance recovery takes place. The "assessable excess" calculation requires the animal to have been valued in the taxpayer's business accounts at the end of the preceding income year.

"Breeding stock" is defined to make it quite clear as to which animals the legislation applies. It is defined as meaning -

*   (a) In relation to bloodstock that is sold, an animal that had been actually used for breeding prior to the sale. If the animal that is sold has never been used by the taxpayer for breeding as part of the stud's business activity, the legislation does not apply.
*   (b) In relation to bloodstock that is subject to an insurance recovery, an animal that has either been used by the taxpayer for breeding as part of the stud's business or an animal that the Commissioner is satisfied was purchased for breeding. It does not, however, apply to stock bred by the taxpayer that the taxpayer intended to use as breeding stock unless that animal has in fact been used for breeding purposes.

Only profits on sale, or insurance recoveries on loss, death or permanent injury, involving "breeding stock" are eligible for offset against replacement stock.

**Sales of Breeding Stock**

_**Subsection (2)**_ deals with sales of "breeding stock". It enables the taxpayer to apply to the Commissioner for any "assessable excess" on sale of any "breeding stock" to be offset against the cost of any bloodstock which the taxpayer has acquired to replace the stock that was sold. The application must be made in writing by the taxpayer within 6 months following the end of the income year in which the breeding stock was sold (or within such further period as the Commissioner considers reasonable) and the replacement animal must be purchased prior to the making of the application. Thus to be eligible the replacement animal must be purchased within 6 months following the end of the year of sale unless exceptional circumstances require a longer period. The legislation permits the whole of the profit on sale to be offset against the cost of the replacement animal. If for any reason the profit exceeds the cost of the replacement, the legislation permits part only of the profit to be offset. Similarly, if the taxpayer wishes to offset only part of the profit, this can be permitted under the legislation.

The effect of the provision is that the profit offset under this section is no longer taxable and the cost of the animal against which it is offset is treated as being reduced by the amount offset.

If the profit on sale has been included in an assessment issued to the taxpayer prior to the receipt of the application for it to be offset, the assessment will be amended to exclude the profit to be offset when the application is approved by the Commissioner.

**Insurance Recoveries**

_**Subsection (3)**_ deals with insurance recoveries and other payments made by way of indemnity, compensation or other damages in respect of the loss or death of, or permanent injury to, any breeding stock. It enables the taxpayer to apply to the Commissioner for the whole or any part of any "assessable excess" to be offset against the cost of the replacement animal. The provision is in two parts. Paragraph (a) requires the election to be made in writing within 6 months after the end of the income year in which the loss, death or permanent injury occurred or within such further time as the Commissioner considers reasonable. In addition, the replacement animal must be purchased prior to the making of the application. Essentially, this provision is the same as that which applies under subsection (2) on the sale of breeding stock.

The second part of this provision is set out in paragraph (b). It caters for the position where paragraph (a) does not apply and the Commissioner is satisfied that:

1.  there are valid commercial reasons for the delay in the replacement of the breeding stock: and
2.  the replacement animal was acquired within two income years following the end of the income year in which the loss, death or permanent injury occurred.

Where these conditions are met, and the taxpayer makes written application prior to the end of that second income year, the Commissioner may exclude all or part of the profit on insurance recovery from the taxpayer's income and reduce the cost of the replacement animal by that amount. It should be noted that:

*   under paragraph (b), the Commissioner has no discretion to accept a late application:
*   the taxpayer has two income years in which to replace the animal, not two years. Although in general it will be two years in practice, it could be a lesser or greater period if the taxpayer has a change of balance date within that two year period.

_**Subsection (4)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

**Application Date**

The new legislation first applies to the income year commencing on 1 April 1986 (or equivalent accounting year). It will therefore first apply in respect of sales, losses, deaths or permanent injuries that occur in 1988 and future tax years. It does not apply where these events occurred in earlier years notwithstanding that the replacement animal may be acquired in 1988 and future years.

### Sport Horses

The legislation applies not only to studs which breed throughbred \[sic\] and standardbred horses for sale as racehorses. It also applies to other industries which use bloodstock for breeding purposes, such as the sport horse breeding industry which uses thoroughbred horses in the breeding of, among others, show Jumpers. The effect of the new legislation on this industry is set out below and is indicative of the treatment that will in future apply to any industry that uses bloodstock in the carrying on of a business.

### Valuation of Stock on Hand, - Section 86H

The new legislation dealing with the valuation of bloodstock applies to all thoroughbred and standardbred horses used in any business. The basic valuation method provided in section 86H for these horses is cost price, with market value being available only where the market value drops significantly as the result of infertility, birth deformity or accident. In the income year in which the horse commences to be used for breeding as part of the stud's business operations, its cost can commence to be written down to $l over a five year period for stallions or at age 14 for broodmares. This applies irrespective of whether the horse with which it is mated is a thoroughbred or standardbred horse.

In short, the rules set out in the detailed explanation of the provisions of section 86H apply equally to all thoroughbred or standardbred horses notwithstanding that the business may not be that of thoroughbred or standardbred breeding.

The provisions of section 86H apply only to those sport horses that are thoroughbreds (or standardbreds). The valuation of all other sport horses is governed by the provisions of section 86(1A), in terms of that section, they must be valued at (at the taxpayer's option) cost price, market value or the value at which the horse can be replaced. There is no provision in the legislation for the cost price of breeding stock that is not a thoroughbred or standardbred horse to be written down to $1.

The stock must be valued at cost price, market value or replacement value, although of course if the market value is declining the adoption of market value will effectively enable the stud to progressively reduce the value of the animal.

### Profit Offset Against Replacement Breeding Stock

Profits on sale or insurance recovery in bloodstock used for the breeding of sport horses will be able to be offset against the cost of replacement bloodstock under the new section 212B. Where these circumstances apply, the legislation applies to the sport horse breeding industry in the same manner as it applies to the thoroughbred and standardbred breeding industries.

It should be noted that for the legislation to apply the breeding animal in which the profit is made must be a thoroughbred or standardbred horse and the replacement animal must also be a thoroughbred or standardbred horse. It does not apply where the profit was made on a horse other than a thoroughbred or standardbred nor does it apply where the replacement animal is a horse other than a thoroughbred or standardbred.

Part IV - Farm Development Expenditure
--------------------------------------

### 1\. Outline

Sections 11 and 12 of the Amendment Act give effect to the announcement that the current year deduction in respect of farming. aquacultural and forestry development expenditure is to be replaced with a depreciation regime which allows depreciation of land improvements to be written-off against assessable income.

**Section 11** repeals the old sections 126, 127, 127A and 128A, and inserts new sections 127, 127A and 128. The effect of section 11 is to phase-out the deduction allowed under those sections over the income years 1988-1991.

**Section 12** inserts new sections 128A, 128B and 128C which provide for the new depreciation regime for land development assets. The following commentary explains the detail of these provisions as they relate to farming. The changes relating to forestry are detailed In Part V of this publication.

### 2\. Section 11: Phase-Out of Farm Development Expenditure

### _2.1 Repeal of Section 126_

_**Subsection (1)**_ repeals section 126 of the principal Act. That section allowed a deduction for certain types of farm development expenditure but only to the extent that the expenditure is not deductible under section 127. As all the types of expenditure listed in section 126 are deductible under section 127 the former section is redundant and has therefore been repealed.

### _**2.2 Replacement Section 127**_

The old section 127 allowed a current-year deduction to taxpayers engaged in any farming or agricultural business in respect of farm development expenditure.

### Deductible Expenditure

_**Subsection (1)**_ of the replacement section provides the same conditions that were contained in the old section 127(2) and lists the same types of expenditure that can be deducted.

The only additional condition imposed by subsection (1) is the requirement that to be deductible the expenditure must be incurred in or before the 1991 income year.

### Phase-out

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that a reducing percentage of the expenditure allowed as a deduction under subsection (1) will be deductible in the 1988 income year and future years.

The effect of subsection (2) is as follows:

| Income Year | Percentage of Expenditure |
| --- | --- |
|     | Deductible |
| 1987 | 100 |
| 1988 | 90  |
| 1989 | 75  |
| 1990 | 55  |
| 1991 | 30  |
| 1992 | 0   |

### Binding Contracts

_**Subsection (3)**_ qualifies subsection (2) by providing that a taxpayer who enters into a binding contract on or before 12 December 1985 (i.e. a contract that becomes unconditional on or before that date) to incur expenditure of any of the kinds listed in subsection (1), may deduct the total amount of any of that expenditure which is incurred in the 1988 income year.

Note that it is only the expenditure that is incurred in that income year pursuant to the binding contract which can be deducted in full. Any expenditure not directly related to the contract is only deductible to the extent of 90 percent of that expenditure.

Deferral of Deduction

_**Subsection (4) to (6)**_ simply restate the provisions that were contained in the old section 127 which allowed taxpayers to spread the deduction for development expenditure over any or all of the nine income years succeeding the income year in which the expenditure is incurred. For example, the amount of deduction allowed in respect of expenditure incurred in the 1991 income year (i.e., 30 percent of expenditure incurred) can be deferred and claimed in full (or in part) In any of (or all of) the expenditure income years 1992-2000.

_**Subsection (7)**_ is the normal accounting year provisions.

### _2.3 Replacement Section 127A - Forestry Development Expenditure_

See commentary on forestry in Part V.

### _2.4 Replacement Section 128 - Aquacultural Development Expenditure_

The old section 128 allowed a deduction to taxpayers engaged in the business of aquaculture in respect of specified types of development expenditure.

The replacement section 128 simply restates the old provisions but inserts the same additional provisions as inserted in the replacement section 127. That is -

*   The deduction will apply only to expenditure incurred in or prior to the 1991 income year (subsection 2).
*   The following phase-out applies -
*   | Income Year | Percentage of Expenditure |
    | --- | --- |
    |     | Deductible |
    | 1987 | 100 |
    | 1988 | 90  |
    | 1989 | 75  |
    | 1990 | 55  |
    | 1991 | 30  |
    | 1992 | 0   |
    
*   Any expenditure incurred in the 1988 income year pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 12 December 1985 may be deducted in full.

### 3\. Section 12 - Depreciation of Development Expenditure

### _3.1 New Section 128A_

The new section 128A gives effect: to the new treatment of farm development expenditure.

### Deduction - Farmer Owns Land

_Subsection (2)_ provides that taxpayers who carry on a farming or agricultural business are entitled to a deduction in respect of any of the types of expenditure specified in Part I of the Thirteenth Schedule (Third Schedule of the Amendment Act). The types of expenditure listed are the same as the types of expenditure in respect of which a deduction is allowed under section 127. There' are, however, two additional categories of expenditure listed in the Thirteenth Schedule. They are - expenditure incurred in:

*   "(1) The planting of vines or trees on the land other than trees planted primarily and principally for the purposes of timber production.
*   "(2) The construction on the land of structures for shelter purposes."

The subsection contains a number of qualifying conditions:

1.  The taxpayer who carries on the farming or agricultural business must also own the land,
2.  No deduction is allowed in the income year the taxpayer disposes of the land
3.  The expenditure must be of benefit to the business in the income year the deduction is claimed.

The effect of condition (iii) is that no deduction is allowed in respect of any land improvements which are not of benefit to the business in the year concerned. For example, deductions would not continue to be allowed in respect of a water bore that dries up or a sheep dip that becomes obsolete.

An additional feature of subsection (2) is that a deduction is allowed in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer concerned or by any other taxpayer. This means that the land owner may claim a deduction in respect of the unexpired portion land improvements effected by previous owners of the land. The effect of this provision is shown in the example that follows.

### Deduction - Lessee Farmer

_**Subsection (3)**_ is a similar provision to subsection (2) but applies to taxpayers who do not own the land on which they undertake their farming or agricultural business. However, such taxpayers are allowed a deduction only in respect of expenditure incurred by that taxpayer.

The effect of the subsection is that farmers who lease their land cannot claim deductions in respect of land improvements effected by the owner or past owners of the land.

Amount of Deduction

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the amount of any deduction allowed under subsection (2) or (3) shall be an amount equal to the percentage specified in the Thirteenth Schedule (5 percent or 10 percent depending on the type of expenditure) of the "diminished value" of the expenditure.

_**Subsection (1)**_ defines "diminished value" as being in relation to any income year, an amount of expenditure reduced by:

*   (a) every deduction allowed to any taxpayer in any preceding income year in relation to that expenditure:
*   (b) every deduction allowed in that income year (other than any deduction allowed under section 128A) to any taxpayer.

The effect of section 128A is demonstrated by the following example

### _Example_

*   Farmer A spends, in the 1989 income year, $40,000 on constructing an access road and $5,000 on clearing scrub from a previously undeveloped block.
*   In the 1991 income year farmer B buys the land.
*   In the 1993 income year the road is washed away in a flood.

The income tax accounts of farmer A and farmer B could be expected to show the following details:

| FARMER A |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expenditure | Opening | Section 127 | Deductible | Section 128A | Closing |
|     | Balance | Deduction | Excess | Deduction | Balance |
| 1989 Return |     |     |     | (5%) |     |
| Access Road - | (cost) |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 10,000 | 7,500 | 2,500 | 125 | 2,375 |
| Scrub Clearance - | (cost) |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 5,000 | 3,750 | 1,250 | 63  | 1,187 |
| 1990 Return |     |     |     |     |     |
| Access Road - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 2,375 | \-  | 2,375 | 118 | 2,257 |
| Scrub Clearance - |     |     |     |     |     |

It can be seen from the preceding example that the new treatment of farm development expenditure is in the nature of a depreciation regime on a diminishing value basis. Additional features of the new basis of treatment are:

*   Any deductions allowed under any other provision must be deducted from the expenditure before calculating the "depreciation".
*   When the land improvement is sold the purchaser continues to claim "depreciation" (on the unexpired portion of the vendor's opening book value of land improvements) at the same rate that would have applied to the vendor had the sale not been made.
*   No deduction is allowed to the vendor in the year of the sale.
*   The purchaser is entitled to a full deduction in the year of purchase (no apportionment regardless of when in the income year the purchase took place).
*   There is no additional deduction in respect of the loss incurred when an improvement is written-off.
*   A full deduction is allowed in the year an improvement is written-off (i.e. the deduction is not apportioned regardless of when in the income year the asset is written-off).
*   The improvement must be of benefit to the business in the income year (one day is sufficient).
*   The taxpayer must be carrying on the business of farming to receive any deduction under this section, i.e., land owning companies and trusts leasing farm land do not qualify.

Farmers who own land but have bailed all their livestock also do not qualify. However, 50/50 sharemilkers do qualify for a deduction under this section because they are considered to be carrying on the business of farming.

### Purpose of Farm Tree Plantings

_**Subsection (5)**_ relates to expenditure of the type specified in category (1) in Part I of the Thirteenth Schedule, which allows a deduction under section 128A in respect of expenditure incurred in:

*   "The planting of vines or trees on the land other than trees planted primarily and principally for the purposes of timber production."

_**Subsection (5)**_ provides that where there is dispute as to the purpose of any farm plantings a certificate from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, or the appropriate Catchment Commission or any other person the Commissioner considers suitably qualified, shall be final evidence as to the purpose of the trees.

Such situations may arise where it is questionable whether a farm planting is a shelter belt or a small commercial woodlot. The purpose for which the trees were planted is the test and it is of no consequence whether the trees ultimately are sold as timber.

_**Subsection (6)**_ is the normal accounting year provision for balance dates which correspond to the 31st day of March.

### _3.2 New Section 128B_

See commentary on forestry in Part V.

### _3.3 New Section 128C_

The new section 128C relates to aquaculture and enacts a provision the same as section 128A but with the necessary changes to section references. The rates of "depreciation" that apply to aquacultural land improvements are listed in Parts III - VII of the Thirteenth Schedule.

All the features of section 128A as outlined in the preceding paragraphs apply also to section 128C.

### _3.4 Applications_

The new section 128A, 128B and 128C apply with respect to the income year ending on the 31st day of March 1988 and subsequent income years.

### Horticultural Trees and Vines

The enactment of section 128A introduces a significant change to the taxation treatment of orchard trees and horticultural vines. Previously the initial cost of purchasing and planting the trees and vines was a capital expense and not deductible with the cost of the replacement trees and vines being deductible. Under the new treatment the cost of both the initial plantings and replacement plantings will be capitalised and "depreciable" under section 128A.

Part V - Forestry Provisions
----------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

The Forestry provisions are covered in three sections of the Amendment Act.

*   **Section 4** - Repeals old section 74 and inserts a replacement section 74 to phase out the deduction of certain planting and maintenance expenditure.
*   **Section 11** - repeals old section 127A and inserts a replacement section 127A which phases out the deduction of forestry development expenditure.
*   **Section 12** - inserts new section 128B which provides for the "depreciation" of forestry development expenditure.

### 2\. Forestry Planting and Maintenance Expenditure

The old section 74 taxed profits from the sale of timber and allowed for a current year deduction of all forestry planting and maintenance expenditure. The new section 74 restates most of the old section 74 but adds a number of new provisions. The following commentary explains the effect of the new provisions.

### _Section 74(1) - Definitions_

The definition of "standing timber" has been amended to provide that the definition includes immature trees. The amendment clarifies that the sale of land on which seedlings or saplings are planted will be deemed to be a sale of standing timber, and therefore any profits in relation to that timber will be taxable.

### _Section 74(2) - Profits Taxable_

Restates provision which taxes the profits derived from the sale of timber (and minerals and flax).

### _Section 74(3) - Certain Deductions Continue_

Provides that taxpayers carrying on a forestry business can continue to deduct the following types of expenditure in the year incurred:

1.  Rent, rates, land tax, insurance premiums, administrative overheads, other like expenses;
2.  Weed control (excluding releasing), pest control, disease control, fertiliser applied to the forest;
3.  Interest;
4.  Repair and maintenance of plant and machinery;
5.  Repair and maintenance of land improvements (e.g., fences, roads, dams).

### _Section 74(4) - Depreciation_

Continues to allow a deduction in respect of the depreciation of plant and machinery used in the forestry business.

### _Section 74(5) - Sale of Standing Timber_

Restates the provision which deems a sale of land with standing timber to be a sale of timber. and thereby requiring the profit on the sale of the timber to be returned as assessable income in the year of sale.

### _Section 74(6) - Matrimonial Transfers_

Restates the provision which allows the matrimonial transfer of standing timber to take place at cost so that no taxable income arises as a result of the transfer.

### _Section 74(7) - Ornamental or Incidental Trees_

Restates the provision regarding certification as to whether trees are ornamented or incidental in nature and therefore not taxable when sold as standing timber.

### _Section 74(8)-74(10) - Existing Provisions_

Restates existing provisions to ensure expenditure deductible in the year incurred cannot subsequently be claimed as a "cost of forest" deduction against the income from the sale of the timber.

### _Section 74(11) - Land Contouring_

Inserts a new provision who deems the cost of land contouring not to form part of the "cost of timber". The effect of this provision is that at no stage can such costs be deductible for income tax purposes.

### _Section 74(12)-74(13) - Determination of Cost of Timber_

Inserts new provisions which provide that any forestry expenditure incurred in the 1988 income year or future years must form part of a "determination" by the Commissioner if it is to be allowed as a deduction against the income from eventual sale of the timber.

The effect of these two subsections is that the deductibility of "cost of forest" expenditure (i.e., expenditure which must be carried forward and offset against the eventual income from the sale of the timber) is determined in the year the expenditure is incurred rather than up to 30 years later. The provision means also that taxpayers can object to the disallowance of a claim for expenditure nearer the time the expenditure is incurred rather than have to wait until the year the corresponding income is received.

The provision requires the taxpayer to include in each year's tax return a record of the "cost of forest" expenditure incurred in that income year. The Department will then issue a notice of determination which certifies the amount of expenditure that eventually will be deductible against the income from the forest.

### _Section 74(14) - Loss of Forest_

Inserts a new provision which allows for a deduction of the "cost of forest" expenditure where the forest is destroyed (e.g., by fire). It provides for a deduction of the balance of the cost of forest account, after subtracting any insurance or compensation proceeds, in the year the forest is lost.

### _Section 74(15)-74(16) - Phase-out of General Deduction_

These two subsections restate the deduction for forestry planting and maintenance expenditure, but provide for a phasing-out of the general deduction so that in the 1992 income year and future years only the types of planting and maintenance expenditure listed in section 74(3) will be allowed as a current year deduction.

The phase-out will be on the following basis:

| Income Year | Percentage of Expenditure |
| --- | --- |
| Ending 31 March | Deductible in the Year Incurred |
| 1987 | 100 |
| 1988 | 90  |
| 1989 | 75  |
| 1990 | 55  |
| 1991 | 30  |
| 1992 | NIL |

### _Section 74(17) - Committed Expenditure_

Inserts a transitional provision which allows taxpayers a deduction in full in respect of forestry planting and maintenance expenditure which is subject to a binding contract entered into on or before 12 December 1985 (i.e., a contract that became unconditional on or before that date). However, it provides that the provision extends only to expenditure incurred in the 1997 income year or any previous year. Also there is a further limitation that the binding contract cannot be between associated persons.

### _Section 74(18) - Existing Forests_

Inserts a further transitional provision which allows taxpayers a deduction in full in respect of forestry maintenance expenditure Incurred on land purchased or leased, or subject to a binding contract of purchase or lease, on or before 12 December 1985. The provision contains the limitation that it will apply only in respect of trees planted on or before 31 December 1986. Also, it further provides that the deduction extends only to and including tree maintenance expenditure incurred up to and including the 1997 income year. Maintenance expenditure includes the pruning and tending of existing trees.

### 3\. Forestry Development Expenditure

Section 11 of the Amendment Act inserts a replacement section 127A which phases out the existing deduction for forestry development expenditure.

### Expenditure Deductible

_**Subsection (1)**_ restates the types of forestry expenditure deductible in the year incurred but adds that to be deductible the expenditure must be incurred in the 1991 income year or in any preceding year.

### Phase-out

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides for the following phase-out of the deduction allowed under subsection (1).

| Income Year | Percentage of Expenditure |
| --- | --- |
| Ending 31 March | Deductible in the Year Incurred |
| 1987 | 100 |
| 1988 | 90  |
| 1989 | 75  |
| 1990 | 55  |
| 1991 | 30  |
| 1992 | NIL |

### Committed Expenditure

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that taxpayers who enter into a binding contract (other than between associated persons) on or before 12 December 1985 to incur forestry development expenditure, receive a deduction in respect of 100 percent of any amount of that expenditure incurred in the 1988 income year.

The effect of this provision is to override the phase-out in respect of expenditure unconditionally committed to prior to 12 December 1985 and incurred in the 1988 income year. Any expenditure incurred in a subsequent income year is subject to the phase-out regardless of any prior binding commitment.

### Existing Forest

_**Subsection (4)**_ inserts a further transitional provision which allows taxpayers a deduction in full in respect of forestry development expenditure incurred on land purchased or leased, or subject to a binding contract of purchase or lease, on or before 12 December 1985. The provision contains a limitation that it will apply only in respect of land on which trees are planted on or before 31 December 1986. Also, it further provides that the deduction extends only to and including development expenditure incurred up to and including the 1997 income year.

As the provision is limited to forests in which the trees are already planted most forestry "development" expenditure would have already have incurred. The provision therefore will apply in practice only to expenditure such as the erection of fences, the sinking of bores and wells, construction of dams, etc.. It will not apply to expenditure undertaken to enable trees to be planted (e.g., the clearing of land).

### Deferral of Deduction

_**Subsections (4)-(7)**_ restate the provisions which relate to the deferral of the development expenditure deduction over a period of up to nine income years. The only change from the old provisions is the insertion of the restriction that the deduction for any expenditure allowed under the section cannot be deferred beyond the year 2000.

_**Subsection (8)**_ is the normal accounting year provision.

### 4\. Depreciation of Forestry Land Improvements

Section 12 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 128B which allows for a deduction in the nature of depreciation in respect of forestry land improvements.

_**Subsection (1)**_ defines the term "diminished value" (see commentary under subsection (4)).

### Deductions - Forester Owns Land

_**Subsection (2)**_ provides that any taxpayer who carries on a forestry business on land owned by the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction (other than in the year the land is sold) in respect of any of the types of forestry development expenditure listed in Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule.

The subsection provides that the deduction relates to expenditure incurred by the taxpayer claiming the deduction or by any other taxpayer. This means the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction in respect of forestry land improvements effected by that taxpayer or by any previous owner of the land. The effect of this provision is shown in the example that follows.

The subsection further provides that the expenditure must be of benefit to the business in the income year a deduction is being claimed, meaning that land improvements that have subsequently been written-off or become redundant (e.g., subsided road or dry bore) will not be eligible for the deduction. Note that the land improvement does not have to actually be used in a particular income year to be of benefit to the business, an example being a fire protection water reservoir from which water is not actually drawn. The benefit of the reservoir is its potential use.

### Deduction - Lessee Forester

Subsection (3) is a similar provision to subsection (2) but applies to taxpayers who do not own the land on which they undertake their forestry business. However, such taxpayers are allowed a deduction only in respect of expendiyure incurred by that taxpayer.

The effect of the subsection is that foresters who lease their land cannot claim deductions in respect of land improvements effected by the owner or past owners of the land.

### Amount of Deduction

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that the amount of any deduction allowed under subsection (2) or (3) shall be an amount equal to the percentage specified in the Thirteenth Schedule (5 percent or 10 percent depending on the type of expenditure) of the "diminished value" of the expenditure.

_**Subsection (1)**_ defines "diminished value" as being in relation to any income year, an amount of expenditure reduced by:

1.  every deduction allowed to any taxpayer in any preceding income year in relation to that expenditure;
2.  every deduction allowed in that income year (other than any deduction allowed under section 128B) to any taxpayer.

The effect of section 128B is demonstrated by the following example

**Example**

*   Forester A spends, in the 1989 income year, $10,000 on constructing an access road and $5,000 on clearing scrub from a previously undeveloped block.
*   In the 1991 income year forester B buys the land.
*   In the 1993 income year the road is washed away in a flood.

The income tax accounts of forester A and forester B could be expected to show the following details:

| FORESTER A |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expenditure | Opening Balance | Section 127 Deduction | Deductible Excess | Section 128A Deduction | Closing Balance |
| 1989 Return |     |     |     | (5%) |     |

| Scrub Clearance - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 5,000 | 3,750 | 1,250 | 63  | 1,187 |
| 1990 Return |     |     |     |     |     |

| B Block | 1,128 (Sold 10.10.92) | Nil | Nil | Nil |     |
| FORESTER B |     |     |     |     |     |
| Expenditure | Opening Balance | Section 127 Deduction | Deductible Excess | Section 128A Deduction | Closing Balance |
| 1991 Return |     |     |     | (5%) |     |
| Access Road |     |     |     |     |     |
| \-B Block | 2,257 (purchased 10.10.92) |     | 2,257 | 112 | 2,145 |
| Scrub Clearance - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 1,128 (purchased 10.10.92) |     | 1,128 | 56  | 1,072 |
| 1992 Return |     |     |     |     |     |
| Access Road - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 2,145 | \-  | 2,145 | 107 | 2,038 |
| Scrub Clearance - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 1,072 | \-  | 1,072 | 53  | 1,019 |
| 1993 Return |     |     |     |     |     |
| Access Road - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B block | 2,038 | \-  | 2,038 | 101 | Nil |
|     |     |     |     |     | (written off) |
| Scrub Clearance - |     |     |     |     |     |
| B Block | 1,019 | \-  | 1,019 | 50  | 969 |

It can be seen from the preceding example that the new treatment of forestry development expenditure is in the nature of a depreciation regime on a diminishing value basis. Additional features of the new basis of treatment are:

*   Any deductions allowed under any other provision must be deducted from the expenditure before calculating the "depreciation".
*   When the land improvement is sold the purchaser continues to claim "depreciation" (on the unexpired portion of the vendor's book value of the land improvements) at the same rate that would have applied to the vendor had the sale not been made.
*   The purchaser is entitled to a full deduction in the year of purchase (i.e. no apportionment is made regardless of when in the income year the purchase takes place).
*   There is no recovery of excess deductions on sale (i.e., it is of no consequence what the improvements were sold for).
*   There is no additional deduction in respect of the loss incurred when an improvement is written-off.
*   A full deduction is allowed in the year an improvement is written-off (i.e., the deduction is not apportioned in that year).
*   The improvement must be of benefit to the business in the income year (one day is sufficient).

### 5\. Summary of Forestry Changes

The following charts summarises the effects of the phasing out of the old forestry provisions and the enactment of the replacement provisions.

| A: EXISTING FOREST |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income Year | Development Expenditure | Planting and Tree Maintenance Expenditure | Administrative and Other Similar Expenditure |
| 1987-1997 | Deductible - 100% | Deductible - 100% | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - Nil | Capitalised - Nil |     |
| 1998 | Deductible - Nil | Deductible - Nil | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 100% | Capitalised - 100% |     |

Applies to expenditure incurred in forests planted on or before 31 December 1986 where land was owned or leased on or before 12 December 1985.

| B: NEW FOREST |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income Year | Development Expenditure | Planting and Tree Maintenance Expenditure | Administrative and Other Similar Expenditure |
| 1987 | Deductible - 100% | Deductible - 100% | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - Nil | Capitalised - Nil |     |
| 1998 | Deductible - 90% \* | Deductible - 90% \* | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 10% | Capitalised - 10% |     |
| 1989 | Deductible - 75% | Deductible - 75% \* | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 25% | Capitalised - 25% |     |
| 1990 | Deductible - 55% | Deductible - 55% \* | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 45% | Capitalised - 45% |     |
| 1991 | Deductible - 30% | Deductible - 30% \* | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 70% | Capitalised - 70% |     |
| 1992-7 | Deductible - Nil | Deductible - Nil | Deductible - 100% |
|     | Depreciable - 100% | Depreciable - 100% |     |

*   100 percent if subject to binding contract entered onto on or before 12 December 1985.
*   Applies to expenditure incurred in forest planted after 31 December 1986 or purchased after 12 December 1985.

In both examples:

"Depreciable" means deductible at the rate specified in the Thirteenth Schedule, e.g., 1991 income year - $10,000 spent on access track (new forest)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Deductible | \- $ 3,000 |
| Depreciable | \- $ 7,000 x 5 percent = $3,500 |

"Capitalised" means the deduction must be capitalised to a "cost of forest" account and deducted in the year income is derived from the forest.

### 6\. Administrative Amendments

A number of decisions made as a result of the Consultative Committee proposals are not reflected in the legislative amendments but are more administrative policy divisions. The following is a Summary of those divisions.

### _Operation of Cost of Forest Accounts_

Cost of forest accounts may be operated in the following ways:

1.  Stand by stand basis (each stand of trees has its own cost of forest account).
2.  Annual planting basis (each year's total plantings has its own cost of forest account).
3.  Total forest basis (a single cost of forest account - available only where the taxpayer has 40 hectares or less of total forest plantings).

Revenue from Thinnings

The total balance in the appropriate cost of forest account may be deducted in full from any revenue from thinnings for up to the twelfth year after planting. After that time the costs must be apportioned according to the amount of forest thinned and the extent of the thinning operation.

For example, if after the twelfth income year of planting one-quarter of an annual planting is thinned to the extent of one tree in three being removed, the following formula should be applied to determine the costs that can be deducted from the thinnings revenue:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cost of bush balance | x   | one third |
| 4   |

### _Debris Clearance Following Harvest_

The cost of clearing the land of debris remaining after a forest is felled can be offset against the income from the forest concerned, with any excess capitalised to the cost of forest account for the subsequent forest (if any).

### 7\. Farm Forestry

Section 14 of the Amendment Act inserts a replacement section 134 of the principal Act which allows a current year deduction for forestry planting and maintenance expenditure incurred by farmers.

Under the old section 134 the deduction was limited to expenditure in relation to trees planted for shelter or erosion control purposes. The deduction is now extended to all trees planted on land on which the taxpayer undertakes a farming or agricultural business. The deduction is however limited to $7,500 in any one income year with the balance being:

1.  depreciable under section 128A in respect of trees planted for other than timber production (i.e., shelter or erosion control plantings)
2.  capitalised to a cost of forest account in respect of forest plantings.

_**Subsection (1)**_ of the replacement section 134 permits the deduction in respect of planting and maintenance expenditure on farm plantings but provides that the farming or agricultural business must be the principal business undertaken on the land for the section to apply.

_**Subsection (2)**_ phases-out the complete deduction allowed under the old section 134 so that for the 1991 income year and subsequent income years only the first $7,500 of planting and maintenance expenditure will be deductible in the year incurred.

The following phase-out is provided:

| Income Year Ending 31 March | Percentage of Expenditure Deductible |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1987 | 100 |
| 1988 | 90  |
| 1989 | 75  |
| 1990 | 55  |
| 1991 | 30  |
| 1992 | up to $7,500 |

**Subsection (3)** provides that -

During the period of phase-out the greater of $7,500 or the specified percentage of expenditure incurred can be deducted. For example if in both the 1988 and 1990 income years a farmer incurs $10,000 of qualifying expenditure, the following deduction would be allowed:

*   1988 income year - $9,000
*   1990 income year - $7,500

**Subsection (4)** is a further transitional provision which allows for an additional ten years (up to and including the 1997 income year) of complete deductibility where the expenditure is incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 12 December 1985.

**Subsection (5**) is the normal accounting year provision.

Part VI - Other Primary Sector Provisions
-----------------------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

Part I of the Amendment Act contains two provisions affecting the primary sector which are an addition to the livestock, farm development expenditure and forestry provisions.

They are:

*   Section 13 - Amendments to Section 129
*   Section 15 - Amendments to Section 188A

### 2\. Amendments to Section 129

Section 13 of the Amendment Act gives effect to the announcement on the 12 December 1985 that farmers and foresters would be exempted from the interest and development expenditure recovery provisions of sections 129 of the principal Act.

An additional exemption is inserted in subsection (9) of section 129 to provide that land (or assets) used by the taxpayer primarily and principally in the carrying on of a farming, agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, aquacultural, or forestry business will be exempted from the recovery provision if the land is sold after 12 December 1985.

It should be noted that the legislation exempts sales of land or other assets that have been used by the owner, or by the owner and any other person, primarily and principally in the carrying on of a farming, agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, aquacultural or forestry business. It does not require the taxpayer to be engaged in any such business within any set period prior to the sale. However, it is necessary for the owner to have been engaged in one or more of these businesses on that land at some previous time.

The means that an owner who leases land for use by some other person in the carrying on of, for example, a farming business will not be eligible for the exemption unless that owner has at some time actually carried on one of the specified businesses on that land. The leasing of land does not itself constitute the carrying on of any of those businesses.

For example, if a private company that has always leased land to the principal shareholder and that shareholder has always farmed that land, the private company will not be eligible for the exemption on the sale of that land.

The "stepping stone farmer" provision (section 129(5)) is also amended. That provision exempts the sale of a farm where a replacement farm is purchased within twelve months of that sale and retained for ten years. The provision has now been amended so that the original sale will not be subject to the recovery provisions if the replacement farm is sold after 12 December 1985 but within ten years of purchase.

Subsection (1) of section 13 contains the amendment to the "stepping stone farmer" provisions.

Subsection (2) of section 13 contains the exemption for farmers and foresters.

### 3\. Amendments to Section 188A

Section 15 of the Amendment Act gives effect to the announcement that the $10,000 loss containment provisions of section 188A of the principal Act will no longer apply to farming, horticultural, viticultural and aquacultural activities.

The exemption is achieved by adding a proviso to subsection (7) of section 188A stating that the subsection will not apply to losses incurred in the 1987 or subsequent income years in the conduct of any of specified activities (a) to (h) listed in section 188A(1).

The effect of this amendment is that losses incurred in such activities in the 1987 and subsequent income years can be offset without limit against income from other sources. However, losses incurred in previous income years are still subject to the $10,000 per annum maximum offset.

Part VII - Other Provisions
---------------------------

### Section 17 - Information Requisitions - New Section 21A

Section 17 of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 21A in the principal Act. This provision is intended to enhance the Commissioner's information gathering powers in relation to expenditure incurred to persons outside New Zealand. This purpose is achieved by making the deduction for the expenditure dependent on the supply of information to the Commissioner.

It was apparent from investigations into film partnerships that non-recourse finance was used to make large payments to entities offshore, usually in tax haven countries. In some instances the offshore entity was associated with the lender and the lender may actually have received the loan back. Payment for intangible benefits, such as advertising, marketing, management fees, royalties, and licence fees, were of particular concern to the Department. It is very difficult for the Department to examine the nature, timing and amount of these payments because of the taxpayer's efforts to keep the details secret. If the Department can obtain details of the payment made it can challenge the deductibility of such expenditure on one or more grounds, including transfer pricing. This provision is intended to assist the Commissioner to obtain information necessary to assess the merits of a claim to deduct payments to an offshore entity.

### Basic Scheme of Section

Where a taxpayer makes a payment offshore and the Commissioner issues an information requisition under section IV of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 concerning that payment then:

1.  if the taxpayer fails to respond to the requisition within 90 days of the mailing of the requisition the Commissioner may disallow the deduction claimed by the taxpayer in respect of the offshore payment, or
2.  if the taxpayer does respond within 90 days of the mailing of the requisition then the only evidence that is admissible in any proceedings under Part III of the principal Act is evidence that is provided in the person's response to the requisition or that is in the possession of the Commissioner when the requisition was given to the taxpayer.

This provision is intended to encourage taxpayers to be more forthcoming in their responses to requisitions from the Commissioner. Also it has the effect of placing a manageable time frame on any investigation in this area because of the 90 day maximum. This will counter the potential to delay an investigation which might otherwise be exploited by taxpayers.

It is envisaged that following a series of questions the Department will finally get to the essential point at issue and will be able to make a more informed decision as to the deductibility of the expenditure incurred.

### Detailed Explanation of Section

### _Subsection (1)_

Subsection (1) is the interpretation subsection.

"Assessment" is given an extended meaning and includes:

*   a determination of loss:
*   a determination of loss carried forward:
*   a determination of a tax credit.

"Information requisition" means a written notice from the Commissioner to a person, informing the person that the Commissioner is acting pursuant to the powers conferred on him by section 17 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 and requiring the person to furnish in writing any information or produce for inspection any books or documents or verify by statutory declaration any information or particulars specified in the notice.

A request under section 17 is not required to be in writing but, for the purposes of section 21A, an information requisition must be in writing.

"Offshore Payment" means an amount of expenditure or loss incurred or purportedly incurred by a taxpayer on or after 1 August 1986 to:

*   a person outside New Zealand, or
*   a person associated with or acting in a fiduciary capacity in relation to a person outside New Zealand, or
*   a person in New Zealand who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may in consequence of the expenditure or loss incurred by the taxpayer make a payment to a person outside New Zealand (or to another person who may make a payment to a person outside New Zealand and so on until a payment to a person outside New Zealand is eventually made).

### _Subsection (2) - 90 Day Rule_

Subsection (2) provides that where the Commissioner gives an information requisition to any person and the requisition concerns a deduction claimed by a taxpayer in respect of an offshore payment then the Commissioner may disallow, in the course of making any assessment, the deduction claimed if the person fails to respond to the requisition (as far as it relates to the offshore payment) within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the requisition.

It is important to note that where the requisition was given to a person other than the taxpayer then the Commissioner may only disallow where the person fails to respond to the requisition within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the requisition and the taxpayer also fails to respond to the copy of the requisition (required to be given to the taxpayer under subsection (7) of this section), i.e., there are two conditions that must occur before the Commissioner can disallow under this subsection.

The subsection also provides that where the Commissioner, in the course of making an assessment, disallows a deduction for an offshore payment the assessment (to the extent of the deduction claimed) shall not be disputed in any proceedings under Part III of the principal Act. The disallowance of a deduction cannot be litigated, notwithstanding the inclusion in any notice of objection of any ground to the disallowance of the deduction unless the taxpayer first establishes, in proceedings on an objection, that

1.  the taxpayer responded to the requisition within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the requisition, or
2.  Where the requisition was given to a person other than the taxpayer, that the person responded to the requisition within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the requisition or the taxpayer responded to the copy of the requisition required to be given to the taxpayer under subsection (7) of section 21A within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the requisition.

What this subsection contemplates is that where there is a dispute about whether a person responded to a requisition that dispute can be dealt with as a preliminary point on objection.

### _Subsection (3) - Evidence in Proceedings Limited to Taxpayers Response_

This subsection provides that where a person responds to an information requisition concerning a deduction claimed by a taxpayer in respect of an offshore payment the only evidence admissible in any proceedings under Part III of the Act in which the deduction is in issue, is evidence:

*   provided in the person's response to the requisition, if such evidence can be verified by the Commissioner, or
*   provided to the Commissioner by the taxpayer, if the requisition was given to a person other than the taxpayer, within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the copy of the requisition (required to be given to the taxpayer), if such evidence can be verified by the Commissioner, or
*   which relates to information or material not mentioned in the requisition.

This subsection limits the evidence that may be admissible in any proceedings under Part III of the principal Act concerning a deduction claimed in respect of an offshore payment. The limitation ensures that, in any proceedings in which a deduction concerning an offshore payment is in issue, the taxpayer is estopped from producing further evidence which for some reason he was not prepared to disclose when responding to an information requisition. Therefore, in any proceedings in which the deduction will be decided upon the evidence is limited to that provided by the taxpayer to the Commissioner and any other evidence in the possession of the Commissioner. This subsection encourages a taxpayer to give a full and frank response to a requisition given by the Commissioner. Failure to do so would limit the evidence available to the taxpayer in any Part III proceedings.

### _Subsection (4) - Admissibility of further evidence gained by Commissioner_

This subsection ensures that where the Commissioner discovers evidence which may refute the evidence supplied in response to an information requisition, that evidence may be adduced in the proceedings and is not made inadmissible by subsection (3). This subsection recognises that the Commissioner is not in the same position as the taxpayer. The taxpayer who claims the deduction for the offshore payment has all the necessary information to justify the claim. The Commissioner must rely on his investigating ability in order to verify the deductibility of the claim. In certain cases the Commissioner may obtain evidence from a taxpayer which the taxpayer failed to disclose or from a source other than the taxpayer. It is this kind of evidence which this subsection will permit the commissioner to adduce notwithstanding the limitations in subsection (3).

### _Subsection (5) - Notice to Taxpayer_

This subsection was designed to give the taxpayer advance notice that the Commissioner is going to invoke subsection (3) in litigation.

The subsection provides that subsection (3) does not apply unless the Commissioner informs the taxpayer that he considers that the taxpayer (or person to whom the requisition was given) has not furnished sufficient information or material to sustain the deduction claimed by the taxpayer in respect of an offshore payment referred to in the information requisition.

If the Commissioner considers that insufficient information or material has been supplied and therefore intends to invoke subsection (3) then he must:

*   by a separate written notice;
*   issued prior to or contemporaneously with a notice of assessment:
    *   inform the taxpayer that he (the Commissioner) considers that the taxpayer (or person to whom the information requisition was given) has not furnished sufficient information or material to sustain the deduction claimed in respect of an offshore payment referred to in the information requisition.

This is a statutory duty placed on the Commissioner. Failure to comply with the duty will nullify the provisions in subsection (3) of the section. Care must be taken by the Commissioner to ensure that the exact requirements set out in the subsection are followed.

Subsection (3) limits the evidence that may be admissible in any proceedings under Part III of the Act. It does not disallow the deduction claimed by the taxpayer for an offshore payment as subsection (2) does. This subsection is primarily concerned with increasing the Commissioner's information gathering function and is complementary to, rather than a substitute for, section 104 of the Act or any other deductions provision.

Under section 104 a taxpayer must establish that the amount claimed is deductible and if the Commissioner, after considering the information and material supplied by a taxpayer, decides that any amount claimed as a deduction by a taxpayer is not deductible, he may disallow the deduction under section 104. In such a case a notice under subsection (5) of section 21A is not required.

### _Subsection (6) - Agents and Partners_

This subsection is self explanatory. For the purposes of the section, any information requisition and any notice given pursuant to subsection (7) of the section by the Commissioner to:

*   an agent for a partnership: or
*   a partner in a partnership,

shall be deemed to be given by the Commissioner to every partner in the partnership.

This provision recognises the reality for the Commissioner when dealing with partnerships. Usually the Commissioner corresponds with either an agent for the partnership or the managing partner. This subsection will save both time and unnecessary expense for the Commissioner in dealing with partnerships.

### _Subsection (7) - Copy of Requisition to Taxpayer_

This subsection provides that a copy of any information requisition given under subsection (2) or (3) of the section, if the requisition was given to a person other than the taxpayer, shall be given to the taxpayer.

This ensures that the taxpayer 15 aware that an information requisition has been sent to another person. The taxpayer can then supply to the Commissioner any information sought in the requisition and so avoid the consequences attendant on an insufficient response by the recipient of the requisition.

The subsection also provides that, for the purposes of section 21C of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974, every copy of a requisition shall be deemed to be a notice required to be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer. Section 21C provides that any notice required to be given by the Commissioner to any person may be -

1.  Given to him personally; or
2.  Sent to him by post addressed to him at his usual or last known place of abode or business; or
3.  Given personally to any other person authorised to act on behalf of that person; or
4.  Sent to that other person by post addressed to him at his usual or last known place of abode or business.

Note that the information requisition itself, which is a separate notice from the copy, is a notice in terms of the definition of "notice" in section 2 of the Income Tax Act.

### _Subsection (8) - Inadequate Response_

This subsection ensures that inadequate responses to information requisitions will not suffice as a response for the purposes of section 21A. A response which is inadequate is deemed not to be a response for the purposes of the section. An inadequate response may well result in the Commissioner invoking subsection (2) and the deduction claimed will be disallowed.

**Application Date**

This section shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1985 and in every subsequent year. Note, however, that an offshore payment means, inter alia, an amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986. Therefore, in relation to the 1986 income year, this section effectively applies only to those taxpayers with balance dates between 1 August 1986 and 30 September 1986 who happened to incur an offshore payment between those dates. In relation to the 1987 income year offshore payments made after 1 August 1986 are subject to section 21A.

### Section 18 - Rates to be fixed by Annual Taxing Act

_**Subsection (1)**_ amends section 39(1) of the Act to provide that the rates of income tax need not be fixed in specific Acts passed by Parliament for that purpose, but can be fixed annually by Income Tax Amendment Acts. (Note that urgent refunds are to be determined using the income tax rates that exist at the time.)

_**Subsection (2)**_ amends the definition of annual taxing Act in section 2 of the Act so that the sections of an Income Tax Amendment Act which change the rates of income tax are deemed to be the annual taxing Act.

### Section 19 - Principal Income Earner Rebate

### _Subsection (1)_

This section amends the Principal Income Earner Rebate (PIER) provisions contained in section 50B of the principal Act.

The amendment is necessary to prevent persons who receive an income-tested benefit or specified war pension from claiming an amount of PIER or family rebate over and above the amount that would have been their entitlement but for the taxation of benefits from 1 October 1986.

The phase-out provisions of the PIER and family rebate prevent any person who was not a taxpayer in the period 1 April 1986 to 30 September 1986 from claiming a rebate for the 1986/87 income year. This means that a person who received an income-tested benefit or specified war pension and derived no other taxable income during the first six months of that income year commenced to be a taxpayer from 1 October and therefore had no rebate entitlement.

However, where such a person derived a small amount of income during the first six months, the qualification criteria for the PIER and family rebate are satisfied. Furthermore, because of the PAYE deductions attributed to the benefit income, large rebate entitlements result. Such entitlements are inflated through the income tax deductions relating to the post-1 October period and would be in addition to the family support entitlement for that period.

In order to allow a rebate only to the extent to which it relates to tax attributable to the pre-1 October 1986 period, a new proviso is added to restrict the amount of the rebate claimed by any taxpayer who received an income-tested benefit or specified war pension, to the difference between the tax assessed and the PAYE deductions made from the benefit or war pension payments.

**Example:** Income returned for year ended 31 March 1987

| Income |     | PAYE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benefit (after 1.10.86) | $5,458.18 | $814.58 |
| Employment (before 1.10.86) | $200 | $25.10 |
|     | $5,658.18 | $839.68 |

Tax Calculated

Tax on $5,658.18 equals $981.05

Rebate Limit

The rebate is limited to the difference between tax assessed ($981.05) and PAYE deductions from benefit income ($814.58) equals ($981.05 $814.58 =) $166.47.

Even though the rebate calculated under normal rules is $240.47 (= $5,658.18 x 0.0425), only $166.47 should be allowed.

This results in a refund of $25.70 being the PAYE deductions on the employment income.

### _Subsection (2)_

This is the application subsection and provides for the rebate limitation contained in subsection (1) of this section to apply in respect of the 1986/87 income year only.

### Section 20 - Transitional Tax Allowance

This section amends the provisions of the transitional tax allowance which under section 50C of the principal Act is claimable as a tax rebate.

_**Subsection (1)**_ expands the qualifying criteria for the transitional tax allowance by amending the definition of "full time earner" contained in section 50C(1) of the principal Act, to include persons who are engaged in remunerative work for at least 20 hours a week. Previously only persons engaged in remunerative work for at least 30 hours a week were deemed to be full time workers, and therefore eligible for the transitional tax allowance.

_**Subsection (2)**_ determines when a taxpayer who qualifies for the transitional tax allowance, because of the new definition of "full time earner" (i.e., they work between 30 and 20 hours a week), will be able to receive the transitional tax allowance on a pay-period basis. These persons will first be able to have the tax code "T" apply against their income:

1.  after they have delivered a tax code certificate, or tax code declaration to their employer, or
2.  after the 15th of December 1986,

\- whichever is the later.

Tax code "T" will continue to apply against the income of the qualifying taxpayer until:

1.  the date on which that tax code ceases to apply to the taxpayer (i.e., the qualifying criteria are no longer met), or
2.  before the 31st of March 1987, (when they are required to furnish a new tax code certificate or tax code declaration)

\- whichever is the earlier.

_**Subsection (3)**_ provides that subsection (1) of this section shall apply from 1 April 1986. Those taxpayers who qualify for the transitional tax allowance because of the expanded criteria can therefore claim, in their end of year tax return (1987). the rebate as if they had been eligible from 1 October 1986.

_**Subsection (4)**_ provides that subsection (2) of this section shall come into force on 15 December 1986, which is the first day from which newly qualifying taxpayers are able to receive the transitional tax allowance through reduced PAYE deductions.

### Section 21 - Family Rebate

This section limits the amount of the Family Rebate which can be claimed by any taxpayer who received an income-tested benefit or specified war pension to the difference between the tax assessed and the PAYE deductions made from the benefit or war pension payments.

This provision restricts the amount of Family Rebate which may be claimed in the same way as section 19 restricts the Principal Income Earner Rebate entitlement. (Refer to the commentary on that section for an example ).

The restrictions apply only for the 1986/87 income year after which the Family Rebate and PIER cease to exist.

### Section 22 - Incomes Wholly Exempt From Income Tax

This section amends section 61 of the principal Act by:

1.  removing the reference to the "Cook Islands" from subsections (9) and (48) of that section. The reference to "Niue" remains.
2.  making exempt from income tax Jurors' and Witnesses' fees (other than expert witnesses fees) paid by the Crown on or after the 13 October 1986.

### _Subsections (1) and (2)_

The effect of this amendment is to repeal certain New Zealand income tax concessions relating to companies registered in New Zealand and deriving income from the Cook Islands. These concessions were introduced at the time when there were no facilities in the Cook Islands for company registration and Cook Islands companies were required to incorporate in New Zealand. The concessions are no longer required as the Cook Islands Companies Act 1970 now renders it unnecessary to register Cook Islands companies in New Zealand.

These subsections will apply with effect from the income year which commences 1 April 1987.

### _Subsection (3) - Juror's and Witnesses' Fees_

This subsection inserts a new subsection (55) to section 61 of the principal Act. The new subsection exempts from income tax income derived by any person from:

1.  Juror's fees paid by the Crown, and
2.  Fees paid by the Crown to witnesses, other than expert witnesses.

The exemption will apply only to fees paid on or after 13 October 1986. Fees paid by the Crown to expert witnesses will still remain taxable. To coincide with this amendment, amendments have been made to:

1.  Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (Amendment No. 5). The amendment (1986/298) removes jurors' and witnesses' fees from liability for deduction of withholding tax effective from 13 October 1986.
2.  The Witnesses and Interpreters Fees Regulations 1974, (Amendment No. 3). This amendment (1986/296) reduces fees payable to witnesses from 13 October 1986 to the net of withholding tax payable prior to that date. Fees payable to expert witnesses will remain at the same level as these will remain taxable.
3.  The Jury Rules 1982, (Amendment No. 3). This amendment (1986/297) reduces the fees payable to jurors from 13 October 1986 to the net of withholding tax levels payable prior to that date.

This subsection will apply with respect to the tax on income derived on or after 1 October 1986.

### Section 23: Niue Development Projects

Section 23 substitutes a new section 62 in the principal Act and continues the exemption from tax of New Zealand companies deriving income from development projects in Niue.

This section authorises the Governor-General to declare, by Order in Council, to be a development project any business or enterprise which is entered wholly or principally for the purpose of developing Niue or will be of importance in such development.

### Section 24 - Items Included in Assessable Income

This section amends section 65 of the principal Act by substituting and inserting a new subsection (1B). The purpose of this amendment is to correct a drafting point to make it clear that one-off gratuitous payments made to spouses or relatives of deceased employees are non-taxable.

Section 65(1B) was inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1985. Its purpose was to treat as taxable income ex-gratia payments made voluntarily to ex-employees or relatives of ex-employees to make good any loss in the real value of pension payments.

However, an inadvertent effect of the amendment was to make taxable ex-gratia payments made to spouses or relatives of an employee upon the death of that employee. These payments have never been taxable in the past because they are not income of the surviving spouse or of the deceased employee.

As it was not the intention of the 1985 amendment to bring within the taxation net such payments, an amendment was necessary to restore the previous position.

This section will apply to payments received on or after 23 March 1985, the application date of the 1985 amendment.

### Section 25 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees

This section amends section 68 of the principal Act to enable redundancy payments made to seasonal workers to come within the provisions of the section and therefore receive the concessional tax treatment.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts two new definitions to section 68.

"Season" defines for the purposes of any employment or service what shall be regarded as a season or seasonal for the purposes of the section. It means any continuous period of employment or service of less than 12 months, where the Commissioner having regard to the circumstances and nature of the type of business, is of the opinion that the employment or service is a normal period of employment or service for that business.

An example of the type of employment which comes within the definition is that of freezing workers where the normal employment or service is for a period of less than 12 months.

"Year of Service" defines for the purposes of seasonal employment any 12 month period where a taxpayer has been employed for a period of not less than one season.

This definition has the effect of allowing the "specified sum" formula to apply to seasonal employment by counting each full season to be a year of service in the same manner as normal employment.

_**Subsection (2)**_ repeals and substitutes a new subsection (4) to section 68. This subsection provides, for the purpose of section 68, where -

1.  Any taxpayer has ceased to be employed by reason of redundancy or loss of office or employment, or other similar circumstances or
2.  Any taxpayer is unable to be re-employed in any seasonal employment by reason of circumstances, that had they resulted in a cessation of the seasonal employment would have been circumstances where the taxpayer would have ceased to be employed by reason of redundancy or loss of office or employment or other similar circumstances:

that any lump sum payment made by way of redundancy by reason of the above is deemed to be a retiring allowance and therefore qualify for the concessional treatment as long as the other provisions of the section are met.

The new subsection removes the requirement that only redundancy payments made "on the occasion of" the termination of employment qualify for the concession. It will enable redundancy payments made subsequent to the termination of a seasonal worker's employment to qualify for the concession. It will also ensure that employees who ceased in a previous season and who have not been re-employed in the current season because their Jobs have been made redundant will be eligible for the concession.

_**Subsection (3)**_ is a consequential amendment.

_**Subsection (4)**_ is the application section. The amendment shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the first day of April 1986 and every subsequent year.

### EXAMPLE

Joe Smith is employed by a freezing works company. For the past 8 years when killing season has re-commenced Joe has been re-employed and has worked for the season. Joe Smith has worked approximately six months of each year and is made redundant after five months of his ninth season at the works.

As the normal period of employment for Joe Smith is the complete season of approximately six months each period employed is deemed to be a "season" for the purposes of section 68. The "years of service" are then calculated on the number of "seasons" that have been worked. In Joe's case 8 years of service have been worked.

**Calculation of taxable income**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Total redundancy pay | $20,000 |
| Specified sum |     |
| (Average remuneration for the last three years of service) 8/10 x $30,000 |
| $24,000 |
| Taxable: |     |
| 5% of redundancy payment | $1,000 |

### Section 26 - Power to Exempt Expenditure on Account of an Employee

Section 26 introduces a new section 73A into the principal Act giving the Commissioner the power to determine the extent to which certain amounts of expenditure on account of an employee may be exempted from income tax.

Under the section 2 definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" where an employee incurs expenditure but the actual payment of that expenditure is discharged by the employer that amount is deemed to be assessable to the employee as monetary remuneration. The purpose of introducing the new section is to allow the Commissioner to exempt from income tax that expenditure on account of an employee that relates to the income earning process.

**For example:**

1.  Where an employee travels on business and books into a hotel in his own name and the account is paid by the employer.
2.  Where an employee orders equipment, say of $300, that she will use whilst working, and the employer pays the amount charged.

Under the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" such amounts would be assessable to the employee as monetary remuneration. Section 73A eliminates this problem by introducing a test, which if satisfied, enables the Commissioner to exempt such amounts from being assessable to the employee.

Section 73A provides that if the employee had paid the amounts owing, rather than the employer, and would have been deemed incurred in gaining or producing of assessable income then such amounts would be exempt from income tax in the hands of the employee.

Included within section 73A are the words "the Commissioner may from time to time determine". This does not mean that the commissioner will be required to make an individual determination every time an employer discharges a debt incurred by an employee. Provided that the expenditure was incurred by the employee in the gaining or producing of his/her assessable income then that amount will be exempted under section 73A. It is a general determination rather than specific to any one case. However, where the Commissioner is not satisfied that the expenditure was incurred in respect of the employment or service of the employee such amounts will remain taxable to the employee as monetary remuneration.

The new section refers to expenditure which if paid by the employee would have been deemed to have been incurred in the gaining or producing of the employees assessable income. This does not limit the exemption to amount which would have been deductible if the employee had discharged the debt. To illustrate this point refer back to example (ii) above. If the employee had paid for the equipment $300 would have been incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income but only $250 would have been deductible because of the restrictions of section 105 and the Fourth Schedule.

This new section has application as from 1 April 1985, being the date from which the definition of the term "expenditure on account of an employee" had application.

### Section 27 - Supplementary Depreciation Allowance for Plant and Machinery Used in Two and Three Shift Industries

This section amends section 113A of the principal Act and is simply a machinery amendment to make it clear that the supplementary allowance can be claimed in year one, in addition to years two to five, for qualifying plant and machinery in cases where the first year depreciation allowance cannot now be claimed because of the latter's repeal.

The supplementary allowance is an additional rate of 3 percent d.v. or 6 percent d.v. for plant and machinery used for 2 shift or 3 shift operations respectively and is allowable in the 2nd to 5th years of the plant's use. In the first year the higher rates of first year depreciation allowance substitute for all other depreciation allowances.

The first year depreciation allowance for new or second hand plant and machinery (section 112(2)(a) or (b) of the Act) was terminated with effect from Budget night, 31 July 1986 - for further information refer to the publication on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1986. As a result of the removal of the first year depreciation allowance multi-shift businesses were put at a disadvantage as the supplementary allowance could not be claimed in year one.

This amendment rectifies the position.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts the word "first" into paragraph (a) of subsection (4) of section 113A. The effect is to allow the supplementary allowance for the first income year in which the plant and machinery is used in the production of assessable income. This is subject to the proviso inserted by subsection 2.

_**Subsection (2)**_ adds a proviso to subsection (4) of section 113A. This provides that no deduction of the supplementary allowance shall be allowed in the first income year in any case where the first year depreciation allowance is allowable under section 112(2)(a) or (b) of the Act.

_**Subsection (3)**_ is the application section.

In order to coincide with the removal of the first year depreciation allowance effective from 31 July 1986 the amendment applies from the income year which commenced 1 April 1985 (1986 income year). This will enable taxpayers with late 1986 balance dates, falling after 31 July, repeal date, and who purchase any qualifying plant and machinery after that date, to claim the supplementary depreciation allowance.

### Section 28 - Revised Assessments Where Assets Sold After Deduction of Depreciation Allowances

This section amends section 117 of the principal Act to allow a deduction against depreciation recovered on the disposal of an asset for the costs attributable to the disposal.

Section 117 of the Act provides that where the Commissioner has allowed a deduction for depreciation in respect of any asset and the asset is sold or disposed of for a price or consideration in excess of its written down value, the assessable income of the taxpayer is increased by the amount of the depreciation recovered on the sale.

The section does not provide for the costs of sale of the asset (for example, commission on sale, auctioneer's fees) to be deducted from the sale price in calculating the amount of the profit on sale. Under the present legislation the costs of sale are incurred in the sale of a capital asset and are not deductible in determining any profit or loss on sale.

The amendment to section 117 effectively enables the amount of depreciation recovered to be reduced by the costs incurred in selling the asset. This follows normal commercial and accounting practice.

_**Subsection (1)**_ removes the words "at a price or" from subsection (1) of section 117. This removes any reference to the term "price" in favour of the term "consideration".

_**Subsection (2)**_ amends subsection (5) of section 117 by adding a new sub paragraph (a) which defines the term "consideration" as being the consideration received on the disposal or sale of an asset reduced by any amount paid or payable by the person in respect of selling or disposing of the asset.

**Note** This amendment allows costs of sale of an asset to be deducted against the sale price only in cases involving depreciation recovered. Such costs are capital losses and remain non-deductible against assessable income. Where the costs of sale exceed the difference between cost and book value the depreciation recovered is nil and no further deduction for the costs of sale are allowed. Where the asset is sold for less than book value the loss on sale may be deducted in accordance with the provisions of section 108, but the costs of sale are non-deductible.

**Example(i) - Profit on sale**

|     |     | $   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost price ofs aset |     | $9,000 |
| Written down value |     | 5,760 |
| Sale Price | 6,500 |     |
| less costs of sale | 600 | 5,900 |
| Depreciation recovered |     | $140 |

**Example (ii) - Loss on Sale**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost price of asset | $9,000 |
| Written down value | 5,760 |
| Sale Price | 5,500 |
| Loss on Sale | $260 |

_**Subsection (3)**_

This amendment applies in respect of any asset sold or disposed of in the income year commencing 1 April 1986 (1987 tax returns) and every subsequent year.

### Section 29 - Accounting for the Income Tax Implications of GST - New Section 140B

**1.1**

This section introduces a new section (section 140B) which comes into effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1986.

**Basic Principles**

The basic principles which need to be understood in relation to the income tax treatment of GST are:

*   Where GST incurred is not allowable as a deduction for GST purposes then the GST which has been paid is a real cost in the incurring of the expenditure of the business. For income tax purposes the legislation recognises a deduction for the cost of GST.
*   Conversely, where GST incurred is allowable as a deduction for GST purposes then that GST is not a real cost for income tax purposes and therefore no deduction is allowable against the business expenditure.

Note that the above principles apply irrespective of whether the expenditure is on account of revenue or capital.

GST charged on taxable supplies made is not business income of the taxpayer as the GST is collected by the taxpayer effectively as agent for the Crown.

**Presentation of Accounts**

Having regard to the above basic principles, taxpayers may furnish accounts based on either a GST-inclusive basis or a GST-exclusive basis, either approach is acceptable - as the same result is achieved, by making certain adjustments at the end of the year. This is discussed in 1.8. For persons registered for GST purposes, GST is generally neither assessable nor deductible for income tax purposes. Specifically:

1.  "Output tax" charged on supplies (including sales of assets), made by the taxpayer is not assessable (refer section 140B(2)(a)).
    *   "Output tax" is defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as the tax chargeable on supplies of goods and services made by a registered person in the course of a taxable activity.
    *   Output tax charged in relation to the sale or other disposition of a capital asset is not included in the "consideration" for the sale, etc., for the purposes of section 117 of the Income Tax Act (refer section 140B(7)(a)).
2.  Any refunds of GST from the Commissioner to the taxpayer are not assessable (refer section 140B(2)(b)).
3.  "Input tax" charged on purchases made by the taxpayer is not deductible for income tax purposes; either as expenditure incurred or by way-of depreciation (refer section 140B(3)(a) and (6)(a)).
    *   "Input tax" is defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as being GST charged on goods and services acquired by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 140B(1)(b) extends the meaning of this term for income tax purposes to include imported goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.
    *   "Taxable supplies" can only be made in the course of a taxable activity by a taxpayer who is registered for GST purposes. Therefore, any taxpayer conducting a GST-exempt activity can use GST-inclusive costs when determining deductions for income tax purposes. This is because the GST they have incurred is not defined as "input tax". This applies also to a small-scale business activity which is not registered for GST purposes (because their turnover is below the threshold of $24,000 per annum).
4.  Any payments of GST to the Commissioner are not deductible (refer section 140B(3)(b)).

**Exceptions to the General Rule**

**1.2**

Notwithstanding the above, there are three situations where GST is deductible or assessable for taxpayers who are registered for GST purposes:

### _(i) Section 21(1) Adjustments for Private/Exempt Use_

Section 21(1) of the GST Act applies where goods and services were purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (and a full input tax deduction thereby allowed), are subsequently applied partially for private or GST-exempt purposes. Upon this subsequent application a GST taxable supply is deemed to occur.

**Exempt Use Adjustment**

Where the section 21(1) adjustment arises as a result of the partial use of a business purchase for generating GST-exempt supplies, the output tax arising from that use will generally be fully deductible for income tax purposes (refer section 140B(4)(a)).

Where both the taxable activity and the activity that generates the GST-exempt supplies are assessable for income tax purposes, a full deduction is allowed for income tax purposes of the output tax arising from the section 21(1) adjustment. This is because a full income tax. deduction (either for expenditure incurred or by way of depreciation) is allowed in respect of the expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing the goods and services so applied.

To illustrate, where a car acquired by a bank is mainly used by its travel agency (i.e., for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies) and is also used to a minor extent for providing financial services (exempt supplies), there is an ongoing adjustment under section 21(1) to recognise that partial GST-exempt use. As the provision of financial services is assessable for income tax purposes, the output tax payable under section 21(1) is deductible for income tax purposes. This deduction is made in the income year in which the output tax is charged.

**Example:**

Car acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost (GST-inclusive) | $22,000 |
| Input Tax deduction |     |
| claimed | $ 2,000 |
| Net cost for depreciation |     |
| purposes | $20,000 |

Car used 25 percent for the purpose of making GST-exempt supplies:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $20,000 (GST-exclusive value) x 13.33% (straight line depn) | x   | 25% (exempt use) |
| 6 (number return periods per annum) |

\= $111.08 deemed supply x 10% = $11.11

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Section 21(1) output tax adjustment per GST return | $11.11 |
| Total output tax in income year (6 GST returns) | $66.66 |
| Deductible for income tax purposes | $66.66 |

NB Where the GST-exempt activity is not assessable for income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed in respect of the output tax liability arising under section 21(1) (refer section 140B(4)(c) and (d)).

### Private Use Adjustment

Where the section 21(1) adjustment has arisen as a result of the private use of a business purchase, the output tax arising from that private use will not be deductible for income tax purposes (refer section 140B(4)(c) and (g)). This is because the expenditure incurred in the acquisition of those goods and services would not have been deductible to the extent of that private use for income tax purposes.

### (ii) Section 21(3) Fringe Benefit Tax Adjustment

Output tax is payable under section 21(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act on supplies to employees subject to fringe benefit tax. However, output tax is not charged on fringe benefits that are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST and on fringe benefits provided in the course of a GST-exempt activity.

The output tax payable under section 21(3) is generally deductible for income tax purposes (refer section 140B(4)(a)). A full deduction is allowed provided the expenditure incurred in providing those fringe benefits is itself taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the taxpayer (refer section 140B(4)(c) and (d)).

**Example:**

Details from a trading bank's FBT return (the bank's business includes a travel agency):

| Details from FBT return | Fringe Benefits\* | s. 21(3) Value | Output tax Payable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Motor Vehicles (25% relates to travel agency, 75% to exempt) | $4,400 | $l,100 | $100 |
| Other Benefits: |     |     |     |
| Overseas trip (zero-rated) | $3,600 | \-  | \-  |
| Low interest loan (exempt supply) | $20,000 | \-  | \-  |
| Subscription for travel agency employee | $ 110 | $ 110 | $ 10 |
|     | $28,110 | $1,210 | $110 |

*   Amount to be claimed in income tax return $110
*   FBT is based upon GST inclusive amounts
*   \*Note that the values of fringe benefits upon which the FBT is calculated are always based upon GST-inclusive amounts. This applies irrespective of whether an input tax deduction is allowed.

### (iii) Section 21(5) Adjustment for Taxable Use of Principally Private/Exempt Asset

For GST purposes, where goods and services are acquired other than for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies no deduction of the GST incurred is allowed, as it is not defined as "input tax". Where such goods and services are also partially used for the of making taxable supplies section 21(5) of the GST Act allows a deduction to recognise taxable activity content of the GST incurred on the purchase of those goods and services for which no GST deduction was originally been allowed.

Where such a deduction (21(5)) for GST purposes is allowed, that amount is generally assessable for income tax purposes (refer section 140B(4)(b)). Where income from the taxable activity of the taxpayer is assessable for income tax purposes the GST deduction is fully assessable. The GST deduction is included in the assessable income of the taxpayer in the year in which it is allowed.

**Example:**

Car used by bank 25% of time for travel agency, balance of time used for banking operations, i.e., acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost (GST-inclusive) | $22,000 |
| GST incurred but not claimed (not "input tax") | $ 2,000 |
| Cost for depreciation purposes | $22,000 |

Car used 25% for the purpose of making GST-taxable supplies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Section 21(5) GST adjustment per GST return | $11.11 |
| Total GST adjustments; in income year (6 GST returns) | $66.66 |
| Assessable for income tax purposes | $66.66 |

Where income from the taxable activity is not assessable for income tax purposes (e.g., non-commercial sales by a charity). the section 21(5) adjustment for GST purposes is not assessable to the taxpayer.

### 1.3 Capital Assets and Depreciation

For income tax purposes, assets are depreciated on the cost price less any input tax deduction claimed (refer section 140B(6)(a)). Thus an asset acquired principally for making taxable supplies is depreciated on the cost price exclusive of GST. In contrast, an asset acquired by a taxpayer other than for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (but nevertheless for the purpose of producing assessable income) is depreciated on the cost price including GST; as no deduction of GST will have been allowed. This is because the GST incurred would not be defined as input tax.

When an asset is sold or otherwise disposed of, section 117 of the Income Tax Act requires the total capital cost of an asset at purchase to be determined. This expenditure is to be exclusive of any input tax incurred (refer section 140B(7)(b)). Remember that if the GST incurred on the capital expenditure is not "input tax" then the total capital cost will include that GST.

### (i) Section 21(1) Adjustment: Permanent Change in Principal Use

Generally, any adjustment which arises from the operation of section 21(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act is deductible and requires no change to be made to the cost price or book value of a depreciable asset for income tax purposes.

However, where a section 21(1) adjustment arises from a permanent change in the principal use of an asset, the opening book value is increased in the year of adjustment by the amount of output tax charged (refer section 140B(6)(b)). This is instead of the income tax deduction of the output tax that would otherwise be allowed (refer section 140B(4)(f)).

To illustrate, a car is acquired by a bank mainly for the use of its travel agency (i.e., for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies), and is subsequently used principally for providing financial services (i.e., for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies). At the time of this change in the principal use of the asset a one-off adjustment is made under section 21(1). The resulting output tax liability will be added to the opening book value of the asset in the income year the liability arises. Where the liability arises in the first year that depreciation is allowed, the output tax is added to the cost price of the asset.

**Example:**

Car acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies:

Any ongoing output tax adjustments made under section 21(1) for the exempt use of this car until the time of the principal use changeover, are deducted for income tax purposes in those years (refer 1.2(i)). Any ongoing GST deductions made under section 21(5) to recognise any taxable use after the changeover will generally be assessable for income tax purposes in the year the GST deduction is made (refer 1.2(iii)).

### Section 21(5) Adjustment: Permanent Change in Principal Use

Generally, any ongoing adjustment which arises from the operation of section 21(5) of the GST Act is assessable and requires no change to be made to the cost price or book value of a depreciable asset.

However, where a section 21(5) adjustment arises from a permanent change in the principal use of an asset, the book value is decreased in the year of adjustment by the amount of the GST deduction claimed and depreciated accordingly (refer section 140B(6)(a) and section 140B(4)(e)). This is instead of the assessment of the GST deduction that would otherwise be required.

To illustrate, a car is acquired by a bank mainly for use in generating financial services (i.e., for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies), and is subsequently used principally by the bank's travel agency (i.e., for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies). At the time of this change in the principal use of the asset, a one-off adjustment is made under section 21(5). The resulting GST deduction will be deducted from the opening book value of the asset in the income year the GST deduction is given. Where the GST deduction is made in the first year that depreciation is allowed, the cost price of the asset is reduced by the amount of that deduction.

**Example**:

Car acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost (GST-inclusive) | $22,000 |     |
| Input Tax deduction | $ 2,000 |     |
| Net cost for depreciation purposes | $20,000 |     |
| Year | Book Value | Depreciation |
| 1   | $20,000 | $4,000 |
| 2   | $16,000 | $3,200 |
| 3 (Principal Use Changeover) | $12,800 |     |

In year three, the principal use of the car changes to that of making GST-exempt supplies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Consideration set at lesser of cost of car or open market value of a similar supply at time of changeover | $16,500 |
| Section 21(1) output tax adjustment | $ l,500 |
| Opening book value in the year of transfer | $12,800 |
| add one-off section 21(1) adjustment | $ 1,500 |
| New opening book value | $14,300 |

Any ongoing GST deductions made under section 21(5) for the taxable use of this car until the time of the principal use changeover are assessable for income tax purposes in those years (refer 1.2(iii)). Any ongoing output tax adjustments made under section 21(1) to recognise any exempt use after the changeover may be deductible for income tax purposes in the year the output tax is charged (refer 1.2(i)).

### 1.4 Insurance Receipts

In most cases, fire and general insurance payments received by a registered person are subject to GST. In such cases, that GST component (i.e., one-eleventh of the insurance receipt) is ignored for the purposes of subsections 117(7) and (8) of the Income Tax Act (refer section 140B(7)(d)).

### 1.5 Valuation of Trading Stock

**Registered Persons**

Section 140B(5)(a) deems "cost price" and "price" in relation to trading stock (including livestock and replacement trading stock) to exclude any input tax deduction claimed. Further, determination to the "average market value", "market selling value", and "market value" will not include GST where GST would have been charged if the taxpayer had made the supply (refer section 140B(5)(b)).

The above applies for the purposes of sections 85(4), 86, 86A, 86B, 86C, 86D, 86H and 88 of the Income Tax Act.

**Non Registered Persons**

Non-registered persons and those conducting exempt activities will, of course, not be in a position to claim an input tax deduction in respect of the GST incurred on the purchase of trading stock, etc., and therefore will value trading stock inclusive of GST charged.

### 1.6 Calculation of Export Market Development and Tourist Promotion Expenditure Incentive (section 156F)

This incentive is claimed on the basis of "prescribed outgoings" exclusive of any "input tax" which is claimed for GST purposes (refer section 140B(8)). Note that the majority of the "prescribed outgoings" will in any case not have GST charged on them as they will relate to costs incurred overseas.

### 1.7 **Dividends**

Dividends deemed to be made pursuant to sections 4(1) or 4(2) of the Income Tax Act are to be valued on GST inclusive amounts where appropriate. This is not covered by the new section 140B but is necessary in determining the income tax liability of a registered person.

For example, where a company asset is given to a shareholder, the value of that asset for the purposes of calculating the dividend distribution would include any GST charged on the supply of that asset.

A further example is where a proprietary company pays one of its shareholder's rates bill of $1,100 (including GST). The deemed dividend made to the shareholder pursuant to section 4(2) is $1,100.

### 1.8 Preparing Accounts for Taxation Purposes - Registered Persons

There are two methods of preparing accounts for income tax purposes for a person who is registered for GST purposes. Both are equally acceptable as they will achieve the same assessable income figure.

The first method is to prepare accounts completely excluding GST, except for the deductible/assessable adjustments which arise from the operation of section 21 of the GST Act. This method complies with the NZ Society of Accountant's SSAP 18.

The second method is to record revenue and expenditure on a GST-inclusive basis and adjust in the accounts by including refunds of GST from the Department as revenue and GST payable to the Department as expenditure in the profit and loss account. The adjustment made must exclude GST in respect of capital and non-assessable or non-deductible items. Where a GST return period spans the balance date a calculation will have to be made of GST payable to/refundable from the Department in respect of the period from the previously furnished GST return to the balance date.

**Example:**

A company has sales (including GST) of $110,000 inputs (including GST) of $33,000 and wages of $40,000. In that income year fringe benefits with a value of $11,000 are provided, and plant costing $22,000 (including GST) is purchased. Some of the company's assets are applied to a minor degree for making GST-exempt supplies and ongoing output tax adjustments totalling $1,200 are made in that year pursuant to section 21(1) of the GST Act.

_**(i) GST-Exclusive Accounts**_

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sales |     | $100,000 |
| Expenditure: |     |     |
| Inputs | $30,000 |     |
| Wages | $40,000 |     |
|     |     |     |
| Depreciation of plant (10% of $20,000) | $2,000 |     |
| Deductible output tax (relating to GST-exempt use)- Section 21(3) | $1,000 |     |
| \- Section 21(1) | $1,200 |     |
|     | $74,200 |     |
| Net Profit |     | $25,800 |

_**(ii) GST-Inclusive Accounts**_

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sales |     | $110,000 |
| Expenditure: |     |     |
| Inputs | $33,000 |     |
| Wages | $40,000 |     |
| Depreciation of plant (10% of $20,000) | $ 2,000 |     |
| GST payable\* | $ 9,200 |     |
|     | $84,200 |     |
| Net Profit |     | $25,800 |

**\*GST payable is calculated as follows:**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output tax: 1/11 x $110,000 | $10,000 |     |
| Section 21(1) | $1,200 |     |
| Section 21(3) | $ 1,000 |     |
|     | $12,200 |     |
| Input Tax:  <br>1/11 x $33,000 | $3,000 |     |
| 1/11 x $22,000 | $2,000 |     |
|     | $5,000 |     |
|     |     | $7,200 |
| GST payable to the IRD Amount to be included in accounts needs to be adjusted for capital and non-assessable items: add input credit in respect of plant |     | $2,000 |
| Amount to put in accounts |     | $9,200 |

Section 30 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees
-----------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 152 of the principal Act and is an amendment consequential to that made to section 68 - refer to section 25 of this Amendment Act. Section 152 governs the deductibility of retiring allowances and redundancy payments in calculating the assessable income of employers making such payments.

_**Subsection (1)**_ inserts a new subsection (2) to section 152. This subsection is virtually a repeat of the new subsection (4) to section 68 of the Act (as repealed and substituted by section 25 of this Amendment Act - refer to that section for commentary). The amendment ensures that the employer is allowed a deduction for the lump sum payment made to any employee or in the case of seasonal workers, former employees.

_**Subsection (2)**_ is a necessary drafting amendment.

_**Subsection (3)**_ is the application section and states that the amendment will apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1986 and every subsequent year.

Section 31 - Export-Market Development and Tourist-Promotion Incentive
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 31 amends section 156F of the principal Act to exclude from the export-market development expenditure and tourist-promotion expenditure tax incentives credit, any expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1986, in relation to the Republic of South Africa. Provision is made for any such expenditure incurred on or after 1 December 1986 under a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986 to qualify under the section.

The amendment is a result of the October 1985 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which agreed to implement certain measures against the Republic of South Africa, and the Review meeting held in London from 3-5 August 1986 which recommended certain economic measures.

The effect of the amendment is to exclude a taxpayer from claiming a tax credit for any export-market development expenditure, where that expenditure is incurred on or after l December 1986 in respect of the promotion of exports of goods or services to South Africa. Similarly, a taxpayer will not be able to claim a tax credit for any tourist-promotion expenditure, where that expenditure is incurred on or after 1 December 1986 relating to New Zealand tourist promotion in relation to the South African market.

Where either expenditure is incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986 that expenditure will still qualify for the tax credit.

_**Subsection (1)**_ is a necessary drafting measure.

_**Subsection (2)**_ amends the definition of the term "export-market development expenditure" by adding a new paragraph (g). This paragraph excludes from the definition any outgoings incurred on or after 1 December 1986 in relation to the Republic of South Africa.

The proviso provides that where the Commissioner is satisfied that outgoings are incurred in relation to South Africa on or after 1 December 1986 pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986, those outgoings are deemed to have been incurred prior to 1 December 1986 and therefore will qualify for the tax credit.

_**Subsection (3)**_ is a necessary drafting measure.

_**Subsection (4)**_ amends the definition of the term "tourist-promotion expenditure" by adding a new paragraph (c). This paragraph excludes from the definition outgoings incurred on or after 1 December 1986 for the purpose of attracting tourists to New Zealand from the Republic of South Africa.

The proviso contains the transitional provisions for outgoings subject to a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986.

**Section 32 - Export-Market Development Activities Incentive for Self-Employed Taxpayers**

Section 32 amends section 156G of the principal Act to exclude export-market development activities (value of time) incurred by a self-employed taxpayer on or after 1 December 1986 in relation to the Republic of South Africa.

As with section 26 this amendment results from the decisions made by the Commonwealth Heads of Government. It will mean that a self-employed taxpayer cannot claim a tax credit for any export-market development activities performed on or after 1 December 1986, other than any performed pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or before 18 August 1986, where that expenditure is in respect of the promotion of export of goods or services to the Republic of South Africa.

**Section 33 - State-owned enterprises, energy trading operators and harbour boards**

_**Subsection (1)**_ of this section inserts 3 new sections into the Income Tax Act:

*   Section 197B - State-owned enterprises
*   Section 197C - Energy trading operators
*   Section 197D - Harbour boards

This gives effect to the Government's policy that the above organisations are to be subject to income tax as separate entities.

### A. State Owned Enterprises - Section 197

Section 197B deals with companies and corporations owned or controlled by the Crown or any person acting for the Crown. The section excludes a state-owned enterprise, or any subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, as an associated person with, or as a member of a group of companies that includes, -

1.  Any other state-owned enterprise,
2.  Any subsidiary of another state-owned enterprise.

The effect of this provision is illustrated in the following example:

![A flowchart showing the effect of the s.197 provision on State Owned Enterprises](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/b/ab9f8480413b573e83e0e3fe04fb91e3/flowchart-vol-162-soe-small.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203136&hash=893807D793489B4E46A48C973B786F92)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/5/c52b8e00413b541783b0e3fe04fb91e3/flowchart-vol-162-soe-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203135&hash=2AA1716DD62FDCE524A352503B37D077 "This link will open a new window.")

In this example SOE 1 with its chain of subsidiaries and SOE 2 with its chain of subsidiaries would, in the absence of s. 197B, be a group of companies under s. 191 by virtue of their common shareholder, the Minister of Finance. Section 197B prevents SOE. 1 and SOE. 2 being considered a group of companies or associated persons. The treatment of a single SOE and its chain of subsidiaries is not affected by this provision. They remain a group of companies and associated persons.

Note that for the purposes of section 191 of the Income Tax Act section 197B took effect from the commencement of section 191 (i.e., 1 April 1977). This prevents any possibility, however academic, of two or more SOEs claiming to be a group of companies in relation to any income year prior to 1 April 1987.

### B. Energy Trading Operators - Section 197C

**Section 197C** deals with local authorities that supply energy to other persons.

_**Subsection (1)**_ provides that section 197C shall apply notwithstanding any other provision in the Income Tax Act.

_**Subsection (2)**_ defines certain terms used in section 197C. A "consumer contribution" (an expression used in section 197C(9)) is any contribution made by a consumer, or a prospective consumer or any other person, toward costs incurred by a local authority in respect of any asset installed by the local authority for use in connection with the supply of energy.

"Energy" is electricity, gas, liquid, geothermal activity, or coal for use as energy or a source of energy (but not for other uses).

The two classes of local authorities subject to this legislation are "energy supply authorities" and "specified local authorities"

An "energy supply authority" is a local authority, the principal purpose of which is the supply of energy (for example an electric power board or an electric power and gas board).

A "specified local authority" is any local authority (except an "energy supply authority" or a harbour board) that supplies "energy" to any other person, but does not include a local authority that derives less than $100,000 per annum gross income from the supply of energy. The $100,000 limit is intended to exclude local authorities that derive a small amount of income from energy produced, for example, in a cogeneration plant.

Section 197C refers generally to "energy trading operators". An "energy trading operator" is -

*   An "energy supply authority"; or
*   A "specified local authority" in its capacity as a supplier of energy (for example a city council, with a municipal electricity department, in its capacity as a supplier of energy).

**Section 197C(3)** states which local authorities the legislation applies to; i.e., "energy supply authorities" and "specified local authorities".

**Section 197C(4)** contains a series of deeming provisions.

**Section 197C(4)(a)** deems an "energy trading operator" to be a company. It also deems shares in the deemed company to be held by the elected members of the local authority in their collective capacity as such. That is, the elected power board or the elected city council holds the shares in the deemed company. An energy trading operator will therefore be able to carry forward losses under section 188 regardless of any change in the Councillors comprising a Council.

**Section 197C(4)(b)** deems any activity or undertaking carried on by an "energy trading operator" to be a business activity. This is intended to ensure that an "energy trading operator" will be subject to income tax on its financial surplus in the same way a private sector taxpayer is taxable on its profits, and that the "energy trading operator's" assessable income is calculated in the same way as taxable business profits.

**Section 197C(4)(c)** deems an "energy trading operator" that is not an "energy supply authority" to be a person separate from every local authority. That is, a city council in its capacity as a supplier of energy is not, for income tax purposes, the same person as that same city council in its capacity as a transport operator. Thus, if a city council's municipal electricity department supplies energy to the city council's transport department it is, for income tax purposes, supplying the energy to a shareholder in the deemed company that is the energy trading operator.

**Section 197C(4)(d)** deems an energy trading operator not to be a local authority. The chief effect of this is that the energy trading operator will not get the benefit of the income tax exemption provided in section 61(2) of the principal Act for local authorities.

**Section 197C(5)** provides that any activity or undertaking that is carried on by a "specified local authority", if it is an activity of a type carried on by an "energy supply operator", is deemed to be carried on by the specified local authority in its capacity as a supplier of energy (that is, the activity is subject to income tax). The proviso to section 197C(5), however, provides an exception: if the activity is not carried on in connection with the supply of energy it is not subject to income tax.

Thus, if a city council contracts out the use of excess computer capacity from its municipal electricity department, that activity is a taxable part of its activities as a supplier of energy. However, if the same city council contracts out the use of excess computer capacity from its treasury department, that will not be a taxable activity.

**Section 197C(6)** provides that, notwithstanding the proviso to section 197C(5) (discussed above), the following activities are deemed to be carried on by a local authority in its capacity as a supplier of energy (if it is a supplier of energy):

*   Sales, installation and servicing of appliances etc.
*   Energy generation, extraction etc.

**Section 197C(7)** contains a series of deeming provisions relating to the income of "energy trading operators". Section 197C(7)(a) provides that any income derived from the investment of funds that have arisen -

1.  From the "energy trading operator's" activities and whether before or after the commencement of taxation, or
2.  Otherwise as assessable income of the "energy trading operator" (e.g. investment income)

is to be included in the assessable income of the "energy trading operator". This section effectively applies to "specified local authorities" - if the surplus funds of a "specified local authority's" MED are invested and managed by the "specified local authority's" treasury department the income relating to those surplus funds is included in the "specified local authority's" assessable income from the supply of energy.

**Section 197C(7)(b)** provides an exception to section 197C(7)(a). To the extent that a "specified local authority" derives income from the investment of funds that have been passed by the deemed "energy trading operator" company to the "specified local authority" as a virtual distribution of profits, that income is not taxable. This would require some documentation of the passing of funds from the deemed company to the local authority.

**Section 197C(7)(c)** includes in an "energy trading operator's" assessable income any income from any sinking fund in relation to the debt or assets of the energy trading operator.

**Section 197C(7)(d)** provides that rates levied by an "energy trading operator" are exempt from income tax except to the extent that the rate is levied to meet any tax-deductible expenditure of the "energy trading operator".

**Section 197C(8)** prevents the Commissioner from treating any company, the shares in which are held by an "energy trading operator", as a member of a group of companies with the "energy trading operator" if the activities of the company are not integral to the activities of the energy trading operator. This will prevent the provisions of section 191 of the principal Act, which relate to loss offsets among companies in a group, from applying in such cases.

**Section 197C(9)** deals with "consumer contributions" and Rural Electrical Reticulation Council (RERC) subsidies under section 45(1) or Section 45(5)(a) of the Electricity Act 1968. Any "consumer contribution" or RERC subsidy received in relation to an uneconomic supply, and the related expenditure, is to be dealt with in terms of section 169 of the principal Act. This means that the "capital contribution" and the RERC subsidy will be deducted from the expenditure and only the balance will be allowed as a tax deduction or as a basis for depreciation.

**Section 197C(10) and (11)** deal with mergers of "energy trading operators" where the merger is not effected by way of a sale and purchase or similar agreement. For the purposes of the principal Act the new "energy trading operator" is deemed to have done all things that were done, and to have suffered all things that were suffered, by its predecessors. This will ensure that the assets (including depreciable assets and trading stock) and liabilities of the predecessor "energy trading operators" are brought to account by the new "energy trading operator" at book value, that the new "energy trading operator" must meet any liability of the predecessor "energy trading operators" under the principal Act and that it will have the rights of objection that its predecessors would have had. This legislation is necessary because in some cases a merger of "energy supply authorities" in the accepted commercial sense is not possible (there may be no owner to buy an "energy supply authority" from).

A merger of "energy trading operators" effected by way of a sale and purchase or similar agreement will be subject to the same treatment as any similar merger of private sector companies.

**Section 197C(12)** deals with assets of a "specified local authority". It provides that transfers of assets from energy supply use to other uses, and vice versa, shall be brought to account by the specified local authority for income tax purposes at market value. This accords with the generally accepted view of the income tax treatment of transfers of assets from one business of a taxpayer to another business of the same taxpayer.

**Section 197C(13)** provides that, subject to subsection (14), any asset owned by an "energy trading operator" at the commencement of section 197C is to be brought to account for income tax depreciation purposes at tax written-down book value based on the historical cost of the asset.

**Section 197C(14)** allows the Commissioner to determine an appropriate book value in cases where the cost price of an energy trading operator's asset cannot be ascertained.

**Section 197C(15)** provides that section 197C shall apply from the commencement of the 1987/88 income tax year. For all known "energy trading operators" this is the year commencing on 1 April 1987.

### C. Harbour Boards - Section 197D

**Section 197D** deals with the taxation of harbour boards.

For the purposes of section 197D a "harbour board" means a harbour board constituted in the manner prescribed in section 15(2) of the Harbours Act 1950. These are the separately constituted harbour boards, and they currently do not include the Crown in its capacity as a harbour board or any territorial local authority in its capacity as a harbour board.

**Section 197D(3)** contains two deeming provisions. Section 197D(3)(a) deems a harbour board to be a company. It also deems shares in the deemed company to be held by the elected members of the local authority in their collective capacity as such. That is, the elected harbour board holds the shares in the deemed company. This provision ensures that a harbour board can carry forward losses under section 188, notwithstanding changes in the members comprising the harbour board.

**Section 197D(3)(b)** deems any activity or undertaking carried on by a harbour board to be a business activity. This is intended to ensure that a harbour board will be subject to income tax on its financial surplus in the same way a private sector taxpayer is taxable on its profits, and that the harbour board's assessable income is calculated in the same way as taxable business profits. It will also ensure that all receipts and all expenditure and losses of a harbour board will be included in the calculation of its assessable income, subject to any specific provisions of the Income Tax Act.

**Section 197D(4)** contains a series of deeming provisions relating to the income of harbour boards.

**Section 197D(4)(a)** includes in a harbour board's assessable income any income from any sinking fund in relation to its debt or assets.

**Section 197D(4)(b)** provides that rates levied by a harbour board are exempt from income tax except to the extent that the rate is levied to meet any tax-deductible expenditure of the harbour board.

**Section 197D(5)** provides that any asset owned by a harbour board at the commencement of taxation is to be brought to account for income tax depreciation purposes at tax written-down book value based on the historical cost of the asset.

**Section 197D(6)** allows the Commissioner to determine on appropriate book value in cases where the cost price of a harbour board's assets cannot be ascertained.

**Section 197D(7)** provides that section 197D shall apply from the beginning of the harbour boards' 1987/88 income tax year. For all known harbour boards this is the year commencing 1 October 1987.

**Subsections (2) and (3) of section 33** of the Amendment Act amend section 67(2) of the Income Tax Act by adding two new paragraphs which exclude state-owned enterprises and harbour boards from the income tax exemption for local and public authorities.

_**Subsection (2)**_, which applies to state-owned enterprises, has effect from 1 April 1987. _**Subsection (3)**_ is consequential upon the new section 197D (harbour boards) and has effect from the same date as section 197D.

_**Subsection (4)**_ adds a new Fourteenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

The Fourteenth Schedule is referred to in section 197B(2) and lists the "state-owned enterprises" for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Other state-owned enterprises may be added to the list from time to time.

### Files

The income tax files of all state-owned enterprises, energy trading operators, and harbour boards will be held on the Special Companies Section in Wellington District Office. All income tax returns and related correspondence should be referred to that Section.

### _Section 34 - Insurance effected with persons not carrying on business in New Zealand_

Section 34 amends section 209 of the Income Tax Act to ensure that any insurance premium or any other payment that is a reimbursement of an insurance premium paid to any person not carrying on business in New Zealand by -

1.  any person resident in New Zealand, or
2.  any person not resident in New Zealand in respect of assets or risks situated in New Zealand,

is subject to tax in terms of section 209.

The purpose of the amendment is primarily to ensure that section 209 applies to insurance premiums or reimbursements of insurance premiums paid to non-residents in respect of assets or risks situated in New Zealand. However, the amendment also clarifies the application of section 209 in relation to insurance premiums paid offshore by persons resident in New Zealand.

Examples of some situations which would be covered by section 209 are:

1.  A branch of a non-resident company makes reimbursing payments to its head office. Included in the payments is a reimbursement of a charge for premiums paid to a non-resident insurer in respect of the branch's assets in New Zealand. The reimbursement of the insurance premium is subject to tax under section 209.
2.  Insurance premiums or reimbursements of insurance premiums paid to non-resident insurers in respect of assets used in New Zealand by non-resident contractors operating here.
3.  Insurance premiums paid to non-resident insurers by a New Zealand resident company in respect of assets situated overseas owned by that company.
4.  Insurance premiums paid on goods exported from New Zealand on a c.i.f. quotation or imported into New Zealand f.o.b.

### Section 35

### _Special Partnerships_

A special partnership is formed under Part II of the Partnership Act 1908 and consists of two types of partners, special and general partners.

*   **Special partners** are not permitted to take an active part in the business operation and are only liable for partnership debts to the extent of the capital they are required to contribute.
*   **General partners** are treated in the same way as partners in ordinary partnerships in that they are jointly and severally responsible for any debt of the partnership.

The general partner carries on the business activity of the partnership while the special partners contribute, to the common stock, specific sums in money as capital.

The main differences between a special partnership and an ordinary partnership are as follows:

*   a general partner is the only partner that is liable for the partnership debts and is also the only one that can contract on behalf of the partnership.
*   the special partnership can have more than 25 members.
*   it may only operate for a maximum period of 7 years (however the partnership can continue to operate by re-registering in the High Court, on the expiration of the 7 year period or any shorter period).

### _Advantages of a Special Partnership_

Special partners essentially enjoy a limited liability status and when combined with a general partner which may be a limited liability company this gives the special partnership the same protection as to liability that a limited liability company enjoys. The limited liability enables the investors to invest their money in high risk ventures, e.g., film making, mussel farming, horticulture, horse-breeding, yacht-building, exporting and importing businesses, yet not be liable for any debt of the partnership in excess of the capital contributed. Prior to this amendment special partnerships also enjoyed certain tax advantages over other kinds of investment vehicle. These advantages are graphically demonstrated when comparing a special partnership with a limited liability company:

1.  The assessable income of the business is only taxed once, i.e., in the hands of the partners, whereas a company's taxable income is taxed twice; first as the company's income and second as the shareholder's income in the form of dividends.
2.  The losses were deductible by the individual partners against income derived from other sources, thus reducing their tax liability. If a company makes a loss the shareholders do not gain such a benefit.
3.  The partners could claim deductions for expenditure incurred by the partnership in excess of their capital contribution.

A taxpayer on the maximum marginal tax rate wishing to reduce his tax liability found joining special partnerships most attractive. The special partnership structure allowed investment in high risk ventures solely to obtain a tax loss. The knowledge that their own financial loss would be no greater than the amount of capital introduced and that they may obtain a tax saving encouraged taxpayers to form special partnerships. The type of ventures entered into by special partnerships tend to take at least three to four years before a profit is made. In the interim period the investor got a return for his investment in the form of tax losses, such losses being offset against his other income and subsequently reducing his taxation liability.

### _The Amendment_

In the 1986 Budget the Minister of Finance announced that the Income Tax Act was to be amended to remove the taxation advantages for investors in special partnerships. A brief overview of the new regime is as follows:

1.  The losses of a special partnership are to be contained within the partnership and expenditure comprising the loss will not be deductible from other income of the individual partners,
2.  The losses may be set off in future income years against any profit made by the partnership,
3.  The carry-forward of losses will be subject to a 40 percent common-ownership test,
4.  The new regime will apply to the partners in any partnership:
    *   registered on or after 1 August 1986.
    *   registered prior to 1 August 1986 where that partnership obtains additional capital after that date from any source, other than capital obtained:
5.  from any partner who was committed to provide further capital to the partnership in instalments; or
6.  prior to 1 April 1987 which was required to meet any commitment involving the incurring of expenditure by the partnership under an unconditional contract entered into before 1 August 1986 by the general partner and notwithstanding any change in the composition of the special partnership.
    *   formed in any other country under legislation similar to Part II of the Partnership Act.

### _An Analysis of Section 35:_

*   Subsection (1) introduces a new section (section 211B) into the Income Tax Act.
*   Subsection (2) provides the application date for the new regime.

**New section 211B** is divided into 13 subsections.

Subsection (1) defines certain terms for the purposes of this section.

Subsection (2) stipulates the special partnerships to which the section will apply.

Subsection (3) provides that no deduction shall be allowed and no income shall be derived by the partners from the partnership if it sustains a loss.

Subsection (4) provides for the loss carry forward and the loss offset.

Subsection (5) provides that the loss offset must be in the order that losses were incurred.

Subsection (6) sets out the 40 percent common holding test.

Subsection (7) ensures that to the extent that any income of a partnership is reduced by any loss the partners will not be taxable on that income.

Subsection (8) covers the situation where there is cancellation or remission of a debt which has been taken into account in calculating any partnership loss which has been carried forward.

Subsection (9) provides that should a special partnership later repay a remitted or cancelled debt a deduction to the partners is allowed in the income year in which the payment is made.

Subsection (10) sets out for the purposes of subsection (8) the circumstances in which a debt is deemed to have been remitted or cancelled.

Subsection (11) authorises the Commissioner to determine the amount of the partnership loss sustained by the partnership.

Subsection (12) provides that if a special partnership first registered prior to 1 August 1986 is renewed or continued in conformity with the appropriate provision in the Partnership Act then for the purposes of section 211B that renewed partnership is regarded as having been first registered prior 1 August 1986 for the purposes of subsection (2) of the section.

Subsection (13) provides that a reference to an income year shall, where the partnership furnishes a return of income for an accounting year with an annual balance date other than 31 March under Section 15 of the Act be deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year.

Subsection (2) of section 35 is the application section and provides that section 211B shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing on 1 April 1986 and in every subsequent year.

### _Explanation of Section 211B_

### Subsection (1)

Subsection (1) defines the following terms for the purposes of the section:

*   "Additional capital, in relation to a special partnership means -
    *   any capital contributed by a partner:
    *   any capital used, or to be used, for the acquisition of any asset, other than trading stock, for use in the business of the partnership.

Capital is a more expansive term than simply money. For example the introduction by a partner of his property other than money may constitute a capital contribution for the purposes of this section. It is not possible to give a precise test of what actually constitutes a capital contribution. It is a question of mixed law and fact which must be determined taking into account the nature and form of the property contributed and the use or value of that property to the partnership.

This term is important in that a special partnership registered prior to 1 August 1986 is not subject to the new regime unless there is an injection of additional capital from any source on or after 1 August 1986.

"Allowable deduction" means a deduction that is allowable (but for this section) under the provisions of this Act to the partners for any outgoing (a defined term) of the partnership.

The definition takes into account the possibility that one or more of the partners is a non-taxpayer. When deciding whether an outgoing is an allowable deduction it is the nature of the outgoing that is crucial, not the nature of the partner, because the definition treats all partners as if they were taxpayers resident in New Zealand.

"Allowance" means an amount for which a deduction is allowable under this Act other than any amount of expenditure or loss.

An example of an allowance is depreciation. Under section 108 of the Income Tax Act the Commissioner may allow such deduction as he thinks fit for the depreciation of certain assets.

"Income" means the gross income derived by the partners from the business or businesses of the partnership.

For the purposes of this definition gross income is all the items and amounts that under the provisions of the Income Tax Act are included in or are deemed to be income or assessable income. Note that the term "gross" is already a defined term in section 2 of the Income Tax Act and means, in relation to an amount, that amount without any deduction whatsoever from that amount.

"Net income" means the residue of the income of the partnership after deducting the allowable deductions of the partnership.

For the purposes of this definition the terms "income" and "allowable deductions" are defined separately in subsection (1). The net income is calculated as if the partnership were a taxpayer resident in New Zealand incurring the "outgoings" and deriving the "income" of the partners in carrying on the business or the businesses of the partnership.

"Outgoing" means any expenditure, loss, or allowance.

"Partnership loss" means the excess (if any) of the allowable deductions of the partnership for the income year over the income of the partnership for the income year.

This loss is calculated as if the partnership were a taxpayer and resident in New Zealand incurring the outgoings and deriving the income of the partners in carrying on the business or businesses of the partnership. The general nature of a partnership presented some special problems in drafting section 211B. A partnership is a legal relationship between two or more persons and is not a separate entity. Nothing exists apart from the partners and it is the partners who derive the income and incur the outgoings of the partnership. The objective of section 211B, however, is to prevent individual partners from deducting from their other income the expenditure comprising any loss sustained by the partnership. The definitions of "net income" and "partnership loss" therefore require the special partnership to be regarded as deriving the income and incurring the outgoings of the partners for the purposes of calculating the net income or loss of the partnership. It is, of course, only the income derived or the outgoings incurred in carrying on the business or businesses of the partnership that are taken into account.

"Registered", in relation to a special partnership formed in a country or territory outside New Zealand, means registered in that country or territory by a procedure similar or equivalent to the registration of a special partnership under Part II of the Partnership Act 1908.

"Special partnership" means

*   a special partnership registered under Part II of the Partnership Act 1908:
*   an association of persons registered as a special partnership under Part II of the Partnership Act 1908:
*   in relation to any country or territory outside New Zealand, a partnership or an association of persons formed in that country or territory which, if formed in New Zealand, would be registered as a special partnership under Part II of the Partnership Act 1908.

This definition includes an association of persons which although registered as a special partnership may legally not conform with the provisions of Part II of the Partnership Act 1908. This definition does not include associations of persons that never intended to operate as a special partnership. Rather it includes those partnerships which have been registered under Part II of the Partnership Act, but which, because of some technical noncompliance with the provisions of the Partnership Act, may argue that they are not special partnerships and, therefore, are not subject to section 211B.

### _Subsection (2)_

Subsection (2) stipulates which special partnerships are within section 211B.

### New special partnerships

The section applies to all special partnerships registered on or after 1 August 1986 (i.e., the day after the Budget announcement). There is no exception to this stipulation. All new special partnerships are bound by this new section.

### _Existing special partnerships_

The section applies to existing special partnerships (i.e., those special partnerships registered prior to 1 August 1986) where there is an injection of "additional capital" into the partnership from any source on or after 1 August 1986. There are, however, two exceptions to this. The first exception is where the partnership obtains capital

*   from any partner who, prior to 1 August 1986, became committed to provide further capital to the partnership in instalments.

The second exception is where the partnership obtains capital

*   prior to 1 April 1987 in order to meet any commitment involving the incurring of expenditure by the partnership, under an unconditional contract entered into before 1 August 1986 by or on behalf of a general partner acting in the capacity of a general partner for the partnership, notwithstanding any change in the composition of the partnership.

The main points to notice about this subsection are that:

*   If a special partnership is registered on or after 1 August 1986 then that partnership is subject to the new regime in this section.
*   If a special partnership is registered prior 1 August 1986 then -
    *   (a) If there has not been an injection of additional capital into the partnership on or after 1 August 1986 the partners in the partnership follow the tax law as it existed at budget night, i.e., the partners are regarded as deriving the income and incurring the outgoings of the partnership.
    *   (b) If there is an injection of additional capital into the partnership on or after 1 August 1986 from any source whatsoever that partnership will be subject to the new regime. This condition is mitigated by providing that certain injections of additional capital will not cause the partnership to be subject to the new regime. For example, where a partner who joined a partnership prior 1 August 1986 was committed to provide capital to the partnership in annual instalments then when the partner makes his instalment payment after 1 August 1986 that payment will not be regarded as an injection of additional capital. Similarly, if the special partnership needs to incur expenditure due to an unconditional contract that it entered into before 1 August 1986 then the injection of capital to satisfy that requirement does not constitute an injection of additional capital, provided the capital to meet the expenditure is contributed before 1 April 1987.
    *   For the purposes of this subsection a partnership that was first registered prior to 1 August 1986 and which reregisters for a further period is regarded as having been registered prior to 1 August 1986. (see subsection (12)).

### _Subsection (3) - Loss Containments_

Subsection (3) is the operative provision of this new regime. It provides that where a special partnership sustains a partnership loss,

1.  no deduction shall be allowed to any partner for any outgoing (i.e., any expenditure, loss or allowance) of the partnership; and
2.  the partners are deemed not to have derived the income of the partnership.

This subsection is the loss containment provision of the section. Its effect is to deny to the partners in the partnership a deduction for any outgoing of the partnership. It also prevents any item of income of the partnership which would otherwise be derived by a partner from being included in the assessable income of the partner.

It is important to note that this subsection applies only "where in any income year a special partnership sustains a partnership loss". If the special partnership does not sustain a loss then it is not subject to loss containment, (since there is no loss to contain). A special partnership which does not make a loss is treated for tax purposes like any other partnership.

### _Subsection (4) - Loss Carry Forward Provisions_

This subsection provides for the carry forward of special partnership losses and the set off of those losses against subsequent net income of the partnership.

*   The special partnership must first sustain a partnership loss in an income year. (Subsection (11) gives the Commissioner the power to determine the amount of the partnership loss sustained by a partnership);
*   The special partnership is entitled to claim that any partnership loss be carried forward.
*   The loss must be carried forward to the next income year following the year in which the loss was incurred and deducted against the "net income" of the partnership (if any) for that year, so far as that income extends. This provision is similar to that for the carry forward of losses for companies in section 188 of the Income Tax Act 1976.
*   Where the loss cannot be deducted or set off in the next income year or the loss exceeds the net income for that year, then the loss or the excess may be carried forward to the next income year to be deducted from or set off against the net income of the partnership. This process continues until all of the available losses have been deducted or set off.

### _Subsection (5) - Order of Set Off_

This subsection is complementary to subsection (4). It provides that where partnership losses incurred in 2 or more income years are carried forward in accordance with the provisions of this section those losses shall be deducted or set off in the same order as those losses were incurred.

### _Subsection (6) - Common Partners Test_

This subsection provides that a special partnership is not allowed to carry forward the claimed loss unless it conforms to a 40 percent common partners requirement.

If a special partnership claims to carry forward the whole or part of a partnership loss to a later income year the claim shall not be allowed unless the Commissioner is satisfied that, at all times during the period specified in the subsection, not less than 40 percent of the certified capital of the partnership was held directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the same partners.

The specified period is the period commencing with the year of loss and ending with the end of the later income year.

The requirement is that at least 40 percent of the certified capital of the partnership must be held directly or indirectly by or on behalf of the same partners. If a special partnership does not satisfy this requirement then the partnership is not entitled to carry forward its accumulated losses. Partnership losses are never available to be set off against the income of any of the partners.

### _Subsection (7) - Treatment of Partners_

This subsection provides that where a partnership loss is carried forward and subsequently deducted or set off against the net income of the special partnership the partners in the partnership shall be deemed not have derived that income to the extent to which it has been deducted or set off.

This subsection is required because of the nature of a special partnership. Partnerships are merely a relationship between the constituent members and as such are not separate legal entities. So even if a partnership loss was set off against the income of a partnership under section 211B the partners would nonetheless derive the net income of the partnership and be taxable on it. This subsection therefore ensures that the partners do not derive such net income.

### _Subsection (8) - Remission of Debts_

This subsection makes provision to cover the situation where there is a cancellation or remission of a debt which has been taken into account in calculating any loss which has been carried forward. That loss is to be reduced by the amount of the debt remitted or cancelled. The provision explicitly states that, to give effect to the subsection, the Commissioner may at any time, alter any assessment notwithstanding anything in section 25 of the Tax Act. Thus there is no time limit within which the Commissioner may issue an amended assessment making any such adjustment.

### _Subsection (9) - Deduction to Partners_

This subsection is complementary to subsection (8). It provides that where a special partnership pays an amount in respect of a debt to which subsection (8) applies, the amount paid shall be allowed as a deduction to the partners in the income year in which the payment is made. The deduction is allowed to the partners, rather than the partnership, because it is the partners who incur the expenditure.

The deduction is limited to the amount: of the debt to which the payment relates. Thus it excludes any excess that may have been paid in respect of the debt.

This subsection allows a deduction to the partners in the income year in which the payment is made. However it is important to note that this subsection is subject to subsection (3) of this section. This means that if in the income year in which the payment is made the special partnership sustains a partnership loss then the partners' deduction is not available to the partners because if the special partnership sustains a loss then the loss containment provisions of subsection (3) apply. The deduction permitted by this subsection is treated the same as any other outgoing of the partnership where the partnership sustains a partnership loss.

### _Subsection (10) - Remission or Cancellation of Debt_

This subsection is complementary to subsection (8) and describes the circumstances in which a debt is deemed to have been remitted or cancelled:

*   a debt is remitted where the partners are discharged from liability for the debt without fully adequate consideration in money or money's worth;
*   a debt is cancelled where the partners are released from liability by the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, Insolvency Act, the Companies Act or by any deed of composition with the partnership's creditors;
*   a debt is cancelled where it has become irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time.

### _Subsection (11) - Notice of Loss Determination_

This section provides that the Commissioner shall determine the amount of the partnership loss sustained by a special partnership.

The determination of loss by the Commissioner is made where

*   a special partnership has furnished a return in respect of any income year and,
*   the return shows, or purports to show, that the partnership has sustained a partnership loss in the income year; or
*   notwithstanding what the return shows, the Commissioner ascertains that the partnership has sustained a loss.

Any such determination is a determination of loss for the purposes of sections 19 and 29 of the principal Act as if the special partnership were a taxpayer. Hence the Commissioner must issue a notice of determination of loss to a special partnership and the partnership will be able to object to the determination.

### _Subsection (12) - Partnership Renewal_

This subsection applies to any special partnership registered prior 1 August 1986. Where such a partnership is renewed or continued in conformity with section 58 of the Partnership Act 1908 beyond the time originally agreed on for the duration of the partnership the partnership shall be regarded, for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, as having been registered prior 1 August 1986.

This subsection enables a special partnership registered prior 1 August 1986 to continue to be treated as an existing partnership if it is renewed. It is not considered crucial that the partnership maintain the same composition of partners for the purposes of this requirement. However it is important to remember that if the partnership should become subject to the loss containment provisions of this section then the composition of the partners is important (see details of subsection (6) above).

### _Subsection (13) - Balance Dates_

This subsection provides that every reference in this section to an income year shall, when the partnership furnishes a return of income for an accounting year other than 31 March, be deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year.

_**Subsection (2) of Section 35 - Application**_

This is the application provision.

Section 211B shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year commencing 1 April 1986 and in every subsequent year.

1987 Tax Returns for partners in some special partnerships may therefore reflect the new regime set out in section 211B.

### Section 36: Application of Excess Retention Tax

Section 36 amends section 248 of the principal Act to ensure that a New Zealand privately controlled investment company whose income is derived exclusively or principally from the Cook Islands or a company in respect of which an Order in Council has been made under section 62 of the principal Act, is no longer specifically exempt from the application of Part V of the Act.

The amendment is made in conjunction to the amendments in Sections (22) and (23). Part V of the Act imposes excess retention tax upon certain privately controlled investment companies which have made insufficient distributions of income. Section 248 of the Act exempts certain classes of companies in relation to the tax and this clause removes the exemption in respect of income derived exclusively or principally from the Cook Islands or in respect of income for which an Order in Council has been made under section 62 of the Act.

### Section 37 - Value of Fringe Benefit - Subsidised Transport Benefits

Section 37 amends section 336O of the principal Act by substituting subsection (3), the method for valuing subsidised transport benefits provided to employees of transport operators.

Prior to this amendment, which has effect from the quarter commencing 1 April 1987, the value of the benefit was 25 percent of the highest priced fare for that class of travel provided. However, where the employer purchased a fare from another operator for the benefit of an employee that benefit was also valued at 25 percent regardless of the amount that the employer had actually paid for that fare.

This amendment replaces the method of valuing subsidised transport benefits and provides that such benefits are to be valued at the greater of:

*   25 percent of the highest priced fare for that class of travel; or
*   the price paid or payable by the employer for the transportation being provided to the employee.

It is to be noted that this method of valuing only applies to subsidised transport benefits provided to employees of transport operators (as defined in section 336N) and not to benefits provided to employees of travel agents. Travel benefits from travel agents are to be valued in accordance with section 336O(5) at the price paid or payable by the employer for the benefit being provided.

### Section 38 - Regulations - Prescribed Rate of Interest

Section 38 amends section 336W of the principal Act to allow for regulations to set the fringe benefit tax prescribed rate of interest quarterly as opposed to annually.

The prescribed rate of interest is used to calculate the value of low interest loan benefits provided to employees. Where the interest rate applicable to a loan is less than the prescribed rate a liability for fringe benefit tax arises.

Prior to this amendment the prescribed rate of interest could only be set annually with effect from 1 April. If there had been any change to the market interest rates after 1 April there was no means of adjusting that rate to reflect upon that change until the following year. If no change to the rate was made prior to 1 April, the rate applicable to the previous year remained as the prescribed rate until the following 31 March.

This amendment enables the regulations to be made at quarterly intervals to change the prescribed rate to apply for the following quarter. This allows for changes to be made quarterly to reflect upon changes in the market. Where it is considered that no change is necessary the rate applicable to the previous quarter will continue to apply.

The amendment to section 336W requires that any change to the prescribed rate of interest is to be made by regulation at least one month prior to the commencement of the following quarter. This is intended to provide the employers with sufficient time in which to adjust their records to reflect upon the changes made. Once the regulation is made an advertisement will appear in the New Zealand Gazette and the press will be advised. An item will also appear in a public information bulletin and all offices will be advised.

This amendment applies in respect of fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1987. Where a loan was provided to an employee prior to 1 April 1987 the fringe benefit is also to be valued at the new prescribed rate as it is the interest which is the benefit as opposed to the actual loan. The only exception to using the latest prescribed rate of interest is where a loan with a non-concessionary rate of interest was provided prior to 1 April 1985. In these cases the benefit is valued in accordance with the rates set out in the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1985.

Prior to the quarter commencing 1 April 1987 the rate will be reviewed and if it is considered necessary the rate will be altered with the change being advertised. The rate will again be reviewed prior to 1 June (being one month prior to the commencement of the following quarter) and in each subsequent quarter.

### Section 39 - Payment of Provisional Tax by Instalments

This section provides for the payment of provisional tax in three equal instalments due on the 7th day of the months set out in the Eighth Schedule to the principal Act, as substituted by section 44(1) of this Amendment Act. Payments will fall due on the 7th day of the 4th, 8th, and 12th month of the taxpayer's accounting year. The schedule of new payment dates for both provisional tax and terminal tax is set out in Appendix A to this circular.

### _Subsection (1)_

This subsection makes the following amendments to section 385 of the principal Act.

Paragraph (a) - Increases the number of provisional tax instalments from 2 to 3.

Paragraph (b) - Provides for the provisional tax payments to be made on the 7th day of the months specified in the substituted Eighth Schedule to the principal Act. The new-look Schedule now only lists the months for payment instead of the dates for payment.

Paragraph (c) - Repeals section 385(2) of the principal Act. This section provided for the three instalment option for certain taxpayers engaged in a farming or agricultural business. With the advent of three instalments for all provisional taxpayers, this provision has become obsolete.

### _Subsection (2)_

With the repeal of section 385(2), the distinction between 2 and 3 instalment provisional taxpayers in section 385(4) also became obsolete. This section is redrafted in recognition of this fact and is substituted by this subsection.

### _Subsection (3)_

This subsection substitutes a new paragraph (b) in section 386(2) of the principal Act. The old paragraph (b) is redrafted in order to:

1.  Recognise that there is no longer a distinction between 2 and 3 instalment taxpayers; and
2.  Provide for all 3 provisional tax instalments to be of equal amount.

### _Subsection (4) - First Applies to 1988 Provisional Tax_

This subsection provides for the new provisional tax payment regime to first apply in respect of 1988 provisional tax.

_Note: As a transitional measure the payment dates for 1988 provisional tax differ from the dates applying in respect of subsequent years. Refer to the commentary to section 44 of this Amendment Act for details._

### Section 40 - Payment of Terminal Tax and Repeal of One Months Grace

This section provides for the payment of terminal tax in the 11th month of a taxpayer's accounting year for taxpayers with balance dates on or before 31 March. Other taxpayers must pay terminal tax by 7 February each year.

The section also provides for the abolition of the one month grace after the due date for payment before a 10 percent late payment penalty is imposed. This one month grace is removed in respect of both provisional and terminal tax payments.

The provisions will apply equally in respect of individuals and companies.

### _Subsection (1) - All Provisional Taxpayers Included_

This subsection amends section 392(2) of the principal Act to provide for all payments of terminal tax to be payable on the 7th day of the month specified in the Eighth Schedule to the principal Act. Whereas the terminal tax payment dates specified in the "old" Schedule only applied in respect of companies, the new Schedule applies in respect of all taxpayers.

### _Subsection (2)_

A definition for the expression "terminal tax" is included in section 2 of the principal Act.

### _Subsections (3) and (4) - Family Support Payments_

These subsections make consequential amendments to section 374J of the principal Act. Section 374J relates to the payment of family support tax credits by way of instalments set off against provisional tax.

As a consequence of the new 3 provisional tax payments regime and the abolition of the one month grace before a late payment penalty is imposed, it became necessary to amend the timing that tax credits are credited against provisional taxpayer's accounts, to coincide with the new rules.

### _Subsection (5) - Provisional Tax Estimates_

This subsection makes a consequential amendment to the estimation of assessable income provisions contained in section 387 of the principal Act to provide for the timing of such estimates to be synchronised with the new payment dates. Under the previous arrangements a taxpayer could estimate his assessable income at any time before the expiry of one month after the due date for payment of any provisional tax instalment. With the abolition of the one month grace provision, it has become necessary that estimations be made on or before the due date.

### _Subsections (6), (7) and (8) - Repeal of One Months Grace_

These sections amend the provisions of section 398 of the principal Act to provide for the removal of the one month grace period before a late payment penalty is imposed.

The new provisions provide for the 10 percent penalty to be imposed from the day immediately following the due date. Similarly the incremental penalties are applied 6 months after the due date and every 6 months thereafter.

### _Subsection (9)_

This subsection consequentially repeals section 32(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1977.

### _Subsection (10) - Payment of Self-Employed AC Levies_

Makes a consequential amendment to the Accident Compensation Act 1982. Self-employed AC levies must be paid by 7 February each year in order to coincide with the due date for payment of terminal tax for the majority of taxpayers. The one month grace for payment of AC levy is therefore withdrawn. This also applies to payments made under the Optional Scheme for which both an election must be made and a payment made by 7 February each year. However, the Optional Scheme cover year remains at 8 March to following 7 March each year.

### _Subsection (11) - Application_

This is the application section and provides for the new payment arrangements to apply in respect of the 1987 terminal tax.

_**Subsection (12)**_ - Provides for subsection (10) of this section to first apply in respect of AC levies for which the due date is 7 February 1988.

### Section 41 - Relief from Additional Tax

This section amends section 413(4) of the principal Act which provides for the Minister of Finance to approve cases for remission of tax where the amount exceeds a certain limit.

The amendment increased the limit, which was last reviewed in 1977, from $1,000 to $5,000 and applies from 15 December 1986, the date this Amendment Act received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 42 - Relief in Cases of Serious Hardship

This section amends section 414(5) of the principal Act and increases the limit under which cases have to be referred to the Minister of Finance for remission of tax in cases of serious hardship, from $1,000 to $5,000.

This section will apply from 15 December 1986, the date this Act received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 43 - Publication of Names of Tax Evaders

Section 43 amends section 427 of the principal Act which requires the Commissioner to publish from time to time, in the Gazette, particulars of offenders against the Act.

The section has been amended to ensure:

1.  the names of persons convicted of aiding, abetting, or inciting tax deduction offences are published in the Gazette; and
2.  the names of persons convicted of certain offences relating to the Family Support Tax Credit scheme are published in the Gazette; and
3.  the names of persons who have penal tax imposed under section 374O of the Act (Family Support Tax Credit) are published in the Gazette.

_**Subsection (1)**_ adds the words "or paragraph (ba)" to paragraph (b). This provides that the names of offenders who have been convicted of aiding, abetting, or inciting an offence under paragraph (a) or (b) of section 368(1) of this Act (tax deduction offences) or paragraph (b) of section 33(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1957, shall have their names published in the Gazette.

_**Subsection (2)**_ substitutes a new paragraph (ba) to section 427. It adds to the paragraph reference to any offence committed under:

1.  Section 374N(d) - makes it an offence for anyone to falsely claim to have paid any instalments of Family Support Tax Credit, and subsequently attempt to obtain a refund from the Commissioner.
2.  374N(g) - makes it an offence for any person to -
    *   A Attempt to obtain a certificate of entitlement or a tax credit by means of a false of \[sic\] misleading application or declaration.
    *   B Give false information or mislead or attempt to mislead the Commissioner, any other officer, employer, or other person in relation to any matter which would affect a certificate of entitlement or a tax credit.
3.  374N(k) - makes it an offence to aid or abet any other person to commit any offence under either of the above paragraphs (d) or (g).

_**Subsection (3)**_ adds to paragraph (c) of section 427 reference to section 374O of the Act which imposes penal tax where any person falsely pretends to have made a payment of Family Support Tax Credit and has attempted to obtain a refund from the Commissioner for that payment or part of the payment.

_**Subsection (4)**_ is the application date for the other subsections which shall apply to offences committed on or after 1 October 1986.

### Section 44 - Dates for Payment of Income Tax and Provisional Tax

This section substitutes a new Eighth Schedule into the principal Act. This new Eighth Schedule - refer to Appendix A of this circular contains, for each balance date, the months for payment of provisional tax instalments and the month for payment of terminal tax.

The payments fall due on the 7th day of each month listed and apply in respect of all provisional taxpayers (i.e., companies and individuals). The new Schedule contains two separate payment schedules; one to apply for the 1987/88 income year and one to apply in respect of the 1988/89 and all subsequent years. The Schedule applying for the 1987/88 income year contains certain transitional arrangements which apply for that year only. These transitional arrangements are as follows:

1.  Taxpayers with an October balance date will have a due date for payment for the 1st instalment of 1988 provisional tax of 7 March 1987 (instead of 7 February 1987 under the new Scheme).
2.  Taxpayers with a February, March or April balance date will have a due date for payment of their 1st instalment of 1988 provisional tax of 7 September 1987 (instead of 7 June, 7 July and 7 August respectively).

_**Subsection (1)**_

This subsection substitutes the new Eighth Schedule to the principal Act.

Subsection (2)

This is the application section and provides for the new payment dates to first apply in respect of

1.  1987 terminal tax: and
2.  1988 provisional tax.

Appendix B
----------

### Cost Price Market Value or Replacement Price

### _Section 86B Income Tax Act 1976_

### COST PRICE

**1\. GENERAL**

The adoption of cost price as an option for livestock valuation will involve the need to analyse all farm costs so that an apportionment can be made between the cost of:

*   the animal (based on weight of meat produced)
*   the animal produce (milk, wool, velvet, etc)
*   the non-livestock activities (cropping, forestry, administration etc.)

Any person selecting cost price as the basis for valuing their livestock will therefore be required to keep very detailed and specific records.

These records must be sufficiently adequate and clear enough to enable the apportionment of costs and the determination of the cost of individual animals or batches of livestock, where they have a common cost, to be easily identified and monitored.

It will be a requirement that there is sufficient analysis and a trail record of information kept to enable the tracing of costs and other relevant data back to the prime source of information.

In addition to the cost data it will also be compulsory that a livestock register is kept. This register must contain a full record of:

*   inward and outward stock movement
*   identification marks of individual animals (or batches of animals with a common cost)
*   source or destination of stock
*   cost of stock purchased (per animal or batch)
*   estimated carcass weight of all immature inward and outward stock at time of acquisition or sale
*   estimated carcass weight of immature stock, including homebred stock, at balance date.
*   estimated weight of produce (wool, fibre, velvet) purchased on live animals.

There will also be a need for stock identification so that individual animals or animals of a specific batch can be traced. The use of ear tags is considered to be a minimum requirement.

If the Commissioner is not satisfied that the taxpayer has sufficient records to accurately determine the cost price of that specified livestock, the option to value livestock at cost shall not apply.

**2\. FARM COSTS**

The farm costs can be broken down into:

1.  Costs specific to an activity other than meat production (e.g., cropping expenses, shearing costs, dairy shed costs). These are not included in calculating the cost of the animal.
2.  Direct farm costs:
    1.  Livestock Costs:
        *   Animal health (includes all costs incurred in maintaining the breeding stock).
        *   Fodder.
        *   Freight In (of livestock).
        *   Insurance.
    2.  Farm Working Expenses:
        *   Plant Hire
        *   Power
        *   Rates

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seeds | only maintenance for existing pasture, doesnot include costs in bringing land into production. |     |
| Top dressing |
| Wages | \- Permanent | (Contracting costs should be included in outstanding items, e.g., shearing, cropping). |
|     | \- Casual |

There is no notional wage of a self-employed farmer but there must be a wage allowance for a shareholder/employee.

If a taxpayer maintains adequate records specific costs can be charged against production costs.

**(iii) Repairs and Maintenance:**

*   Farm buildings
*   Fences and yards (does not include new fences)
*   Plant and machinery
*   Protective clothing
*   Tools and hardware
*   Tracks and drains (does not include new tracks or drains)
*   Water supply and irrigation (does not include new water supply or irrigation)

If a taxpayer maintains adequate records, specific costs (e.g., woolshed maintenance) can be charged against production income (e.g., wool sales).

**(iv) Vehicle expenses (fuel, maintenance, registration and insurance):**

*   Utility vehicles
*   Trucks
*   Tractors
*   Motorcycles

Motorcar expenses are treated as indirect farm costs - see paragraph (c) below;

**(v) Depreciation:**

Buildings, vehicles, plant and capitalised development expenditure.

If a taxpayer maintains adequate records, specific depreciation (e.g., dairyshed plant) can be charged against production income (e.g., milk sales).

**(c) Indirect farm costs** - These are administration costs which are not to be included in the calculation of livestock cost:

*   Motorcar expenses and depreciation
*   Farm insurance (not elsewhere included)
*   Interest
*   Accounting
*   Legal
*   Farm advisory
*   General
*   Rent

**3\. APPORTIONMENT OF DIRECT FARM COSTS BETWEEN LIVESTOCK TYPES**

The direct farm costs must be apportioned between the cost of producing the "various" types of livestock on the farm.

*   (a) Calculate direct farm costs relating to livestock valuation:
    *   (i) livestock costs (excluding purchase price).
    *   (ii) a portion of all direct farm costs based on land used (e.g., cash crops v livestock use). This apportionment should be on an area basis unless a taxpayer produces an otherwise acceptable basis.
*   (b) Apportion the amount allocated to livestock use between the various types of livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, deer, goats etc) based on stock units carried at opening balance date.

The stock units are:

| Livestock | Stock Units |
| --- | --- |
| Adult sheep | 1.0 |
| Immature sheep | 0.7 |
| Breeding cows - dairy | 7.0 |
| \- beef | 6.0 |
| Rising one-year cattle | 4.0 |
| Rising two-year cattle and others | 5.0 |
| Adult deer | 2.0 |
| Immature deer | 1.5 |
| Adult goats | 0.7 |
| Immature goats | 0.5 |
| Adult pigs | 1.5 |
| Immature pigs | 1.0 |

The following example illustrates the conversion of livestock numbers to equivalent stock units.

| Livestock | No. on hand | No. on hand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.4.88 | 31.3.89 |
| Adult sheet \[sic\] | 1,000 | 1,100 |
| Immature sheep | 500 | 400 |
| Rising 2-year cattle | 100 | 100 |
| Adult deer | 150 | 170 |
| Immature deer | 108 | 120 |
|     | l,858 | 1,890 |

Total stock units at opening balance date:

| Class | 1.4.88 | Stock Units per head | Equivalent Stock Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adult sheep | 1,000 | 1.0 | 1,000 |
| Immature sheep | 500 | 0.7 | 350 |
| Rising 2-year cattle | 100 | 5.0 | 500 |
| Adult deer | 150 | 2.0 | 300 |
| Immature deer | 108 | 1.5 | 162 |
|     |     | Total opening stock units | 2,312 |

Taxpayer wants to use cost price scheme for the deer which equals 462 stock units carried on the farm.

The farm expenses are:

1.  Costs to specific activities:
    *   Shearing expenses $1,360.00, Woolshed depreciation $150.00
2.  Direct farm costs:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Livestock costs | $3,027.00 |
|     | (excluding purchase price) |     |
| (ii) | Farm working expenses | $13,402.00 |
| (iii) | Repairs and maintenance | $2,245.00 |
| (iv) | Vehicle expenses | $1,537.00 |
| (v) | Depreciation | $821.00 |

### 4\. APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS BETWEEN DUAL PRODUCTS FROM A LIVESTOCK SPECIES -

Dual products are produced by all livestock other than beef cattle and pigs (e.g., fibre and meat, milk and meat, velvet and meat). The costs must be apportioned between the production of meat and the production of the animal products on the basis of the weight of each product.

The system guidelines are:

1.  For wool and other fibre (and velvet) the weight produced for allocation purposes will be restricted to the weight sold plus or minus the net change in closing stocks on hand in an income year (weight sold minus opening stock on hand plus closing stock on hand).
2.  Milk weight will be that produced and sold during the year.
3.  The weight of meat produced will include all production from livestock up to one year of age for pigs and two years of age for all other livestock species. The calculation will be based on carcass weights and will include the following:
    1.  carcass weights of immature livestock derived from killing sheets plus
    2.  estimated carcass weights of all relevant classes of livestock sold live (and as recorded in the livestock register) plus
    3.  estimated carcass weight of all rising one-year stock returned at closing balance plus
    4.  estimated carcass weight of all rising two-year stock retained at closing balance (not pigs) minus
    5.  estimated carcass weight of all stock less than two years of age (one year for pigs) purchased during the year (carcass weight estimation made at time of introduction to the farm) minus
    6.  estimated carcass weight of all rising one-year stock at opening balance.
4.  This system will estimate total meat production for an income year. In the case of beef cattle, fattening steers and bulls older than two years should also have meat production estimates included in the total estimate. All estimates of carcass weights for inward and outward stock movements will be recorded in the livestock registers. Stock sold at less than one week of age will be excluded (e.g., bobby calves).

4.  (iv) Costs specific to a particular product will be allocated directly to that product (e.g., shearing to wool, dairyshed expenses to milk production).
5.  (v) All other costs allocated to a specific livestock species will then be apportioned in direct proportion to the weight of each product produced.

e.g. Number and classes of deer farmed

| Class | Opening Stock | Closing Stock | Opening Carcass weight kg/head | Closing Carcass weight kg/head | Number Purchased during year | Carcass weight at purchase kg/head |

|     | Total production from deer |     |     |     | 4,700 kg |     |

### Cost of meat products

| Costs apportioned to deer farming |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total weight of deer product |     |     |
| Thus, cost per kilogram of carcass weight | \=  | 4,206  <br>4,700 |
|     | \=  | $0.90/kg |

### 5\. THE LIVESTOCK IS VALUED AS FOLLOWS:

(a) Purchase mature livestock

*   These can be valued as a batch if a pen lot is purchased or as individuals. The costs assigned to livestock will be retained for the remainder of their life on the farm. The only adjustment to the value will be for deaths or sales.
*   The cost of the livestock is:
    *   (i) The purchase price of the livestock plus
    *   (ii) Costs incurred in delivering the animal onto the property (e.g., freight inward, quarantine fees, insurance).

(b) Purchase of immature livestock

*   The cost price of the livestock will be:
    1.  Purchase price of livestock plus
    2.  Costs incurred in delivering the animal on to the property plus
    3.  The additional costs associated with the estimated carcass weight increase (see paragraph 4).

**EXAMPLE**

Taxpayer purchased 5 rising hinds for $980.00 each - delivery costs to farm was $50.00 and the estimated average carcass weight on arrival on the farm was 50kg. Weight at balance date 70kg. The cost of the livestock would be:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Purchase price | $980.00 |
| (ii) | Delivery costs $50.00 Ã· 5 = | $10.00 |
| (iii) | Cost to produce increased carcass weight |     |
|     | Est Carcass Weight at balance date 70kg |     |
|     | Est Carcass Weight at purchase 50kg |     |
|     | Weight gain 20kg |     |
|     | x production cost per kg 90.0 cents kg | $ 10.00 |
|     | (see paragraph 4) Cost of livestock = | $1,008.00 |

(c) Homebred stock (first year)

*   The cost of homebred stock less than one year old at balance date will be calculated as follows:
    1.  Any specified cost relating to that progeny, e.g., net cost, AI (Artificial Insemination) cost plus
    2.  The average cost per kilogram of estimated carcass weight multiplied by the estimated weight of those animals, being valued, on hand at closing date plus
    3.  The depreciation of breeding stock (based on book value/cost) pertaining to meat production averaged over all progeny. The depreciation rate used will be the same as the rate used for the high price stock regime. This figure is only used for calculating the cost of the offspring and is not shown in the accounts, i.e.,
*   |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | Sheep | 25% |
    | Cattle | 20% |
    | Stags | 20% |
    | Other Deer | 15% |
    | Goats | 20% |
    | Pigs | 33 1/3% |
    
*   (where breeding stock are bailed the bailment fee will be used in lieu of depreciation).
*   e.g., Taxpayer has natural increase of 120 Fawns which had an average closing weight of 40kg each.
*   Cost of the Fawns would be:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | Farm Total | Total per Offspring |
| (i) | Specified costs relating to production of progeny | Nil | Nil |
| (ii) | Depreciation of breeding stock:  <br>145 mixed-age hinds @ $2,000 x 15% | $43,500 |     |
|     | Cost per fawn: $43,500 / 120  <br>5 breeding stags @ $4,000 @ 20% | $4,000 | $362.50 |
|     | Cost per fawn: $4,000 / 120 |     | $33.33 |
| (iii) | Average cost of growing offspring (hinds) to 40 kg at  <br>closing balance @ 90c/kg | N/A | $36.00 |
|     | (see para (4)) |     |     |
|     | Cost per rising l-year hind (homebred) |     | $431.83 |

(d) Homebred Stock (from first balance date till maturity)

*   Livestock are deemed to be mature at the age of two except for pigs which are mature at one year of age.
*   The costs of homebred stock are:
    1.  The costs of those livestock as calculated at the closing balance of the previous year plus
    2.  The estimated increase in carcass weight (multiplied by the average cost per kilogram of carcass weight) between opening balance date and, either closing balance date or the date the livestock (except pigs) turn two, whichever is earlier.
    3.  e.g.

|     |     | $/head |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Cost of rising l-year hind at opening balance date | $431.83 |
| (ii) | Cost of estimated carcass weight gain from rising l-year to rising 2-years (70kg-35kg) i.e., 35kg @ 90 cents/kg | $31.50 |
|     | Cost per rising 2-year hind (homebred at rising 1-year) | $463.33 |

(e) Captured livestock over two years of age

*   The cost of captured livestock is:
    1.  The total annual recovery costs incurred divided by the number of livestock captured plus
    2.  The costs incurred in transporting the animal to the farm plus
    3.  Any vet or drug costs incurred on capture.

(f) Captured livestock less than two years of age

*   The cost of captured immature livestock is:
    1.  Costs of capture (see paragraph (e)) plus
    2.  The additional costs associated with the estimated carcass weight increase from date of arrival on the farm to balance date (see paragraph 4).

(g) Continuing cost of mature livestock

*   The cost assigned to relevant livestock at the closing balance date when they reach maturity will be retained for the remainder of their life on the farm. No depreciation will be allowed at time of sale or death.

### MARKET VALUE OR REPLACEMENT PRICE

The requirement of these options will be relatively straightforward.

### _Market Value_

The market value of livestock can be used as an alternative to cost price. Market value is the value that the livestock would be worth on the open market if they were available for sale in the normal course of business to an arms-length party at balance date.

Market value should not be reduced by any selling costs such as the cost of transport from farm to sale yards or slaughterhouse.

What will be required is a valuation certificate for each class of livestock from a competent independent valuer. The certificate must include stock numbers and either the market value or replacement price as at balance date.

### Replacement Price

The replacement price of livestock is the price the taxpayer would pay at balance date for livestock of the same class and quality as the livestock on hand at that balance date which are to be valued at replacement price.

What will be required is a valuation certificate for each class of livestock from a competent independent valuer. The certificate must include stock numbers and either the market value or replacement price as at balance date.

### Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation

The following is a repeat of a press release issued by the Minister of Finance, the Hon R.O. Douglas, on 9 March 1986:

### _Consultative document released_

Finance Minister Roger Douglas released last night the Consultative Document on the taxation of livestock and of agriculture, horticultural, forestry and aquacultural capital expenditure.

The public have until Friday 4 April to make submissions on the issues raised in the document. A committee chaired by Dr Don Brash will receive the submissions and report back to Government.

Mr Douglas said that the terms of reference of the committee were to receive and hear public submissions on matters affecting the implementation and efficient operation of the schemes outlined in the document.

"However I have told Dr Brash that he should not feel constrained from reporting on matters outside the terms of reference if he feels that such matters need consideration by Government."

Mr Douglas said that the scheme was not retrospective. The scheme applies for the first time in the 1986/87 income year. This year's income, and last years income are not affected, unless farmers elect to bring part of the write up to account in 1985/86.

He said that the livestock valuation changes did however affect future earning on investments people had already made but that this also applied to a whole range of Government policy changes. Unless this was the case the Government could never change its policies in the community's interests.

Mr Douglas said that the changes meant that livestock would be treated, as far as practicable, on the same basis as the stocks of other businesses. Primary capital expenditure would also be treated on a similar basis to that in other sectors.

Douglas said that changes to standard values would be straightforward to apply on an ongoing basis.

"Two livestock valuation schemes will replace the existing system. The trading stock scheme is simply the old standard value system but with annually reviewable standard values plugged in each year. As is the case with other businesses, increases in the amount of stock during the year increases assessable income," he said.

There would be no other changes required to records or accounting practices. The Herd Scheme applied to mature female breeding animals and although it was not compulsory, Mr Douglas said that many farmers would find that it had considerable advantages.

"In particular the herd scheme means that farmers will not be taxed on the inflationary component of the increase in livestock values as they are under the present system," he said.

"The transitional measures may appear complex but they are required to ensure that the move to the new scheme is achieved fairly. The transitional arrangements allow for a variety of different situations and each farmer would find that only a small number of the transitional provisions actually applied to him," he said.

"Businesses in New Zealand are taxed on an income basis, which is not the same as cash flow. Criticisms that the proposed changes unfairly tax unrealised income are therefore not valid," he said.

Mr Douglas said that the present rules for livestock valuation had a number of severe disadvantages:

*   They bias investment decisions such as the choice among different land uses (for instance the choice between deer farming and dairying or between sheep farming and cropping).
*   They inflate land and other input prices making it harder for young farmers to buy a farm and making some existing farm activities uneconomic.
*   They encourage activities solely for the tax advantages which are available, which are largest for people on high incomes.

Mr Douglas said that he hoped that the consultative exercise being carried out by the Committee chaired by Dr Brash would be as successful as it was in advising the Government on the draft GST legislation.

"I urge people to take this opportunity to help refine and develop the proposals outlined in the document."

"This is a major chance for farm industry organisations to make constructive input and help the Government achieve its objectives in the simplest, most efficient way," he said.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988
=====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988 from PIB vol 176 Sep 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 176, September 1988

Budget Night Tax Legislation (1988)
-----------------------------------

The changes to the depreciation provisions of the Income Tax Act announced in the Budget were introduced as part of a Finance Bill on Budget night.

The Bill was passed on 29 July and received the Governor-General's assent on 30 July 1988.

The tax amendments have become the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988.

The following explains the amendments made to the Income Tax Act 1976, in this regard.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988
-------------------------------------

### Section 1 - Short Title and Commencement

The income tax amendments contained in this Amendment Act are deemed to come into force on the 29th day of July 1988.

### Section 2 - Revised Assessments where Assets Sold after Deduction of Depreciation Allowances

Three amendments have been made to section 117 of the Tax Act:

*   The rollover provision has been repealed
*   The recovery of excess depreciation on buildings has been made taxable
*   Any loss on the sale of a building is now specifically disallowed.

### Rollover Provision

Previously when any asset (except a building) was sold for more than its depreciated value, taxpayers had the option of allowing the excess depreciation recovered to be applied in the reduction of the cost recorded for a replacement asset.

The rollover provision has now been terminated by limiting it to replacement assets acquired before 29 July 1988 or acquired under an unconditional contract of sale in force at the close of 28 July 1988.

### Buildings

Previously when any building (except a temporary building) was sold for more than its depreciated value, the excess depreciation allowed was not taxable.

For buildings sold or otherwise disposed of after 28 July 1988 (unless subject to an unconditional contract of sale at the close of the 28th day July) any excess depreciation is now to be treated in the same manner as applies to other assets, i.e., the excess depreciation is taxable. The depreciation which can be recovered for tax purposes includes all ordinary and special depreciation allowed over the period the building was owned.

Any excess depreciation recovered will be subject to the usual rights of election in respect of the spreading provisions included in section 117 of the Tax Act.

A new subsection (1A) has been inserted in section 117 to deal with the situation where buildings are sold for less than their depreciated value. No deduction of the resultant loss is to be allowed in such cases.

### Transition

The introduction date of 29 July means that the new measures may affect some taxpayers with late balance dates in the 1988 income year.

In the case of late balance dates, the 1988 return form does not specifically provide or mention depreciation recovered on the sale of buildings. Taxpayers using late balance dates and to whom this measure applies are asked to attach a statement to affected 1988 tax returns, showing the depreciation recovered on the sale of buildings.

It should be noted that an unconditional contract is a contract in which no conditions have to be satisfied before title is passed. A conditional sale agreed to prior to 29 July can be regarded as unconditional if all the conditions were met by the close of 28 July.

The repeal of the rollover provision will affect assets sold before 29 July where the intended replacement asset has not been purchased, or contracted to be purchased, by the close of 28 July.

Â 

The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) was passed by Parliament on Tuesday 13 December and received the Governor-General's assent on Friday 16 December 1988.

The Act comprises the following Parts:

*   **Part I - Accruals**
*   **Part II - Taxation of Trusts**
*   **Part III - International Tax**
*   **Part IV - Full imputation, Dividend Withholding Payments, Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts, and Related Amendments**
*   **Part V - Miscellaneous Provisions**

This explanatory document explains only the amendments contained in Part V of the Amendment Act.

As explanatory material on the other Parts becomes available this will be issued under separate cover.

### Sections 63-65 - Taxation of Youth Allowances

The amendments contained in sections 63-65 result from the Government's Youth Support package which was announced in June 1988. The package provided, inter alia, for the Department of Education to pay youth allowances to students. These allowances, which will be called basic grants and independent circumstances grants, will be paid under the Student Allowances Regulations 1988 which will shortly be promulgated by the Department of Education. First payments are expected to be made after 1 January 1989.

The amendments contained in this Act provide for these allowances to be taxable and subject to deductions at source.

### Section 63

amends the definition of the term "salary or wages" contained in section 2 of the principal Act to include the basic grant and independent circumstances grant within that definition. This means that payments of these grants are brought into the PAYE net and are subject to deductions at source.

### Section 64

qualifies section 61(37) of the principal Act so as to make it clear that these grants are not included in the term "scholarship or bursary" and are therefore not exempt from income tax.

### Section 65

amends section 65(2) of the principal Act to make it explicit that the grants are included in assessable income.

### Sections 63-65

have application to income derived in the 1989 and subsequent income years but will not have any practical effect until after 1 January 1989 when the Department of Education starts paying these grants to students.

### Section 66 - Retiring Allowances and Redundancy Payments.

Section 66 makes a number of minor drafting amendments to section 68 of the Income Tax Act (tax treatment of retiring allowances and redundancy payments).

Retiring allowances paid from 1 October 1988 are not subject to tax in the recipient's hands but are solely subject to FBT at the rate of 24 cents in the dollar. So much of a redundancy payment paid from 1 October 1988 as does not exceed the specified sum is taxable in the recipient's hands subject to a concessionary tax regime, described under subsection (3) below. To the extent that payments exceed the specified sum FBT at the rate of 24 cents in the dollar is payable on the excess.

The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1988 made amendments to the definition of the term "specified sum" for the purposes of calculating the tax payable on a redundancy payment. One amendment replaced the term "employment or service" with the word "employment" in that definition. This section of this Amendment Act repeals the definition of "employment or service" and inserts a definition of the term "employment". The effect is that those circumstances which previously were considered to be employment or service with one employer, now satisfy the requirements of employment with one employer.

Subsection (2) provides that the amount of a redundancy payment deemed to be assessable income in the hands of the recipient is the lesser of:

*   5% of the payment, or
*   5% of the specified sum.

Subsection (3) makes a drafting correction to section 68(3A) of the Income Tax Act which provides for the tax treatment of a second redundancy payment. Such payments can qualify for concessionary treatment but the specified sum is calculated on the basis of income derived from the subsequent employment. The amendment does not alter the current treatment.

These amendments apply from 1 October 1988.

Subsection (4) clarifies the application date of the amendments made in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1988. (i.e., 1 October 1988).

Note: The Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, passed by Parliament on 22 March 1989, increases the rate of FBT to 49 cents in the dollar and makes fringe benefit tax payments deductible expenditure for income tax purposes. The amendments relate to FBT on fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 1989.

### Section 67 - Depreciation on Motor Cars

Section 67 amends the formula in section 110(3A) of the Income Tax Act (calculation of the depreciable value of a motor car purchased prior to 31 March 1987).

Prior to the 1988 income year, section 110 provided that depreciation allowable on business motor cars would be limited to an amount calculated on the basis of a specified cost (for the 1982 to 1987 income years - $11,000). This provision was repealed in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1986. For motor cars purchased prior to 31 March 1987 a formula provided the basis for the calculation of the depreciable value which would apply for the 1988 and subsequent income years. The effect of the formula is to equate the book value of the motor car as at 1 April 1987 to the book value which would have applied if the specified cost provisions had not been introduced and the taxpayer had claimed depreciation on the full cost of the motor car in the years since it had been acquired.

Unfortunately the formula introduced in 1986 did not take account of the fact that when the motor car was purchased the taxpayer may have elected to offset depreciation recovered on a previous motor car against the specified cost of the new vehicle. Section 67 of this Amendment Act amends the formula so that the rollover of depreciation recovered does not distort the intention of the legislation. The operation of the formula is illustrated in Appendix A to this TPC.

### Section 68 - Expenditure on Improvements in Relation to Aquaculture

This section amends section 128C(3) of the Income Tax Act to correct a drafting error. From the 1989 income year a deduction for expenditure on aquacultural improvements will be allowed to a lessee of such improvements only if the expenditure was incurred by that lessee.

### Section 69 - Determination of Specified Exemption

This section amends section 336BA(1)of the principal Act which deals with the determination of the specified exemption level for the purposes of the National Superannuitant Surcharge.

The Government announced on budget night that from 1 October 1988, all new superannuitants who are married will be paid at the same rate. This removed the anomaly whereby married superannuitants with a spouse under 60 years were paid 60 percent of the married rate of National Superannuation rather than 50 percent like other married superannuitants.

The change is being brought into effect by freezing the amount of National Superannuation received by those married superannuitants who receive the single rate until such time as the married rate, through the normal six monthly adjustments, has caught up.

National Superannuitants who first became eligible for National Superannuation after 1 October 1988 will receive the lower (50 percent of the married) rate immediately.

This change in policy meant that the specified exemption for married superannuitants affected by this change also needed to be adjusted.

Subsection (1) amends section 336BA(1) of the principal Act by replacing paragraph (b) with two new paragraphs (b) and (ba).

The new paragraph (b) determines the specified exemption level that applies to a person who is receiving half the married rate of National Superannuation and who does not have a spouse under the age of 60 years (as it did before the amendment).

The new paragraph (ba) determines the specified exemption level for those National Superannuitants whose spouses do not qualify for National Superannuation (i.e. under 60 years) and who are receiving National Superannuation at 50 percent of the married rate. (i.e. Until the effect of the six monthly adjustments catches up this will only be those who became eligible after 1 October 1988.)

The difference between paragraphs (b)(ba) and results from the need to allow an adjustment for any specified foreign social security pension the spouse (who is under 60 years) may be receiving in order to ensure equal treatment with spouses who are National Superannuitants. For the latter, such pensions are effectively already exempt from surcharge.

Subsection (2) makes an amendment to paragraph (c) of section 336BA(1) to exclude superannuitants who are married from claiming the single specified exemption level.

Married superannuitants who are receiving the frozen amount of National Superannuation (i.e. received National Superannuation before 1 October 1988) still have their specified exemption determined under paragraph (c) (pursuant to 336BA(1)(d)(iii)). Their entitlement to a minimum exemption of $7,202 is therefore protected until such time as their rate of National Superannuation equals 50 percent of the married rate and section 336BA(1)(ba) applies.

Subsection (3) provides that section 69 of the Amendment Act will come into force on the 1st of April 1989.

### Section 70 - Family Support Credit of Tax

As part of the youth support package, the Government, on June 1 1988, announced the following changes:

1.  Parents of 15 year olds who are not employed (i.e. a student, unemployed, or on an ACCESS course) will be entitled to a Family Benefit and consequently Family Support in respect of those children. This Family Support entitlement will be at the normal rate of either $36 or $16 per week subject to the normal abatement rules.
2.  Parents will be entitled to the higher level of Family Support (i.e. $36 per week subject to the normal abatement rules) in respect of each 16, 17, or 18 year old under their care and who is still attending secondary school.

The first of these policy changes requires no amendment to the Income Tax Act. The fact that a Family Benefit will be payable in respect of 15 year olds who are not in employment (a Social Security Act amendment) will automatically result in a Family Support entitlement.

The amendment contained in section 70 of this Amendment Act deals with the second of the above announcements.

Subsections (1) and (2) amend item y in sections 374D(2) and 374D(3) of the principal Act respectively, to give effect to the above announcement. Because a Family Benefit is payable in respect of 16, 17, and 18 year olds who are still at school, this remains the link to a Family Support entitlement.

Subsection(3) provides for this amendment to apply from 1 April 1989.

### Section 71 - Director-General to Deliver Credit of Tax

This section inserts two new subsections into section 374I of the principal Act to remove, under certain circumstances, the requirement for the Department of Social Welfare to pay the unabated amount of Family Support to social security beneficiaries. The purpose of the amendment is to give the Department of Social Welfare greater flexibility in dealing with cases where beneficiaries, if paid full Family Support with their benefit, would have a substantial end-of-year tax debit.

Subsection (1) inserts new subsections (3A) and (3B) into section 374I of the principal Act to release the Director-General of Social Welfare and the Secretary for War Pensions from their obligation, imposed by either section 374I(2) or 374I(3) to deliver Family Support in any case where the beneficiary requests not to receive it.

The new subsection (3B) provides for Family Support payments to be recommenced at any time after such a request is cancelled.

Subsection (2) makes a consequential drafting amendment to section 374G of the principal Act.

Subsection (3) provides for these amendments to apply from 1 April 1989.

### Section 72 - Interpretation (Provisional Tax)

This section amends the definition of "residual income tax" in section 375 of the principal Act by repealing paragraph (c). This paragraph provided for any Family Support and GMFI tax credits, deducted from or set off against a taxpayer's income tax under section 374F of the principal Act, to be deducted from the taxpayer's income tax for the purpose of determining the taxpayer's residual income tax. This residual income tax would then be used to calculate the taxpayer's provisional tax liability in the following income year.

This approach effectively meant that provisional taxpayers could reduce their provisional tax payments in any one year by the amount of Family Support or GMFI tax credit entitlement of the previous year.

Because a tax credit entitlement should only be delivered during the year pursuant to a certificate of entitlement, Family Support and GMFI entitlements will no longer be deducted from a person's income tax liability to determine the provisional tax liability in the following year. Provisional taxpayers who will be entitled to a tax credit should apply for a certificate of entitlement to have their provisional tax payments reduced in accordance with section 374J of the principal Act.

Subsection (2) deems the above amendment to have come into force on 7 November 1988 from when the new provisional tax rules first applied.

### Section 73 - Estimated Provisional Tax

Subsection (1) provides for a new subsection (6) to be added to section 382 of the principal Act. This new subsection determines an estimate for the purposes of section 382(2) in any case where a taxpayer is required to make an estimate but fails to do so.

Section 382(2) of the principal Act provides that taxpayers with provisional income exceeding $1,000,000 must estimate their residual income tax and furnish a notice of that estimate to the Commissioner on or before the taxpayer's third instalment date. Where an estimate is received after the taxpayer's third instalment date it is not valid and the Commissioner must have the authority to determine an estimate for the taxpayer. Failure to furnish an estimate is most likely to occur when a taxpayer incorrectly anticipates the provisional income to be less than $1,000,000 and does not voluntarily make an estimate.

In relation to any such taxpayer where an estimate has not been received by the Commissioner on or before the third instalment date, an amount equal to the aggregate of the provisional tax paid on or before the third instalment date is deemed to be the taxpayer's estimate.

Subsection (2) provides for this section to come into force on 7 March 1989 which is the third instalment date for the majority of provisional taxpayers.

### Section 74 - Interest on Tax Overpaid

Subsections (1) and (2) amend the definition of the term "residual income tax" in section 413A of the principal Act. Together they provide for any under- or overpayments of Family Support and GMFI tax credits to be taken into account when determining a taxpayer's eligibility for interest on overpaid provisional tax. The mechanics of the amendments are to add all tax credits received during the income year to the amount of income tax and surcharge payable and then to allow a deduction for the actual tax credit entitlement under sections 374D and 374E of the principal Act.

It should be noted that the amendment to the term "residual income tax" in section 413A of the principal Act (contained in this section) is quite different from thev amendment to that term in section 375 of the principal Act (contained in section 72 of this Amendment Act). While tax credits are ignored for the purposes of calculating provisional tax liabilities, they are fully taken into account in calculating interest on provisional tax overpayments.

Subsection (3) corrects a drafting ambiguity to ensure that the correct amount of overpaid provisional tax, in respect of which interest will be paid by the Commissioner, is the amount that remains to be refunded by the Commissioner of the difference between the provisional tax actually paid by the third instalment date and the amount of income tax payable by the taxpayer.

Subsection (4) provides for the amendments to first apply from 1 April 1988 and therefore affect any overpayment of 1989 provisional tax on which interest will be paid from the third instalment date.

### Section 75 - Transitional Provisions in relation to Provisional Tax

Subsections (1), (2), and (3) correct a drafting error in relation to the 1988/89 transitional arrangements applying to companies.

Subsection (1) defines "trustee income" as having the same meaning as in section 226 of the principal Act (as substituted by section 11 of this Amendment Act). This means that "trustee income" (but not beneficiary income for any beneficiary of that trust), in relation to any trust and any income year, is assessable income derived in that income year by a trustee of that trust. Subsection (2) applies the term "trustee income" to ensure that any company which is a trustee of a trust is not eligible to apply the transitional arrangement provided by subsection (3) in respect of any trustee income.

Subsection (3) allows companies who pay their 1988/89 provisional tax in accordance with section 377(1) (i.e. companies who do not estimate their provisional tax liability but pay on the basis of the previous year's tax) to make an adjustment to take into account the reduction in the company tax rate from 48 to 28 cents per dollar.

Subsection (4) allows provisional taxpayers, who are individuals and who earned more than $100,000 provisional income in the 1988/89 income year, to pay their 1989/90 provisional tax based on their 1988/89 residual income tax without the 10 percent uplift. This provision is to partially allow for the reduced individual tax rates which applied from 1 October 1988.

Subsection (5) allows companies who pay their 1989/90 provisional tax in accordance with section 381 (i.e. will not have furnished last year's tax return and will pay 1989/90 provisional tax based on 1987/88 residual income tax) to make an adjustment to take into account the reduction in the company tax rate from 48 to 28 cents per dollar.

Subsection (6) allows certain individuals who will pay their 1989/90 provisional tax in accordance with section 381 to pay an amount of provisional tax equal to 110 percent rather than 120 percent of 1987/88 residual income tax. This provision only applies in respect of a natural person who derived at least $100,000 provisional income in the 1987/88 income year.

A table incorporating all the existing and newly introduced transitional provisions is attached as Appendix B.

Subsection (7) repeals sections 22(1) and 22(2) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1988 which contained the transitional provisions replaced by subsections (1) to (3) of this section.

Subsection (8) deems the above provisions to have come into force on 7 November 1988 from when the new provisional tax rules first applied.

### Section 76 - Tenth Schedule

The Tenth Schedule deals with the calculation of the value of motor vehicles for FBT purposes. This section closes a loophole in that legislation.

At present under paragraph (e) of the Tenth Schedule, if an employee has access for private use to more than one motor vehicle of an employer, the liability for FBT is based on the average value of the vehicles available for use. Some employers have lowered their FBT liability by making a low value motor vehicle available to a group of employees who already have a motor vehicle supplied. Even though this vehicle may never be used, it lowers the FBT payable by lowering the average value of the vehicles available for the private use of each employee.

From the quarter commencing 1 January 1989, the only circumstance where averaging will be allowed under the Tenth Schedule will be where an employee is involved in the business of selling cars and the vehicles available for private use are trading stock. In other situations the liability for FBT for the provision of a motor vehicle will be based on the value of the vehicle primarily used by the employee or, if the employee does not primarily use one vehicle, the value of the highest valued vehicle available for the use of the employee.

### Appendix A

Depreciable Values of Motor Cars Purchased prior to 31 March 1987 - Operation of Formula in Section 110(3A)

Example

A car was sold in June 1986 resulting in depreciation recovered of $2,000. The depreciation recovered was offset against the cost of a replacement car purchased in June 1986 for $13,000.

If the "specified cost" rules had not applied for the 1987 income year the book value of the new car at 31 March 1987 would have been:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cost price: | 13,000 |
| Less depreciation recovered on previous car: | 2,000 |
| Balance: | 11,000 |
| Less depreciation at 20 percent: | 2,200 |
| Book Value at 31 March 1987: | 8,800 |

### Effect Under Legislation as Amended

The formula reads:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X (Y-Z) | +   | W   |
| Y   |

where-

X is the original cost, reduced by depreciation recovered on the previous vehicle.

Y is the specified cost, reduced by depreciation recovered on the previous vehicle.

Z is the depreciation on the motor car allowed in any income year which commenced prior to 1 April 1987, excluding depreciation recovered on the previous vehicle.

W is all depreciation allowed during and prior to the 1987 income year, including depreciation recovered on the sale of the previous motor car.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11,000 (9,000-1,800) | +   | 3,800 |
| 9,000 |

\= 12,600 (Deemed Cost Price)

On this basis the book value is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deemed cost price: | 12,600 |     |
| Less depreciation recovered: | 2,000 |     |
| Balance: | 10,600 |     |
| Less depreciation allowed in 1987: |     |     |
|     | (On specified cost of $11,000-$2,000) | 1,800 |
| Book Value at 31 March 1988: | 8,800 |     |

### Appendix B

### Charitable Trust Taxation

The following is the text of a press release issued on 30 August 1984 proposed amendments to section 61 (27) of the Income Tax Act 1976 concerning the exemption from tax of the business income of charities.

"Charitable Trusts Taxation - The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene, announced today that an amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 will be introduced during the current parliamentary session to remedy a deficiency in provisions relating to the taxation of the business income of certain charitable trusts.

Mr de Cleene explained that prior to 1982 the business income of a charitable trust was exempt from income tax except to the extent that it was applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand. In 1982 that exemption was narrowed in a manner designed to prevent the use of certain kinds of charitable trusts for tax avoidance purposes.

Under those measures where business assets have been settled in charitable trust and a settlor, trustee or an associated person of either of them is able to materially influence any benefit to be derived by himself, the trust loses the general charitable trust tax exemption.

It has since become evident however that the 1982 measure is not of itself sufficient to counter the use of a charitable trust for tax avoidance in certain cases where a beneficiary of the trust is a recognised charitable institution.

Notwithstanding that a charitable trust may fall outside the general tax exemption provisions, the trustees would not be liable for tax on the income which is paid and applied to the charitable beneficiary during the income year.

Mr de Cleene added that this was clearly an unintended result and legislation would be introduced this session to close the loophole.

The amendment, which it is proposed will have effect from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1984, will ensure that the measures to prevent tax avoidance through the use of charitable trusts are not frustrated.

An amendment would also be introduced to ensure that the 1982 measures apply to non-exempt charitable trusts on income derived from the income year that commenced on 1 April 1983, irrespective of the date the assets were settled.

Mr de Cleene added that this would also give effect to the original intention of the 1982 amendments."

#### **Confirmation of Previous Government Approvals to Amend Legislation**

"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene, announced today the Government's intention to proceed with certain 1984 taxation legislative proposals which were announced by the former Government before the general election. The proposals will be effected by way of amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976.

It is intended that the necessary amendments to the Income Tax Act will be introduced later during this parliamentary session. "The actual form of the amendments will not be available until then" said Mr de Cleene. He did, however, confirm that the broad details of the approvals is the same in all respects as announced by the previous Government.

Briefly the approvals are:

*   An amendment to close a loophole in relation to the deriving of interest on money lent. The present legislation does not cover the situation where money lent is paid or applied on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the borrower rather than being lent to him. This anomaly will be corrected with effect from 29 July 1983, being the commencement of the present regime for the taxation of interest.
*   An amendment to make it clear that payments of external examination fees, such as School Certificate fees made by parents of children attending private or integrated schools will no longer qualify for the School Fees Rebate. This will bring the situation into line with that where children attend state schools.
*   An amendment to exclude from the definition of taxable dividends two specific categories of company distributions to shareholders. The first category comprises distributions of assets made to shareholders on the winding up of a private company. The second concerns the tax consequences where a company incurs expenditure for the personal benefit of a shareholder.
*   An amendment to protect those low income earners who mistakenly furnish a return of income when they are not obliged to do so. In these cases any small amount of tax which would otherwise be payable will be extinguished.
*   An amendment to modify two of the conditions which must be met for a partnership to be entitled to claim a deduction for tax purposes of salary or wages paid to a partner. The amendment will remove an existing requirement that the partner be employed on a full time basis by the partnership. It will permit also the deduction of a bonus paid to the employed partner, whether or not the bonus has been predetermined and is specified in the terms of the partner's contract of service."

#### Deductibility of Accident Compensation Levies for Income Tax Purposes

"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene, announced today the Government's intention to amend the Income Tax Act during the current session to make it clear that Accident Compensation levies paid by employers and self-employed persons are deductible for income tax purposes, in the income year they become due and payable.

Mr de Cleene said that it was apparent there was a diversity of practice among employers and the self-employed as to the timing of the deduction of levies and in their annual accounts. Those practices ranged from the deduction of levies on an accruals basis by making provision in the accounts before the levies became due and payable to claiming the levies in the year they were paid.

He stated that the proposed amendment will clarify the position and will ensure that all levy payers adopt a common basis of approach in the claiming of levies as a deductible expense item.

Mr de Cleene said that the amendment will apply with respect to levies that become due and payable on or after 1 April 1985."

#### Phase Out of Export Incentives

The Parliamentary Under Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor de Cleene MP, today released details of the basis on which the export performance taxation incentives are to be removed. Mr de Cleene said that as previously announced, these incentives will be phased out on the same basis as that which was agreed to under CER in respect of the export of goods to Australia. This will affect each of the performance based taxation incentives in the following way.

#### Export Performance Incentive for Qualifying Goods

For the income years up to and including the year ending 31 March 1985 (or equivalent accounting year) the full incentive will be available. For the income year ending 31 March 1986 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be 50 percent of the assigned or specified percentage.

For the income year ending 31 March 1987 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be 25 percent of the assigned or specified percentage.

For the income year ending 31 March 1988 (or equivalent accounting year) and future years, no incentive will be available.

#### Export Performance Incentive for Qualifying Services

For the income years up to and including the year ending 31 March 1985 (or equivalent accounting year) the full incentive tax credit of 11.9 percent will be available.

For the income year ending 31 March 1986 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by 50 percent to a tax credit of 5.95 percent.

For the income year ending 31 March 1987 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by a further 50 percent to a tax credit of 2.975 percent.

For the income year ending 31 March 1988 (or equivalent accounting year) and future years, no incentive will be available.

#### Export Performance Incentive for Qualifying Tourist Services

For the income years up to and including the year ending 31 March 1985 (or equivalent accounting year) the full incentive tax credit of 10 percent will be available.

For the income year ending 31 March 1986 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by 50 percent to a tax credit of 5 percent.

For the income year ending 31 March 1987 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by a further 50 percent to a tax credit of 2.5 percent.

For the income year ending 31 March 1988 (or equivalent accounting year) and future years, no incentive will be available.

#### Export Performance Incentive for Qualifying Overseas Projects

For qualifying projects which commence up to or during the income year ending 31 March 1985 (or equivalent accounting year) the full incentive tax credit of 11.9 percent will be available, irrespective of the year in which the project is completed.

For qualifying projects which commence during the income year ending 31 March 1986 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by 50 percent to a tax credit of 5.95 percent. This rate will apply to the earnings from that project irrespective of the year in which it is completed.

For qualifying projects which commence during the income year ending 31 March 1987 (or equivalent accounting year) the incentive will be reduced by a further 50 percent to a tax credit of 2.975 percent. This rate will apply to the earnings from that project irrespective of the year in which it is completed.

For qualifying projects which commence during the income year ending 31 March 1988 (or equivalent accounting year) and future years no incentive will be available.

The incentive legislation will not be removed until all qualifying projects entered into prior to the end of the income year ending 31 March 1987 (or equivalent accounting year) have terminated.

Mr de Cleene explained that the reference to "accounting year" was needed because many exporters do not balance on 31 March for taxation purposes. "The end of the financial year for these taxpayers can vary from 1 October of the previous year to 30 September of the year under consideration. For this reason I have prepared a chart to show how the phase out will affect exporters who balance on a date other than 31 March".

The chart prepared by Mr de Cleene is set out below:

| Ending 31 March 1985 and Previous Years | Income Year Ending 31 March 1986 | Income Year Ending 31 March 1987 | Ending 31 March 1988 and Future Years |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounting year ending on any date between 1 October 1984 and 30 September 1985, or previously. | Accounting year ending on any date between 1 October 1985 and 30 September 1986. | Accounting year ending on any date between 1 October 1986 and 30 September 1987. | Accounting year ending on any date between 1 October 1987 and 30 September 1988, or thereafter. |
| Full incentives available. | Incentive available at the rate of 50 per cent of incentive percentage rate. | Incentive available at the rate of 25 per cent of incentive percentage rate. | No incentive available. |

"It can be seen from this chart that an exporter with a late balance date, say 31 August, will be eligible for the full incentives in respect of goods, services, etc., for the year ending 31 August 1985, half rates for the year ending 31 August 1986, quarter rates for the year ending 31 August 1987 and no incentive for those goods or services after that date," said Mr de Cleene. "On the other hand, an exporter with an early balance date, say 31 October, will be eligible for the full incentives for the year ending 31 October 1984, half rates for the year ending 31 October 1985, quarter rates for the year ending 31 October 1986 and no incentive after that date. While this may appear to provide substantial advantages to exporters who have had late balance dates, in fact these exporters had been disadvantaged in the past because they had to wait to gain benefits from changes to export incentives while those with the early balance dates had received an advantage. The export sales incentives were originally introduced with effect from the commencement of accounting years rather than from a set date, they had been amended on that basis in the past, and it would therefore be inequitable to terminate them on any other basis", Mr de Cleene said.

Mr de Cleene added that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has advised that he would not be accepting requests from exporters for changes from an earlier to a later balance date which would give an undue advantage over the phase out period.

Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1985
====================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1985 from PIB vol 136 May 1985.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 136, May 1985

Â 

### Introduction

The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1985 was enacted on 20 August 1985.

It removes, with some exceptions, the exemption from income tax, in the hands of shareholders, of capital distributions made by companies on or after 21 August 1985. The basis of the amendment is that distributions from capital reserves and share premium reserves will, if made to shareholders on or after 21 August 1985, be subject to tax in the hands of the recipient, irrespective of whether the capital gain was made before or after that date. The only exemption for distributions made on or after 21 August 1985 will be in respect of those distributions made on the _winding-up_ of a company (irrespective of when the capital gain arose) and even then only where the distribution is made to shareholders who are not "related companies" as defined.

As announced by the Minister of Finance the taxation of capital dividends in the hands of shareholders will apply as an interim measure until a full imputation system of company/shareholder income is implemented with effect from the 1988/89 income year.

### Section 1 - Short Title and Commencement

This section provides that the Amendment Act is to be read together with the Income Tax Act 1976 and that it forms part of that Act.

It further provides that the Amendment Act is to come into force on 21 August 1985. This means that, within the boundaries specified in the Amendment Act, the removal of the capital distributions exemption applies to such distributions made on or after that date.

### Section 2 - Meaning of the Term Dividend

_**A. Subsection (1)**_ is a machinery amendment arising from amendments made to section 4(1) of the principal Act by section 4(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985.

Under the 1985 "No 2 Act" amendment, section 4(1)(b) of the principal Act (which deems certain distributions of property, to a shareholder, to be dividends) was stated as NOT applying to the distribution of property to which section 4(1)(c) applied.

Section 4(1)(c), which deemed certain distributions to a shareholder on the winding up of the company to be a dividend, was in turn stated (in the proviso) as NOT applying to specified "in specie" distributions of assets made on winding up.

The overall effect was that when the "in specie distribution" exemption applied in accordance with the proviso to section 4(1)(c), it was nevertheless subject to section 4(1)(b) and the "in specie" distribution could, in theory, become a divided in terms of that section.

That inadvertent circularity has now been remedied.

Section 2(1) of the Amendment Act also provides that if section 4(5) as now amended (distributions of realised capital gains) of the principal Act applies, section 4(1)(b) of that Act will not apply. This amendment is designed to make it quite clear that section 4(1)(b) cannot be applied to _winding-up_ distributions of capital gains where they are otherwise exempted by the provisions of the amended section 4(5).

_**B. Subsections (2) - (5) - Capital Dividends**_

1.  **Tax Treatment of Capital Dividends Distributed Prior to 21 August 1985** - Prior to the coming into force of this Amendment Act, section 4 of the principal Act provided that, with three exceptions, all distributions to a shareholder, in excess of the amount paid up on shares were deemed dividends. The effect of the three exceptions was that the following distributions were tax free in the shareholders' hands:
    1.  The capital gain content of an "in specie" distribution of an asset _in the course of the winding up of a company_. (Proviso to section 4(1)(c).)
    2.  Premiums, paid to the company by shareholders, where:
        1.  The premium arose from a _cash_ payment made by a shareholder to the company for the purchase of shares issued at a premium, and
        2.  The premium did not arise with respect to the issue of shares in one company as consideration for the purchase of shares in another company. (Second proviso to section 4 of the principal Act.)
        3.  The premiums were credited to a share premium reserve in the company's account.
    3.  The profit arising from the realisation of a company asset, in excess of the cost of that asset to the company, and any other capital gains (section 4(5) of the principal Act). However, certain profits arising from realisations of assets between related parties are excluded from this exemption, except in the case of a private company where the asset is sold on winding-up to a related person, not being a company, by section 4(5A).

*   Although the amendment repeals the existing section 4(5) of the principal Act, the exemption for capital distributions made prior to 21 August 1985 is preserved by the new sections 4(5)(a)(i) and 4(5)(b)(i) of the principal Act.

2.  **Tax Treatment of Capital Distributions Subsequent to 20 August 1985**
    *   With the exception of certain distributions upon the winding-up of a company (see paragraph (3) below) all company distributions on or after 21 August 1985 are taxable in the shareholders' hands.

3.  **Tax Treatment of Capital Distributions on Winding-up Subsequent to 20 August 1985**
    *   _In specie Distributions_ _**Subsection (2)**_ of the Amendment Act relates to "in specie" distributions. It provides that the capital gain content of "in specie" distributions on winding up will continue to be tax exempt _except_ when the distribution is made by a "specified company" within the meaning of section 4(5A) to any related company.
    *   _Share Premium Reserves_ _**Subsection (3)**_ limits the application, of the second proviso to section 4(1) of the principal Act (share premium reserves), to distributions, to individuals or non-related companies, made upon the winding up of a company. Such distributions from share premium reserves, upon winding up, will be tax exempt.
    *   _Realised Capital Profits and Other Capital Gains_ _**Subsection (4)**_ repeals the existing subsection (5) of the principal Act and replaces it with a new subsection (5). The new section 4(5) contains the following provisions relating to distributions on or after 21 August 1985. _**Subsection (5)(a)(ii)**_ of the principal Act relates to distributions made from realised capital profits of a company. It restricts the exemption of such distributions in the hands of shareholders to those made by companies upon _winding-up_ (section 4(1)(c) of the principal Act) and then excludes from this exemption such distributions if they are made to related companies. _**Subsection (5)(b)(ii)**_ of the principal Act relates to distributions from capital profits or gains derived by a company other than by way of realisation of an asset. This provision restricts the exemption, so that it applies only to such distributions made by companies upon _winding-up_. (Section 4(1)(c) of the principal Act.) Here again, the exemption does not apply to a distribution made to a related company.

4.  **Meaning of the Term "Related Company"** Distributions during winding up will _not_ be tax exempt in the shareholders' hands where the distribution is made _to a company_ which:
    1.  Owns, or has the power to control, or the right to acquire 20 percent or more of the ordinary shares of the company which makes the distribution. (Section 4(5B)(a)(i).)
    2.  Owns, or has the power to control, or the right to acquire 20 percent or more of the voting rights of the company which makes the distribution. (Section 4(5B)(a)(ii).)
    3.  Is a company of which:
        *   The shares are owned to the extent of 20 percent or more by any shareholders who own or control or have the right to acquire 20 percent or more of the shares or the voting rights of the company which makes the distribution, or
        *   The voting rights are able to be controlled to the extent of 20 percent or more by shareholders who own, control, or have the right to acquire 20 percent or more of the shares or the voting rights of the company which makes the distribution. (Paragraph (c) could apply where a company held less than 20 percent of the shares in the company making the distribution but the companies also had common shareholders.) (Section 4(5B)(a)(v).)

5.  **The Taxable Status of Distributions to Shareholders that are Related Companies**
    *   As already explained, distributions made on or after 21 August 1985 upon the winding up of a company, to shareholders that are related companies, are not exempt from income tax. This is designed to inhibit the "artificial" winding up of companies as a means of using the winding-up provisions in order to distribute capital reserves and thus avoid tax on dividends. When such a distribution is made to a shareholder that is a related company that distribution, received as a dividend, will (although it may be exempted by section 63 of the principal Act from income tax in the hands of the shareholder company) constitute a dividend when distributed subsequently to the shareholders of that related company. This will apply even if that latter distribution is made upon the winding-up of that related company.

6.  **Amendment to the Related Persons Test**
    *   _Subsection (5)_ of the Amendment Act expands the application of subsection (5B) of section 4 of the principal Act which, for certain purposes within section 4, defines when a person is a "person related" to a company. Consequent upon this amendment subsection (5B) will, on or after 21 August 1985, apply for the purposes of each of the following:
        1.  The proviso to section 4(1)(c) of the principal Act ("in specie" distributions on winding-up).
        2.  The second proviso to section 4(1) of the principal Act (distributions, on winding-up, of qualifying share premium reserves).
        3.  Section 4(5) of the principal Act (distributions, on winding-up, of realised capital gains).

*   This expanded application of subsection (5B) is relevant to the amendment that is made by each of the subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this Amendment Act which insert in the appropriate places, in each of the provisions (of section 4) referred to at (a), (b) and (c) above, the following words: "(not being a shareholder that is a company that, where the company first mentioned in this subsection is a specified company within the meaning of subsection (5A) of this section, is a person related thereto or that, if the said first-mentioned company were a specified company within the said meaning, would be a person related thereto)." See also, in this regard, paragraph 4 above.

_**C. Subsections (6) and (7) - Bonus Share Issues**_

_**Subsections (6) and (7)**_ of this Amendment Act make amendments to section 3 of the principal Act ("meaning of term bonus issue"). Bonus share issues made after 20 August 1985 from capital gains or from share premium reserves will constitute "bonus issues" for income tax purposes. The effect will be that if a reduction or repayment of capital occurs within 10 years after the making of such a bonus issue, the bonus issue will be treated as a dividend in terms of section 4(1)(ca).

_**D. Subsection (8)**_

_**Subsection (8)**_ of this Amendment Act consequently repeals previous amendments that, on the enactment of this Amendment Act, became spent.

_**E. Non-Resident Withholding Tax**_

As a result of this amendment distributions to non-resident shareholders from capital reserves and share premium reserves are subject to non-resident withholding tax as from the date on which the exemption was removed.

_**Summary**_

The treatment of various distributions upon the winding up of a company in terms of the Amendment Act is summarised as follows:

**The Income Tax Position in Relation to Distributions Made on or After 21 August 1985**

The following gives a guide to the income tax status of such distributions, in the hands of shareholders.

1.  "In specie" distributions to individuals and non-related companies:
    *   Not taxable (proviso to section 4(1)(c)).
2.  "In specie" distributions to related companies:
    *   Taxable (section 4(1) (c)).
3.  Distributions to individuals and non-related companies from profits resulting from arms-length realisations of assets:
    *   Not taxable (section 4(5)(a)(ii)).
4.  Distributions to related companies from profits resulting from arms-length realisations of assets:
    *   Taxable (section 4(1)(c)).
5.  Distributions from qualifying share premium reserves to individuals or non-related companies:
    *   Not taxable (second proviso to section 4(1)).
6.  Distributions from share premium reserves to related companies:
    *   Taxable (section 4(1)(c)).
7.  Distributions, whether to individuals or to related or non-related companies, from profits arising from realisations of assets to related persons:
    *   Taxable (section 4(1)(c)). However, note that under the proviso to section 4(5A), distributions by private companies are _not taxable_ where made to individuals or non-related companies from profits arising from a realisation of an asset to a related person, other than to a related person that is a company.
8.  Distributions by private companies to related companies from profits arising from realisation of assets to related persons:
    *   Taxable (section 4(1)(c)).

NgÄ mÅhiohio tÄke moni whiwhi Income tax information
====================================================

The income tax information on this will be refreshed on 1 May each year.

If you're not linked to a client for income tax, all fields in this section will be blank. This report may not match your extension of time (EOT) dashboard results in myIR as there is additional information that goes into this calculation. For example, if you file an income tax return for a client and are then delinked from that client, you will still get a count for that client's return in your EOT dashboard.

Current year EOT status
-----------------------

This will show the client's EOT status for the income tax period shown in the report header information. If the client does not have an income tax period open, this field will be blank.

Individual filing group
-----------------------

The individual filing group will display an individualâs filing expectation.

To determine this grouping, we evaluate active links to other entities and any active income types in the clientâs income profile relevant to the income year.

Based on changes from the 2020 income year there are two main individual filing groups for clients of tax agents â depending on whether they are qualifying individuals or non-qualifying individuals:

*   Auto issued - more info (includes Working for Families, schedular income and nil income clients)
*   Return filer (IR3)

[Tax Technical - TIB May 2019](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-31---2019/tib-vol31-no4)

A client will only show as Auto assessed or No assessment required if they are linked to a tax agent after the grouping evaluation has been run.

Note: The Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) section of the client list report will identify any of your clients who were principal child carers or a partner (or ex-partner) for WfFTC.

Below is a list of all Individual filing groups, as well as an explanation of what each means.

### Auto issued - more info

This indicates that an Income tax â more information request letter has been generated for the client. Every letter needs to be reviewed, updated with any other income or expenses and finalised within the required timeframe.

If we do not hear from you or your client within the set timeframe, weâll assume the information is correct and release the income tax assessment. Once finalised you will receive an income tax assessment.

If you add non-reportable income into the customers assessment, eg. rental income, we will change them to an IR3 filer in the system when we process the return â but the âauto issued â more infoâ indicator will remain on the customer so we can ensure your client has until the terminal tax due date to repay any refund they might have received as a result of an original assessment.

The Return expected? column will display No, and the Current year lodgement date column will show the date the more info request was generated. This date will change once the more info request has been finalised.

If you have been granted an extension of time, you will have until 31 March to review and finalise the more info request (if you were linked at the time this was generated).

If there is no extension of time or the client linked after the letter was generated, you have 45 days from the issue date.

### Return filer (IR3)

This indicates that weâre expecting an Individual income tax return - IR3 for this client.

This filing expectation has been generated as we have non-reportable income active in a clientâs income profile.

To see clients that need to file an IR3, you can filter the Return expected? column to Yes. The Current year lodgement date will be blank until we receive the return, at which point it will show the date we received it.

### Change of filing expectation

If you file an IR3 return for a client who had an âAuto issued - more info' we will change their assessment to an IR3 filer in the system when we process the return â but the âauto issued â more infoâ indicator will remain on the customer, so we can ensure your client has until the terminal tax due date to repay any refund they might have received as a result of an original assessment.

Adding non-reportable income, eg. Rental income will update the clients income source to ensure theyâre correctly selected as an IR3 filer for future years.

### Blank

The column may be blank if you're not linked to the client for income tax, or if their income tax account is ceased.

It might also be blank in the first few weeks of a new tax year, if we have not yet started issuing Income tax â more information request letters for the previous tax year. This will be updated as more are issued.

Return expected?
----------------

This column will display for all clients that youâre linked to for income tax, to indicate whether we're expecting an income tax return from that client (individual and non-individual clients). This column will display Yes or No. If youâre not linked to a client for income tax, this column will be blank.

All individual clients have a filing expectation either an Income tax - more information request or an IR3 depending on their income sources.

### Yes

If the Return expected? column is marked as Yes, we're expecting an income tax return to be filed for this client. You can see if the return has been received under the Current year return lodgement date. The Return expected? column will not change to No once we receive a return.

### No

If the Return expected? column is marked as No, we will not be expecting an income tax return from the client.

This may be because the:

*   client is exempt from filing
*   client is a non-active trust or company
*   clientâs income tax account is ceased
*   company is struck off
*   the client is deceased.

For the last 3 points, consider if these clients can now be delinked as they may have no future tax obligations.

This column includes individual clients that we have issued an Income tax - more information request letter for.

In some instances, clients who have received a notification that they need to file an income tax return will be marked as not needing to file. This will happen if we receive new information indicating that the client no longer needs to file a return.

Current year return lodgement date
----------------------------------

This will show the date received for income tax returns or the date an Income tax - more information request has been generated for the period shown in the report header. The column will be blank if the return has not been received. More information on the specifics of this column is available under Individual filing group above.

Notice of assessment issued
---------------------------

This will display a Yes for any clients who have been issued a Notice of assessment (NOA) for the income tax period shown in the report header. This will only issue if we make changes to the income tax assessment once it has been filed. All other clients will display No.

Provisional tax method
----------------------

This will display the current provisional tax method for the income tax period shown in the report header. If the client does not need to pay provisional tax for the period, or if provisional tax has not yet been calculated, this column will be blank.

Loss carried forward
--------------------

This will display the value of any loss calculated in the period prior to the one showing in the report header information. If the client does not have any losses from the previous year, this column will be blank.

Excess imputation carried forward
---------------------------------

This will display the value of any excess imputation credits in the period prior to the one showing in the report header information. If there is no excess imputation from the previous year, this column will be blank.

Previous year ICA/MAC balance

National standard costs for specified livestock determination 2016
==================================================================

2016 Determination setting the National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock (NSC).

This determination may be cited as the Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 2016.

This determination applies in respect of the valuation of specified livestock under the national standard cost scheme for the 2015-2016 income years and subsequent income years.

This determination varies the [Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1993 and the Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1994](/internet/ird/technical-tax/determinations/livestock/national-standard/livestock-nat-std-index.html)
 by replacing, wherever they appear in these determinations, the following words:

"purchased"Â Â  toÂ Â Â Â Â Â  "acquired"

"purchase"Â Â Â Â  toÂ Â Â Â Â Â  "acquisition"

"sales"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  toÂ Â Â Â Â Â  "disposals"

This determination is signed by Rob Wells on 14 March 2016.

### **Note to Determination**

Section EC 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows the Commissioner ("the CIR") to issue a determination stating the methods that may be used to calculate the value of specified livestock under the national standard cost scheme. The matters that may be included in such a determination are set out in section 91AAD of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA"). To date these sections have been used to issue two determinations; the [Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1993 and the Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1994](/internet/ird/technical-tax/determinations/livestock/national-standard/livestock-nat-std-index.html)
_._ These determinations set out the methods used to calculate the cost of specified livestock, details of the provisions that apply to these valuations, the inventory system requirements under the national standard cost scheme, and the requirements for movement between national standard cost and other livestock valuation schemes.

Section 91AAD(9) of the TAA allows the CIR to vary the contents of determinations made under these sections. This subsection is here being utilised to vary the above determinations by issuing the _Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 2016 ("the 2016 determination")._

The variations contained in the 2016 determination replace the words "purchase" (to "acquisition"), "purchased" (to "acquired") and "sales" (to "disposals") and are made to confirm, for the avoidance of any doubt, that these transactions include those that involve the receipt or payment of non-monetary (as well as monetary) consideration. These changes are made as part of wider wording changes listed in _Schedule 3_ of the _Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-2016, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016._

Although the Commissioner acknowledges that the replacement words are capable of having a wide meaning, solely for the purposes of this determination it is emphasised that to come within the words used the transaction must be made for "consideration", whether that consideration be in money or some other form.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is therefore confirmed that the words used **do not** include the acquisition of homebred livestock or livestock that has been gifted inter-generationally or donated. In addition, the words used **do not** include the disposal of livestock that dies or is culled and is disposed of on-farm or to still-born livestock ("slinks"). Although slinks are generally sold for monetary consideration, it is the Commissionerâs view that being still-born, slinks are not livestock and therefore not subject to any of the national standard costs for livestock determinations. Note however that amounts received for slinks should continue to be treated as part of the ordinary business income of a farmer.

Income Tax Withholding Payments Regulations 1975
================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax Withholding Payments Regulations 1975 from PIB vol 83 Apr 1975.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 83, April 1975

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Introduction

New Regulations were recently gazetted which consolidate and extend the existing withholding payments regulations. The following are now included in the withholding tax system -

### Non-Resident Entertainers And Sportsmen

Payments made on or after 1 April 1975 by agents and entrepreneurs to visiting overseas entertainers and sportsmen are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 20 cents in the dollar. Overseas promoters who provide the services of the entertainer or sportsman will also be subject to the withholding tax. The withholding tax is to be deducted by the agent or entrepreneur from the gross payments and in those cases where the payments are the only income derived from New Zealand, the non-resident entertainer or sportsman need not furnish a return and the withholding tax will be final. However, where the withholding tax deducted is considered by the taxpayer to be excessive, he may elect to furnish a return of income and tax will then be assessed at annual rates on the net income.

The kinds of activities which are subject to the withholding tax include any activity or performance in connection with -

*   any sporting event or competition including motor racing, motor car rallies, motor cycle racing, motor boat racing, horse racing or trotting,
*   lectures, speeches, or talks,
*   performances by actors, entertainers, musicians, singers, dancers, comperes or other artistes whether alone or in choirs, choruses, bands, orchestras, ballets or other entertainment groups.

The above activities also include performances or appearances on television, radio or any film.

### Activities Exempt From Withholding Tax

Payments in respect of the following activities or performances will be exempt from withholding tax -

*   cultural programmes sponsored by an overseas government or the Government of New Zealand,
*   programmes of a foundation, trust or organisation which exists for the promotion of any cultural activity provided it is not carried on for private pecuniary profit,
*   any game or sport where the participants are the official representatives of an association, league, union, or other body which administers the game or sport in an overseas country.

Applications for exemption should be sent to the Auckland Tax Office.

### Relief Provided Under Certain Double Taxation Agreements

Double taxation agreements in existence with Canada, Sweden and the USA may in certain circumstances grant relief from New Zealand tax on the income of non-resident entertainers. Where an overseas entertainer is a resident of one of these countries our Auckland Tax Office will be glad to advise on the liability for New Zealand tax. Other double taxation agreements in existence do not affect New Zealand's right to tax the non-resident entertainer or sportsman.

### Tax Deduction Certificate IR13

This form is to be used when making deductions of withholding tax. The tax deductions are to be paid into any tax office or post office with savings bank facilities by the 20th of the following month. Payment should be made on form IR66N.

### Returns For Non-Resident Entertainers To Be Sent To Auckland Tax Office

The Auckland Tax Office will continue to deal with tax returns of non-resident entertainers.

Copies of the new Regulations (SR 1975/48) are available from the Government Bookshop.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 90, May 1977

### Labour Only Contractors Including Fishermen

### The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1975, Amendment No. 1

### Introduction

New Regulations were recently gazetted which -

*   increase the rate of withholding tax on labour only contracts for carpenters from 10 percent to 20 percent;
*   extend the withholding tax system to -
    *   certain other labour only contracts within the building industry;
    *   payments made to fishermen;
*   makes a minor drafting amendment in relation to the existing withholding tax provisions on overseas entertainers.

### Application Date of Withholding Tax

The Regulations apply with respect to withholding payments made on or after 1 April 1977, notwithstanding that the payments may relate to a period that commenced before that date.

Copies of the new Regulations (SR 1976/306) are available from the Government Bookshop.

### Labour Only Contracts

The following labour only contracts are included in the Regulations from 1 April 1977 and gross payments for work done or services rendered in relation to these contracts will also be subject to a withholding tax at the rate of 20 cents in the dollar -

*   fixing of roofs and the fixing of steel
*   erection of fences, laying of concrete, bricks, block, stones, etc
*   painting, plastering, wallpapering and decorating
*   installation of wallboards, fibrous plaster and other interior linings
*   laying of carpets, tiles and other floor coverings

### Fishermen

Payments made to fishermen under contracts, arrangements or profit sharing agreements which are for the supply of labour in operating or maintaining any fishing boat, will be subject to withholding tax at the rate of 20 cents in the dollar.

### Deduction of Withholding Tax

The withholding tax will be deducted from the gross payments made. With most contracts this will generally be the amount payable for the services rendered. In the case of fishermen where payments are often made on a "share of catch" basis after taking into account a proportionate share of boat operating costs, the withholding tax will be deducted from the actual payments made.

### Exemptions From Withholding Tax

These will include payments -

*   of salary or wages or other emoluments from which ordinary PAYE is deducted;
*   made to persons in business on their own account and who pay provisional tax and have a certificate of exemption IR118.
*   made to companies.

### ACC Levy

The liability to pay Accident Compensation Levy both by employers and self-employed, as the case may be, will not be affected by the requirement to deduct withholding tax. Who is responsible for the payment of the Accident Compensation Levy in any particular case will continue to depend - as in the past - on whether the contract between the parties is one of service (employee) or for service (self employed).

### Tax Deduction Certificate IR13

This form is to be used when making deductions of withholding tax. The tax deductions are to be paid into any tax office or post office with savings bank facilities by the 20th of the following month. Payment should be made on form IR66N.

Income under ordinary tax rules

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

When you receive an amount of money, it can be hard to know if it is income and how to account for it. Many amounts you receive will be easy to identify as income because specific rules apply. Examples include interest and dividends and amounts that come under the bright-line rules.

If you receive an amount that does not have a specific rule, it may be income under the general income rules.

An amount can be income under more than 1 rule, but it is only taxed once.

The amount that is taxable is the sale price less the cost of the item sold.

Ordinary income
---------------

The ordinary concept of income includes that:

*   income is something that comes in
*   income amounts repeat or are regular
*   an amount is income depending on factors like the relationship you have with the payer, why you got the payment, and how much you rely on the payment.

When we assess income this way it is sometimes called âincome under ordinary conceptsâ.

Read about income under ordinary concepts in IS 23/11 Income tax: Income â when gifts are assessable incomeÂ 

[IS 23/11 Income tax: Income â when gifts are assessable income](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/2023/is-23-11)
Â 

Income from a business
----------------------

Amounts earned from a business are income.

When you are thinking about whether or not a business exists you need to look at 2 issues.

*   The nature of the activity
*   The intentions of the person doing the activity, which includes looking to see if there is an intention to make a profit.

When looking to see whether the activity is a business we consider:

*   the intent to make a profit
*   the time, money and effort you have put into the activity
*   the nature of the activity, for example selling or providing goods or services on a regular basis
*   whether records are kept to monitor the financial status of the activity
*   the amount of money earned from the activity
*   the scale of operations, the volume of transactions, and the pattern of activity
*   if the activity is run in a similar way to most businesses in the same trade
*   the length of time that has been spent on doing the activity.

### Income from a business of dealing in personal property

Amounts earned from a business of dealing in personal property are also income. When a person earns an amount from selling an asset, the amount is income if they deal in similar items as part of the trading stock of their business.

### Income from a profit-making schemeÂ 

Amounts earned from carrying on or carrying out a profit-making scheme is income.

A scheme is a course of action, a series of steps, or an enterprise directed to a result. The words suggest activities that are co-ordinated by plan or purpose.

The plan or purpose must be clear and have some agreement of ideas but does not need to be precise - a generalised plan is all that is needed.

Also, any intent of making a profit must be the dominant or main intent. If it applies, any profits are only taxable from the time you start the scheme.

Personal property you acquired for disposal
-------------------------------------------

An amount earned from selling personal property, such as shares, gold, and crypto assets is income if that property was bought with the main or dominant purpose of selling it.

You do not have to be in business for the profit to be income. If the main reason you bought the asset was to sell it, then the profit is taxable.

You may need to prove to us what your purpose(s) for getting the asset was.

When we look at the main or dominant purpose for buying an asset, weâll look at what you say your purpose was and also the supporting facts. We may take into account factors including:

*   the type of asset sold
*   other work that is ordinarily undertaken
*   reasons for buying and then selling the asset
*   the number of similar transactions
*   the length of time the asset was held
*   the circumstances of the use and sale of the asset.

Get tax advice
--------------

Most of the time youâll know if an amount you receive is income under 1 of the general rules. If youâre unsure we recommend you speak to a tax professional.

Te ratonga moni whiwhi Income service
=====================================

The income service enables digital service providers to retrieve a customerâs income profile data reported to Inland Revenue.Â 

How the income service works
----------------------------

The income service enables access to a customer's income and tax data from all known income sources for a specific date range. It returns income data that consists of the income source, date income was recognised, income type, amount, and any deductions from that income.

Income data is accessible by an intermediary who's linked to the customerâs income tax account or the customer to whom the income belongs.

When integrated through our gateway services it can be used to match investment and income data to what we have recorded.

Inconsistent treatment challenge not struck out
===============================================

2015 case note â Inconsistency of treatment challenge by Michael Hill group of companies - Strike out, inconsistent treatment, administrative law, invalidity.

Case

Michael Hill Finance (NZ) Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules 2008

### Summary

The Michael Hill group of companies entered into a transaction in which it transferred its intellectual property and franchising operations within the group from New Zealand to Australia, using an Australian Limited Partnership (âALPâ) as part of the finance structure. Michael Hill Finance (NZ) Ltd (âMichael Hillâ) owned 95% of the ALP and had applied for a binding ruling on the application of the Income Tax Act 2007, including sÂ BG1, the tax avoidance provision. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (âthe Commissionerâ) formed the view that s BG1 applied. Michael Hill then amended its ruling application to exclude consideration of s BG1 and self-assessed on the basis that sÂ BG1 applied. It proposed an adjustment to the self-assessment which the Commissioner rejected. Michael Hill then filed challenge proceedings on two grounds - that the Commissioner was inconsistent with her treatment of Michael Hill compared to other taxpayers using the same, or materially the same, ALP structure and the Commissionerâs treatment of the transaction is wrong in that it is not tax avoidance. The Commissioner applied to strike out the inconsistency grounds of the challenge. The High Court dismissed the strike-out application.

### Impact

Michael Hillâs inconsistency challenge will be heard as part of its substantive challenge to the Commissionerâs refusal to accept its proposed adjustments. Should Michael Hillâs inconsistency challenge ultimately be successful, the Commissioner may be required to treat materially similarly placed taxpayers consistently, regardless of the correctness of the tax assessment.

Taxpayers may be able to challenge the Commissioner on the basis that they have been treated inconsistently with other taxpayers in materially similar positions. Further, it is possible that the courts may not limit the types of administrative law challenges that may be brought within the Part 8A Tax Administration Act 1994 challenge procedure.

The Commissioner has appealed to the Court of Appeal and, at the date of this issue of the _Tax Information Bulletin_, the appeal is still pending.

### Facts

The Commissioner made an application for an order striking out the part of Michael Hillâs challenge which alleges that the Commissioner breached a duty to treat taxpayers consistently (the inconsistency challenge).

In December 2008, the Michael Hill group of companies entered into a transaction in which it transferred its intellectual property and franchising operations within the group from New Zealand to Australia. An ALP was used as part of the finance structure. Michael Hill owns 99.5% of the ALP. The ALP was used to create asymmetric tax treatment in the relevant years. The effect of this was that in both New Zealand and Australia there were deductions and that the Australian deduction was not assessable income in New Zealand.

Michael Hill applied for a binding ruling from the Commissioner on the application of the Income Tax Act 2007 (âITAâ), including s BG 1, to the transaction. A binding ruling was provided in relation to the âblack letterâ tax treatment of the structure, but the Commissioner formed the view that s BG 1 applied.

Michael Hill amended its application for a binding ruling to exclude consideration of s BG 1, and then self-assessed the tax liability on the basis that s BG 1 did apply. Subsequently, Michael Hill proposed an adjustment to its self-assessment. The Commissioner rejected Michael Hillâs proposed adjustment by issuing a notice of response.

Michael Hill then initiated challenge proceedings on the following grounds:

1.  _An inconsistency challenge_: Michael Hill alleges the Commissioner has taken an inconsistent approach in her treatment of Michael Hill and other taxpayers who have used the same, or materially the same, ALP structures in breach of her duty to treat all similarly placed taxpayers alike.
2.  _A correctness challenge_: Michael Hill says the Commissioner's treatment of the transaction is wrong in law in that it is not a tax avoidance arrangement.

The Commissioner accepted the correctness challenge was an orthodox challenge but applied to strike out the inconsistency challenge on the basis it could not stand alone as a valid ground for challenge.

For the purposes of the strike-out application, Toogood J assumed the following facts to be true:

1.  There are a number of transactions by other taxpayers that are materially the same as the Michael Hill transaction.
2.  Those other transactions have the same tax effects.
3.  The Commissioner has, in relation to those other transactions, provided binding rulings that s BG 1 does not apply to certain of them, or made a decision not to investigate certain of them, or investigated certain of the other transactions and formed the view that s BG 1 does not have an application to them.

**_Michael Hill's position_**

Michael Hill's position was that the inconsistency in treatment should lead to a declaration that the Commissioner has acted unlawfully in rejecting Michael Hills' proposed adjustments, and as a consequence the assessments are unlawful; or that pursuant to s 138P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), a determination that each of the assessments be cancelled, reduced or modified, or otherwise varied, or a direction that the Commissioner alter each of the assessments in a way that conforms with the Court's determination.

**_The Commissioner's position_**

The Commissioner's position was that the inconsistency challenge is a collateral attack on assessments, which is untenable and unarguable because there is no basis in law to adjust an otherwise correct assessment on the grounds of inconsistent treatment as between taxpayers; the Court will determine the correctness of the assessments in issue by the way of a de novo hearing that is curative of any defects; and the inconsistency challenge does not fall within the narrow category of cases that would not turn on correctness.

### Decision

**_Issue one_**

The first issue was whether there was an arguable case that the Commissioner has an enforceable duty to act consistently.

Toogood J was not persuaded that Michael Hillâs position was inarguable. It was, he said, consistent with the treatment of the consistency principle in New Zealand case law and also academic opinion.

As Toogood J read the case law, there are essentially two questions to be answered when a claim of inconsistency is made against the Commissioner:

1.  First, are the facts or circumstances identical for all material purposes, such that there is a true inconsistency because the assessments or rulings at issue cannot be reconciled as a matter of law?
2.  Second, if there appears to have been inconsistent treatment, is the discrepancy explicable and not unfair?

**_Issue two_**

The second issue was whether the facts of the challenge make it untenable that Michael Hill could succeed in enforcing such any such duty.

Toogood J found that, on the current pleadings, the pleaded facts (which for the purposes of the strike-out application are assumed to be provable) did not render the inconsistency argument untenable.

**_Issue three_**

The third issue was whether ss 109 and 114 of the TAA prevent a taxpayer from raising administrative law grounds in challenge proceedings except in "exceptional circumstances".

The Commissioner argued that the effect of ss 109 and 114 of the TAA, and the decision of the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158 (â_Tannadyce_â), was to limit the ability of a taxpayer to raise administrative law grounds in challenge proceedings other than in âexceptional circumstancesâ, and that _Tannadyce_ cannot be said to have expanded the Court of Appeal decision in _Westpac Banking Corp v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] NZCA 24 (â_Westpac_â).

Toogood J found that it was distinctly arguable that the test in _Westpac_ was not the test that determines whether an invalidity challenge is properly brought within Part 8A of the TAA, and that in any event the majority in _Tannadyce_ appeared to have overruled the test in _Westpac_.Â 

It was at least arguable that the Supreme Courtâs decision in _Tannadyce_ allowed Michael Hill to bring a challenge under Part 8A of the TAA on inconsistency grounds. It was arguable that there are no limitations on the types of administrative law challenges that may be brought within the Part 8A procedure.

**_Issue four_**

The fourth issue was, in challenge proceedings, whether a finding that the Commissioner's decision was correct trumps any invalidity which might otherwise result from a breach of the duty of inconsistency.

Toogood J found it was arguable that a taxpayer was not prevented from raising administrative law grounds of challenge despite a claim by the Commissioner that the correctness of the decision remedies any invalidity resulting from the decision-making process.

**_Issue five_**

The fifth issue was whether the inconsistency challenge should be struck out.

On the basis of his conclusions for issues one through four, Toogood J did not consider it plain and obvious that Michael Hillâs inconsistency challenge could not succeed, and dismissed the Commissionerâs application to strike it out. He also awarded costs to Michael Hill on a category 2B basis, plus disbursements.

The Commissioner has appealed the decision and at the date of this _Tax Information Bulletin_, the appeal is still pending.

Incorporated societies-carrying forward and grouping tax losses
===============================================================

2005 amendment to definition of 'special corporate entity' allows incorporated societies to carry forward tax losses and offset against companies in the same group.

**_Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 2004, new sections OD 3(4) and OD 3(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and section 8B of the Income Tax Act 1976_**

### Introduction

The definition of "special corporate entity" has been amended to include incorporated societies that have no shares on issue to members of the society. The effect of this amendment is to allow such incorporated societies to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group.

The amendments also allow commonly owned incorporated societies to offset income and losses for the 1997-98 to 2002-03 income years.

### Background

The amendments ensure that incorporated societies which are treated as companies for tax purposes, can access the same provisions that allow other corporate entities to carry forward losses and offset them against those of companies in the same group.

Before 1992, incorporated societies were able to carry forward and offset their tax losses. In 1992, the loss carrying forward rules were substantially overhauled. An unintended consequence of this overhaul was that incorporated societies were now required to satisfy the shareholder continuity test in order to access the loss provisions.

Incorporated societies may not satisfy the shareholder continuity test on the grounds that they do not issue shares and previously could not be exempted from this requirement as they did not fall within the definition of "special corporate entity". Since 1992, some incorporated societies have applied the loss provisions as if they applied to them, while others have followed the letter of the law.

### Key features

The definition of "special corporate entity" in section OB 1 of the 1994 and 2004 Acts has been amended to include any body incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 that has no shares on issue to members of the society. A similar amendment has been made to section 8G of the Income Tax Act 1976. This allows incorporated societies to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses against those of companies in the same group.

New section OD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows commonly owned incorporated societies that do not issue shares to offset income and losses within the same group of companies for the 1997-98 to 2002-03 income years. This provision treats a member of an incorporated society that does not issue shares as holding a share, and these shares carry all the shareholder decision making rights. The result is that a voting interest is created that can be used for the purposes of subpart IG of the Act.

New section OD 3(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ensures that incorporated societies that applied new section OD 3(4), do not breach continuity upon being treated as a "special corporate entity" in the 2003-04 income year.

### Application date

The amendment allowing incorporated societies to carry forward losses and offset income and losses against those of companies in the same group has two application dates:

*   In relation to the carry forward of tax losses, the amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year.
*   In relation to the offsetting of income and losses by incorporated societies and companies that are in the same group, the amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year if the society has, before 29 March 2004 (date of introduction of the bill), filed a tax return and the society has adopted a tax position in that return that is consistent with the proposed amendments.

The amendment that allows commonly owned incorporated societies to offset income and losses, applies from the 1997-98 income year to the 2002-03 income year if the incorporated societies have taken this tax position in relation to tax returns filed for those years.
