This statement is about organisations having “donee organisation” status under s LD 3(2)(a). Donee organisation status means that, subject to some limits, donors of monetary gifts to the organisation can obtain tax advantages. The tax advantage for natural persons is a refundable tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of gifts of $5 or more under ss LD 1 and LD 2. Companies and Māori authorities can qualify for a deduction for the amount of the gift under ss DB 41 or DV 12. 2. Generally, organisations can obtain donee organisation status in two main ways. They can meet the requirements of s LD 3(2)(a) or they can be added to the list of overseas donee organisations appearing in sch 32. 3. This statement concerns donee organisations under s LD 3(2)(a). To qualify as a donee organisation under s LD 3(2)(a), an organisation must be: a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: In this statement “charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural” purposes are collectively referred to as “specified” purposes. Also, gifts eligible for tax advantages, defined in s LD 3(1) as “charitable or other public benefit gifts”, are referred to as “gifts” or “donations”. 4. This statement seeks to clarify aspects of the interpretation of s LD 3(2)(a) that the Commissioner is aware have given rise to uncertainty. That is, the meaning of “whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to \[specified\] purposes within New Zealand”. In doing so, this statement concludes on approaches to the legislation that donee organisations can feel confident are consistent with the Commissioner’s view of the meaning of the legislation. 5. Section LD 3(2) includes paragraphs other than para (a) that also confer donee organisation status in specific cases. For example, s LD 3(2)(bb) can apply to a board of trustees under the Education Act 1989. This statement does not apply to donee organisation status arising under any paragraph of s LD 3(2) other than para (a). This statement also does not apply to overseas donee organisations listed in sch 32. 6. This statement applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. This means the statement applies from 1 April 2019 or the first day of the 2019/20 income year for organisations with a non-standard balance date. Summary Meaning of “wholly or mainly” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) Interpretative conclusion 7. Section LD 3(2)(a) uses the phrase “wholly or mainly” to set the extent to which funds must be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. The phrase also effectively determines the extent to which an organisation may apply funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand and remain a donee organisation under the provision. IS 18/05 3 UNCLASSIFIED 8. Before this statement, the Commissioner in recent times, and from time to time, accepted in some cases that the phrase “wholly or mainly” could mean as little as a bare majority (ie, “more than 50%”). This meant it was possible for an organisation to apply up to 49% of its funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand and retain donee organisation status. However, the Commissioner’s approach was administrative and not necessarily consistently applied. 9. Having now considered the matter in depth, the Commissioner concludes in this statement that the extent to which donee organisations may apply funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand is less than what may have been previously accepted in some cases. 1 The Commissioner concludes that “wholly or mainly” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) requires considerably more than a bare majority of a donee organisation’s funds to be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 10. The meaning of “wholly or mainly” has been determined after considering the following:  The ordinary meaning of “wholly” is “entirely” or “fully”.  The ordinary meaning of “mainly” is unclear when expressed numerically in terms of the extent to which a donee organisation needs to apply funds to specified funds within New Zealand. It may mean: no more than a bare majority (ie, “more than 50%”); or – something greater than a bare majority. – 11. The legislative context and purpose support the view that a meaning for “mainly” of greater than a bare majority better fulfils the purpose of s LD 3(2)(a) in light of:  the immediate context of s LD 3(2)(a) where “mainly” is used in conjunction with and as an alternative to “wholly”;  the other paragraphs of s LD 3(2) that require purposes to be achieved “exclusively” within New Zealand;  sch 32 which applies to organisations the purposes of which are achieved principally overseas; and  the history of the legislation that shows the provision of the tax credit to donors by Parliament was to encourage giving to support community self- help and to help relieve the government of the burden of expenditure that it would otherwise incur to achieve domestic social outcomes. 12. On balance, the Commissioner considers the legislative context and purposes means “mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) should be read more restrictively, indicating a considerably higher figure than a bare majority. However, “wholly or mainly” is an imprecise term. While something considerably greater than a bare majority is indicated, it is not possible to interpret the expression with any greater certainty. 1 For an earlier stage in this process of considering the matters in-depth, see the Public Rulings Unit’s 2016 Issues Paper No. 9 “Donee organisations – clarifying when funds are wholly or mainly applied to specified purposes within New Zealand”. IS 18/05 4 UNCLASSIFIED Administrative safe harbour for “wholly or mainly” requirement 13. To bring greater certainty, the Commissioner proposes to supplement this interpretative conclusion by administering the “wholly or mainly” requirement of s LD 3(2)(a) on a “safe harbour” basis. The administrative safe harbour is a calculation method an organisation can adopt to arrive at a “safe harbour percentage”. If an organisation meets or exceeds the minimum safe harbour percentage, the Commissioner will generally accept without further enquiry that the organisation meets the “wholly or mainly” requirement of s LD 3(2)(a). The Commissioner has set the safe harbour percentage at a minimum of 75%. 14. Accordingly, the safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies any of its funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand and wants some certainty about its eligibility under s LD 3(2)(a). 15. A figure of 75% was suggested in R v Radio Authority, ex p Bull \[1997\] 2 All ER 561 (CA). In that case, the court adopted a mid-way point between the possible meanings of “mainly” which ranged from 51% to 99%. The Commissioner considers this is a reasonable and pragmatic figure to apply in the context of s LD 3(2)(a). Interpretative conclusions on other requirements of s LD 3(2)(a) 16. In addition to providing certainty about “wholly or mainly”, the Commissioner makes further conclusions on other aspects of s LD 3(2)(a). These are necessary to apply the administrative safe harbour and concern the meanings of:  “Funds”  “Applied”  “Funds are applied”  “New Zealand”. “Funds” 17. While not free from doubt, the most appropriate meaning of “funds” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) seems to be a reference to money readily available to an organisation at any point in time (ie, “cash on hand”). This includes cash and other highly liquid assets available to meet commitments. For the purposes of the safe harbour, the term “funds” is accepted as equating to the accounting concepts of “cash” and “cash equivalents”. “Applied” 18. “Applied” means “devoted to” or “put to use” and this includes where funds have been:  spent on a purpose or purposes;  invested for a purpose or purposes; or  set aside to be spent at some future date on a purpose or purposes. 19. While there are no specific limits on the extent to which funds can be accumulated (ie, invested or set aside), organisations that simply accumulate funds still need to show that they are applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to the required extent. IS 18/05 5 UNCLASSIFIED “Funds are applied” 20. The expression “funds are applied” suggests:  The application of funds arises as a result of the organisation either spending money or undertaking some affirmative act to invest or set aside the money for future spending for some purpose or purposes.  The affirmative act is the decision to accumulate funds that has been made at the appropriate level in the organisation for decisions of that type according to its established management practices. For example, the trustees of a charitable trust resolving to set aside money in the trust’s on- call savings account pending a capital purchase.  The decision to accumulate funds will need sufficient detail to be able to characterise that application of funds as advancing charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. 21. The application of funds occurs on a continuing basis over the lifetime of the donee organisation. This is so, even though for administrative purposes to gauge compliance with this on-going lifetime requirement, it is more practicable to look at funds applied over a discrete period of time, such as a year, and then, from year to year. 22. It is the specified purposes that must be “within New Zealand” not the application of funds. This means the location where funds are spent is not relevant. It is the objectively determined purpose sought to be achieved through the application of the funds that is important. 23. Absent the funds being spent or there being an affirmative act to invest or set aside the funds for a purpose, they will not be considered as being applied to any purpose, although these funds still form part of the organisation’s total “funds”. “New Zealand” 24. “New Zealand” should commonly be understood as the North, South, Stewart, Chatham and Kermadec Islands and all other territories, islands, and islets in the geographical areas set out in the New Zealand Boundaries Act 1863 (UK) and the preamble of the Kermadec Islands Act 1887. 25. “New Zealand” for the purposes of s LD 3(2)(a) does not include:  the self-governing states of the Cook Islands and Niue;  Tokelau; or  the Ross Dependency. When funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 26. Unless accumulated or donated to another organisation, funds would usually be applied by being spent on the provision of goods or services in the course of carrying on some activity. The character of an activity is determined by the reason for which the activity is carried out. That is, the underlying purpose sought to be advanced, as assessed objectively from the activity’s results. 27. The enquiry under s LD 3(2)(a) in regard to the application of funds is to identify objectively whether a sufficient relationship (connection or nexus) exists between IS 18/05 6 UNCLASSIFIED the purposes served by the actual or proposed activity and advancing specified purposes within New Zealand. The connection needs to be sufficiently direct, although not necessarily an immediate connection. 28. When assessing the connection:  A distinction can be made between purposes and results. Some results arise incidentally or as a consequence of the achievement of other results directly relatable to the objects of the organisation as set out in its founding documents. If so, they can be ignored when determining whether the results of activities arising from an application of funds bear a sufficient relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand.  Results not naturally arising as an incident or consequence of other results that are pursued as a result in their own right may indicate the presence of another independent and additional purpose of the application of funds. If so, the expenditure concerned may need to be apportioned to different purposes. Apportionment is required if the purposes differ as to whether they are specified purposes within New Zealand or other purposes.  The view taken of the purpose or purposes served by an application of funds may need to have regard to whether it is the immediate or less immediate purposes served that are determinative. One common situation where this may be important is in relation to funds applied in trading activities or fund- raising events. Where trading activities are conducted as a means of raising funds, the Commissioner considers funds applied to such activities as being applied to the same purposes as those to which the net surplus will be applied. In other cases, where the trading directly achieves a certain object or objects of the organisation, then that object or those objects will dictate what the funds applied to the trading activity are applied to.  In cases where a donee organisation has applied funds by donating them to another organisation, the donee organisation may need to establish it has applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to ensure it meets the safe harbour.  Each application of funds needs to be assessed objectively on its own merits as to whether some results are incidental or consequential to other results or whether more than one purpose exists. Apportionment 29. Apportionment issues in this context can be approached on a similar basis to apportionment arising under s DA 1:  The circumstances of the particular case will usually determine the most apt way of deciding how to apportion an amount.  The apportionment must be fair, not arbitrary, and must be done as a matter of fact.  Where expenditure has distinct and severable components, it may be divided or dissected where the distinct and severable components can be related to differing tax treatments.  Where a single outlay serves two or more objects without distinction, dissection is impractical and apportionment on a fair and reasonable basis applies.  In apportionment cases, the onus of proof lies with the taxpayer. IS 18/05 7 UNCLASSIFIED  Just because the apportionment might be difficult is not of itself sufficient reason for failing to find that some apportionment can be made.  Absolute precision cannot be expected, so a reasonable estimate is sufficient. Calculating the safe harbour percentage 30. The safe harbour approach comprises determining an organisation’s safe harbour percentage for a financial year. Calculating an organisation’s safe harbour percentage involves three steps:  Use the organisation’s statement of cash flows in its financial statements or statement of receipts and payments in its performance report to find the organisation’s “total funds”. “Total funds” is the sum of the cash on hand at the end of a year and the cash spent during the year (ie, all cash outflows whether capital or revenue).  Find the amount of the organisation's “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand”. This is a combination of the cash spent, invested or set aside entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand and amounts reasonably apportioned to those purposes.  Divide the cash spent or set aside for specified purposes within New Zealand (as per the second step) by the organisation’s “total funds” (as per the first step) and express this as a percentage. 31. If the figure is below 75% in any year, the cumulative total of its funds applied over the current and preceding two years can be used (including years before the commencement of this statement). This allows some year-on-year variation for exceptional years. However, it would not be expected that under the rolling three-year cumulative safe harbour calculation an organisation would devote 50% or less of its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand in any particular year. 32. If the rolling three-year cumulative safe harbour percentage is below 75% or the figure in any year is 50% or below, the organisation should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible. 33. Some options may be available if an organisation finds complying with the wholly or mainly requirement of s LD 3(2)(a) difficult. For example, organisations may wish to consider whether to establish and maintain a fund exclusively for specified purposes within New Zealand under s LD 3(2)(c). In that situation, the fund, rather than the organisation, would hold donee organisation status and tax benefits could accrue to donors to the fund. Introduction 34. The Commissioner is aware of a lack of clarity and consistency about aspects of the requirements for “donee organisation” status under s LD 3(2)(a). Unfortunately, there is little judicial guidance on interpreting this provision. IS 18/05 8 UNCLASSIFIED 35. A former version of the provision was considered in Molloy v CIR \[1981\] 1 NZLR 688 (CA). The former provision was s 84B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 which required organisations to “wholly or principally” apply funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. 2 Molloy is the only case to directly consider the legislation. However, while the Court of Appeal noted (at 690) the legislation raised several problems, it was not required to resolve them. 36. The problems noted in Molloy included:  when purposes are “within New Zealand”;  whether “funds” refers to the whole or the principal part of an organisation’s funds or just income;  whether “applying funds” refers to an income year or a longer period; and  whether holding funds is “applying” them. 37. While the court in Molloy did not include the meaning of “principally” as a problem (simply stating (at 690 – 691) that it was “sufficient that funds are applied principally to an enumerated purpose”), the Commissioner is aware that the meaning of “wholly or mainly” (as it is now) has been an issue more recently. 38. Accordingly, this statement considers:  the meaning of “wholly or mainly”;  the meanings of “funds”, “applied” and “funds are applied”;  what is required to be “within New Zealand”; and  when will funds be considered applied wholly or mainly to specified purposes within New Zealand. 39. As most of these issues require interpreting the Act, it is useful first to consider the approach to statutory interpretation in New Zealand. Text, context and purpose – the approach to interpretation 40. Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 sets the approach to statutory interpretation in New Zealand by requiring the meaning of an enactment to be determined by its text and in the light of its purpose. The Supreme Court acknowledged the necessity of applying the s 5(1) approach in Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36 (at \[22\]): It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. 41. The Act acknowledges the role of s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 in s AA 3(2), which states: 2 As part of the 2004 rewrite of the tax legislation, the word “mainly” was used to replace “primarily and principally” and similar expressions in the Act. This was done on the basis that “mainly” bore sufficiently similar connotations to these other expressions. This view was informed by the decision in Newmans Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (HC) (see: “Income Tax Act 2004”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004) 46 at 71). IS 18/05 9 UNCLASSIFIED (2) The Interpretation Act 1999 also contains definitions of terms, including in particular the term person, and other provisions that apply to the interpretation and construction of this Act. 42. The Supreme Court has also confirmed the approach to statutory interpretation in New Zealand (of requiring the meaning of an enactment to be determined by its text and in the light of its purpose) applies without modification to revenue statutes (see Stiassny v CIR (No 2) \[2012\] NZSC 106 at \[23\] and Terminals (NZ) Ltd v Comptroller of Customs \[2013\] NZSC 139 at \[39\]). 43. In Commerce Commission v Fonterra, the Supreme Court went on to state (at \[22\]) that the interpretative approach requires determining the meaning of the text and then cross-checking the meaning against the purpose of the legislation. This is so even if the meaning of the text appears clear: Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual requirements of s 5 \[of the Interpretation Act 1999\]. In determining purpose the court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. 44. About the meaning of the text of legislation, the Supreme Court stated (at \[23\]): The concept of a plain and ordinary meaning does not involve the court having recourse to external sources such as expert evidence and textbooks. 12 If the court has to do that there can hardly be a plain meaning. If one has to go outside the immediate text in this way, there is no logical reason to stop there. Any suggestion of a plain meaning must then evaporate. 12 Reference to recognised dictionaries is, of course, in accordance with the plain meaning approach. 45. Also, when determining the meaning of the text, the Supreme Court has accepted that “there may still be some place for the old canons of construction” (Terminals (NZ) Ltd at \[74\]). This is a reference to guiding principles (or canons) developed from case law that the courts apply to aid in their interpretation of legislation. One canon relevant in the present context is noscitur a sociis (ie, words derive colour from those which surround them). It is discussed from \[84\]. 46. Where the ordinary meaning of the text is not clear, the Supreme Court stated in Commerce Commission v Fonterra that it would be guided by the legislation’s context and purpose (at \[24\]): Where, as here, the meaning is not clear on the face of the legislation, the court will regard context and purpose as essential guides to meaning. 47. In respect of the context and purpose, the practice of the courts, including the Supreme Court, has been to look to the legislative history for assistance. (See, for example Terminals (NZ) Ltd from \[50\] and Worldwide NZ LLC v NZ Venue and Event Management \[2014\] NZSC 108 from \[17\].) In some cases, the courts will look to parliamentary debates (Hansard) as part of the examination of the legislative history. (See, for example, Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA) at 701 and Worldwide NZ LLC at \[19\].) 48. The Supreme Court has also acknowledged that, in some cases, the only reliable guide as to the purpose of a revenue statute is the legislation itself (Stiassny (at 23\]): The purpose of a taxing provision may be a guide to its meaning and intended application. But, as Burrows and Carter point out, in most cases the only evidence IS 18/05 10 UNCLASSIFIED of that purpose is the detailed wording of the provision and the safest method is to read the words in their most natural sense. 49. The approach to statutory interpretation was summed up in Mailley v District Court at North Shore \[2015\] 2 NZLR 567 (HC) as striking a balance between the text (which is enlarged by considering purpose) and purpose (which is constrained by the text). Keane J stated (at \[66\]): This principle of interpretation, according to Burrows, has stood in New Zealand for over a century. 30 It calls for a balance to be struck between the text and the purpose, in which the latter is decisive. In 1992 Cooke P said that, in principle, “strict grammatical meaning must yield to sufficiently obvious purpose”. 31 That is so also where a provision is ambiguous or unclear. 32 But a sensible balance must be struck. As the then chief parliamentary counsel, George Tanner QC, said in 2005, “text is enlarged by purpose, and purpose is constrained by text”. 33 30 JF Burrows and RI Carter Statute Law in New Zealand (4th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2009) at 203. 31 McKenzie v Attorney-General \[1992\] 2 NZLR 14 (CA) at 17. 32 Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 at \[24\]. 33 Tanner & Carter “Purposive Interpretation of New Zealand Legislation”, (paper presented to Australian Drafting Conference, Sydney, August 2005) at \[66\]. 50. Finally, judicial precedent or the doctrine of stare decisis acts as a constraint on a court interpreting legislation (see: R Carter, Burrows and Carter: Statute Law in New Zealand (5th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2015) at 191–193). Stare decisis is the principle that a court is required to follow previous court decisions unless they are inconsistent with a higher court’s decision or are wrong in law. While acting as a constraint, judicial precedent provides for greater certainty in interpretation of the law because if an earlier court has given legislation a particular interpretation, then that interpretation is binding on lower courts and very persuasive for courts at the same level. 51. However, there are limits to which the doctrine applies, including those expressed by the House of Lords in Ogden Industries Pty Ltd v Lucas \[1969\] 1 All ER 121 at 126 where Lord Upjohn, delivering the judgment of the court, said: It is quite clear that judicial statements as to the construction and intention of an Act must never be allowed to supplant or supersede its proper construction and courts must beware of falling into the error of treating the law to be that laid down by the judge in construing the Act rather than found in the words of the Act itself. No doubt a decision on particular words binds inferior courts on the construction of those words on similar facts, but beyond that the observations of judges on the construction of statutes may be of the greatest help and guidance but are entitled to no more than respect and cannot absolve the court from its duty of exercising an independent judgment. 52. Judicial decisions on other legislation can be helpful, as can decisions of courts in other jurisdictions. However, care must be exercised in both instances. The wording of other provisions may vary slightly, the purpose and context of the Acts may differ, and harmonisation between Acts and jurisdictions is not an absolute requirement. 53. Accordingly, decided cases can be useful in helping to inform questions of the ordinary meaning of words or the context and purpose of legislation where that has been the subject of previous judicial scrutiny. 54. In summary, the legislation is to be interpreted in the following way: IS 18/05 11 UNCLASSIFIED  The statutory text is considered from which the plain and ordinary meaning or meanings of the words used are determined.  The plain and ordinary meaning or meanings of the text may be determined with reference to recognised dictionaries but should not involve recourse to such things as textbooks or expert evidence.  The plain and ordinary meaning or meanings must then be cross-checked against the purpose of the legislation.  In determining purpose, regard must be given to both the immediate and general legislative contexts.  It may also be relevant when determining purpose to consider the social, commercial or other objective of the legislation.  Decided cases may be of interpretative assistance in determining the meaning of legislation. 55. Overall, a sensible balance must be struck between text and purpose. In practice, this will mean that if the meaning of the text is consistent with the legislative purpose, the legislative purpose bolsters that conclusion. However, if the meaning of the text is unclear or ambiguous, the legislative purpose is an essential guide to the meaning. Meaning of “wholly or mainly” The statutory text: “wholly”, “or” and “mainly” 56. The interpretative approach is to first consider the words of the Act. In this case, “wholly”, “or” and “mainly”. These words are not defined in the Act so they bear their ordinary meanings. “Wholly” 57. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “wholly” as: wholly ... adv. entirely; fully. 58. In FCT v FH Faulding & Co Ltd \[ 1950\] ALR 862 (HCA) the High Court of Australia considered the phrase “wholly or principally”. Latham J stated (at 863): \[T\]he word “wholly” necessarily requires the application of a quantitative standard. A quantitative measure is one capable of being measured. 59. Accordingly, it seems reasonably clear that the ordinary meaning of “wholly” would require all of a donee organisation’s funds to be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. It also seems “wholly” requires that the funds are measurably applied to those purposes. “Or” 60. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “or” as: or  conj. 1 used to link alternatives. 61. Accordingly, “or” means “wholly” and “mainly” are linked as alternatives. As an alternative, “mainly” does not overlap with “wholly”. This was confirmed by Aldous LJ in Radio Authority where he stated (at 575) that the words “wholly or IS 18/05 12 UNCLASSIFIED mainly” are “not coterminous in meaning” (ie, they do not have the same boundaries). “Mainly” 62. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, defines “mainly” as: mainly ... adv. more than anything else.  for the most part. 63. In the Collins English Dictionary (online ed, HarperCollins, New York, accessed 30 August 2018), “mainly” is defined as: mainly ... (in British) adv 1. for the most part; to the greatest extent; principally. 64. The dictionary definitions indicate “mainly” bears meanings that vary as to degree. For instance, “more than anything else” could mean more than anything else considered singly. If so, the “main” thing needs to be only greater than any other single thing. Alternatively, it could mean more than anything else considered collectively. If this is so, then the “main” thing needs to be greater than all the other things considered together (ie, greater than 50%). “For the most part” could be viewed in the same way, whereas “to the greatest extent” might not. Where the item of interest is but one option of two, this distinction may have no practical effect – the “main” thing will be greater than 50%. However, where the item of interest is one option of many, “mainly” could mean something less than 50%. 65. For instance, in Franklin v Gramophone Co Ltd \[1948\] 1 All ER 353, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal (at 358) considered whether a person spending two hours a day at a task might be considered “mainly” engaged in that task, if during the rest of the day they were involved in, say, eight other tasks for an hour. That is, the person was mainly engaged in a certain task because they spent more time on that task than any other task considered singly. In that example, “mainly” could mean something numerically as low as 20%. Somervall LJ did not consider “mainly” had such a meaning in the context of the case. However, he accepted “\[t\]he word ‘mainly’ may, in some contexts, have such a meaning”. 66. It seems more common for the courts to find that “mainly” has a meaning consistent with the situation where the “main” thing is more than anything else considered collectively (ie, more than 50%). However, this may reflect the reality that courts are often called on to consider whether something is or is not the “main” thing (ie, in a context of only two alternatives). 67. In New Zealand, the court accepted “mainly” as meaning “more than half” in CIR v Mitchell (1986) 8 NZTC 5,181 (HC). In Mitchell, the High Court considered whether a taxpayer’s dining room was used “wholly or principally” in connection with employment. The court considered “principally” was synonymous with “mainly”. The employment use of the dining room was between 55% and 59% and this use was found to be sufficient. Davison CJ stated (at 5,183): Issue 1. Meaning of “principally” I agree that the word must be used in its context. The dictionary definition of the word as used in the context of cl 7 \[of the fourth schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976\] is, in my view, synonymous with “mainly” which is an expression well understood by ordinary people. ... Mr Aspey \[for the Commissioner\] submitted that “principally” connotes so great a use that a use for any other purpose or purposes must be relatively insignificant. IS 18/05 13 UNCLASSIFIED He went on to suggest that in order to satisfy cl 7, the work related use should be above 85%. I do not agree. ... In Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council \[1961\] AC 636, 669, Lord Morton of Henryton expressed the view that the word “mainly” probably means “more than half”. Such is consistent with the definition of “mainly” in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary – “for the most part, chiefly, principally”. \[Emphasis added\] 68. Mitchell was cited in Newmans Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (HC) in relation to the phrase “primarily and principally”. The court stated (at 6,030): As seen, an overriding requirement is that the expenditure be incurred “primarily and principally” for the purpose of attracting tourists to New Zealand from overseas. The term “primarily and principally” does not appear previously to have been the subject of judicial exposition. C of IR v Mitchell (1986) 8 NZTC 5,181, a judgment of Sir Ronald Davison CJ, was concerned with the provision in cl 7 of the fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, concerning expenditure where a room in a dwelling was used “wholly or principally” for the purpose of the taxpayer’s employment. As to the meaning of “principally” the Chief Justice relied on the dictionary meanings of the adjective “principal” — prime, main, chief, foremost, leading. He referred also to Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council \[1961\] AC 636 at p 669 where Lord Morton expressed the view that in the particular context “mainly” probably meant more than half. The expression in issue here poses a higher hurdle than that in Mitchell's case — the purpose must be not only the main one, in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes, singly or collectively, it must also be the primary purpose, that is the first one. \[Emphasis added\] 69. Mitchell and Newmans Tours referred to the comments of Lord Morton of Henryton in Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council \[1960\] 3 All ER 503 (HL). In Fawcett Properties, the House of Lords considered whether a local authority’s planning consent for a housing development was invalid because of a condition in the consent requiring the houses’ occupation to be “limited to persons whose employment ... was in ... an industry mainly dependent upon agriculture”. Lord Morton of Henryton stated (at 512) “mainly” probably meant more than half although the word “at once gives rise to difficulties”: Other criticisms were directed to other words in the condition, but I shall not detain your Lordships by travelling through them, for, in my opinion, the words “mainly dependent upon agriculture” are of themselves enough to lead your Lordships to declare the condition void. The word “mainly” at once gives rise to difficulties. Probably it means “more than half”,... \[Emphasis added\] 70. In contrast to the preceding cases, in the Australian Federal Court case of Davis v FCT; Sirise Pty Ltd v FCT 2000 ATC 4,201 the court declined to apply a statutorily defined meaning for “mainly” of “to the extent of more than 50%”. The court in Davis v FCT accepted that while “mainly” usually meant “more than half” as defined, it also accepted the Commissioner’s argument that Parliament did not intend for the defined meaning to apply to the relevant use of “mainly” in the legislation. The court considered “mainly” meant something other than “more than half” based on its ordinary meaning of “chief; principal; leading” (per the Macquarie Dictionary (2nd ed, Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, Sydney, 1991). In accepting the Commissioner’s argument, the court stated (at \[62\]): IS 18/05 14 UNCLASSIFIED This suggests that Parliament contemplated that in the present context the word was intended to signify “principal use” or perhaps the “preponderant use” rather than use just greater than 50%. 71. In the context of Davis v FCT, the court did not need to decide what percentage of use would be a “principal” or “preponderant” use. However, the case illustrates that, depending on the context, “mainly” could bear an ordinary meaning of greater than a bare majority. 72. Finally, some case law suggests the ordinary meaning of “mainly” may be quantitative in nature. For instance, in Waugh v British Railways Board \[1979\] 2 All ER 1,169 (HL) the court considered the appropriate test for applying legal privilege to documents containing legal advice where the documents were not created solely for that purpose. Courts had used various words to describe the extent to which a legal advice purpose needed to be the purpose of the document before privilege would apply to it. When reviewing these various words, Lord Simon of Gaisdale expressed a preference for the word “dominant” in this context. This is because he considered this word to be “less quantitative than ‘mainly’” (at 1,178). 73. From the above case law, applying in contexts other than s LD 3(2)(a), it seems that regardless of the dictionary meaning of “mainly”, when the meaning is expressed in quantitative terms by a court, it could indicate something less than half, just greater than half, or something greater again, depending on the context. 74. Accordingly, it is not completely free of doubt what the ordinary meaning of “mainly” means in relation to the degree to which s LD 3(2)(a) requires organisations to apply their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand (ie, what minimum percentage “mainly” translates to). It may mean an organisation simply needs to apply funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to a greater extent than it applies its funds to any other single purpose. It may mean the organisation need only apply more than half of their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, it may mean a figure greater than a bare majority is indicated by “mainly”, although how much greater is not clear. Conclusions on the statutory text: “wholly or mainly” 75. The ordinary meaning of “wholly” seems clear in requiring all of an organisation’s funds to be quantifiably applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 76. However, the addition of “mainly” as an alternative to “wholly” means something less than 100% is also acceptable. That is, the phrase “wholly or mainly” presents a choice between the two alternatives with “wholly” removing any doubt about whether “mainly” includes 100% (Radio Authority). 77. “Mainly” (or its synonyms) can mean “for the most part” or “more than anything else” in the sense of “more than anything else considered together” (ie, “more than 50%”) (Mitchell, Newmans Tours, Fawcett Properties and Davis v FCT). 78. However, “mainly” can bear meanings that vary as to degree. These meanings include being simply more than anything else considered singly (ie, something that could be less than 50% (Franklin v Gramophone)). Equally, “mainly” could mean something more than a bare majority, even if the boundaries of this meaning are unclear (Davis v FCT). IS 18/05 15 UNCLASSIFIED “Wholly or mainly” in light of the context and purpose of the legislation Introduction 79. In accordance with the approach to statutory interpretation, the next step is to consider the text of the legislation in light of its purpose. This is made more crucial by the conclusion above that the ordinary meaning of “mainly” is unclear. Therefore, the legislative purpose and context are essential guides to the meaning of the legislation. 80. In determining the purpose, regard must be given to the immediate and general legislative context including social, commercial and other objectives of the enactment (Fonterra at \[22\]). Accordingly, considered on their own, no one aspect of the context and purpose of the legislation discussed below may indicate conclusively what the appropriate meaning is for “wholly or mainly”. What is required is an overall assessment of these aspects of the legislation. Immediate context — s LD 3(2)(a) – “wholly” and “mainly” used in conjunction 81. The immediate context of “mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) is that it is used in conjunction with the word “wholly”. “Wholly or mainly” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) concerns itself with the ratio between funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand and total funds. Because the legislation is concerned with only two things – funds applied to specified purpose within New Zealand and funds not so applied – only two meanings for “mainly” are relevant:  as little as a bare majority (ie, “more than 50%”); or  something greater than a bare majority. 82. The third possible meaning of “mainly” of “more than anything else” considered singly (as suggested in Franklin v Gramophone), does not need to be considered further as it is not applicable when there are only two options. 83. As discussed at \[67\], in Mitchell, the synonymous phrase “wholly or principally” was accepted in a New Zealand tax context as meaning “more than 50%”. Overseas, the courts have followed a similar approach in other contexts (for example: Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food v Mason \[1968\] 3 All ER 76 (HC), Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Colmer \[1999\] BTC 440 (HL), On Call Interpreters and Translators Agency Pty Ltd v FCT 2011 ATC 20-258 (FCA) and Kenya Aid Programme v Sheffield City Council \[2013\] EWHC 54 (Admin)). 84. On the face of it, therefore, the phrase “wholly or mainly” appears to mean anything from over 50% to 100%. However, the meaning of “mainly” can be affected or “coloured” by, its use in conjunction with the word “wholly”. This is consistent with the guiding canon of statutory construction of reading words in the legislation in the context of the other words of the section in which they appear. The rule is sometimes referred to by the Latin term noscitur a sociis (“words derive colour from those which surround them” per Stamp J in Bourne v Norwich Crematorium Ltd \[1967\] 2 All ER 576 (HC) at 578)). As Stamp J continued to state (at 578): Sentences are not mere collections of words to be taken out of the sentence, defined separately by reference to the dictionary or decided cases, and then put back into the sentences with the meaning which you have assigned to them as separate words. IS 18/05 16 UNCLASSIFIED 85. The effect of this rule of interpretation can be seen in Re Hatschek’s patents, ex p Zerenner \[1909\] 2 Ch 68 (HC). The case concerned a challenge to the Comptroller General’s decision to revoke a patent. The legislation at issue provided that any person could apply to the Comptroller for another person’s patent to be revoked, if the patented article or process was manufactured or carried on “exclusively or mainly outside the United Kingdom”. Parker J stated (at 82–84): The first question is this: What is the state of circumstances the existence of which imposes this serious liability on a patentee? In the words of sub-s. 1, it is whenever “the patented article or process is manufactured or carried on exclusively or mainly outside the United Kingdom.” There is no difficulty in the use of the word “exclusively,” but the use of the word “mainly” gives rise to difficulty. The sub-section may, and it was argued that it did, include every case in which the patented, article or process is manufactured or carried on to a greater extent outside than inside the United Kingdom. If this be its true meaning, then in every case in which more than 50 per cent, of the patented articles manufactured anywhere are manufactured abroad, the patentee can be called upon to justify the use he has made of his monopoly and defend his patent rights. I cannot think that this is the true meaning of the sub-section. ... The word “mainly” is used in the sub-section in close connection with and as an alternative to “exclusively”, and, having regard to this fact, I do not think that a process or article can be said to be mainly carried on or manufactured abroad merely because it is carried on or manufactured abroad to a somewhat greater extent than within the United Kingdom. For example, if the total manufacture in the United Kingdom were 1200 and the total manufacture elsewhere 1250, giving a total of 2450 in all, I do not think it could be said that the manufacture was mainly abroad within the meaning of the section; to come within the sub-section the disparity must, in my opinion, be greater than a mere small percentage, and, indeed, if the article be manufactured or the process be carried on within the United Kingdom, not only to a substantial extent, but to an extent as substantial as may reasonably be expected having regard to what is done abroad, I do not think the state of circumstances is that contemplated by sub-s. 1. \[Emphasis added\] 86. Parker J rejected the argument “mainly” meant simply “more than 50 percent”. He considered that if this was the word’s meaning, then the difference between the activities carried on inside the United Kingdom and the activities carried on outside the United Kingdom could be small in some cases (2% in his example). Parker J concluded that in the context of the relevant legislation, Parliament must have intended an outcome where the difference was greater than a small percentage. That is, “mainly” has a meaning greater than a bare majority. Parker J concluded this because “mainly” was used with “exclusively”. Parker J, however, did not indicate what would be considered sufficiently more than a mere small percentage margin to meet his understanding of the phrase. 87. The rule of interpretation was also applied in a New Zealand context by the former Supreme Court (now the High Court) in Fairmaid v Otago District Land Registrar \[1952\] NZLR 782. The case concerned registering a property under the Joint Family Homes Act 1950. The homeowner was a partner in a law firm who had purchased the property because it was close to his law offices. The homeowner also used a small room at the back of the property as an office. To be registered, the property had to be “exclusively or principally” used as a home and the Registrar General argued this requirement was not met. The Registrar General cited the noscitur a sociis rule of interpretation arguing this limited the meaning of the word “principally” so it was interpreted more narrowly than if it stood alone. IS 18/05 17 UNCLASSIFIED In support, counsel cited Hatschek’s patents. North J agreed with this view (at 785): \[Counsel for the Registrar General\] very properly, in my opinion, contented himself with submitting that the association of the three words “exclusively or principally” should cause the Court to interpret the last word rather more narrowly than if it had stood alone. \[Emphasis added\] 88. While North J in Fairmaid indicated “principally” should be interpreted more narrowly, he did not indicate what this would mean in percentage terms for the meaning of “exclusively or principally”. 89. In Houston v Poingdestre \[1950\] NZLR 966, the former Supreme Court considered a landlord’s action for possession brought under the Tenancy Act 1948. No order for possession could be made if the property in question was an “urban property”, as defined. The definition of “urban property” excluded properties used “exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes”. Findlay J stated (at 973– 974): \[I\]t does seem clear that the Legislature intended to leave all land used “exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes” outside the ambit of the Act ... The consequential conclusion seems to follow that the Legislature intended all land not used for agricultural purposes to the high degree conveyed by the words “exclusively or principally” to come within the scope of the Act. ... For several reasons, but principally for three in particular, I think the Legislature did not intend to exclude premises used primarily as a home from the definition of “urban property.” I think so, first, because the phrase “exclusively or principally” in the definition envisages some, if not some substantial, use for agricultural purposes, so that it becomes a question of the degree of that use which determines whether a property is urban property or not. That degree has to be determined in relation to the use being made of it for some other purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 90. While Findlay J considered that for land to be used “exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes” the use had to be to a “high degree” or “substantially”, there is no indication what extent of use in percentage terms would satisfy these terms. This is because, on the facts of the case, Findlay J determined the land was not used for agricultural purposes. Findlay J may have been influenced by the Magistrates’ Court decision in Livingstone v Barker (1947) MCR 135, which he cited concerning the same legislation where “exclusively” was considered to colour the meaning of “principally”. 91. Livingstone considered the same question as Houston as to whether a property was used “exclusively or principally for agricultural purposes”. In considering the meaning of this phrase, the Magistrate stated (at 138): The dominating words in the definition are “Exclusively or Principally” and of these words “Exclusively” dominates “Principally”. It is the less general term of the two that restricts the meaning of “Principally”. In Maxwell in the Interpretation of Statutes (8 th ed., at p. 284) it says:– “When two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled together noscitur a sociis, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense. They take as it were, their colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to the less general. This is precisely how these two words are to be understood. “Principally” which the New Oxford Dictionary defines as “in the chief place; as the chief thing concerned IS 18/05 18 UNCLASSIFIED mainly; above all” has a meaning cognate to and only a few degrees more liberal than “exclusively”. Its association with “exclusively” therefore confines its meanings to one more ejusdem generis that term. 92. The Magistrate applied the interpretative rule of noscitur a sociis to conclude that “principally” is coloured by “exclusively” and is interpreted as setting a high threshold “only a few degrees more liberal than ‘exclusively’”. He saw the words as specific and general terms of the same class. As such, under the interpretative rule ejusdem generis (“of the same kinds, class, or nature”) the otherwise wide meaning of the general term “principally” must be restricted to the same class as the more specific term “exclusively”. That is, in the context of “wholly or mainly”, the view would be that both words are descriptors of a class concerning matters of degree. Then, because “mainly” is a more general descriptor of degree than “wholly”, it must be interpreted as meaning something closer to “wholly” than otherwise might be the case. 93. The noscitur a sociis rule has also been applied in a New Zealand tax context by the Taxation Review Authority in Case E79 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,416. Case E79 concerned whether a panel van was a “motorcar” where that term was defined as a vehicle “designed exclusively or principally” for the carriage of passengers. Judge Barber considered the van was not a “motorcar” because it was designed principally for the carriage of goods. Judge Barber accepted, on authority of Fairmaid, the association of the word “exclusively” with the word “principally” should cause the Authority to interpret “principally” more narrowly than if it had been used alone. Again, the Authority did not indicate what this meant in percentage terms for the meaning of the relevant phrase. 94. A meaning for “wholly or mainly” of “100% or a near percentage” was applied in British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers & Attractions Ltd \[2011\] TC 01504 (UKFTT). This case involved the issue of whether an association’s membership subscriptions should be exempt from value added tax (VAT). The exemption applied if the association’s membership was restricted “wholly or mainly” to individuals or corporate bodies connected to the association’s purposes. With 69% of its members connected to its purposes, the association argued it met the relevant test because “mainly” meant more than 50%. In finding against the taxpayer, the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) considered the meaning of “wholly or mainly” (at \[39\]): The Association’s reading of “mainly” is, I think, incorrect. The word cannot be read in isolation. It is part of the compound phrase “wholly or mainly”. In that connection it must, I think, mean all or substantially all, e.g. 100% or a near percentage, rather than simply a bare majority. \[Emphasis added\] 95. Although the Tribunal indicated a meaning for “wholly or mainly” of “100% or a near percentage”, the tribunal’s conclusions were not supported by authority or analysis. In the context of the VAT legislation, the view that “wholly or mainly” set a high figure limited the application of an exemption from tax and this may have meant the high figure was appropriate. The tribunal’s decision was criticised in several areas when the taxpayer unsuccessfully appealed, but not on the meaning of “wholly or mainly” (British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners \[2013\] UKUT 130 (TCC)). 96. Consistent with this rule of interpretation, in Radio Authority, a meaning for “wholly or mainly” of greater than a bare majority was applied where the context supported a restrictive interpretation. The United Kingdom Court of Appeal IS 18/05 19 UNCLASSIFIED considered whether Amnesty International (British Section) was a body whose objects were “wholly or mainly” of a political nature. If so, it could not advertise on the radio. Lord Wolf considered the phrase’s meaning was not free from ambiguity. He adopted a narrow meaning of “mainly” in light of the legislative context, although he did not directly refer to the word’s use with the word “wholly” in terms of the rule of noscitur a sociis. Lord Wolf stated (at 570): “Wholly or mainly” is a phrase the meaning of which is not free from ambiguity. Clearly it requires a proportion which is more than half. But how much more? 51% or 99% and anything in between are candidates. The same phrase appears elsewhere in the Act in a different context (see s 2 \[Broadcasting Act 1990\] where it is not directly concerned with freedom of communication). Here it has to be construed as a part of a provision which restricts the ability of \[Amnesty International (British Section)\] to promote itself on the media by advertising. This constitutes a restriction on freedom of communication. ... The issue is not whether the restriction ... is justifiable but how the restriction should be construed having regard to its blanket or discriminative effect in relation to a political body. In view of this restriction the ambiguous words “wholly or mainly” should be construed restrictively. By that I mean they should be construed in a way in which limits the application of the restriction to bodies whose objects are substantially or primarily political. This corresponds with the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary meaning of “mainly” as being “For the most part; chiefly, principally”. Certainly a body to fall within the provision must be at least midway between the two percentages I have identified ie more than 75%. \[Emphasis added\] 97. Accordingly, the court in Radio Authority, when confronted with the situation where it was appropriate to read “mainly” narrowly opted for the pragmatic solution of translating this in percentage terms to the simple median between the possible range of meanings. That is, it opted for 75% simply because this is half- way between the possible meanings ranging from 51% to 99%. 3 98. Finally, as mentioned in \[58\] and \[72\], the words “wholly” and “mainly” suggest they each set a test that is quantitative in nature and this would carry over to the phrase “wholly or mainly” emphasising the need to settle on some percentage figure for the phrase’s use in s LD 3(2)(a) despite its apparent ambiguity. Even if this were not the case, the Commissioner would need to offer some quantifiable measure to provide guidance in administering the provision. Conclusions on the immediate context – s LD 3(2)(a) – “wholly” and “mainly” used in conjunction 99. The immediate context of “mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) is that it is used in conjunction with the word “wholly”. “Wholly or mainly” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) concerns the ratio between applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand and all other possible application of funds. Private pecuniary profit aside, the legislation does not focus on the application of any portion of funds not applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 3 Although, the mid-point between 51% and 99% would seem to more correctly include 75% so translates to “75% or more” rather than “more than 75%”, as expressed by the court. IS 18/05 20 UNCLASSIFIED 100. Where “mainly” (or its synonyms) is used in conjunction with “wholly” it can retain a meaning of “more than 50%” (Mitchell, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food v Mason, Imperial Chemical Industries, On Call Interpreters and Translators and Kenya Aid Programme). 101. Alternatively, if the legislative context and purpose require, “mainly” can be read more narrowly and, in combination with “wholly” (or synonyms of it), bear a meaning of greater than a bare majority (Hatschek’s patents, Fairmaid, Houston, Livingstone, Case E79, British Association of Leisure Parks (UKFTT) and Radio Authority). However, the boundaries of this meaning are unclear. At least one court in the past has simply opted for the mid-point in the range of possible meanings when faced with this situation (ie, 75% per Radio Authority). 102. Used together, “wholly or mainly” sets a quantitative test, meaning, in s LD 3(2)(a) the extent to which funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand must be measurable in some way (FH Faulding and Waugh). Immediate context — other paragraphs of s LD 3(2) – “exclusively” 103. The language used in other paragraphs of s LD 3(2) is also relevant. These other paragraphs form part of the context in which para (a) must be interpreted and may have some influence on the interpretation of para (a). The relevant paragraphs are (b), (c) and (d): (b) a public institution maintained exclusively for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a): ... (c) a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual: (d) a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand set out in paragraph (a). \[Emphasis added\] 104. These other paragraphs require funds to be applied exclusively or wholly within New Zealand. This may indicate Parliament intended only some minor relaxation of this standard when it used “wholly or mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) (ie, “mainly” means something greater than a bare majority). Or, it may indicate no more than a different test was intended to apply for these other paragraphs. 105. Additionally, under s LD 3(2)(a), funds not applied by a donee organisation to specified purposes within New Zealand are not focused on by the provision. These other purposes may not necessarily be ones Parliament would wish to support through the tax system. 106. On balance, the Commissioner considers the use of “exclusively” and “wholly or mainly” shows Parliament was concerned with what purposes organisations achieved and where. Except for sch 32 (where Parliament retains case-by-case control on donee organisation status), Parliament intended purposes to be generally achieved within New Zealand rather than overseas. That is, the context of s LD 3(2) shows some bias toward purposes being achieved within New Zealand. IS 18/05 21 UNCLASSIFIED Wider context — Part L of the Act 107. As mentioned, the tax credits for charitable gifts are part of calculating a taxpayer’s tax liability. This is the context of part L of the Act, which collates various credits affecting the calculation. 108. Tax credits are significant because they can be used to satisfy a taxpayer’s tax liability or refunded to them in cash. Credits usually recognise tax already paid elsewhere or are used to promote social objectives, (such as in this case, the object of encouraging charitable and public-benefit giving). This suggests s LD 3(2)(a) is concessionary in nature in its application to donee organisations because it encourages giving to organisations that include charities. This is consistent with the Act’s treatment of charities generally, such as providing income exemptions for the income of charities. 109. However, the tax credits in this case accrue to donors and not to the organisations receiving the gifts. Despite this, it could be argued a lower figure for “wholly or mainly” is consistent with a concessionary approach to charities. This is because it could permit more organisations to be eligible for donee organisation status, (ie, those that undertake activities outside New Zealand but not extensively enough to meet sch 32 listing requirements). A lower figure could have a positive effect for donors by widening their choice of eligible organisations. 110. The Commissioner does not consider such an argument to be sustainable. The linkages between cause and effect in this argument are weak. It may not necessarily follow that more donee organisations would exist if the figure was lower rather than higher. Even if donors had more choice, this may not encourage more giving as opposed to simply causing the redirection of existing donations. 111. Also, the presence of sch 32 in the Act (discussed from \[112\]) and the history of the legislation (discussed from \[125\]) would weigh against such an argument. Wider context — other parts of the Act Schedule 32 112. As mentioned in \[2\], organisations can obtain donee organisation status in two main ways. They can meet the requirements of s LD 3(2) or they can be added to the list of overseas donee organisations appearing in sch 32. The history of sch 32 is that individually named organisations approved as “overseas” donee organisations were not originally listed in a schedule. Instead, they were listed in the body of the Act in what is now s LD 3(2). A separate schedule did not exist until the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007. In either case, listing in the body of the legislation or in the schedule relies on the scrutiny and approval of Cabinet. The current listing criteria have existed since 1978 as follows: The basic criteria for adding an organisation to the list of approved “overseas” charities: (i) the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries\*; or raising educational standards of a developing country\*; (ii) charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed should not qualify; IS 18/05 22 UNCLASSIFIED \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. \[CM 78/14/7 refers\] 113. The eligible purposes set out in the criteria are narrower than the common law meaning of “charity”, the meaning of “charitable purpose” in s 5 of the Charities Act 2005 and the purposes in s LD 3(2)(a). Accordingly, s LD 3(2)(a) and sch 32 are not concerned with identical purposes. They do not simply sit at opposite ends of a spectrum, depending on where an organisation’s purposes are achieved geographically. Schedule 32 criteria are limited to charitable purposes, whereas purposes for s LD 3(2)(a) include, but are not limited to, charitable purposes. Further, sch 32 charitable criteria are limited to a subset of charitable purposes and include only certain charitable purposes achieved in certain foreign countries. 114. This limits the extent to which inferences can be drawn on the meaning of “wholly or mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a). Also, the criteria determining how organisations may be added to sch 32 are not interpretatively relevant as they are not part of the Act. 115. Despite this, sch 32 is part of the Act. It is possible to look at the listed organisations and discern a common characteristic. This characteristic is that they all focus on achieving purposes outside New Zealand (although, a narrower range of purposes than s LD 3(2)(a)). The overseas focus of those organisations listed in sch 32 further reinforces the finding that Parliament is concerned with where purposes are being achieved. 116. The Commissioner considers it shows Parliament intended different rules to apply depending on whether purposes were being achieved to some degree within or outside New Zealand. Where purposes are being achieved outside New Zealand, Parliament controls donee organisation status through the Cabinet criteria and the need for legislative amendment to sch 32 to add further organisations. Where purposes are being achieved within New Zealand, s LD 3(2)(a) (in particular, the “wholly or mainly” requirement) exerts control on where such purposes are achieved. 117. However, as mentioned, this does not immediately suggest an appropriate numeric meaning for “wholly or mainly”. Arguably, a high figure for “wholly or mainly” would be more consistent with a view that this phrase in s LD 3(2)(a) expresses Parliament’s concern with, in this case, purposes being achieved within New Zealand. A lower figure for “wholly or mainly” would seem to undermine Parliament’s concern. This is because it would result in the domestic rules applying to situations where more funds (potentially, up to 49%) were being applied outside New Zealand without the degree of scrutiny required for sch 32 listing applying. Other uses of “wholly or mainly” 118. “Wholly or mainly” appears in other provisions of the Act. For example, s DC 3(2) refers to “a partnership that is engaged wholly or mainly in investing money” and an exemption in s CW 59 applies to a New Zealand company deriving income “wholly or mainly from Niue”. 119. For one recently enacted example, some extrinsic material suggests what was contemplated for “wholly or mainly”. Section CE 1B(4)(c) was inserted into the Act by s 15 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 which followed Employee Allowances (special report, Policy and IS 18/05 23 UNCLASSIFIED Strategy, Inland Revenue, Wellington, 2014). The special report commented on the meaning of “wholly or mainly” as follows: Work use of accommodation The deduction from the taxable amount when part of the accommodation is used for work purposes reflects current practice and the amendment is merely intended to clarify and confirm that approach. To qualify, a clearly identifiable part of the accommodation needs to be used “wholly or mainly” for work purposes related to the employee’s employment or service. The accommodation does not need to be used solely for work purposes to meet the “wholly or mainly” test, but it must at least be used predominantly for work purposes, and its primary purpose must be work-related. Any non-work-related use must be temporary or sporadic, or otherwise minor (such as using an office for checking personal emails or a family member occasionally using it for personal projects). The deduction is determined by apportioning between the business and private use. \[Emphasis added\] 120. While not expressed in percentage terms, references to predominate or primary use in contrast to temporary, sporadic or minor use show “wholly or mainly” in the context of s CE 1B(4)(c) was intended to mean more than a bare majority. 121. However, the same meaning of “mainly” may not necessarily apply throughout the Act. This is especially so, in the absence of a definition applicable for all uses of “wholly or mainly” or “mainly” in s YA 1. This is despite the word “mainly” being adopted in the 2004 rewrite of the Act with the intention of making the tax legislation clearer and structurally consistent through greater use of plain language. As explained in the approach to interpretation from \[40\], the required approach cannot disregard the context and purpose of the provisions, which could differ with different uses of the same word or phrase in the Act. 122. Even if the same meaning were intended, it is not clear what single meaning would be applied, so examining the context and purpose of each provision is still necessary. Consequently, it appears little assistance in determining the meaning of “wholly or mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) can be derived from considering other references to “wholly or mainly” or “mainly” in the Act. Purpose 123. The purpose of the Act is provided in s AA 1 as being to:  define, and impose tax on, net income;  impose obligations concerning tax; and  set out rules for calculating tax and for satisfying the obligations imposed. 124. Donee organisations and the tax benefits accruing to donors are part of the rules for calculating tax. This connection was more obvious when the donee organisation rules were first enacted as part of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. When first enacted, the tax benefit was in the form of a deduction from income up to a limit of £25. Aside from this, the purpose of the Act as a whole provides little guidance on how to interpret “wholly or mainly” in s LD 3(2)(a) in the context of the Act. IS 18/05 24 UNCLASSIFIED Legislative history 125. The history of s LD 3(2)(a) dates from the 1960s. Because of the age of the legislation there is little historical material available. None of the following material (identified in Burrows and Carter: Statute Law in New Zealand (at 278) as possible aids to interpretation) is available to draw on:  reports of committees, commissions or other bodies;  regulatory impact statements;  the explanatory note accompanying a Bill’s introduction;  disclosure statements identifying the Bill’s policy objective;  any report by the Attorney-General concerning implications under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990;  any changes made during the Bill’s passage through the House;  select committee commentary and reports;  explanations of any Supplementary Order Paper. 126. Dr Michael Gousmett traces the precedents for and history of the donee organisation legislation that now appears in the Act in “The history of charitable purpose tax concessions in New Zealand: Part 1 New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy Vol 19 (June 2013):139. As for the rationale for the legislation, the author concludes (at 155): There can be no doubt that the donations concession was intended to encourage philanthropy, as can be seen in \[the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Keith Holyoake’s\] words, that “\[t\]he Government is now giving an incentive to people to think of what they can give, not what they can get. This is an incentive to our people to give.” 133 But what was behind the incentive? When Mr Holyoake says that the incentive “will encourage self-help, community help, and community welfare activity,” 134 was National’s underlying rationale that if we encourage greater community activity, then there will be less of a call on government funds? Was this Government abdicating its responsibility for those less fortunate based on its philosophy of individual responsibility, or a genuine desire to assist the community in helping itself? Can the answer be found in National’s 1960 Election Manifesto? The author pondered on this thesis during the research phase, and eventually found an answer provided by \[Hon John Rae MP\], who said that: 135 The exemption of the donation is £25, which can be deducted for income tax purposes. ... I believe that this sum, which starts off quite modestly, can grow. At the moment it is limited to individuals. It is denied to companies. We will see how it goes and what it costs the country. I believe if people are given a little incentive great things will be done privately, and fewer demands will fall on the Government’s plate. I look forward to this concession growing with time. I believe that a great deal of good will be done by private donations for all these worthy objectives. In other words, community activity will relieve the government of burden, by transferring the cost to charitable entities which, in turn, would benefit from being exempt from income tax and donors would receive concessions. The unasked and answered question, however, is whether the cost to the government would be at least equal to or less than the tangible benefits provided by charitable entities to the community. 133 (3 July 1962) 330 NZPD 591 (emphasis added). 134 (3 July 1962) 330 NZPD 591. 135 (11 July 1962) 330 NZPD 840 (emphasis added). IS 18/05 25 UNCLASSIFIED 127. From the limited internal tax policy records available from when the legislation was enacted, the Commissioner is aware that the question of whether “principally” should be defined was considered and discounted. It was considered that by not expressly defining the term a more “elastic arrangement” would result. 4 128. In 1962, during the second reading of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2) the Hon H R Lake (Minister of Finance), said ((23 November 1962) 333 NZPD 2,893, at 2,894): The first main feature of the donation scheme is that, apart from the four organisations listed in the Bill—CORSO, the Red Cross Society Incorporated, the Lepers Trust Board Incorporated, and the Mission to Lepers (New Zealand)— the society, institution, organisation or trust to which the donation is made must be one in which there is no private profit for any individual. Furthermore, apart from the four exemptions mentioned in the Bill, it must be in New Zealand and its funds must be applied wholly or principally to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; or alternatively, it must be a New Zealand public institution maintained exclusively for one or more of these purposes, or a public fund so applied. Secondly—and this is important— if the society or other body does not qualify because of its purposes being partly but not principally charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural, it may set up a separate fund to be applied exclusively for those purposes, and in that case donations to the separate fund would qualify. 129. Also, the National (Government) member for Wellington Central, David Riddiford, after noting the credit’s extension beyond charitable purposes to benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes, stated (at 3,056): This provision extends the word “charitable” beyond its purely legal definition. Lawyers who have had to try to interpret the word “charity” in its legal definition will realise how many pitfalls are involved. .... However, this particular provision goes further by uniting the word “charitable” with the words “benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes”, and overcomes a difficulty which existed in regard to donations for charitable purposes, in that the donation had to be wholly for that purposes. Now it is sufficient if it be principally for that object. ... This Bill is in line with the National Government’s policy of reduction in taxation; ... to give encouragement and help to the charitable institutions which are in a position to assume such a large part of the burden which would otherwise fall on the shoulders of Government. 130. Mr Riddiford’s comments echo those cited by Dr Gousmett as attributable to the Rt Hon Keith Holyoake concerning the underlying rationale for the legislation was to encourage self-help and community help (ie, purposes being achieved within New Zealand). The history of the legislation appears to reinforce the view gained above that Parliament has a concern with where the purposes were being achieved. The object of relieving the government of the burden of expenditure that would otherwise be incurred domestically to achieve social outcomes would not be achieved if purposes were not being achieved within New Zealand. 131. More recently, the purpose of allowing a tax credit for gifts was set out in more detail in Tax Incentives for Giving to Charities and Other Non-profit Organisations: A government discussion document (Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, Wellington, 2006). The discussion document stated at \[1.13\]: Among the reasons that governments seek to promote charitable giving are: 4 The Commissioner acknowledges this material is not interpretatively relevant and is mentioned only to highlight that no clear intended meaning by the original drafters has been located. IS 18/05 26 UNCLASSIFIED Charities and other non-profit organisations help governments to further their social objectives, such as increasing support to the disadvantaged members of society and fostering a more caring and cohesive society. Many of the activities of charities and other non-profit organisations provide wider benefits to society over and above the value of the benefits received by the recipient or supplier of the activity. The activities of charities and other non-profit organisations may be more responsive to the needs of society than government programmes, since donors and charities can often respond more quickly to changing social needs. Also, the donations people make to such organisations provide an effective indicator of the extra goods and services people feel are needed. Because charitable activities use donated goods and volunteer labour they may be a more efficient way of providing social assistance than government programmes. 132. The discussion document shows that charitable giving is seen as benefiting a government’s social objectives. Charities (and other similar organisations) are seen as an efficient way to deliver these objectives. Further, people’s choices about the organisations they support are seen as being an effective way of targeting funds to where society feels they are most needed. The discussion document led to the Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007, which enhanced the tax incentives available for donations. The enhancement of tax incentives for charitable giving serves to reinforce the imperative for the incentives to advance the government’s social objectives. 133. This tends to support a higher numeric meaning for “wholly or mainly” than a bare majority. A higher figure is consistent with more social outcomes being achieved within New Zealand and with maximising the burden that the government is relieved of. Conclusions on the context and purpose 134. At a general level, the purposes of the donee organisation legislation are to encourage giving in society and encouraging community self-help. More specifically, a discernible concern exists in the legislation as to where the benefits of the giving are achieved. 135. For s LD 3(2)(a) that concern would indicate an interpretation of the text that ensures, as far as possible, benefits accrue to New Zealand society as this best achieves self-help in the community. In this way, the government is relieved of some of the burden of providing the goods and services that donee organisations provide to New Zealand society. Conclusions on the meaning of “wholly or mainly” 136. Generally, the ordinary meaning of “mainly” is not without its “difficulties” (see Fawcett Properties (at 512) or Hatschek’s patents (at 83)). The phrase “wholly or mainly” has been thought “ambiguous” (see Radio Authority (at 570)). 137. The examination of the text of s LD 3(2)(a) has shown that “mainly” can bear meanings that vary as to degree and is, therefore, unclear as to the figure it would set for the extent to which donee organisations must apply their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. 138. In this situation, a court would regard the context and purpose of the legislation “as essential guides to meaning” (Commerce Commission v Fonterra). IS 18/05 27 UNCLASSIFIED 139. On balance, the Commissioner considers a meaning for “wholly or mainly” of something greater than a bare majority better fulfils the purposes of the legislation in ensuring benefits accrue to New Zealand society as a result of s LD 3(2)(a). That is, in the Commissioner’s view, “mainly” is “coloured” by its use in conjunction with the word “wholly” and as a result means something considerably closer to 100% than a bare majority. 140. This view is due to:  The immediate context of s LD 3(2)(a) where “mainly” is used in conjunction with “wholly” and the focus is only on the portion of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand.  The other paragraphs of s LD 3(2) that require purposes to be achieved “exclusively” within New Zealand.  Schedule 32 of the Act which applies to organisations whose purposes are achieved principally overseas.  The history of the legislation that shows the provision of the tax credit to donors by Parliament was to encourage community self-help and help relieve the government of the burden of expenditure that it would otherwise incur to achieve domestic social outcomes. 141. However, the words “wholly or mainly” are ones of degree, and it is easier to point to certain figures and say with some certainty they are not included than it is to say what figure or range of figures are included. For instance, looking again at the cases where a figure greater than a bare majority was adopted for “mainly”, the decision in British Association of Leisure Parks (UKFTT) (which set the highest figure) is something of an outlier. Given the stature of the court involved and the lack of analysis in support of the court’s reasoning for the threshold, the Commissioner does not consider the case as authoritative in the context of s LD 3(2)(a). However, Hatschek’s patents, Fairmaid and Case E79 offer no assistance as to how much more than a bare majority is sufficient. In Radio Authority, the court simply adopted 75% as a mid-way point between the possible meanings of “mainly” ranging from 51% to 99%. 142. Also, when it comes to assigning percentages to the meaning of a term such as “wholly or mainly” it is important not to give the term a false impression of precision. This danger was highlighted in Radio Authority (at 569) where the court cited from the House of Lord’s decision in South Yorkshire Transport Ltd v Monopolies and Mergers Commission \[1993\] 1 All ER 289. In delivering the judgment of the court in South Yorkshire, Lord Mustill stated in relation to the meaning of the word “substantial” (at 294–295): The courts have repeatedly warned against the dangers of taking an inherently imprecise word, and by redefining it thrusting on it a spurious degree of precision. 143. On balance, the Commissioner’s view is that “wholly or mainly” is an imprecise term. While something considerably greater than a bare majority is indicated, it is not possible to interpret the expression with any greater certainty. 144. Despite this lack of interpretative certainty, the Commissioner will adopt an “administrative safe harbour” approach to administering s LD 3(2)(a). The safe harbour is a calculation method an organisation can adopt to arrive at a “safe harbour percentage”. If an organisation meets or exceeds the minimum safe harbour percentage, the Commissioner will generally accept without further enquiry that the organisation meets the “wholly or mainly” requirement in IS 18/05 28 UNCLASSIFIED s LD 3(2)(a). The Commissioner has set the safe harbour figure at a minimum of 75%. In other words, the Commissioner will adopt a “75% or more” safe harbour approach from the application date of this statement. 145. A figure of 75% was suggested in R v Radio Authority, ex p Bull \[1997\] 2 All ER 561 (CA). In that case, the court adopted a mid-way point between the possible meanings of “mainly” which ranged from 51% to 99%. The Commissioner considers this is a reasonable and pragmatic figure to apply in the context of s LD 3(2)(a). 146. This approach includes an allowance for flexibility year-on-year including an ability to look at an organisation’s history. In an exceptional year an organisation may be able to fall below the 75% lower boundary. However, it will not be acceptable to fall below a bare majority in any year as this is the lower bound of “mainly” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) under any view of the meaning of the word. Further details on how the safe harbour approach is to apply are set out from \[281\]. Meaning of “funds are applied” 147. Section LD 3(2)(a) refers to organisations “whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to \[specified\] purposes within New Zealand” (emphasis added). The key words yet to be considered in this phrase are “funds are applied”. “Funds” and “applied” are not defined in the Act, so both terms bear their ordinary meanings. The statutory text: “funds” 148. Th e Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “funds” as: fund  n. ... 2 (funds) financial resources. 149. It is not immediately apparent what the “financial resources” of an organisation would comprise. At its widest, it may include all actual and potential resources of a financial nature that might be available to an organisation. If so, it may include financial resources from a particular source (such as, income or capital receipts or both) or a financial resource of a particular form (such, as fixed, current or non- current assets or all of these). Alternatively, “financial resources” might comprise only some subset of these resources. 150. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary further defines the adjective “financial” as relating to “finance” which, in turn, is defined as “the management of large amounts of money”. This suggests “financial resources” might be limited to resources in money. This would be consistent with the Collins English Dictionary, which refers to “funds” in terms of “money” as follows: Funds (in British) plural noun 1. money that is readily available. 151. It would also be consistent with the Macquarie Dictionary (7 th ed, Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, Sydney, 2017) that defines the plural of “fund” as: Fund ... 4 (plural) money in hand; pecuniary resources. 152. “Money that is readily available” or “money in hand” suggests a meaning of “funds” that is referring to the financial resources that a person or an organisation has immediately available to meet commitments. Viewed narrowly, this could be simply cash or, more broadly, it may extend to such things as marketable securities and other highly liquid investments (ie, “near cash” financial resources). IS 18/05 29 UNCLASSIFIED 153. As such, “funds” as “money in hand” might then be likened to the accounting concepts of “cash” or a combination of “cash” and “cash equivalents”. “Cash equivalents” include short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, rather than for investment or other purposes. 154. “Funds” may also be likened to the accounting concept of “working capital” (which is the funds an entity has on hand to use in day-to-day operations calculated as current assets minus current liabilities). However, this appears to be a net concept so may not be as synonymous with “funds”. 155. While these other terms may have a technical meaning in law or the field of accounting practice, there is no indication that “funds” itself has a particular technical meaning (or, for that matter, that Parliament intended for “funds” to bear a technical meaning in the context of s LD 3(2)(a)). 156. Accordingly, the ordinary meaning of “funds” is not free from doubt. It may mean all the assets of an organisation, certain sources of financial resources (such as, income or capital receipts or both) or certain assets, such as cash or cash and near cash. Its meaning in s LD 3(2)(a) needs to be determined in light of the context and purpose of the legislation. The statutory text: “applied” 157. Dictionary definitions of “applied” give several meanings to the verb “apply”. The Collins English Dictionary relevantly defines “apply”, when used as a transitive verb (ie, with an object), as: apply (in British) verb –plies, -plying or –plied 1 (transitive) to put to practical use; utilize; employ ... 6. (transitive) to bring into operation or use ... 158. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines “apply” as: apply  v. (applies, applying, applied) ... 2 ...  bring into operation or use. ... 159. Consistent with these definitions, in Williams v Papworth \[1900\] AC 563 (PC), Lord Macnaghten stated (at 567): ... the word ‘applied’ ... simply means ‘devoted to’ or ‘employed for the special purpose thereof’. 160. Accordingly, it seems reasonably clear that “applied” refers to the situation where something (ie, “funds”) is “devoted to” or “put to use”, in this case, toward the object of specified purposes within New Zealand. Funds accumulated in investments or set aside rather than spent 161. Where funds have been spent it seems reasonably clear that the funds have been “applied” by being devoted to the object of the spending and the purposes that flow from the results of the spending. However, when funds are accumulated in investments or set aside in cash or short-term deposits rather than spent, the question arises as to whether the funds held have been “devoted to” or “put to use” to a purpose. IS 18/05 30 UNCLASSIFIED 162. No New Zealand case law appears to help with deciding this question. There are, however, overseas authorities on the question of whether accumulating income of a charity is to “apply” them. While care must be exercised in accepting the comments of courts in other jurisdictions, the Commissioner considers the United Kingdom and Australian authorities cited in this context relate to legislation sufficiently similar to s LD 3(2)(a) as to be relevant. 163. In each jurisdiction, the question was similar – whether the income of a charity or charitable fund had been “applied” either to charitable purposes or the purposes for which the fund was established. Similarities exist between s LD 3(2)(a) and the relevant overseas legislation in the way they both set a twofold test. First, the test concerns the nature of the organisation or fund. Second, the test concerns the application of the relevant funds to certain purposes. That is, s LD 3(2)(a) qualifies the types of organisations that it applies to in the first instance and, secondly, limits what qualifying organisations may apply their funds to. 164. This question arose in General Nursing Council for Scotland v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1929) 14 TC 645 (CSIH) in relation to an income tax exemption that, among other things, required the exempt income to be “applied to charitable purposes”. For some years the Nursing Council had accumulated surpluses of income over expenditure in cash, bank deposits and investments. The Council claimed the tax exemption for amounts of interest and dividends received from the accumulated funds. On the question of whether the interest and dividends needed to be spent to be “applied to charitable purposes”, Lord Sands stated (at 653): It does not import that the exemption is to be allowed only when the income has been spent, or falls immediately to be spent, for some charitable purposes. If the directors of a charitable trust deem it desirable that a capital sum should be accumulated for the service of the trust or that a reserve fund should be formed for the greater security of the trust, the income carried to the credit of any such account is, in my view, applied to a charitable purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 165. Accordingly, Lord Sands considered income could be “applied” when being accumulated for the general purposes of an organisation, rather than spent. 166. The issue of whether accumulating funds amounts to applying them did not arise in Molloy. However, the Court of Appeal in Molloy referred (at 690) to General Nursing Council for Scotland. In doing so, the court seemingly considered the case relevant to the issue of applying funds in the context of s 84B(2)(a) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (a predecessor of s LD 3(2)(a)). 167. Lord Sands’ view expressed in General Nursing Council for Scotland was accepted by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in IRC v Helen Slater Charitable Trust Ltd \[1982\] 1 Ch 49. In this case, the court considered that, where an organisation invested surplus funds, it was applying those funds to the purposes of the organisation. The case involved a similarly worded income tax exemption as considered in General Nursing Council for Scotland. The issue was whether donations by one charity to another charity were an application of the first charity’s income to charitable purposes, even though the second charity simply accumulated the funds. Among other things, the Commissioner argued that funds simply being invested as an accumulation to the second charity’s general funds was not an application of those funds to charitable purposes. The court rejected the Commissioner’s argument with Oliver LJ stating (at 59F): IS 18/05 31 UNCLASSIFIED Charitable trustees who simply leave surplus income uninvested cannot, I think, be said to have “applied” it at all and, indeed, would be in breach of trust. But if the income is reinvested by them and held, as invested, as part of the funds of the charity, I would be disposed to say that it is no less being applied for charitable purposes than it is if it is paid out in wages to the secretary. 168. Oliver LJ also affirmed the view of Slade J in the High Court (IRC v Helen Slater Charitable Trust Ltd \[1980\] 1 All ER 785) that to apply income to a particular purpose where it has been accumulated rather than spent required some affirmative act on the part of the organisation. That is, the organisation needed to have turned its mind to why the funds are being held. After reviewing several authorities referred to in the context of trust settlements, Oliver LJ stated (at 59E): I find these cases of little assistance in determining the meaning of the word “applied” in the context of the relevant subsections. Manifestly the legislature, in enacting them in the form in which they are, intended to impose some additional qualification for the exemption of income beyond that of merely being applicable for charitable purposes. ... I agree with Slade J. that it imports more than that—some affirmative requirement that the income should have been dealt with in some way or other. \[Emphasis added\] 169. Oliver LJ affirmed the High Court decision and, as above, Slade J’s comments in respect of “applied”. Oliver LJ also stated (at 794): Counsel submitted on behalf of the Crown, and counsel for the trust I think accepted, that the legislature, in using the affirmative phrase ‘so far as applied’ etc, must have intended to impose an affirmative requirement that the income should have been dealt with in some way or other. It was, I think, common ground that merely to receive income and do nothing with it would not amount to an ‘application’ thereof. \[Emphasis added\] 170. Accordingly, on these authorities, applying funds can include accumulating or setting aside funds. A conclusion that setting aside funds for a purpose is to apply those funds is also consistent with a meaning for “applied” of “devoted to” as noted at \[160\]. 171. However, the authorities above indicate there is an affirmative requirement to the investing or setting aside of funds. That is, funds will be “applied” by being invested or set aside only provided there has been an affirmative act on the part of the organisation to deal with them in some way so as to devote them to some purpose. Otherwise, the organisation is at risk of being considered to have done nothing with the funds. 172. The Commissioner expects this affirmative act of applying the funds by setting them aside would be the result of a decision as to the purpose to which the funds are to be applied. Some evidence of a decision to invest or set aside the funds would then be required. The decision may also be accompanied by certain acts such as opening bank accounts, depositing or transferring money, or making appropriate accounting entries. The decision needs to have been made at the appropriate level in the organisation for decisions of that type according to its established management practices (eg, the trustees of a charitable trust resolving to set aside money in the trust’s on-call savings account pending a capital purchase). IS 18/05 32 UNCLASSIFIED 173. For the purposes of s LD 3(2)(a) the relevant purpose is whether the funds invested or set aside are being devoted to specified purposes within New Zealand. Accordingly, it is necessary for the decision to accumulate funds to identify that the funds are to be applied to a purpose in sufficient detail to be able to characterise that application of funds as advancing charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. In all cases, where funds are “applied” by being accumulated, the application of the funds is considered again when the funds are spent. 174. Also, there may be instances where the decision to devote funds to a purpose is made in the first instance and not overtly revisited subsequently. For example, the decision to devote funds held in a particular bank current account to all the purposes of the organisation as general operating funds would usually be made at the time the account was opened and would not be expected to be formally revisited thereafter. Similarly, a decision to accumulate funds in investments over an extended period to fund a future major asset purchase would not necessarily be formally revisited each time income from the investments accrued to the capital or further investments were accumulated for the same purpose. 175. As mentioned, failing any affirmative act to apply the funds, the funds would not be considered “applied” in any way. This would mean they could not be treated as funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand, despite remaining part of the total “funds” of the organisation. “Excessive” accumulation of funds 176. An issue that arises in this context is whether funds can be accumulated “excessively”. This issue arose in the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) case of TACT v FCT (2008) AATA 275. In TACT, the Federal Commissioner argued that the trustee’s decision to accumulate income until the trust fund had net assets of $1 million was “excessive”. With no particular purpose for the accumulation, no assessment of the appropriateness of the figure and no time frame in which to raise the sum, the Commissioner argued the income was not being “applied for the purposes for which \[the trust fund\] was established”. At the same time, however, the Federal Commissioner accepted some accumulation of income for specific and justifiable good reasons was acceptable. 177. The AAT considered there was an inherent difficulty with the Federal Commissioner’s argument (at \[45\]): On the one hand it implicitly concedes that some accumulation of income is permissible. On the other it relies on either the concept of accumulation for a specific purpose, or an impressionistic characterisation of the accumulation as “excessive”, as marking the limits of permissible accumulation. 178. The AAT considered that the concepts of acceptable accumulations for specific purposes or the arbitrary characterisation of some accumulations as “excessive” were not found in the legislation’s requirement for the income of the fund to be applied for the purposes for which the fund was established. The AAT also referred to Helen Slater Charitable Trust (CA) as authority for rejecting the proposition that accumulation for general purposes does not evidence the required application of the fund. This argument was not renewed on subsequent appeals. (The litigation was concluded in FCT v Bargwanna \[2012\] HCA 11.) 179. As noted above, funds may not be considered “applied” if an organisation does nothing with them. The AAT decision in TACT v FCT raises the issue of whether a IS 18/05 33 UNCLASSIFIED question about an organisation’s eligibility under s LD 3(2)(a) could arise if it applied its funds by accumulating them to such an extent over such a period of time that it was doubtful that it was applying its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to the required degree. TACT v FCT, however, illustrates that it is not possible to provide hard and fast rules in this respect. 180. For instance, in Bargwanna the full High Court of Australia also noted where the issue of accumulating funds had arisen in earlier Australian cases. In particular, the issue arose in Trustees, Executors and Agency Co Ltd v Acting FCT (1917) 23 CLR 576 (HCA). This case was not decided on the issue of accumulating funds. However, in the course of argument, the Acting Federal Commissioner submitted that it was not possible to determine if a fund was being applied to charitable purposes until the fund or the income of the fund was spent on charitable purposes. The court did not accept this submission, with Isaacs J stating (at 586– 587): Argument was addressed to us on the meaning of “applied,” though it does not directly fall within the question asked. It must be observed, as pointed out by \[counsel for the appellant\], that a distinction is made between the “income” and the “fund,” and “applied” is attached to the “fund” and not the “income.” Further, the words are “the fund is being applied” – not simply “applied.” I agree that some elasticity must be given to the phrase. For instance, if a fund were established to purchase radium for free curative purposes, and if it were found that (say) £20,000 were required as a minimum, but the fund could accumulate only at the rate of £5,000 a year, and the Commissioner were satisfied that each year’s income was deposited in a bank for the special purpose of getting together £20,000, and buying the radium, he could well say he was satisfied the fund was “being applied” to the charitable purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 181. Not only does this decision reinforce the view that accumulating funds can mean the funds are applied, it illustrates by way of example the difficulty with setting limits around what might be considered “excessive” accumulations. In Trustees, Executors and Agency Co Ltd v Acting FCT, Isaacs J notes that an organisation might well accumulate all of its income over a period for a specific purpose and that this might well mean the income was being “applied” in an acceptable manner. 182. As noted from \[125\], the history of s LD 3(2)(a) supports the view that Parliament intended benefits to accrue to New Zealand society and, as a result, government would be relieved of some of the burden of providing the goods and services that donee organisations provide to New Zealand society. Organisations that simply accumulate funds, either by setting them aside or investing them over a period, may have difficulty in showing this purpose of the provision was being achieved. In the Commissioner’s view, an organisation that accumulates funds in this way will need to show that it has applied those funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to the required degree. “Funds are applied” in light of the context and purpose of the legislation 183. In accordance with the approach to statutory interpretation, set out from \[40\], the next step is to consider the ordinary meanings of “funds” and “applied” in light of the context and purpose of the legislation. 184. As discussed, the word “funds” may be capable of a variety of meanings, such as the income or receipts of an organisation, or all or some of its assets. The IS 18/05 34 UNCLASSIFIED question is which meaning is most consistent with the context and purpose of the legislation. In contrast, it appeared reasonably clear that “applied” meant “to devote to” or “put to use” and that this included accumulating funds by investing them or setting them aside. If so, what is required next is to cross-check this meaning of “applied” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a). Immediate context – s LD 3(2)(a) 185. Section LD 3(2)(a) is concerned with the achievement of certain purposes within New Zealand. Clearly, to achieve certain purposes as a set of desired results or some future state, resources of some sort need to be deployed in some way to bring about those results or that future state. In this case, Parliament used the word “funds” to describe the resources being considered, and it expects those resources to be deployed by way of being “applied”. “Funds” 186. The immediate context includes the need for “funds” to be “applied” to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent required of the quantitative measure provided by the phrase “wholly or mainly”. This means “funds” and the extent of their application must be measurable. Another relevant factor is, as discussed above, funds can be applied where they have been accumulated for a purpose, in addition to being spent. 187. Another consideration, especially relevant when considering a quantitative test, is that a meaning that gives the most practical and sensible result is to be preferred. Burrows and Carter: Statute Law in New Zealand notes this is a relevant interpretative consideration (at 329): If a provision is susceptible of several meanings, it is obvious that a court is likely to choose the one that leads to the most practical and sensible result. In many cases, courts have said that they are seeking the “most practical” interpretation. Finnemore J once said “\[If\] there are two different interpretations of the words in an Act, the Court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those things”. \[Footnotes omitted\] 188. As discussed from \[148\], the ordinary meaning of “funds” suggests a variety of possible meanings. To determine the meaning most appropriate in the context of s LD 3(2)(a), these possible meanings can be evaluated in light of the factors of measurability, practicality and the implications (if any) of how funds can be “applied”. 189. On the basis of the dictionary definitions of “funds”, the most consistent meaning appears to be “money in hand” or “money available to be spent”. A meaning of “financial resources” including fixed assets is less so, and meanings such as “receipts” or “income” do not feature in the definitions and would require a particular reading of “financial resources”. 190. Also, in the case of meanings such as “receipts” or “income”, it would have been open for Parliament to use more specific words than “funds”, such as “receipts” or “income”, had it intended those meanings. For that matter, it is also clear that “funds” does not mean “gifts”. This meaning was discounted by the court in Molloy in the context of a predecessor of s LD 3(2)(a). The court stated (at 691): IS 18/05 35 UNCLASSIFIED What s 84B(2)(a) refers to is not the intended or actual fate of the donation itself but the manner of the application of the whole or the principal part of the funds of the donee. 191. In any event, all of the meanings of “funds” discussed above could, arguably, include the gifts for which donors receive tax benefits. Most obviously, receipts would include gifts. Gifts could also be the source of cash or other assets (if the gifts had been spent on acquiring assets). Equally, all the meanings discussed above include more than just gifts. Accordingly, whether or not “funds” includes the gifts on which tax benefits accrue does not seem to provide a basis on which to distinguish the meaning for “funds” in the context of s LD 3(2)(a). 192. On the basis of measurability and practicality, “receipts” or “income” could, and are, easily quantified in the usual course of preparing an organisation’s financial statements. However, “income”, which excludes capital receipts, may not capture all amounts that then can be “applied” by being accumulated or spent. The receipts of an organisation over a particular period would include capital receipts. However, the funds “applied” would not necessarily correlate with the receipts for the period. This is because funds accumulated from a prior period may be spent in a later period. Overall, the terms “receipts” and “income” seem to be more descriptions of the sources of “funds” rather than a possible meaning of “funds”. 193. “Funds” as “money in hand” (being cash and highly liquid assets) are also measurable and can be practicably determined from accounting statements such as cash flow statements. Such a meaning would, over time, include all sources of money in hand as would be included in a meaning of “receipts”. It would also include money on hand at any point that has been applied by being accumulated. Cash on hand is readily quantifiable when held as physical currency. Cash on hand held in current accounts or other short-term deposits with financial institutions are similarly easily quantified. 194. The least quantifiable and most complicated meaning would seem to be the meaning of “financial resources” where this includes assets of all types. In this case, the amounts needed to be taken into account in terms of determining the application of funds would include not only closing values of cash and highly liquid assets but all other current and fixed assets as well. This includes assets that may have a significant risk of changes in value. 195. Accordingly, the “all assets” meaning of “financial resources” introduces difficult valuation issues and possible inequities in terms of quantifying the amount of an organisation’s “funds”, particularly, fixed assets. For instance, are the assets quantified for s LD 3(2)(a) purposes at original cost, written down book value or current market value. Market value would result in additional costs for organisations having to annually revalue all their assets. Cost or book values are easier to calculate but suffer from the fact that, over time, they may increasingly fail to provide a true reflection of the extent the resources of an organisation are devoted to different purposes. 196. While not free from doubt, in the Commissioner’s view the immediate context of s LD 3(2)(a) suggests that the most appropriate meaning of “funds” seems to be “money in hand” where this contemplates both cash and highly liquid investments available for meeting commitments. In this sense, it most closely resembles a combination of the accounting concepts of “cash” and “cash equivalents”. IS 18/05 36 UNCLASSIFIED Continuous application of funds over time 197. The phrase “funds are applied” suggests the putting to use of funds occurs on a continuing basis over the lifetime of the donee organisation. As noted at \[34\], the court in Molloy noted in relation to a predecessor of s LD 3(2)(a), that the legislation raised a number of problems, including (at 690): (4) whether the words “the funds are applied” relate to an income year or import a history of consistent qualifying application”. 198. In the Commissioner’s view, it is the latter (ie, a history of consistent qualifying application) that is required by the tenor of words “funds are applied”. This is so, even though administrative measures of compliance with this on-going lifetime requirement may be confined to looking at funds applied over a discrete period, such as a year, and then from year to year. This is not only a practical approach but is consistent with income tax being an annual tax, the administration of which follows an annual cycle (see Golden Bay Cement Company Ltd v CIR \[1999\] 1 NZLR 385 (PC) at 392 and CIR v Lemmington Holdings Ltd \[1982\] 1 NZLR 517 (CA) at 523). 199. Although the Commissioner considers that the legislation requires an on-going application of funds approach, quantifying how funds have been “applied” requires considering what the funds on hand have been invested or set aside for, or spent on. Spending, as the application of funds, is quantifiable with reference to the transaction values for funds spent over a period. Quantifying the funds invested or set aside for different purposes, however, can be done only for a point in time (eg, at the time the investment is made or at balance date). In either case, difficulties may arise with determining the purpose or purposes to which these “funds” have been “applied”. However, those difficulties arise regardless of which meaning is adopted for “funds are applied”. Wider context – the Act and other legislation 200. The only other instance of the phrase “funds are applied” in the Act appears in the group investment rules concerning “designated sources” (s HR 3(5)(b)). Historically, this provision can be traced back to 1968 when it was introduced to exempt charity-related trusts from a new trust tax regime. Due to the age of the provision, there is little material to suggest the intended meaning of “wholly or mainly” in this context. At the time it was introduced, it more closely resembled s 84B which was the predecessor of s LD 3(2)(a). This resemblance suggests it was simply modelled on s 84B which had been inserted in the Act only five years prior. 201. Section 58 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits the Commissioner to request a gift-exempt organisation to furnish a return of its “funds derived or received in any tax year and showing the source and application of those funds”. A gift exempt body comprises sch 32 donee organisations and could include s LD 3(2)(a) donee organisations that have RWT-exempt status. On the face of it, the use of “funds” in s 58 appears to contemplate funds as including “income” (ie, amounts either “derived” or “received”). As such, it does not appear entirely consistent with a view that the “funds” of an organisation in s LD 3(2)(a) means “money in hand”, although income received would be included in that meaning. However, as an administrative provision concerned with annual returns, it may be directed at different purposes. IS 18/05 37 UNCLASSIFIED 202. In a wider context, it can be seen that in other legislative contexts where a far- reaching definition of “funds” was seen as important, drafters did not rely on ordinary meanings of “funds”. Instead, the drafters provided an expansive statutory definition where the word “funds” includes, among other things, “assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable” (see s 4(1) of the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, s 5(1) of the Cluster Munitions Act 2009 and s 9(2) of the Mercenary Activities (Prohibition) Act 2004). 203. On balance, the wider legislative context does not suggest a need to reach a different conclusion on the meaning of “funds are applied” to that arrived from examining the immediate context of s LD 3(2)(a). Purpose 204. Following the approach to statutory interpretation previously outlined, the next step is to examine the meaning of “funds are applied” in light of the purpose of the legislation. The purpose of the legislation has been considered in \[123\] to \[133\] when looking at the meaning of “wholly or mainly”. It was concluded that the legislation was intended by Parliament to encourage giving to support community self-help and help relieve government of the burden of social expenditure that it would otherwise incur to achieve domestic social outcomes. 205. This purpose for the provision would tend to suggest an emphasis is on funds being spent on specified purposes within New Zealand. This reinforces the comments made at \[182\] that, while funds can be “applied” by being invested or set aside, organisations that simply accumulate funds in this way over a period may have difficulty in showing this purpose of the legislation was being achieved. Conclusions on the meaning of “funds are applied” 206. While not free from doubt, the Commissioner considers that, out of the range of possible meanings, the most appropriate meaning of “funds” is that it refers to the money readily available to an organisation at any point (ie, “money in hand”). This includes cash and other highly liquid assets available to meet commitments. 207. “Applied” means “devoted to” or “put to use” and includes where funds have been:  spent on a purpose or purposes;  invested for a purpose or purposes; or  set aside to be spent at some future date on a purpose or purposes. 208. While there are no specific limits on the extent to which funds can be accumulated, organisations that simply accumulate funds will still need to show that they are applying funds in this way to specified purposes within New Zealand to the required extent. 209. In the Commissioner’s view, “funds are applied” suggests:  Money can be applied to a purpose as a result of an affirmative act by the organisation to invest or set aside the money for future spending for some purpose or purposes.  The affirmative act is the decision to accumulate the funds that was made at the appropriate level in the organisation for decisions of that type, according to the organisation’s established management practices (eg, the trustees of IS 18/05 38 UNCLASSIFIED a charitable trust resolving to set aside money in the trust’s on-call savings account pending a capital purchase).  The decision to accumulate funds will need sufficient detail to be able to characterise that application of funds as advancing charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand. 210. Absent an affirmative act to apply funds, the funds are not applied to any purpose, although still form part of the organisation’s total “funds”. 211. The application of funds occurs on a continuing basis over the lifetime of the donee organisation. This is so, even though to gauge compliance with this on- going lifetime requirement on an administrative basis it is more practicable to look at funds applied over a discrete period, such as a year, and then from year to year. Meaning of “within New Zealand” 212. Section LD 3(2)(a) requires funds to be applied to specified purposes “within New Zealand”. The preposition “within” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as meaning “inside the range of” or “inside the bounds set by” something, in this case, “New Zealand”. In most cases it does not seem to present any particular interpretative difficulties. However, there can be situations where what made up the boundaries of this country may be in issue. It is, therefore, useful to explain in more detail the meaning of “New Zealand” in this context. “New Zealand” 213. The Act defines “New Zealand” inclusively (but not exhaustively) in s YA 1 as including certain things – the continental shelf and the water and air space above the continental shelf that is beyond New Zealand’s territorial sea (subject to some limitations). 214. To find a definition of “New Zealand” in terms of what it would commonly be thought of as including, resort must be made to s 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999, which provides: New Zealand or similar words referring to New Zealand, when used as a territorial description, mean the islands and territories within the Realm of New Zealand; but do not include the self-governing State of the Cook Islands, the self-governing State of Niue, Tokelau, or the Ross Dependency 215. The Interpretation Act 1999 applies to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless the latter provides otherwise or the context of the legislation requires a different interpretation (s 4 of the Interpretation Act 1999). In the Commissioner’s view, the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply otherwise or for the purposes of s LD 3(2)(a) indicate a different context in terms of overriding the effect of s 4 of the Interpretation Act 1999. Therefore, the Interpretation Act 1999 definition of “New Zealand” applies to s LD 3(2)(a). 216. Importantly, the definition in s 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999 does not include the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency in the meaning of “New Zealand”. 217. This means “New Zealand” in s LD 3(2)(a) includes what is commonly understood to be included in this geographical term. That is, the North, South, Stewart, IS 18/05 39 UNCLASSIFIED Chatham and Kermadec Islands and all other territories, islands, and islets in the geographical areas set out in the New Zealand Boundaries Act 1863 (UK) and the preamble of the Kermadec Islands Act 1887. “Within New Zealand” 218. Where it refers to an organisation “whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to \[specified\] purposes within New Zealand”, s LD 3(2)(a) may leave some doubt about what the “within New Zealand” requirement relates to. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the phrase “within New Zealand” relates to where the purposes are carried out or achieved, rather than to where the funds are applied or spent. This means the geographic location of where the funds are spent is not relevant. 219. This issue arose in Case T50 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,346 (TRA). Case T50 concerned whether the taxpayer was a charitable trust where a payment of trust money was made as a donation to an organisation outside New Zealand. Judge Willy stated (at 8,361 – 8,362): I think the only fair conclusion to be drawn from that evidence is that although the monies were actually utilised in Australia for the preparation of the video material there, the whole purpose of the donations was to enable the New Zealand League of Rights to have access to that material as of right for use in New Zealand and although the trustees have power to apply trust funds to entities outside of New Zealand I am not satisfied on the evidence in this case that such has occurred. \[Emphasis added\] 220. Judge Willy looked past where the funds were spent to the purpose for which the money was outlaid. The purpose of the expenditure in Australia was seen to provide a benefit arising in New Zealand (the right to use video material). As a result, Judge Willy considered the funds had not been applied outside New Zealand. Case T50 was appealed to the High Court (CIR v Dick \[2002\] 2 NZLR 560 (HC)). In the High Court, Glazebrook J stated (at 565): The Commissioner concentrated on some donations made by the foundation that were paid directly to the Australian League of Rights. The Australian League of Rights used the funds to defray part of the costs of video educational material which was used in both Australia and New Zealand. Judge Willy held first that the donations were to a charitable object and this finding was not challenged on appeal. Secondly he held (Case T50 at para 103) that the purpose of the donations was to enable the New Zealand League of Rights to have access to the video material for use in New Zealand. He regarded the payments as being to the New Zealand League of Rights who in turn decided to apply them for the production of material out of New Zealand for use within New Zealand. ... From a review of the evidence ... Judge Willy’s findings would appear to be findings that were available to him. The findings should not be disturbed on appeal and will not be. This means that all the donations made so far have been for purposes in New Zealand (given that Judge Willy’s finding is upheld). \[Emphasis added\] 221. The High Court’s decision was appealed in CIR v Dick \[2003\] 1 NZLR 741 (CA), although the aspect of the case discussed here was not challenged. IS 18/05 40 UNCLASSIFIED 222. Accordingly, the geographical location of where funds are applied in terms of where they are spent or paid is not determinative. What is determinative is for an organisation’s funds to be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. This may occur even if it results in money being paid outside New Zealand to achieve specified purposes within New Zealand. That is, there is no separate requirement in s LD 3(2)(a) for funds to be spent within New Zealand. 223. Conversely, spending money in New Zealand to achieve purposes overseas would not be sufficient for the funds involved to be considered as applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. For example, if the facts of Case T50 were reversed and altered slightly so that the payments were made to produce the video educational material in New Zealand for the Australian League of Rights to use, then this would not be an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This would be so, despite the funds being spent in New Zealand. When funds will be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 224. The Commissioner concluded at \[209\] that to apply funds requires some affirmative act on the part of the organisation to apply the funds to a purpose or purposes. In the context of s LD 3(2)(a), the relevant purposes are specified purposes within New Zealand. The question then arises as to when a particular application of funds are considered as an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. “Purposes” 225. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “purpose” (as the singular of “purposes”):  n. 1 the reason for which something is done or for which something exists 226. This definition suggests that the ordinary meaning of “purpose” is either the reason for which something is done or the reason for which something exists. In the context of s LD 3(2)(a), “purposes” is used as part of the phrase “charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand”. These “purposes” are linked to the application of the funds with the word “to” so it is the organisation’s funds that must be applied to these purposes. This suggests a meaning of “purposes” of the reason or reasons for which something is done. In this case, the reason or reasons the funds were applied must be to serve specified purposes within New Zealand. Connection to specified purposes within New Zealand 227. As a matter of practice, funds cannot be applied directly to purposes. Funds will usually be applied by being spent on the provision of goods or services in the course of carrying on some activity (unless they are accumulated for spending on future activities or donated to another organisation). The character of an activity is, however, ambiguous and is determined by the reason for which the activity is carried out. This was the view of Iacobucci J in Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women v MNR \[1999\] 1 SCR 10 (SCC): 152. While the definition of “charitable” is one major problem with the standard in s 149.1(1), it is not the only one. Another is its focus on “charitable activities” rather than purposes. The difficulty is that the character of an activity is at best ambiguous; for example, writing a letter to solicit donations for a dance school might well be considered charitable, but the very same activity might lose its charitable character if the donations were IS 18/05 41 UNCLASSIFIED to go to a group disseminating hate literature. In other words, it is really the purpose in furtherance of which an activity is carried out, and not the character of the activity itself, that determines whether or not it is of a charitable nature. \[Emphasis added\] 228. In the same case, Gonthier J considered that it would then be a matter of whether a sufficient connection exists between the activity and the purpose the activity is meant to serve: 62 Some question may also arise as to the degree of “sufficient connection” between the activity under scrutiny and the purpose it is meant to serve. In Toronto Volgograd Committee, supra, at p. 259, Marceau J.A. held that activities must “be considered with respect to their immediate result and effect, not their possible eventual consequence”. That is, there must be a direct, rather than an indirect, relationship between the activity and the purpose it serves. That is the position taken by Iacobucci J. in the present appeal. I agree. However, I would be reluctant to interpret “direct” as “immediate”. All that is required is that there be a coherent relationship between the activity and the purpose, such that the activity can be said to be furthering the purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 229. This connection or nexus requirement is one that is similar to and consistent with the approach taken in other areas of tax, particularly, in respect of the principles of deductibility under the general permission of s DA 1. Section DA 1 allows deductions against income for expenditure or loss to the extent the expenditure is incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 230. One of the leading cases on the principles of deductibility is Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) in which Richardson J stated (at 61,274): The heart of the inquiry is the identification of the relationship between the advantage gained or sought to be gained by the expenditure and the income earning process. That in turn requires determining the true character of the payment. It then becomes a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand, and the income earning process on the other, to fall within the words of the section (C. of I.R. v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236, 61,242). 231. Applied to s LD 3(2)(a), this test would suggest that the “heart of the enquiry” over the application of funds would be to identify the relationship between the advantage gained or sought by the application of funds to an activity and the purposes served by that activity. 232. Under the general permission nexus test, the relationship between the expenditure and what it sought to provide does not hinge on the subjective motives of the taxpayer. For instance, in Magna Alloys & Research Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4,543 the full Federal Court of Australia considered that, under the Australian equivalent of the general permission, the relationship between expenditure and its purpose needed to be determined objectively (at 4,551): Given a sufficient identification of what the expenditure is for and the character and scope of the taxpayer’s income-earning undertaking or business, the question whether expenditure is incurred for the purpose of carrying on a business or for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income does not depend upon the taxpayer’s state of mind. The relationship between what the expenditure is for and the IS 18/05 42 UNCLASSIFIED taxpayer’s undertaking or business determines objectively the purpose of the expenditure. In cases to which a reference to purpose is required or appropriate, objective purpose will be found to be an element in determining whether expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or in carrying on business. If the purpose of incurring expenditure is not the gaining or producing of assessable income or the carrying on of a business, the expenditure cannot be said to be ‘incidental and relevant’ to gaining or producing assessable income or carrying on business; or to be incurred ‘in the course of gaining or producing’ assessable income or of carrying on a business; nor can the undertaking or business be seen to be ‘the occasion of’ the expenditure. \[Emphasis added\] 233. The Commissioner considers these comments have relevance to the evaluation of funds applied, or to be applied on activities and whether those activities serve particular purposes. In the Commissioner’s view, applied to s LD 3(2)(a), they mean that the question of whether funds have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand must be determined objectively. They also mean that there must be a sufficient direct (although not necessarily an immediate) connection between the application or future application of funds to an activity and the advancement of specified purposes within New Zealand. 234. In relation to determining whether a sufficient relationship exists between the application of funds and specified purposes within New Zealand the issues that must be considered are:  the distinction between results and purposes;  whether funds are applied to more than one purpose and need apportioning to different purposes;  whether it is the immediate or less immediate purpose that is determinative; and  the situation where funds are applied by being donated to another organisation. Distinction between results and purposes 235. A distinction can be made between results of an activity and the purposes the activity serves in terms of ends, means and consequences. The Privy Council made this distinction in an analogous context of whether a trust was established for charitable purposes in Latimer v CIR \[2004\] UKPC 13: \[32\] A trust may, however, authorize the trustees to apply the trust income for a number of different purposes. In such case the trust is not a valid charitable trust unless every purpose is wholly charitable. ... \[36\] The distinction is between ends, means and consequences. The ends must be exclusively charitable. But if the non-charitable benefits are merely the means or the incidental consequences of carrying out the charitable purposes and are not ends in themselves, charitable status is not lost. \[Emphasis added\] 236. The Privy Council equated “ends” with “purposes”. It noted that the means by which purposes are achieved or the incidental consequences of pursuing purposes may sometimes result in non-charitable results. However, this does not mean the organisation concerned has been established for the purpose of bringing about those non-charitable results, unless they were pursued as an end in themselves. IS 18/05 43 UNCLASSIFIED 237. A similar distinction was made in a charitable context by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal in Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v Attorney-General \[1971\] 3 All ER 1,029. In this case the issue arose of whether the council, which was incorporated for the purpose of preparing and publishing law reports, was charitable. The court held that the council was established exclusively for the charitable purpose of disseminating law reports that were beneficial to the development, administration and knowledge of the law. The fact that one result flowing from the council’s activities directed at this purpose was that the law reports were used by members of the legal profession in the earning of their fees did not detract from this finding. The court emphasised that the results flowing from the achievement of a purpose should not be confused with the purpose itself. Sachs LJ stated (at 1040): Where the purpose of producing a book is to enable a specified subject, and a learned subject at that, to be studied, it is, in my judgment, published for the advancement of education, as this, of course, includes as regards the Statute of Elizabeth I the advancement of learning. That remains its purpose despite the fact that professional men--be they lawyers, doctors or chemists--use the knowledge acquired to earn their living. One must not confuse the results flowing from the achievement of a purpose with the purpose itself, any more than one should have regard to the motives of those who set that purpose in motion. \[Emphasis added\] 238. In this case, the result of benefiting the legal profession arose as a consequence of, or incidental to, the result of benefiting the public. As such, the court felt it could ignore these results when characterising the Council’s activities as exclusively charitable. In a New Zealand context, a similar outcome arose in CIR v New Zealand Council of Law Reporting (1981) 5 NZTC 61,053 (CA). 239. In these cases, the court could arrive at its conclusion only if the benefit to the public was seen as the overriding purpose or object of the Council. To arrive at this view of the relationship between these different results, the court saw the objects clause in the founding memorandum of the Council as playing a leading role. Those objects established, in the eyes of the court, the leading role of the purpose of benefiting the public to which other results could then be seen as an incidence or consequence of. 240. While these cases relate to whether a particular entity is charitable, the Commissioner considers the approach adopted by the courts in these cases has some relevance to s LD 3(2)(a). In particular, they have relevance to the question of whether funds have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. The approach of the courts in these cases may assist in deciding if all the results that arise from a particular application of funds are relevant to this question. For instance, a particular application of funds may result in a variety of results some of which may be possibly seen as advancing specified purposes within New Zealand. Conversely, some results may be able to be seen as advancing purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand. 241. If the approach taken in these types of cases is applied in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) it requires considering all the results that arise from a particular application of funds and determining the relationship the results have to each other and to the organisation’s objects as set out in its founding documents. From this, it may be possible to discern which results arose directly from pursuing the organisation’s objects and which were incidental, ancillary or consequential to other results. Only the results directly relatable to the objects of the organisation IS 18/05 44 UNCLASSIFIED would then characterise the purposes served by the application of funds. Incidental or consequential results could be ignored for this exercise. Put another way, these cases provide another way of viewing whether the results from a particular application of funds are sufficiently related to the advancing of specified purposes within New Zealand. 242. Viewing the results of an application of funds in terms of whether they are incidental to other results and in terms of their relationship to the organisation’s objects provides a way of narrowing the range of results that are relevant to the enquiry into whether the results bear a sufficient relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand. In other words, just because an application of funds gives rise to certain results, these results may not be determinative of the purpose or purposes to which the funds have been applied. The examples 2, 7 to 9 and 15 appearing from \[280\] illustrate this concept. 243. On the other hand, if certain results do not naturally arise incidentally or consequentially to other results such that they appear to have been pursued as an additional result or end in their own right, this may indicate the presence of another independent and additional purpose for the application of funds. If so, there may be a need to apportion the expenditure concerned to different purposes when determining if an organisation has applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand to the required extent. Apportionment is required if the purposes differ as to whether they are specified purposes within New Zealand or other purposes. The examples 3 and 4 appearing from \[280\] illustrate situations where apportionment is necessary because funds have been applied to different purposes. 244. It will be a matter of fact and degree as to whether particular results are of sufficient importance to indicate that they are an additional purpose of the application of funds. Similarly, it is not possible to provide rules as to when some results are independent results and, therefore, fulfilling an additional purpose or when they are incidental to other results. Each application of funds will need to be assessed objectively on its own merits. The examples appearing after \[280\] may assist an organisation with this issue. Apportionment of funds applied to more than one purpose 245. As discussed above, there may be instances of where funds have been applied to more than one purpose and a need to apportion the expenditure to these different purposes may arise if the purposes differ as to whether they are specified purposes within New Zealand or other purposes. 246. As mentioned at \[229\], the need for a connection between the activity to which funds have been applied and specified purposes within New Zealand is similar to and consistent with the approach to the deductibility of expenditure under the general permission of s DA 1. Apportionment issues also arise under the general permission because s DA 1 permits a deduction for expenditure or loss “to the extent” it is incurred in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the derivation of income. Case authorities on this issue in that context include CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA), Ronpibon Tin NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 (HCA), Buckley & Young and Omihi Lime Co Ltd v CIR \[1964\] NZLR 731 (HC)). 247. Case law in the context of s DA 1 establishes general principles that the Commissioner considers would be applicable to apportionment issues under s LD 3(2)(a), being: IS 18/05 45 UNCLASSIFIED  It is impossible to prescribe any precise formula applicable to all cases because the circumstances of the particular case will usually determine the most apt way of deciding how to apportion an amount (Buckley & Young).  The apportionment must be fair, not arbitrary, and must be done as a matter of fact (Buckley & Young).  Where expenditure has distinct and severable components it can be divided or dissected where the distinct and severable components can be related to differing tax treatments (Banks, Ronpibon Tin).  Where a single outlay serves two or more objects indifferently, dissection is impractical and apportionment on a fair and reasonable basis applies (Buckley & Young).  Some fair and reasonable bases for apportionment may include (Buckley & Young): o the actual use or availability for use, of an asset used for more than one purpose; o the respective values of the advantages arising from the expenditure; or o where the advantages do not lend themselves to measurement, some particular part or fractional share of the total expenditure if the part or share can be established on the basis of sufficient evidence.  In apportionment cases, the onus of proof lies with the taxpayer (Buckley & Young).  Just because the apportionment might be difficult is not of itself sufficient reason for failing to find that some apportionment can be made (Buckley & Young).  Absolute precision cannot be expected and a reasonable estimate is sufficient (Omihi Lime Co). Immediate and less immediate purposes 248. As mentioned, the reasons for funds being applied in a particular way need to be assessed objectively alongside the objects of the organisation and an assessment made of the degree of connection between the application of funds, the related activities and the actual or likely results and consequences of those activities. The aim is to reach an overall determination of what purposes are being served. 249. The need for a sufficient connection between the application of funds and purposes might suggest the connection must be the immediate purpose served by the application of funds. However, as noted at \[228\], in Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women, Gonthier J was reluctant to relate the need for a direct relationship between an activity and the purpose it serves as an “immediate” need. 250. Accordingly, the determination of the purpose or purposes served by an application of funds may need to have regard to whether it is the immediate or less immediate purposes served that are determinative 251. One common situation where this may be important is in relation to funds applied in trading activities or to fund-raising events. On one view, these funds are immediately applied to those activities or events. This may lead to a view that IS 18/05 46 UNCLASSIFIED these funds are not applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, the less immediate, but more relevant purpose to which they are applied, may be the purpose to which the surplus funds generated by the activities or events are to be applied. 252. The situation where a charitable organisation has been carrying on a trading activity and its relationship to its charitable ends has arisen many times in the courts in various contexts. For example, in CIR v Carey’s (Petone and Miramar) Ltd \[1963\] NZLR 450, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of whether a stamp duty exemption for property held on charitable trust applied to certain property assigned to a company on trust. The Commissioner argued that, as the company was empowered to use the property assigned in the furtherance of its trading activities, the property could not be said to be held on charitable trust. However, the Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s argument with Glesson P stating (at 455): The conduct of the business is subjected to the dominating consideration that the income, when ascertained, shall be paid to the Board to be apportioned exclusively amongst charities. All the wide powers given to the respondent are for the purpose of developing the business and increasing the income yield. It is indeed not uncommon for trustees to be given such powers as to carry on farming or other business for the benefit of the widow or children of a testator; in such a case the whole net income from the investment is held in trust for the nominated beneficiaries. It cannot be doubted that a trust is thus constituted, and if the objects of such a trust are indubitably charitable, can it be contended that it is not a charitable trust? Such trustees, in carrying on the business of the farm would have to buy and sell stock and engage in sundry other commercial operations; but these incidental and intermediate operations, involving no diversion of ultimate income into non-charitable channels cannot, in our opinion, change the essential charitable nature of the original trust if that nature be found to be originally charitable. \[Emphasis added\] 253. Accordingly, the court saw the trading activities of a charitable trust as “incidental and intermediate operations” that would not detract from the charitable nature of the trust. While some income may be applied immediately to non-charitable business operations, the court appeared to take a less immediate view in concluding that there was “no diversion of ultimate income” to non-charitable purposes. 254. In FCT v Word Investments Ltd \[2007\] FCAFC 171 the full Federal Court of Australia considered the charitable status of a company that carried out investment activities and operated a funeral business where its profits were applied to another charitable entity. The court considered the trading activities did not mean the company was not charitable in nature. Allsop J stated: 32. To the contrary of the Commissioner’s proposition that the predominance of non-charitable activities by an entity can deny the possibility of its characterisation as a charitable institution, there is authority to the effect that a company that is incorporated for the object of charitable purposes that conducts activities of a so-call commercial (or relevantly non- inherently charitable kind) for the clear and exclusive purposes (as here) of raising funds to deploy in ways that are charitable is or can be characterised as a charitable institution. ... 48. Here, on the proper understanding of the memorandum of association, the purpose of all activities was, and could only be, the religious (and charitable) purposes of Word. ... On the basis of the authorities to which I have referred, the commercial nature of the activities did IS 18/05 47 UNCLASSIFIED not necessarily destroy the capacity of Word to be characterised as a charitable institution. \[Emphasis added\] 255. The authorities Allsop J referred to included CIR v Carey’s (Petone and Miramar) Ltd and Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women. This focus by the courts on the way in which the net surplus is applied to charitable purposes seems to involve characterising the non-charitable activities as either “incidental” (and thus ignored as a purpose of the application of the funds) or charitable in themselves. The latter would be consistent with the view of Iacobucci J in Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women. That is, that activities (including trading activities) are “at best ambiguous” and that it is “really the purpose in furtherance of which an activity is carried out, and not the character of the activity itself, that determines whether or not it is of a charitable nature” (at 152 as shown at \[227\]). 256. In other cases, it has been recognised that the commercial activities may be the way the entity directly realises its charitable purposes. If so, it would seem that the trading activities themselves are seen as charitable in nature. See, for example, Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd v Glasgow Corporation \[1967\] SC (HL) 116, Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (Qld) v FCT \[ 1971\] HCA 44 and Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v Attorney-General. In these cases the activities carried out (cremation services and law reporting, respectively) were the means of carrying out the charitable purposes of the organisation. 257. Accordingly, as the authorities show, the mere operation of trading activities does not preclude the organisation conducting the activities from being considered charitable. The application of funds to non-charitable purposes in those examples is not seen as detracting from the organisation’s overall charitable nature. This is because either the application of funds to the trading activity is an application for charitable purposes or the trading purposes are incidental to charitable purposes. 258. In light of these authorities, the Commissioner considers that a court faced with a similar situation in the context of s LD 3(2)(a) is likely to view the funds applied to trading activities as being applied to the same purposes as the net surplus from such activities are applied where trading activities are conducted as a means of raising funds. Alternatively, where the trading directly achieves a certain object or objects of the organisation, the funds applied immediately to trading activities are accepted as being applied to those objects. Applying funds by donating them to another organisation 259. As mentioned at \[227\], funds cannot be applied directly to purposes and would usually be applied by being spent on activities that then serve certain purposes. Unless, that is, the funds were either accumulated for future spending or passed on to another organisation to fund the activities and purposes of the other organisation. 260. In the latter case, the question arises as to what purposes the donated funds would be considered as applied to where the donation is made by an organisation to which s LD 3(2)(a) applies. 261. In FCT v Word Investments Ltd \[2006\] FCA 1414 the Federal Court of Australia stated it was what the donor understood was to be the purposes advanced by the IS 18/05 48 UNCLASSIFIED donated funds that was relevant to whether funds had been applied to a charitable purpose. This case involved the application of the Australian income tax exemption available to charities. As part of the decision, Sundberg J considered the purposes to which funds had been applied by one organisation (Word) when it had passed money to another organisation (Wycliffe): 31 This evidentiary submission invites consideration of the wrong question. It is not relevant whether Wycliffe and the other recipients of Word’s funds used those funds for religious purposes; that question is only relevant to the charitable purposes of those organisations. In determining Word’s purposes, the question is what Word understood was being done with its funds. On this question, there was ample evidence. Three directors of Word gave evidence before the Tribunal. Two of them were also directors of Wycliffe. All three gave evidence of Wycliffe’s activities and the reasons why Word supported those activities. All three were cross-examined by counsel for the Commissioner. Also in evidence was the fact that Wycliffe has itself been endorsed by the Commissioner as an exempt charity and that the directors of Word were aware of this. Finally, in considering the evidence, the Tribunal was required to give Word the benefit of the presumption referred to by Higgins J in Hardey v Tory \[1923\] HCA 35; (1923) 32 CLR 592 at 595: “where a gift is made to a society having a distinctive charitable purpose, prima facie the gift is for that purpose.” 32. ... Clearly, in this case there was evidence that Wycliffe and the other organisations used the money received from Word for charitable purposes. More importantly, there was also evidence that Word intended and believed Wycliffe and the other organisations would use the money for charitable purposes. ... \[Emphasis added\] 262. Sundberg J suggests (at \[31\]), it may not be relevant what the recipient organisation (Wycliffe) did with the funds that it received from Word. He suggests what was more relevant was what Word understood was to be done with the funds. However, the two organisations had close associations, and Sundberg J notes (at \[32\]) that the funds passed from Word to Wycliffe were actually used for charitable purposes. 263. Sundberg J also relied on authority arising in a cy-près context. This is a reference to the situation where the original objective of a settlor or testator in making a charitable settlement or donation has become impossible, impractical or illegal to perform. If so, the court can amend the terms of the charitable trust as closely as possible to that as originally intended by the settlor or testator. This arose, for instance, in Hardey v Tory (1923) 32 CLR 592 where Higgins J stated (at 595): ... where a gift is made to a society having a distinctive charitable purpose, prima facie the gift is for that purpose. ... The gift to the Wesleyan Missionary Society is prima facie to the objects of that Society, and there is nothing in the will to contradict or qualify that prima facie meaning. \[Emphasis added\] 264. For other examples of this approach from the courts in a testamentary gift context see: Smith v West Australian Trustee Executor & Agency Co Ltd (1950) 81 CLR 320 (HCA) (at 322) and Stratton v Simpson (1970) 125 CLR 138 (HCA) (at 142). 265. Helen Slater Charitable Trust (CA) similarly suggests the use of donated funds by the recipient may not be relevant to determining if the donee organisation has IS 18/05 49 UNCLASSIFIED made charitable use of its funds where it has passed its funds on to another organisation. In Helen Slater Charitable Trust (CA), Oliver LJ stated (at 56): The Crown’s proposition is a startling one; it involves this, that the trustees of a grant-making charity, although they may discharge themselves as a matter of law by making a grant to another properly constituted charity, are obliged if they wish to claim exemption under the subsections to inquire into the application of the funds given and to demonstrate to the revenue how those funds have been dealt with by other trustees over whom they have no control and for whose actions they are not answerable. Anything more inconvenient would be difficult to imagine, and I find myself quite unable to accept that the legislature, in enacting these sections, can possibly have intended such a result. For my part, I entertain no doubt whatever that, as a general proposition, funds which are donated by a charity “A”, pursuant to its trust deed or constitution, to charity “B” are funds which are “applied” by charity “A” for charitable purposes. \[Emphasis added\] 266. Accordingly, there is authority in such cases as Word and Helen Slater Charitable Trust (CA) that, in deciding whether funds are applied to charitable purposes when they are passed from one organisation to another, it may not be necessary to trace what the recipient organisation did with the funds. However, in both cases there was a close relationship between the two organisations involved. Also, all that the court needed to establish in these cases was whether funds were applied to charitable purposes. The courts did not need to decide where those charitable purposes were being advanced geographically, as is the nature of the enquiry in s LD 3(2)(a). 267. In the situation where the recipient organisation is clearly charitable, case authorities suggest that reliance can be placed on the proposition that a donation to a charitable organisation is, on the face of it, a donation to the distinct charitable purposes of that organisation (see Hardey v Tory, Smith v West Australian Trustee Executor & Agency Co and Stratton v Simpson). 268. In some instances, the distinctive objects of the other organisation will indicate that the donated funds have been applied wholly to specified purposes within New Zealand and can be counted as such. For example, a donation to a public institution or fund that has donee status under ss LD 3(2)(b), (c) or (d) would be a donation to an organisation or fund that is required to exclusively apply its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Sometimes, the other organisation will have objects such that it is obvious any donations received by it are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 269. In other cases, such as an overseas donee organisation listed in sch 32 of the Act, the presumption, without evidence to the contrary, would be that the donated funds are applied to that organisation’s distinct overseas objects, rather than to specified purposes within New Zealand. Those funds need to be counted as not applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. 270. In all cases where a donee organisation has applied funds by donating them to another organisation, the donee organisation may need to establish it has applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand and, depending on the circumstances, to what extent to ensure it meets the safe harbour. IS 18/05 50 UNCLASSIFIED Conclusions on when funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 271. “Purposes” in relation to s LD 3(2)(a) means the reason or reasons funds were applied and these reasons must be to serve specified purposes within New Zealand. 272. Unless accumulated or donated to another organisation, funds would usually be applied by being spent on the provision of goods or services in the course of carrying on some activity. The character of an activity is, however, ambiguous and is determined by the reason for which the activity is carried out as assessed objectively from the activity’s results. 273. The heart of the enquiry under s LD 3(2)(a) over the application of funds is to identify objectively if a sufficient relationship (a connection or nexus) exists between the purposes served by the activity (or, the future activity) and specified purposes within New Zealand. This is similar to the approach taken in respect of the principles of deductibility under the general permission of s DA 1. The connection needs to be sufficiently direct, although this is not necessarily an immediate connection. 274. In assessing the connection, the following must be considered:  A distinction can be made between purposes and results. Some results arise incidentally or consequentially to the achievement of other results directly relatable to the objects of the organisation as set out in its founding documents. If so, they can be ignored for the exercise of determining whether the results of activities arising from an application of funds bear a sufficient relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand.  Results not naturally arising as an incident or consequence to other results pursued as an additional result or end in their own right may indicate the presence of another independent and additional purpose of the application of funds. If so, the expenditure concerned may need to be apportioned to different purposes. Apportionment is required if the purposes differ as to whether they are specified purposes within New Zealand or other purposes.  Each application of funds will need to be assessed objectively on its own merits as to whether some results are incidental or consequential to other results or whether there was more than one purpose. 275. Where an application of funds serves both specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes there may be a need to apportion the funds to these different purposes. Apportionment issues in this context can be approached on a similar basis to apportionment arising under s DA 1. 276. The view taken of the purpose or purposes served by an application of funds may need to have regard to whether it is the immediate or less immediate purposes served that are determinative. 277. Where trading activities are conducted as a means of raising funds, the Commissioner considers funds applied to such activities as being applied to the same purposes as those to which the net surplus are applied. 278. In other cases, where the trading directly achieves certain objects of the organisation, then those objects will dictate what the funds applied to the trading activity are applied to. IS 18/05 51 UNCLASSIFIED 279. In all cases where a donee organisation has applied funds by donating them to another organisation, the donee organisation may need to establish it has applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand, and, depending on the circumstances to what extent, to ensure it meets the safe harbour. 280. The examples appearing below will help an organisation decide how much of its total funds are accumulated or spent for specified purposes within New Zealand. Examples – how to determine when funds are applied to specified purposes within New Zealand The following examples involve the Foliage Foundation. This foundation is a charitable organisation with donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a). The foundation was established with the primary object of supporting and undertaking the restoration or maintenance of New Zealand native forests by promoting or undertaking native tree planting programmes in New Zealand bush reserves. Other objects include public education on indigenous forest conservation issues in New Zealand and overseas as well as assisting or co-operating with other people or organisations with similar aims in New Zealand or overseas. Example 1 – Spending overseas to further New Zealand specified purposes The Foliage Foundation purchases and imports from a foreign supplier certain specialty tools used for clearing land and planting trees. Although the purchase involves spending offshore, the purpose of the expenditure is to advance the foundation’s New Zealand tree planting activities. Therefore, the spending is regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 2 – Spending in New Zealand to further overseas purposes The Foliage Foundation becomes concerned about the loss of rain forest in the Amazon basin of South America through logging and land clearing for agriculture. In response, it carries out a campaign in New Zealand to raise awareness about deforestation in the Amazon. The campaign involves a series of road shows around New Zealand for which the foundation pays each speaker’s expenses and a speaker’s fee. It pays an Auckland business to create a new website, separate from the foundation’s general website, with information specific to the Amazon rainforest issues. It also produces a number of television and radio advertisements that are broadcast on New Zealand stations. The campaign is directed at bringing about a halt to deforestation outside New Zealand. Any result this would bring about within New Zealand, for instance the effects this might arguably have on New Zealand’s climate, arises incidentally to the primary purpose of the campaign. Accordingly, the application of funds to the campaign does not bear a sufficiently direct relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the various costs are not regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 3 – Apportionment of expenses – wage costs dissected or apportioned The Amazon rainforest campaign in example 2 is very successful, so the Foliage Foundation hires one additional staff member to work full time on Amazon rainforest issues. The foundation has 19 other staff employed to carry on its New Zealand planting programme. It needs to dissect its total wage expense by staff member and consider the purpose for which each staff member is employed. IS 18/05 52 UNCLASSIFIED The salaries of the 19 staff are funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, the salary for the employee working on the Amazon rainforest issues is not. If any staff member was employed for more than one purpose, some apportionment of the individual’s wage expense on a reasonable basis might then be needed (eg, by hours spent on each purpose). This would require the foundation keeping adequate records to substantiate any apportionment calculation. Example 4 – Apportionment of expenses – electricity bill apportioned The Foliage Foundation is based in temporary accommodation from where all its activities are undertaken or directed and where all of the organisation’s staff are located. It receives and pays a $300 electricity bill for its accommodation. Unlike the previous example, it cannot reasonably trace the exact usage of electricity and dissect the electricity bill into the portion that relates to specified purposes within New Zealand and the portion that relates to its activities in relation to the Amazon. Accordingly, it needs to find some reasonable basis on which to apportion the electricity bill. In the absence of a more reasonable basis, Inland Revenue will generally accept apportionment of overhead expenses, such as electricity, on the basis of the percentage established by the funds that have been applied entirely to a single purpose plus those that have been apportioned using some other apportionment method. In this case, the foundation works out that it has applied funds entirely to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $8,000 and entirely to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand of $2,000. It has no other funds it can apportion on another discernible and reasonable basis. Accordingly, it apportions its electricity bill as being applied to specified purposes within New Zealand in the same ratio. 5 This means the electricity bill is apportioned to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $240 ($8,000 / $10,000 x $300 = $240). Example 5 – Scholarships for New Zealand students to study overseas The Foliage Foundation decides to start providing scholarships to high-achieving New Zealand arboriculture students to increase expertise in New Zealand. The scholarships allow students to undertake a year of study on courses specialising in the restoration of native forests at a foreign university. Although the scholarship funds are spent offshore and the students carry out their studies overseas, the students are required to return to New Zealand and many continue to work in related sectors in New Zealand. The results of having increased arboriculture skills and knowledge available to the foundation and New Zealand in general provide a sufficient connection to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the scholarship costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 6 – Sending employees to overseas conference The Foliage Foundation joins the Native Tree League, a worldwide network of organisations promoting native tree development programmes. Joining is free and entitles the foundation to attend the league’s annual conference and access technical resources and expertise from the league members. 5 This apportionment approach is described in more detail following these examples under the heading “apportionment of ‘overheads’” in the explanation of the safe harbour calculation (at \[299\]). IS 18/05 53 UNCLASSIFIED The foundation decides to send two of its employees to the league’s annual conference held that year in Argentina and has to pay for flights and accommodation. No holiday element is included in the trip. The employees return with increased knowledge of native tree preservation. The results of having increased skills and knowledge available to the foundation provide a sufficient connection to specified purposes within New Zealand. As such, the travel costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 7 - Sending a speaker to an overseas conference The Foliage Foundation decides to send another employee to present a paper at the annual Native Tree League conference in Argentina. The paper will be about their involvement in a recent study into kauri conservation. The foundation pays for the flights and accommodation and the employee attends the conference. No holiday element is included in the trip. One result of the expenditure is to benefit the foreign conference attendees with increased knowledge of kauri conservation issues. However, the employee’s presentation will also raise the profile of the foundation and international awareness of indigenous forest conservation issues in New Zealand. The employee will return with increased knowledge of these issues from attending the balance of the conference. Any personal benefit to the employee and any benefit to the other conference attendees who attend the paper’s presentation is incidental to these purposes. Therefore, the travel costs are regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 8 – Hosting overseas representatives Following the conference (example 7), the Foliage Foundation hosts two Native Tree League representatives while they are visiting New Zealand. Whether the expenditure incurred in hosting the representatives can be regarded as advancing specified purposes within New Zealand will depend on the purpose of the representatives’ visit. For instance, if the representatives are hosted while carrying on activities for the Native Tree League or during a private visit to New Zealand the expenditure will not advance the foundation’s objects. Therefore, the hosting costs are unlikely to be regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, if the representatives were hosted, for example, because they were the keynote speakers at the foundation’s annual conference, then the hosting costs would be considered as being applied to advance specified purposes within New Zealand with any benefit to the Native Tree League being incidental. In other circumstances, the hosting costs might advance the purposes of both organisations in which case some apportionment on a reasonable basis would be acceptable. Example 9 – Contribution to a foreign organisation A representative from the Native Tree League contacts the Foliage Foundation and asks for a contribution to the construction of the league’s worldwide headquarters in Argentina. The foundation decides that it will contribute a lump-sum payment because of the organisations’ shared interest in developing native tree planting programmes throughout the world. The contribution directly advances the purposes of the league overseas as it helps bring about the result that the league has new headquarters. This may have some indirect results that benefit members of the league in other countries, such as the foundation. However, such results are incidental to the direct advancement of the league’s purposes. IS 18/05 54 UNCLASSIFIED This means the contribution does not bear a sufficiently direct relationship to specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the contribution is not regarded as funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 10 – Investment in New Zealand and overseas To fund major planting projects planned for the South Island for coming years, the Foliage Foundation decides to use funds to invest in a portfolio of shares and bonds. Some of the shares and bonds it buys are in New Zealand companies, but most are in overseas listed companies. Most of the income from its investments is from overseas. The investment income will be reinvested until such time as all the investments are sold to fund the planned planting projects. The purchase of the shares and bonds and subsequent reinvestment of investment income involves the application of funds. The purpose advanced by the application of these funds is the less immediate purpose to which the investments will ultimately be applied. This purpose is the foundation’s tree-planting purposes within New Zealand. It is not relevant that some of the investments are overseas or that the source of some of the investment income is from overseas. Therefore, the accumulation of funds is regarded as being funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. When the investments are realised in the future, the cash spent on the South Island planting projects will also be an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 11 – Purchase of materials by trading activity The Foliage Foundation decides to run a small trading activity making and selling designer bush shirts from a shop in Wellington. It uses cash from its general operating funds to buy from overseas and New Zealand suppliers the raw materials used to manufacture the shirts. The shirts are then sold and the surplus used to fund the foundation’s New Zealand planting programmes. The relevant purpose to which the cash used to purchase raw materials is applied is the less immediate purpose of generating funds for the foundation to apply to its purposes of tree planting in New Zealand. Therefore, the purchase of the raw materials is regarded as being funds that have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 12 – Funding a future project The Foliage Foundation decides to buy a small block of land adjacent to a bush reserve and build an office and storage yard. It intends to use the premises for its permanent New Zealand head office from which all its activities are undertaken or directed and where its equipment is stored. All foundation staff will be located in the head office. The foundation appeals to its supporters for financial assistance. Tim, a foundation supporter, donates all the money needed to buy the land. In anticipation of Tim’s donation being spent on the new property, the foundation’s officers make a decision to invest the donation and create a building reserve fund in the foundation’s financial accounts. As further donations and funds arise they will be invested as a result of further decisions to accumulate funds towards this capital project. Ultimately, the capital project will result in advancing all the foundation’s objects by providing the site of the foundation’s future premises. As with example 4, apportionment of the funds accumulated is required as the foundation’s objects are advanced both within and outside of New Zealand. IS 18/05 55 UNCLASSIFIED Example 13 – Expenses related to a fixed asset The Foliage Foundation realises its investments and completes the capital project (from example 12) in a subsequent financial year. At this point, it needs to reconsider whether the cash realised from the investments is being spent for specified purposes within New Zealand. As it still intends to use the property for all of its activities, the funds being applied to the project will need to be apportioned on the same basis as previously. In the future, any costs of holding the property (such as local authority rates and insurance) may also need to be apportioned on a reasonable basis between all the foundation’s purposes. The holding costs could be apportioned using a similar approach to that used in example 4. Example 14 – Loan funds and repayments Instead of receiving all of the money needed for its new premises from a donation (as in example 12), the Foliage Foundation borrows some of what is needed from a trading bank. On borrowing the money from the bank, the money immediately becomes part of the foundation’s total funds for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. The borrowed funds are applied by being accumulated until they are spent, as in the earlier example. When the borrowed funds are spent, the foundation will need to consider the purpose for which the premises will be used. If, (as in example 13) all the funds are being applied to more than one purpose, they will need to be apportioned for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. Subsequently, the foundation will apply further funds to repay the loan from the bank. The purpose of the funds applied to the loan repayments will follow the purposes to which the original loan money was spent on. Example 15 – Overseas people viewing the Foliage Foundation’s general website The Foliage Foundation maintains two websites. One has general information about the foundation and details its New Zealand planting programmes and scholarships. The second, separate, website holds information about the foundation’s Amazon rainforest work (see example 2) and links to the Native Tree League’s website (see example 6). The foundation’s general website includes a link to this second website, but contains none of its content. The foundation finds that both of its websites get hits from visitors from overseas countries. However, because the general website’s content is not specifically directed to the foundation’s overseas activities, any use of the website by overseas persons is incidental. The expenditure involved in running the general website will still be viewed as advancing the foundation’s purposes in New Zealand. Therefore, the general website’s costs are regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. However, if in the future any of the content of the general website was specifically directed at advancing overseas purposes, some apportionment of the on-going website costs on a reasonable basis may be necessary. Example 16 – Spending for foreign posted worker holidaying in New Zealand After a few years, the Foliage Foundation’s Amazon rainforest campaign’s effectiveness declines. The foundation thinks it can make a greater difference by spending the same amount to engage somebody to travel to South America to undertake rainforest protection work. The foundation sends one of its long-time supporters, Emma, to Brazil. IS 18/05 56 UNCLASSIFIED After spending a year in Brazil, Emma returns to New Zealand for a two week holiday to see her family and friends. At the end of her holiday Emma will return to her duties in Brazil. The foundation helps pay for Emma’s travel and accommodation while she is in New Zealand. Although the travel and accommodation costs are spent in New Zealand, they are costs involved in advancing the foundation’s overseas purposes because Emma is primarily engaged in the activity of advancing rainforest protection work in Brazil even though she is temporarily visiting New Zealand. Therefore, the travel and accommodation costs will not be regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. Example 17 – Government contracts The Foliage Foundation enters into an agreement with a government department where, in return for the payment of a grant, the foundation carries out native forest restoration on Crown conservation land. On receipt, the grant will be part of the foundation’s total funds for the purposes of the safe harbour calculation. The foundation uses the grant to purchase native tree seedlings and to pay temporary employees to plant them. The grant spent on seedlings and employee wages are costs associated with the provision of outputs under the government contract. The purpose of the expenditure will, therefore, follow the purpose of the government contract. Since the purpose of the government contract is to restore New Zealand native forests, the expenditure advances specified purposes within New Zealand. Therefore, the grant money spent and the portion set aside for future spending under the grant agreement are regarded as being an application of funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. The same conclusion will apply, if the contract is terminated and, under the terms of the grant agreement, any unspent grant money is required to be repaid to the government department. The administrative safe harbour Introduction 281. As mentioned at \[144\], the Commissioner will, to provide greater certainty, administer the requirement that donee organisations under s LD 3(2)(a) must “wholly or mainly” apply their funds to specified purposes within New Zealand by adopting a “75% or more administrative safe harbour”. The following portion of this statement details how the safe harbour percentage is calculated and applied. 282. Broadly, the administrative safe harbour approach will give organisations certainty that the Commissioner will generally accept without further enquiry they have donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a) because they are sufficiently oriented towards achieving specified purposes within New Zealand. The “wholly or mainly” requirement of the legislation is considered a “whole-of-life” test, but the administrative safe harbour approach can be made part of an organisation’s annual financial reporting cycle. The safe harbour calculation below adopts the financial information prepared by organisations as part of their annual financial reporting as a starting point for the calculation. 283. If an organisation falls below the safe harbour minimum of 75% in an exceptional year, they can recalculate their safe harbour percentage by aggregating amounts for the current and previous two years (including periods before the application date of this statement). IS 18/05 57 UNCLASSIFIED 284. The calculation method takes into account money spent (on capital and revenue items) and money on hand that has been accumulated in investments or set aside during the year in cash or short-term deposits. It requires identifying amounts that may have been spent or accumulated entirely for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or entirely for other purposes. Other amounts may have been spent or accumulated partly for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand and partly for other purposes. For example, office overhead costs and general operating funds on hand at year-end may have been spent or set aside for a combination of these purposes. Funds may also have been accumulated in investments for a combination of purposes. If so, these funds need to be apportioned on a reasonable basis as described from \[245\]. The safe harbour calculation Using the organisation’s financial statements or performance report 285. For a registered charity, the starting point for the safe harbour calculation will be its:  Statement of cash flows or  Statement of receipts and payments. 286. These reports should be prepared as a matter of course in the organisation’s financial statements or performance report required annually by Charities Services. Organisations that are not registered charities could use the equivalent reports from their financial reports. 287. The financial statements or performance report for the organisation should be used rather than any consolidated accounts that include financial information for other entities. This is because s LD 3(2)(a) refers to “a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust” and not to a consolidated group that may include an entity of that type. 288. Financial reporting for registered charities fall into different “tiers” numbered from 1 to 4. A charity’s tier generally depends on the amount of its annual expenses or operating payments. Tier 1 to 3 charities will prepare a statement of cash flows as part of their financial statements. Organisations reporting under tier 4 prepare their performance report on a cash basis and have a statement of receipts and payments rather than a statement of cash flows. The statement of receipts and payments is equivalent in most respects to the statement of cash flows for tier 1 to 3 organisations, and can be used as the starting point to determine how an organisation’s funds have been applied. The steps in the calculation Step one – determine the organisation’s “total funds” for the year 289. The first step in the calculation is to find the organisation’s “total funds” for the year. As mentioned at \[153\], the term “funds” might be likened to the accounting concepts of “cash” and “cash equivalents” (ie, cash on hand and demand deposits plus short-term deposits and other amounts held for the purpose of meeting cash commitments, rather than for investment). For the purposes of the safe harbour calculation, all “cash and “cash equivalents” are accepted as a proxy for “funds”. IS 18/05 58 UNCLASSIFIED 290. An organisation’s total funds for a year is the amount of cash and cash equivalents the organisation had on hand at the beginning of the year plus all cash received in the year from all sources (ie, capital and revenue receipts). 291. Total funds will also equate to all the cash that an organisation has spent or invested in the year (ie, all cash outflows) and the cash and cash equivalents it has remaining on hand at the end of the year. 6 Given the focus on applying funds by way of accumulating or spending it, this view of “total funds” provides a more convenient starting point for the safe harbour calculation. 292. Regardless of how viewed, the “total funds” figure is intended to capture the total amount of cash and cash equivalents (ie, “funds”) that was available to the organisation in the year for it to apply in some way, either by spending or by accumulating it for future spending. Step two – determine the portion of total funds applied in the year to specified purposes within New Zealand 293. The second step is for the organisation to find the portion of the total funds that have been applied in the year to specified purposes within New Zealand. This step involves looking at all the cash spent or invested in the year and the cash (and cash equivalents) on hand at the end of the year (ie, amounts on hand excluding investments) and deciding whether it was applied: (a) entirely for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; (b) entirely for purposes other than charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand; or (c) for a combination of charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand and other purposes. 294. Some reasonable apportionment must be made between the different purposes advanced by the relevant application of funds for the amounts in (c) above (see the discussion of apportionment from \[245\]). The total of the amounts in (c) apportioned to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand plus the total of the amounts in (a) gives the total amount of funds the organisation has applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand for the year. Step three – calculate the safe harbour percentage 295. The third step in the safe harbour calculation is to work out the “safe harbour percentage” by dividing the total amount of funds applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand (per step two) by the organisation’s “total funds” (per step one). This figure, expressed as a percentage, is the organisation’s safe harbour percentage for the year. The Commissioner would expect that this figure is usually 75% or greater (but see 6 Cash and cash equivalents on hand will not include investments made in prior years. Investments made in the current year are treated as an application of funds at the time the investment is acquired (see \[297\] and \[298\]). IS 18/05 59 UNCLASSIFIED further from \[309\] concerning organisations not meeting this requirement in an exceptional year). 296. The flow chart in Figure 1 describes how an organisation should go about using its Financial Statements or Performance Report to find its percentage of funds applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand using the steps in the calculation mentioned above: Figure 1: The three steps of the safe harbour calculation 7 7 Step 1 assumes that the statement of cash flows has been prepared using the direct method. Step 3: Find the organisation's "safe harbour percentage". The "safe harbour percentage" is the organisation's "funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand" (as per Step 2 ) as a percentage of the organisation's "total funds" (as per Step 1 ). That is, "funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand" ÷ "total funds" = "safe harbour percentage". Step 2: Find the amount of the organisation's "funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand". Find the amount of cash that has been spent or accumulated entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand and the amount of cash that has been spent or accumulated entirely for other purposes. Then, find the amount of cash that has been spent or accumulated for a combination of these purposes. Apportion these amounts on a reasonable basis. Add the portion relating to specified purposes within New Zealand to the total of the cash entirely applied to those purposes. Step 1: Use the Statement of Cash Flows or Statement of Receipts and Payments in the organisation's Financial Statements/Performance Report to find the organisation’s "total funds". "Total funds" is (depending on the Statement used) the: - "Closing cash" plus the total of "Cash applied to" operating, investing and financing activities; or - "Bank Accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year" (excluding investments) plus the total of "Operating Payments" and "Capital Payments". IS 18/05 60 UNCLASSIFIED Additional comments about finding the amount an organisation has applied to specified purposes within New Zealand Investing and setting aside funds 297. Funds invested or set aside for future spending for some purpose or purposes are applied at the time the investment is acquired or the decision to set the funds aside is made. Practically this means that funds set aside but still on hand at balance date will be considered in every year’s safe harbour calculation up until and in the year they are spent. However, funds invested will be considered only in the year they are invested and again when spent. 298. Because the safe harbour calculation adopts the accounting terms “cash” and “cash equivalents” as a proxy for “funds” these terms will provide the basis for differentiating between funds set aside and investments. Generally, “cash equivalents” are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Often these funds will be set aside for funding an organisation’s on-going operational expenses and will be, therefore, usually set aside for the purpose of advancing all the objects of the organisation. Apportionment of “overheads” 299. Step 2 in the safe harbour calculation (in Figure 1) requires finding the amount of cash an organisation has spent or accumulated (ie, set aside or invested) for specified purposes within New Zealand. This includes apportioning amounts where they have been spent or accumulated for both specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes. 300. As mentioned in the earlier discussion on apportionment, in some cases funds are applied in such a way that different purposes are served without distinction and the relative application of funds does not lend itself easily to measurement. This situation may commonly arise for “overhead” type costs (eg, sundry office expenses). It may also arise for investments where funds have been accumulated for the general purposes of the organisation (see \[284\]). It may also be true of the general operating funds of the organisation on hand at year-end. In many cases, the general operating funds of the organisation on hand at year-end will equate to all of the funds (cash and cash equivalents) an organisation set aside at year-end. 301. In such cases, some basis of apportionment is still required. The Commissioner will generally accept apportioning these remaining funds based on the ratio established when the application of all the other funds is considered. That is, the ratio of the other funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (being those applied entirely to those purposes or those apportioned already to those purposes on some other reasonable basis) compared to the total of all these other funds. 302. For example, an organisation determines that the total funds in a year it has spent or accumulated entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand is $1,000. It determines that other funds totalling $500 have been spent or accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand and for other purposes. Using some apportionment method that is reasonable given the particular nature of these funds, the organisation apportions $200 of this total to specified purposes within IS 18/05 61 UNCLASSIFIED New Zealand. The ratio of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand established so far is, therefore, 80% ((1,000 + 200) / (1,000 + 500)). 303. The organisation has remaining funds of $800 that have been applied to a combination of purposes. This amount includes the organisation’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at year-end held as operating funds and other “overhead” expenses that relate to all the purposes of the organisation without distinction. It is assumed there is no discernable and reasonable basis on which to apportion these funds. Therefore, the Commissioner will generally accept that these funds can be apportioned using the percentage arrived at by considering the way the other $1,500 of the organisation’s funds have been spent or accumulated (ie, 80% to specified purposes within New Zealand). 304. In that case, the $800 of remaining funds is apportioned to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $640 (800 x 0.80). This means, assuming all of the organisation’s funds for the year have been applied to a purpose, the organisation’s “total funds” of $2,300 (1,500 + 800), have been applied to specified purposes within New Zealand to the extent of $1,840 (1,000 + 200 + 640). The organisation’s safe harbour percentage is 80% (1,840 / 2,300). 305. Including these remaining funds in the calculation does not affect the safe harbour percentage already determined from the analysis of the other funds spent or accumulated because the $800 is apportioned using the same ratio of 80%. Practically, therefore, these funds could be ignored for the purposes of the calculation. However, as mentioned, this applies only to funds spent or accumulated for different purposes where no other reasonable basis on which they can be apportioned exists. Funds not accumulated for a purpose 306. Most organisations are likely to have spent or accumulated all of their funds for a purpose in any given year. In other words, they will not have any funds that have not either been spent or accumulated for a purpose. This is because the organisation has taken some affirmative act to spend or accumulate all of its funds for a purpose – see discussion from \[172\]). 307. If so, in the safe harbour calculation the total of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand plus the funds that have been applied to other purposes will always equal the organisation’s “total funds” for the year. 308. However, if an organisation does have funds that have not been accumulated for a purpose, this will not be the case. The funds that have not been accumulated for a purpose will still be part of the “total funds” for the purposes of calculating the organisation’s safe harbour percentage. However, by definition, these funds have not been accumulated for any purpose. Therefore, they cannot be counted as funds that have been accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand. The practical implication of this occurring in any year is that it will tend to reduce the percentage of funds applied to New Zealand specified purposes for that year. Organisations not meeting the 75% figure 309. The 75% figure is an administrative safe harbour rather than a figure set out in the legislation. However, the Commissioner is satisfied that meeting this percentage is indicative of an organisation meeting the “wholly or mainly” requirement in s LD 3(2)(a). IS 18/05 62 UNCLASSIFIED 310. Broadly, the requirement that organisations apply their funds wholly or mainly to specified purposes within New Zealand means that to qualify for donee organisation status under the legislation an organisation needs to be oriented towards advancing specified purposes within New Zealand over its lifetime. The Commissioner accepts that in an exceptional year an organisation could find that its safe harbour percentage is less than 75%. This is where the rolling three-year cumulative approach described below may assist the organisation. 311. However, in the Commissioner’s view, an exceptional year would not include the situation where the safe harbour percentage fell below a bare majority (ie, 50% or less). This is because, on any view of the meaning of the words “wholly or mainly”, at least a bare majority must be applied to specified purposes within New Zealand on a consistent and continuous basis. 312. Where organisations are not within the administrative safe harbour in an exceptional year they may consider the organisation’s safe harbour percentage derived by aggregating amounts for the current year and the two previous years (including years before the commencement of this statement). If that percentage is 75% or more, the Commissioner will generally accept that the organisation is within the administrative safe harbour. 313. This approach is intended to provide organisations with some flexibility in the event that their percentage of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand falls below 75% in an exceptional year. However, as mentioned, the Commissioner would expect an organisation to apply more than a bare majority of its funds to specified purposes within New Zealand every year. 314. For new organisations, the approach above means the organisation’s safe harbour percentage should be at least to the extent of 75% in the first year of its operation. 315. The table below shows an example of how the organisation should approach this calculation: IS 18/05 63 UNCLASSIFIED Table 1: Example of the rolling three- year cumulative approach to the safe harbour calculation Year -2 $ Year -1 $ Current year $ Total funds 10,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00 Funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 9,000.00 4,000.00 3,000.00 Percentage of total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (safe harbour percentage) 90% 80% 60% Cumulative total funds 10,000.00 15,000.00 20,000.00 Cumulative funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand 9,000.00 13,000.00 16,000.00 Cumulative percentage of total funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand (cumulative safe harbour percentage) 90% 87% 80% 316. If the rolling three-year cumulative safe harbour percentage of funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand in a year is below the 75% administrative safe harbour or the figure in any year is 50% or below, then the organisation should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible. 317. Some options may be available if an organisation finds complying with the wholly or mainly requirement of s LD 3(2)(a) difficult. For example, an organisation may wish to consider whether to establish and maintain a fund exclusively for specified purposes within New Zealand under s LD 3(2)(c). In that situation, the fund, rather than the organisation, would hold donee organisation status and tax benefits could accrue to donors to the fund. Organisations can discuss their situation with Inland Revenue. 318. The following example is included to illustrate the approach to the safe harbour percentage calculation. Worked example of the safe harbour calculation 319. EduParcel is an organisation established primarily to provide grants to New Zealand students, but it also provides occasional assistance in developing countries by distributing food parcels. EduParcel has generally funded its operations through donations from the public. 320. EduParcel is approved as a registered charity with Charities Services and has donee organisation status under s LD 3(2)(a). Since it is a small organisation, EduParcel has opted to apply the tier 4 reporting standards for registered charities. This requires EduParcel to file an annual performance report and annual return to Charities Services. IS 18/05 64 UNCLASSIFIED 321. EduParcel commences its activities on 1 April 2019 with unpaid volunteer staff. It has a 31 March balance date. In its first year of operations, EduParcel receives donations of $22,000. Included in the donations is a $10,000 bequest. EduParcel’s management board resolves to invest this amount as surplus operating funds to be applied to all its purposes in the future. Accordingly, it resolves to invest the funds in a term deposit for future spending on all of the organisation’s purposes. 322. EduParcel opens a cheque account with a trading bank specifically for the purpose of meeting its on-going operating costs. It also opens a savings account with the bank for the purpose of holding operating funds not needed immediately on an interest-bearing basis. The savings account generates $20 of interest income for the year. 323. EduParcel rents an office, and pays for office supplies, contents insurance, power, phone, internet and a website. It also rents a small storage unit to house the food parcels and related material. These costs amount to $9,300. To fund these expenses, it initially borrows $2,000 interest-free from a supporter. This amount is repaid from donations later in the year. EduParcel also purchases some office furniture for $800 during the year. 324. During the year, EduParcel provides Sally, a New Zealand physics student from a disadvantaged background, with a $1,150 grant to assist her New Zealand university studies. It also spends $50 to send a food parcel to an overseas developing country. 325. At year-end EduParcel has set aside $300 in its cheque account and $420 in its savings account for future operating costs. 326. For the year ended 31 March 2020, EduParcel produces a performance report including the following statement of receipts and payments: IS 18/05 65 UNCLASSIFIED Table 2: Example – EduParcel’s statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 EduParcel Statement of Receipts and Payments “How was it funded?” and “What did it cost?” For the year ended: 31 March 2020 Notes Actual Actual This Year Last Year $ $ Operating Receipts Donations, fundraising and other similar receipts 22,000 Fees, subscriptions and other receipts from members - Receipts from providing goods or services - Interest, dividends and other investment income receipts 20 Other operating receipts - Total Operating Receipts 22,020 - Operating Payments Payments relating to public fundraising - Volunteer and employee related payments - Payments related to providing goods or services 3 9,300 Grants and donations paid 3 1,200 Other operating payments - Total Operating Payments 10,500 - Operating Surplus or (Deficit) 11,520 Capital receipts Receipts from sale of resources Receipts from borrowings 2,000 Capital payments Purchase of resources 3 800 Repayment of borrowings 2,000 Increase /(Decrease) in Bank Account and Cash 10,720 - Bank accounts and cash at beginning of the financial year - Bank accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year 10,720 - Represented by: Cheque account(s) 300 Savings accounts(s) 420 Term Deposit account(s) 10,000 Cash Floats - Petty Cash - Total Bank Accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year 10,720 - 327. Following the method in Figure 1 above, EduParcel uses the statement of receipts and payments from the performance report to determine its “total funds”. “Total funds” comprises the amounts highlighted in green in Table 2. They are the:  Operating and Capital Payments made (10,500 + 2,800 = $13,300) IS 18/05 66 UNCLASSIFIED  Bank Accounts and Cash at the End of the Financial Year ($10,720). 328. Accordingly, EduParcel has spent funds of $13,300 and has $10,720 left over that it has accumulated by investing or setting aside at the end of the year, giving it a “total funds” figure of $24,020. 329. “Total funds” of $24,020 is the same amount obtained by adding EduParcel’s:  opening bank accounts and cash (nil); and  receipts from all sources for the year (22,020 + 2,000 as highlighted in yellow in Table 2). 330. Step 2 in the safe harbour calculation requires finding the amount of cash EduParcel has spent or accumulated for specified purposes within New Zealand. In this example, EduParcel does not have any cash that has not been spent or accumulated for a purpose. Accordingly, all of its “total funds” have been “applied” by being spent or accumulated. 331. The notes to the performance report provide further details of EduParcel’s payments (see Table 3): IS 18/05 67 UNCLASSIFIED Table 3: Example – EduParcel’s notes to the performance report for the year ended 31 March2020 EduParcel Notes to the Performance Report For the year ended: 31 March 2020 Note 3: Analysis of Payments “What did it cost?” Payment item Analysis This Year Last Year $ $ Payments relating to public fundraising - Total - - Payment item Analysis Volunteer and employee-related payments - Total - - Payment item Analysis Payments related to providing goods or services Rent on NZ office 7,800 Rent on storage unit 300 Office supplies 200 Contents Insurance 500 Power/phone/internet 300 Website costs 200 Total 9,300 - Payment item Analysis Grants and donations paid NZ scholarship grant 1,150 Overseas food parcel programme 50 Total 1,200 - Payment item Analysis Other operating payments - Total - - Payment item Analysis Capital payments Property, plant and equipment 800 Repayment of borrowings 2,000 Total 2,800 - 332. To find the amount spent and accumulated for “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand” EduParcel first finds the amounts spent or accumulated entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand. The only amount spent entirely for specified purposes within New Zealand is the education grant of $1,150. 333. EduParcel then finds the amounts that have been spent or accumulated entirely for purposes other than specified purposes within New Zealand. These amounts are the rent on the storage unit of $300 and the food parcel of $50 because both these amounts relate to EduParcel’s activities for advancing purposes overseas. 334. All of EduParcel’s remaining funds have been spent or accumulated for both specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes. EduParcel next considers whether any of these funds can be apportioned between these different IS 18/05 68 UNCLASSIFIED purposes on some discernible and reasonable basis. It concludes that, because the contents insurance covers property in both its office and the storage shed, most of the insurance premium of $500 relates to its office furniture based on the relative insured values of the property. From this, it determines the relative insured values are 20% for overseas purposes and 80% for specified purposes within New Zealand. Accordingly, it apportions $400 of the premium to specified purposes within New Zealand. 335. EduParcel considers that in relation to the remaining funds no readily discernible basis on which to make an apportionment exists. This is because none of these other amounts can be specifically attributed to its New Zealand educational activities, or to its foreign food parcel programme. 336. However, these remaining amounts need to be apportioned between specified purposes within New Zealand and other purposes on some basis. The amounts in question are the:  payments relating to providing goods or services (such as the office rent and office supplies but excluding the storage unit rent and contents insurance) of $8,500;  capital payment to purchase office furniture of $800;  funds spent on repaying the loan of $2,000;  funds invested in the term deposit of $10,000; and  funds set aside as operating funds and held in the cheque and savings accounts at year-end of $720. 337. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that these amounts serve all of EduParcel’s purposes without distinction and that there is no more reasonable basis to apportion these amounts. As such, they can be apportioned on the ratio of the previous amounts referred to that relate entirely to a purpose or can be reasonably apportioned on some other basis. 338. EduParcel prepares a spread sheet (in Table 4) showing these amounts: IS 18/05 69 UNCLASSIFIED Table 4: Example – EduParcel safe harbour calculation EduParcel – Safe harbour calculation Item Specified purposes within NZ $ Other purposes $ Total $ Funds applied entirely for a purpose: NZ scholarship grant 1,150 1,150 Overseas food parcel programme 50 50 Storage unit rent 300 300 Funds applied for both purposes – apportioned on some reasonable basis Contents insurance 400 100 500 Total 1,550 450 2,000 Percentage of funds applied 78% 22% 100% Funds applied for a combination of purposes apportioned on above percentage: Operating payments 6,630 1,870 8,500 Purchase of office furniture 624 176 800 Loan repayment 1,560 440 2,000 Term deposit 7,800 2,200 10,000 Cash held for general operating purposes 562 158 720 Total 17,176 4,844 22,020 Funds applied to no purpose - - - Total funds applied $18,726 $5,294 $24,020 339. EduParcel finds its safe harbour percentage by taking its “funds applied to specified purposes within New Zealand” ($18,726) and dividing it by its “total funds” ($24,020) to arrive at a percentage of 78%. On the basis of this single year’s results, Inland Revenue would generally accept without further enquiry that EduParcel has applied 78% of its total funds to specified purposes within New Zealand and is within the 75% wholly or mainly administrative safe harbour. 340. As can be seen in this example, the safe harbour percentage could be established by just considering the funds entirely applied to a purpose plus those able to be apportioned on some other discernible and reasonable basis (ie, the funds applied totalling $2,000 shown in the first part of Table 4). This is because the funds applied to a combination of purposes that cannot be apportioned on some other discernible and reasonable basis are apportioned on the same ratio (in this case, 78%). 341. Organisations apportioning funds applied on this basis will need to be able to show that there is no other basis for apportionment (eg, floor area or time basis – see the discussion of apportionment from \[245\]). However, Inland Revenue will generally accept this basis applying at least to the extent of funds set aside and on hand at year-end as operating funds. 342.

This Interpretation Statement concerns 1 April 2017 amendments to the GSTA. The amendments relate to the circumstances in which services related to land can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(e) and (k). Summary 2. Section 11A(1)(e) and (k) sets out circumstances in which land-related services can be zero-rated. As amended, s 11A(1)(k) provides that services supplied to non- residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed are eligible for zero-rating if they are not: (a) directly in connection with land in New Zealand; or (b) in connection with land in New Zealand and intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of that land. 3. A corresponding rule in s 11A(1)(e) applies for services supplied in relation to land outside New Zealand. 4. This item sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of these provisions. Introduction 5. Before 1 April 2017, s 11A(1)(e) and (k) provided that services related to land could be zero-rated in two situations. These services could be zero-rated where: (a) “the services are supplied directly in connection with land situated outside New Zealand or any improvement to the land”; or (b) the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed and where the services are not “supplied directly in connection with ... land situated in New Zealand or any improvement to the land”. 6. Therefore, before 1 April 2017, the provisions asked whether the supply of services was “directly in connection” with land. The supply was zero-rated only if the services were: (a) directly in connection with land outside New Zealand (para (e)); or (b) not directly in connection with land in New Zealand and the recipient of the services was a non-resident and outside New Zealand at the time the services were performed (para (k)). 7. Section 11A(1)(e) and (k) was amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016– 17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 with effect from 1 April 2017. This Act added a new test that broadened the variety of services zero-rated by para (e) and excluded from zero-rating by para (k). In each case, the relevant services now also include services that are: supplied in connection with such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement. 8. In other words, the provisions are no longer limited to services supplied “directly in connection” with land. Instead, services “in connection with land” are either IS 18/07 3 UNCLASSIFIED included as zero-rated under para (e) or excluded from being zero-rated under para (k) if the services “are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status” of the land. 9. The commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill summarised the background to the changes (at p 72): New Zealand’s GST system is based on the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. This means services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand will generally be zero-rated, as the services will be regarded as consumed overseas. An exception is when the service supplied is so closely connected with land that the location of the land is the most appropriate place of taxation. Services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand are not zero-rated when the services are directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand. Similarly, services that are supplied directly in connection with land situated outside New Zealand will be zero- rated (charged with GST at 0%). 10. This item discusses phrases used in s 11A(1)(e) and (k) both before those provisions were amended on 1 April 2017 (the prior provisions) and after (the amended provisions). Analysis 11. The amended provisions are as follows: 11A Zero-rating of services (1) A supply of services that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (e) the services are supplied directly in connection with land situated outside New Zealand, or with an improvement to such land, or are supplied in connection with such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement; or ... (k) subject to subsection (2), the services are supplied to a person who is a non- resident and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are— (i) supplied directly in connection with land situated in New Zealand, or with an improvement to such land, or are supplied in connection with such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement; or ... 12. Common terms and phrases are used in both paras (e) and (k) of s 11A(1). Much of the analysis that follows, therefore, applies to both provisions. However, the issues that arise under s 11A(1)(e) are essentially covered by the discussion of s 11A(1)(k). Therefore, the analysis focuses on para (k) and notes how any conclusions apply to para (e). 13. The analysis and examples in this item are structured in the following way: (a) The item first discusses the meaning of “non-resident” and the situations in which a non-resident will be regarded as “outside New Zealand at the time IS 18/07 4 UNCLASSIFIED the services are performed”. These two preliminary elements are required by s 11A(1)(k) for that provision to apply. (b) The item then considers the types of interests that are “land” in the amended provisions. The item discusses this because services will be subject to the amended provisions only if they are directly in connection with land or in connection with land and intended to enable or assist certain changes to “land”. (c) The item then considers whether the services can be regarded as “directly in connection” with land. This test from the prior provisions is retained in the amended provisions. (d) For services that do not meet the “directly in connection” with land test, the item goes on to consider the application of the remainder of the amended provisions. This discussion covers: (i) whether services are “in connection with” land, as that test is the starting point for the application of the amended provisions; (ii) whether services enable or assist a relevant change to land and the types of services and the types of changes to land that are covered by the amended provisions; (iii) the circumstances in which services can be regarded as having been “intended” to enable or assist such changes. (e) Finally, the item briefly discusses ss 22 and 54B. Section 22 allows for input tax deductions to be claimed for pre-incorporation expenses. Section 54B allows some non-residents to register and claim input tax deductions for GST paid. Both ss 22 and 54B may provide input tax deductions where services are standard-rated under the amended provisions. Section 11A(1)(k) – are the services supplied to a “non-resident” who is “outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed”? “Non-resident” 14. For services to be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k), they must be supplied to a person who is “non-resident”. 15. The term non-resident is defined in s 2 to mean “a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand”. Section 2 defines “resident” to mean resident in accordance with the income tax residency test in ss YD 1 and YD 2 (excluding s YD 2(2)) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (see the appendix). For individuals, the test depends on being present in New Zealand for a certain number of days or having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. For companies, the test depends on the company’s place of incorporation, head office, centre of management and director control. For more information on “residence” under the Income Tax Act 2007, see “IS 16/03: Tax residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 16. However, there are three modifications to the income tax residency tests. These modifications are in paras (a) to (c) of the definition of resident in the GSTA. 17. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition relate to unincorporated bodies and the effect of the day count tests in the income tax residency tests. Paragraph (a) is particularly relevant in the context of supplies of land-related services. It provides that for GST purposes: IS 18/07 5 UNCLASSIFIED ...a person shall be deemed to be resident in New Zealand to the extent that that person carries on, in New Zealand, any taxable activity or any other activity, while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity... Taxable activity or other activity 18. For para (a) of the definition of resident to apply, the person must carry on a “taxable activity or other activity”. The person’s taxable activity or other activity must also be carried on in New Zealand while the person has a “fixed or permanent place” in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity. 19. The term “taxable activity” is defined in s 6. The definition refers to an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly involving or intending to involve the making of taxable supplies. Notably, however, s 6(3) excludes certain activities from being taxable activities. Examples of excluded activities are activities that involve making exempt supplies (s 6(3)(d)) and hobbies (s 6(3)(a) and (aa)). 20. Paragraph (a) in the definition of “resident” also includes “other” activities in its scope. The terms “activity” and “other activity” are not defined in the GSTA. 21. The word “activity” is very broad. It may refer to “a course of conduct or series of acts which a person has chosen to undertake or become engaged in”: Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC). Similarly, the Court of Appeal in CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 said (at 14,078): In its standard dictionary usage, “activity” is “the state of being active; the exertion of energy, action” (Oxford English Dictionary). In the context of ss 6 and 8 \[of the GSTA\] it points to the combination of tasks undertaken, or course of conduct pursued by the registered person and whether or not it amounted to a business, trade or profession in the ordinary sense. 22. Both Newman and Bayly discuss the meaning of “activity” in the context of the s 6 definition of “taxable activity”. The Commissioner’s view is that “activity” in “other activity” will bear the same meaning. 23. The inclusion of “other activity” in para (a) in addition to “taxable activity” was intended to expand the variety of activities that could result in residency under the GSTA. The legislative history confirms that “other activity” was included in para (a) to ensure supplies do not qualify for zero-rating where those supplies are made to non-residents whose activities involve the making of exempt supplies in New Zealand. An example is supplies made to a financial institution that is non- resident for income tax purposes (and thus may be non-resident for GST purposes but for the inclusion of para (a)). 24. However, the Commissioner’s view is that “other activity” is not limited to activities that involve the making of exempt supplies. The word “other” implies that Parliament intended that a wide variety of activities would be covered by para (a). Fixed or permanent place 25. For para (a) in the definition of “resident” to apply, a person must also have a “fixed or permanent place” in New Zealand. The expression “fixed or permanent place” is not defined in the GSTA. 26. In the context of the provision, it is the place that must be “fixed” or “permanent”. The ordinary meaning of the word “place” indicates a physical location or a link to a particular geographical point. IS 18/07 6 UNCLASSIFIED 27. The ordinary meaning of the words “fixed” and “permanent” indicates that the physical location must be lasting, unchanging and not temporary. An element of permanence is necessary, so a transient activity will not meet the test. However, ownership of the physical location is not necessary. Having a fixed or permanent place merely requires the person to have that place permanently at their disposal or be able to use that place on a permanent basis. 28. In the context of a supply of land-related services, it is necessary to consider whether the recipient has a “fixed or permanent place” and, therefore, whether the recipient might be a resident for GST purposes, at the time the services are supplied. 29. The Commissioner notes that a similar concept of “fixed establishment” is used in the Income Tax Act 2007, and the phrase “permanent establishment” is used in New Zealand’s double tax treaties. Case law has discussed the meanings of these phrases, and the concepts likely overlap with the concept of a “fixed or permanent place”. 30. However, the Commissioner’s view is that the “fixed establishment” and “permanent establishment” concepts are not equivalent to “fixed or permanent place” under the GSTA. The ordinary meaning of the word “establishment” is arguably a stronger term than “place”, so “place” may be wider in its scope. Also, tax treaties often define a “permanent establishment” to include or exclude specific types of establishments. In contrast, the GSTA definition is general in its terms. Relating to 31. Paragraph (a) also requires the person to have a fixed or permanent place “relating to” the taxable activity or other activity. 32. Case law has considered the words “relating to” as well as the similar phrases “in relation to” and “in respect of”. The courts have said that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are “words of the widest import”: Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303. 33. In New Zealand Forest Research Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,928, the High Court stated that the starting point in interpreting the meaning of “relating to” is to consider the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase, in the context of the particular provision in which it is used. 34. The ordinary meaning of “relating” is a connection between things: Concise Oxford English Dictionary. This suggests that a degree of connection is required between the fixed or permanent place and the relevant activity. 35. The context of the provision does not appear to require a departure from the ordinary meaning of “relating to”. The provision is part of the definition of “resident” in the GSTA, which affects both the imposition of GST on supplies under s 8, and whether supplies can be zero-rated under the zero-rating provisions. In general, these provisions are intended to give effect to the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. Requiring a connection between a person’s activity in New Zealand and a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand before they are considered resident for GST purposes (and subject to GST at the standard rate) appears to be consistent with that purpose. IS 18/07 7 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1: Rental property owner resident for GST purposes James, a non-resident for income tax purposes, owns a residential rental property in Wellington that he purchased in 2015. The property has been tenanted since James purchased it, with the tenants paying a weekly rent. On purchasing the property, James engaged a property manager to take care of day- to-day matters in relation to the property and the tenancy. James’s residential rental activity is not a taxable activity under ss 6(3)(d) and 14. However, it will still be an “other activity” in terms of the s 2 definition of “resident”. This is because renting out a residential property on an ongoing basis is “a course of conduct or series of acts which a person has chosen to undertake or become engaged in” (Newman). Also, the phrase “other activity” in the s 2 definition of resident was intended to capture activities that would otherwise be exempt. Further, the rental activity is carried on from a fixed or permanent place, being the rental property. This means James is treated as being a New Zealand resident for GST purposes to the extent of his rental activity. To the extent that 36. For GST purposes, a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand “to the extent that” the person carries on, in New Zealand any taxable activity or any other activity while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable activity or other activity. 37. Similarly, the definition of “non-resident” in s 2 states that non-resident “means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand” (emphasis added). 38. The use of the phrase “to the extent that” implies that a single legal person can, for the purposes of the GSTA, be both resident and non-resident. In the context of supplies of services, zero-rating applies only where goods are supplied to a non- resident. This means it may be necessary for a supplier to consider the extent to which the recipient is a resident or non-resident and whether the supply of services has been made to the recipient in their resident or non-resident capacity. Example 2: A person may be both resident and non-resident This example follows on from example 1. James is happy with his Wellington rental property. In 2017, he decides to look into acquiring a second property, but this time in Auckland. The property is to be used as premises for a coffee roastery business. As a foreign owner of the coffee business, James plans to hire a manager and staff to run the activity in New Zealand. James has not yet settled on a property, but thinks three industrial areas in Auckland present good buying opportunities. He phones a property valuation firm to ask it to provide him with general valuation reports in relation to the three areas. Although James is a resident for GST purposes under para (a) of the definition of “resident” in s 2, he is resident only “to the extent that” he carries on, in New Zealand, a relevant activity, while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. Any Auckland coffee roasting activity will constitute a separate activity from James’s Wellington rental property activity. Since James has not yet acquired a property in respect of the coffee roasting activity, he cannot be said to have a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to the coffee roasting activity. Therefore, to the extent of the coffee roasting activity, James will be a non- resident for the purposes of the GSTA. IS 18/07 8 UNCLASSIFIED “Outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed” 39. Section 11A(1)(k) allows services to be zero-rated only when the non-resident recipient is “outside New Zealand” at the time the services are performed. However, two rules in s 11A provide that certain limited presences in New Zealand are treated as “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of the provision. 40. The first rule, in s 11A(3), relates to non-resident companies and unincorporated bodies. It provides that a non-resident company or unincorporated body will be treated as “outside New Zealand” if it has: (a) a minor presence in New Zealand; or (b) for presences that are more than “minor”, a presence that is not “effectively connected” with the supply (where the ordinary meaning of “effectively connected” and the legislative history suggest a presence will not be effectively connected with a supply, if the presence cannot be regarded as actually or implicitly connected with the supply). 41. The second rule, in s 11A(3B), relates to natural persons. It provides that a natural person will be treated as outside New Zealand if they have: (a) a minor presence in New Zealand; and (b) that minor presence is not “directly in connection with” the supply of services (“directly in connection with” is described from \[51\] and has the same meaning in the context of the rule for individuals in s 11A(3B), meaning, in general, that the presence is not directly related to the supply). 42. A person’s presence in New Zealand will be “minor” if it is a presence of short duration. Whether any given presence is minor will be a question of fact and depend on the circumstances of the particular case. Example 3: Individual outside New Zealand This example follows on from example 2. Unbeknownst to the valuer, James was attending a three-day origami convention in Queenstown when the valuation services were provided to him. James had arrived in Queenstown the night before the convention and flew out on the evening the convention closed. Although James was physically present in New Zealand at the time the services were performed, s 11A(3B) treats his presence as being “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of s 11A(1)(k). This is because the short duration of James’s trip to New Zealand means it was a “minor presence”, and his “minor presence” was not directly in connection with the supply of services by the valuer because it was unrelated to his activities. Since the valuation services supplied to James relate to his potential coffee roasting activities, those services are supplied to him in his non-resident capacity. Whether general market valuation services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k) is considered in example 18. IS 18/07 9 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4: Company outside New Zealand C&C Pty Ltd is an Australian company that is non-resident for GST purposes. C&C is a leading producer of chalk and cheese in Australia. C&C also has a branch in New Zealand. The New Zealand operation focuses solely on chalk sales to schools and universities. C&C has a small office in Auckland, where two chalk sales staff are employed. With whiteboards gaining in popularity, C&C’s chalk sales are declining. C&C decides to investigate the possibility of extending its cheese business into New Zealand. To do so, C&C needs to consider acquiring New Zealand land to establish a cheese manufacturing plant. C&C does not have a particular piece of land in mind, so commissions a report from a New Zealand valuation firm to establish the general prices of vacant commercially zoned land in several suitable regions in New Zealand. Since C&C has a permanent office in Auckland, its presence in New Zealand is not short in duration. Therefore, C&C does not have a “minor presence” in New Zealand. However, under s 11A(3), C&C will still be regarded as being outside New Zealand at the time the valuation services were performed. This is because the services the valuation firm supplied are not “effectively connected” with C&C’s presence in New Zealand. The services relate to C&C’s possible expansion of its cheese business, but C&C’s presence relates solely to its chalk sales operations. What is “land” for the purposes of s 11A(1)(e) and (k)? 43. Paragraphs (e) and (k) of s 11A(1) apply to services intended to enable or assist a relevant change to “land” or “improvements”. 44. The term “land” is defined in the GSTA only for the purposes of the compulsory zero-rating (CZR) of land rules. The Commissioner considers that in the context of s 11A(1)(e) and (k), “land” has a wide meaning and includes both physical land and legal and equitable estates in land. 45. However, the reference to “land” does not include a shareholder’s interest in a land-owning company. This is because a land-owning company’s shareholders have no interest, legal or equitable, in the land owned by the company (R v McCurdy \[1983\] NZLR 551 (CA)). Therefore, services that are intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership of a land-owning company’s shares will not be regarded as enabling or assisting a change in the ownership of “land”. 46. For completeness, the Commissioner notes that “land” does not include a licence to occupy land or other purely contractual right relating to land. However, even though such a contractual right itself may not be “land”, it may still be able to be described as “directly in connection with” land – see para \[69\] below. 47. The term “improvement” is not defined in the GSTA. Based on case law, improvements to land include any work or operations done to land that enhance the value of that land (Case L43 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,262; Morrison v Federal Commissioner of Land Tax (1914) 17 CLR 498 (HCA)). 48. Work done to a building may be improvements to land to the extent that it involves adding fixtures or making structural changes to the building. This is because, legally, a building and its fixtures are considered part of the land to which they are attached. This long-standing principle of land law is summarised in Hinde, McMorland & Sim Land Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, accessed 3 August 2018) at \[6.036\]: IS 18/07 10 UNCLASSIFIED whatever is affixed to the soil, belongs to the soil. Thus buildings erected on land and items permanently attached to the buildings become fixtures and a part of the land itself. Are the services “directly in connection with” land? 49. Under the prior provisions, services related to land could be zero-rated where the services were supplied: (a) “directly in connection with” land or improvements situated outside New Zealand; or (b) to a non-resident who was outside New Zealand at the time the services were performed and where the services were not supplied “directly in connection with” land or improvements in New Zealand. 50. Under the prior provisions, a critical question was whether the services were “directly in connection with” land. That test has been retained in the amended provisions. Therefore, a supplier will still need to consider whether the services meet the “directly in connection with” test to determine whether the supply is zero- rated. How the courts have interpreted “directly in connection with” land 51. Several cases discuss the phrase “directly in connection with” in the GST context. In particular, the phrase was considered in Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC), appealed as Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA), Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551 appealed as CIR v Suzuki NZ Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819 (HC) and CIR v Suzuki NZ Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA)), and Malololailai Interval Holidays NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 (HC). These cases illustrate how the phrase is to be interpreted in the context of s 11A(1)(k)(i). 52. In Wilson & Horton (HC), the issue was whether the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was “directly in connection with” the goods advertised. In the High Court, Hillyer J considered that the goods that were the subject of the advertising were not “directly in connection with” land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Hillyer J said (at 11,224): The supply of space and the services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor. \[Emphasis added\] 53. Hillyer J noted an example where services would and would not be directly in connection with goods (at 11,224): One example given by counsel was the painting of a vessel. That service would be directly in connection with the vessel, but services rendered to the passengers and crew of a vessel would not be rendered directly in connection with the vessel. 54. Wilson & Horton was appealed to the Court of Appeal. On appeal, the High Court’s conclusion that the services were not directly in connection with the advertised goods was accepted by both parties as correct. That aspect of the High Court’s judgment was not addressed by the Court of Appeal. 55. The legislation was amended to overturn the result in Wilson & Horton. The amendment was based on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the phrase “for and to”, which was previously contained in s 11(2)(e) (now s 11A(1)(k)). However, the phrase “directly in connection with” was retained in the provision. This IS 18/07 11 UNCLASSIFIED arguably suggests that the “one step removed” test applied by the High Court in Wilson & Horton reflects the intention of the legislation. 56. Before the Court of Appeal’s decision in Wilson & Horton, a series of cases had commenced relating to the zero-rating of services supplied under certain vehicle warranty contracts: Case S88 and CIR v Suzuki NZ Ltd (HC) and (CA) (collectively, the Suzuki cases). 57. In the Suzuki cases, a non-resident manufacturer (SMC), from whom an importer (SNZ) purchased vehicles, provided a service warranty to SNZ under which it agreed to reimburse SNZ for certain repairs. SNZ on-sold the vehicles to a dealer, which in turn sold the vehicles to the public. The warranty given by SNZ was wider than the warranty SNZ received from SMC. If SNZ was required to reimburse the dealer for the cost of repairs covered by SNZ’s warranty and the particular repairs were also within SMC’s warranty, SNZ would claim reimbursement from SMC. 58. In each of the Suzuki cases, the Commissioner argued, and the court agreed, that SNZ supplied vehicle repair services to SMC in return for the reimbursement payment. The issue was, therefore, whether the payment SNZ received from SMC was for services supplied “directly in connection with ... moveable personal property” (that is, the vehicles) in New Zealand. 59. On that issue, in Case S88 Judge Barber said (at 7,558): There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) \[relating to services directly in connection with moveable personal property in New Zealand\] must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of the s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. The repairs were carried out for the objector (and others) which was carrying them out for MC (and others). The objector was not merely arranging for the repairs to be carried out, but was responsible under warranty to make the repairs — as was MC. That activity, or supply, meets the statutory nexus between goods and the service. The service is the actual repair of vehicles even though that work was performed by a contractor — usually the dealer. 60. Case S88 was appealed to the High Court, where McGechan J said (at 15,830): I have no doubt that repair services were carried out directly in connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. Quite simply, they were repairs carried out on cars within New Zealand. The situation equates to “painting the ship”. The nexus could not be closer. 61. And on appeal to the Court of Appeal, Blanchard J said (at 17,103): The repair services were obviously supplied in relation to goods, namely motor vehicles, which were situated in New Zealand. The supply of repairs could hardly be more directly connected with the motor vehicles. 62. Malololailai Interval Holidays involved a Fijian timeshare operation in which New Zealand purchasers bought a one-week per year licence to occupy an accommodation unit at a Fijian resort. The resort land was owned by an individual, but under a series of leases was leased to a Vanuatu company, referred to as MIH(V). A New Zealand company, MIH(NZ), acted as MIH(V)’s agent and entered into the timeshare agreements with purchasers. MIH(NZ) had made an agreement with another New Zealand company, AHL, under which AHL marketed the timeshares to purchasers. AHL was essentially responsible for concluding the timeshare agreements on behalf of MIH(NZ), including determining the sale price. IS 18/07 12 UNCLASSIFIED 63. The issue was whether AHL’s marketing services were “directly in connection with land” outside New Zealand. If so, the services would be zero-rated under s 11(2)(b) (now s 11A(1)(e)). 64. Neazor J approached the issue by considering the transactions or supplies, and cited the Court of Appeal judgment in Wilson & Horton where Richardson J had said (at 13,146): \[Section 8(1), the definitions of ‘taxable activity’ in s 6(1)(a) and of ‘supplier’ and ‘recipient’ in s 2 and ss 9(1) and 10(2)\] are directed to the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient of the supply. In keeping with the general statutory scheme in that respect s 11, providing for zero rating of supply transactions where the stated overseas element is present, follows that same pattern. It follows that where, as in the presently material s 11(2)(e), the provision refers to ‘services ... supplied ... to a person’ the statutory dictionary applies and the phrase refers to the contractual position and so to the person who has provided the consideration. \[Emphasis added\] 65. Neazor J went on to say (at 13,146): I would regard the contractual transaction between MIH(NZ) and the purchaser of an interval holiday as within the descriptive words “directly in connection with land or any improvement thereto”, although that determination is not essential to this decision, but when attention is paid to the services supplied by AHL to MIH(NZ) \[I\] consider that those services are not within the statutory description. What AHL does is to advertise and promote interval holidays for MIH(NZ) and negotiate the contract for individual holidays (including the consideration for that contract between the purchaser and MIH(NZ)) up to the point where the contract is effected between those two parties. The services provided by AHL are not directly in connection with the land or the improvements. The transaction of those considered which would be in that category is the transaction between MIH(NZ) and the purchaser. The transaction between AHL and MIH(NZ) is one which brings about the transaction which has direct effect, but in my view is of a kind to which Hillyer J's words may properly be applied — it is one step removed from the direct transaction. If one of the analogies referred to needs to be chosen I would take that of the publication of advertisements in the Wilson & Horton case. The newspaper proprietor’s services facilitated or opened the way to the transactions between vendor and purchaser, and that in my view is what \[the marketing company AHL\] did, although it was more closely involved in the transaction to which the statutory words apply than the publisher of an advertisement would be. Nevertheless the transaction having direct effect was not that of the publisher, or in this case of the sales agent. \[Emphasis added\] 66. Neazor J considered that the transaction between MIH(NZ) and the purchaser of an interval holiday was “directly in connection with” land outside New Zealand. However, he said that the marketing services supplied by AHL (although essential to bring together MIH(NZ) and the purchaser and closely related to the sale and purchase transaction) were not “directly in connection with” the land. This was because the marketing services transaction did not have a “direct effect” on land in the same way that the transaction between MIH(NZ) and the purchaser did. 67. Malololailai also confirms that the recipient of a service need not acquire a legal interest in land before the service can be “directly in connection with” the land. Neazor J commented (at 13,143): It is not in my view necessary to consider the first point of \[the\] argument further than that, because the issue is not whether the purchaser acquires land or an interest in land, but whether the services provided by the marketer on behalf of the objector are “directly in connection with land”, which may involve much less than acquiring an interest in the land. By way of example, the provision of gardening services would surely come within the statutory words. IS 18/07 13 UNCLASSIFIED 68. For completeness, the phrase “directly in connection with” was also considered in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 (HC) and Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410. However, those decisions are not directly on point in the context of services related to land. Directly in connection: summary of principles 69. The courts have generally interpreted the phrase “directly in connection with” narrowly. The following principles are derived from cases in relation to whether a service is directly in connection with property: (a) The inclusion of the word “directly” in s 11A(1)(k) indicates that a close connection is required before a service is “directly in connection with” land (Malololailai). (b) Services may bring about or facilitate a transaction that has direct effect but, they are not services that are “directly in connection with” land or an improvement to such land if they are one step removed from the transaction that has direct effect (Malololailai, Wilson & Horton) (c) Services that involve a direct physical effect on land, such as repairs or gardening, will almost certainly be supplied directly in connection with land (Malololailai, Wilson & Horton). (d) Where a supply of services does not involve a direct physical effect on land, the courts may consider whether the supply of services has a direct legal effect on land. If the supply of services has a direct legal effect on land, such as a licence to occupy, the supply is likely to be directly in connection with land (Malololailai). (e) The recipient does not need to own, be entitled to use or have possession of the particular property for services to be directly in connection with that property (Suzuki). (f) It is not necessary that the supplier carries out the services personally for the supply to be directly in connection with land. It is possible for the supplier to act through an agent as happened in the Suzuki cases where it was the dealers that physically carried out the repairs. (g) Given the cases suggest that the test is one of fact and degree, a person does not physically need to go onto the land for their services to be directly in connection with land. Equally, the fact that a person does physically go onto the land while providing their services does not necessarily mean that those services will be directly in connection with land. 70. The examples from para \[133\] show how some of these principles will apply in practice. Are the services “in connection with” land? 71. The new test expands the scope of the services covered to include services that are not only “directly in connection with” land, but are also “in connection with” land and of a certain nature (discussed further from \[78\]). 72. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441 at 59,446, Judge Bathgate discussed the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” in the context of the Income Tax Act 1976: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in IS 18/07 14 UNCLASSIFIED connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. ... Its proper interpretation depends on the context in which the phrase is used. It may mean “substantial relation in a practical business sense”, or it may have a far more restricted meaning, depending on its context ... \[Emphasis added\] 73. Judge Bathgate considered that it is a question of fact and degree and impression whether a sufficient relationship exists between two things for them to be “in connection with” each other. He held that the evaluation of whether two things are “in connection with” each other requires a common sense assessment of the factual situation. 74. In Malololailai, Neazor J referred to Case E84 and said (at 13,144): A good deal of the debate in that case about whether a narrow or wide interpretation of the statutory phrase was appropriate might have been seen as unnecessary if the word “directly” had been used, as it is in s 11 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 75. These comments highlight the difference in meaning between “directly in connection with” and “in connection with”. The word “directly” in s 11 is intended to narrow the scope of what might be considered to be “in connection with” the land and Malololailai confirms that the relevant services must have a direct physical or legal effect on the land. 76. In the context of s 11A(1)(e) and (k), the discussion at \[51\] to \[69\] notes that services that do not have a direct physical or legal effect on land are unlikely to be “directly in connection with” that land. But given the new test does not require a “direct” connection, a much wider variety of services will fall within the amended provisions. For instance, services that have only an indirect physical or legal effect – perhaps because they only facilitate a transaction that has a direct effect on land – are now captured. 77. However, it is important to note that not all services that meet the “in connection with” land test will meet the new test. The new test also requires the services to be “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement”. Are the services intended to enable or assist a relevant change to land? “Change” generally 78. For the new test to apply, services must be intended to enable or assist a “change” to land that is of a relevant type. The relevant types of changes covered by the new test are changes in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land. 79. The word “change” is not defined in the GSTA. The ordinary meaning of the word “change”, in its noun form, is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, accessed 3 August 2018): An act or process through which something becomes different. 80. In the context of the new test, the ordinary meaning, therefore, suggests that a “change” will involve an “act or process” where the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land “becomes different”. As explained at paras \[109\] to IS 18/07 15 UNCLASSIFIED \[119\], a “change” of this sort only needs to be intended by the recipient, even if it does not result. 81. In some instances, services might relate to a specific piece of land in New Zealand, but might not be capable of being described as being intended to cause the physical condition, ownership or other legal status to “change” in the way described above. The Commissioner’s view is that these services will not be covered by the new test. Example 5: Inherited land Poppy, who lives in the United Kingdom and is not a New Zealand tax resident, inherits some New Zealand land from a relative. The land is a vacant lot. Following the inheritance, Poppy engages a New Zealand law firm to advise her on the legal obligations associated with owning the specific lot of inherited land in New Zealand (for example, rates and insurance) and what restrictions (if any) apply to the use or uses to which the land may be put. The services supplied to Poppy do not relate to the change in ownership of the land on inheritance. The law firm’s advice is about the implications of holding land unchanged, not about changing the land’s physical form, ownership or other legal status. Since the new test is directed at services that “change” the land in a relevant way, the services are not subject to the new wording and may be zero-rated. A change in the physical condition of land 82. A change in the “physical condition” of land is the first kind of change covered by the new test. 83. Services that have a direct effect on the physical condition of land are generally captured under the “directly in connection” test. Two examples of such services are construction work and earthworks. Where the relevant land is New Zealand land, this means the services are standard-rated. 84. However, before the amendments, services that did not have a direct physical effect on land were not always captured, even if they, for instance, facilitated services that had a direct physical effect. The amendments provide that generally these kinds of services are now also standard-rated. Examples of typical services that enable or assist a change in the physical condition of land are: (a) architectural services; (b) engineering; (c) construction supervision. A change in the ownership or other legal status of land 85. Another relevant change is a change in the ownership of land. The word “ownership” is not defined in the GSTA. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) defines “own”: Own ... v. 1 possess; have. ... 86. The Butterworth’s New Zealand Law Dictionary (6th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2005) defines “ownership” as: The right to the exclusive enjoyment of a thing. Ownership may be absolute, in which case the owner may freely use or dispose of his or her property, or restricted, IS 18/07 16 UNCLASSIFIED as in the case of joint ownership. Beneficial ownership is the right of enjoyment of property, as distinguished from legal ownership. 87. Therefore, to “own” an item of property, the ordinary meaning is that a person must possess or have the exclusive enjoyment of that item of property. Ownership can be absolute or restricted. 88. Case law suggests that “ownership” generally refers to legal rights unless the context demands otherwise. In Bellinz Pty Ltd v FCT (1998) 98 ATC 4,399 the Australian Federal Court said (at 4,411): Ultimately ownership consists of rights over property. Accordingly, unless the legal or natural meaning is displaced by the context in which the issue of ownership arises a legal or jurisprudential, rather than a commercial or popular, analysis of these rights is required. \[Emphasis in original\] 89. As above, “ownership” is context specific but is likely to refer to a legal concept involving exclusive enjoyment of property. However, the provisions do not refer to “ownership” in isolation. Section 11A(1)(e) and (k) uses a composite phrase “ownership or other legal status”. 90. The phrases “legal status” and “other legal status” are not defined in the GSTA nor are they used in any other provision. But in the context of the new test, the phrase used is “ownership or other legal status”. This implies “ownership” is a subset of “legal status”. It also implies that the term “other legal status” must cover a wider variety of legal statuses than ownership. 91. The Oxford English Dictionary (online edition, accessed 3 August 2018) defines the words “legal” and “status” as: legal, adj. 1 Relating to the law. status, n. 2 The situation at a particular time during a process. 92. Based on the ordinary meaning, the phrase “other legal status” refers to a status arising under the law. When considering the ways in which status is granted under the law, it is useful to go back to the context of the amended provisions to see that the phrase “ownership or other legal status” refers to “land or improvements to land”. Therefore, the context is that the amended provisions are concerned with legal status as it relates to land and improvements. 93. The Commentary to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill provides some assistance in determining the meaning of “ownership or other legal status” (at 71): The inclusion of services intended to “enable or assist a change in the ... ownership or other legal status of the land” is expected to apply to a variety of professional services such as legal or real estate agents’ services as part of a land transaction, where the ultimate outcome is to change the legal nature of the land but the services do not involve any physical change or connection to the land. 94. That commentary states that a “variety of professional services” and services that change the “legal nature” of the land are intended to be covered by the new test. 95. The concepts of “legal status” and “legal nature” appear to refer to interests in land that a person might have and that are recognised in law. A limited number of interests in land give rise to “legal statuses”. These statuses may be created in different ways, take a variety of different forms, and arise under common law or statutory rules. For instance, the legal status of land may depend on whether the IS 18/07 17 UNCLASSIFIED land is subject to an interest such as a lease, a life interest, an easement or a mortgage. 96. Some interests may be able (or required) to be registered against the title to the land and some may not. As an example, a short-term lease as defined in s 207 of the Property Law Act 2007 is not able to be registered but gives rise to an interest in land (Hinde McMorland & Sim Land Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, accessed 3 August 2018) at \[11.038\]). Therefore, the ability to be registered will not be determinative of the existence of an interest in land and so a “legal status” for the purposes of the new test. 97. Legal interests can be contrasted with interests such as licences. A licence is generally accepted as being a personal right against the licensor (see, for instance, Hinde McMorland & Sim Land Law in New Zealand (online looseleaf ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, accessed 3 August 2018) at \[18.001\]. It is not a right in the land that can be enforced against a third party, nor is it one that can be registered against the title. In that sense, the Commissioner’s view is that the grant of a licence does not change the “legal status” or “legal nature” of land. 98. Changes in equitable interests in land can also give rise to changes in the ownership or other legal status of land. This means services that, for instance, enable or assist the sale of an equitable interest in a property purchased “off the plans” may enable or assist a relevant change to land. 99. Certain services relating to changes to land-owning trusts are similarly covered by the amended provisions. 100. In the context of a beneficial interest in land, the entitlements of a beneficiary stem from the terms of the trust deed and the exercise of discretions by the trustees. As a result, the nature of a beneficiary’s interest in trust property varies accordingly. 101. Although each situation will depend on the terms of the trust deed, the Commissioner’s view is that in the context of a land-owning discretionary trust, a discretionary beneficiary is unlikely to have an interest in “land” for the purposes of the provisions. This is because, generally, a discretionary beneficiary has no more than a hope that the trustee’s discretion will be exercised in his or her favour (Law of Trusts (LexisNexis, Wellington, 2018) at \[4.68\], citing Re Munro’s Settlement Trusts \[1963\] 1 All ER 209 (Ch)). This means services that, for instance, add or remove individual beneficiaries to or from a land-owning discretionary trust are unlikely to enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. 102. Where the trust relationship means a beneficiary has an interest in the trust’s land, as may be the case for a fixed trust, services that alter the interests of beneficiaries may enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. 103. Where services involve trust deed changes that are intended to enable or assist changes in a legal interest in land, they will enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. For instance, services that are intended to change the trustees of a land-owning trust will result in a change in the person holding a legal interest in that land. Therefore, the services are intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. 104. Where the trust deed changes do not involve any changes in trustees’ or beneficiaries’ interests, the services are unlikely to enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. Typical services falling into this category might be changes to the administrative provisions of the deed (for instance, provisions regarding trust meetings). IS 18/07 18 UNCLASSIFIED 105. Consequently, the Commissioner’s view is that the phrase “a change in ownership or other legal status of land” is referring to two different things: (a) changes in ownership of any estate or interest in land, including legal and equitable interests; and (b) other changes in the legal status of any estate or interest in land, such as granting a lease, a life interest or an easement or registering a mortgage as security against the title to land, but excluding changes in personal or contractual rights such as licences. 106. The following are examples of services that enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land: (a) Typical services provided by a lawyer or real estate agent in a sale and purchase of real estate. This will be the case whether the sale is of a legal interest in land or an equitable interest in land (such as where the sale is of an interest in a property that was purchased “off the plans”). (b) Services involved in arranging a lease of land. (c) Legal services relating to transactions involving the mortgage of land. (d) Services provided to alter the trustees of a trust where the trust property includes land. (e) Services provided to alter the beneficiaries of a fixed trust where the trust property includes land. (f) Services provided to create, alter or remove an easement that grants certain rights in relation to a person’s land. For example, services provided to a landowner to assist them in obtaining an easement so they can lay a drain across their neighbour’s land. (g) Services that are intended to procure a change relating to land in terms of a district plan or regional plan made under the Resource Management Act 1991. (h) Accounting and tax services supplied as part of a land transaction where those services can be said to be intended by the recipient to enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land. This could be where: (i) accounting or tax advice is required as a formal condition of the sale agreement; or, (ii) the accounting or tax advice can be regarded as being intended to enable or assist a relevant change such as where the advice assists the recipient in their choice of business structure in the context of a land purchase. The specific facts will need to be considered in each case. 107. The following are examples of services that are unlikely to enable or assist a change in the ownership or other legal status of land: (a) Services provided to change the shareholders of a land-owning company. (b) Services provided to alter a discretionary trust’s beneficiaries where the trust property includes land. (c) General year-end accounting and tax services, such as the preparation of accounts or tax returns for a property for a non-resident client. IS 18/07 19 UNCLASSIFIED (d) Accounting and tax services supplied following the conclusion of a land transaction. For instance, where those services assist a client with making the correct accounting entries to record the past transaction in their accounting records. Or where the accounting or tax advice is advice as to how the accounting or tax rules applied to a past transaction. Services that “enable or assist” a relevant change 108. The amended provisions cover services in connection with specific land only where the services are intended to “enable or assist” certain changes to that land. Services that “enable or assist” a relevant change will be services intended to help or make possible a relevant change. In some cases, services may be in connection with specific land and relate to a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land, but may not “enable or assist” such a change. Example 6: Services where there is a lack of intention to “enable or assist” a relevant change Bev, a non-resident, owns a vacant section of land in New Zealand. Bev’s land is adjacent to another vacant section owned by T-Shirts Ltd. Bev discovers that T- Shirts is proposing to build a t-shirt factory on its land. The factory development of T-Shirts is expected to carry some risk of degrading the quality of Bev’s land. Bev engages a New Zealand law firm to advise on her right to object to the proposed factory development by T-Shirts. Although the law firm’s services arguably relate to a change in the physical condition of a specific piece of land in New Zealand, the services cannot be said to be intended to “enable or assist” that change. The services are not intended by Bev to help or make possible the proposed development of the factory. What is the “intended” purpose of the services? 109. Where services are “in connection with land”, it is also necessary to determine what the services are intended to achieve. This is because services are captured by the new test in the amended provisions only if they are “intended” to enable or assist certain changes to land. 110. In the context of s 6(1)(a), the Taxation Review Authority in Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229 followed the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 in finding that a person’s intention is a subjective matter, but that the person’s stated intention can be tested against objective evidence. The Commissioner’s view is that a similar approach is required in the new test. The “intended” purpose of the services is, therefore, determined by considering the recipient’s subjective intention against the wider factual circumstances. 111. The amended provisions do not explicitly state whose intention is to be tested. However, in the context of the amended provisions, the Commissioner’s view is that the recipient’s intention is relevant. 112. The evidence that suppliers should hold to establish the recipient’s intention will depend on the nature and context of the services. Since the test is subjective (but tested objectively), in some cases it may be useful for the supplier to obtain some form of statement from the recipient. However, it may not be necessary to obtain a statement in all cases, such as where the documentary evidence is clear as to what the services were intended to do. IS 18/07 20 UNCLASSIFIED 113. If the recipient refuses to or does not provide the required information about their intention for the services acquired, it is recommended the supplier standard-rates the transaction, unless the supplier is confident that zero-rating is the correct GST treatment of the supply. By standard rating the supply in this situation the supplier ensures that any GST payable for the supply is accounted for by the supplier at the appropriate time. If it is subsequently found that the supply should have been zero-rated, then the GST paid can be corrected. Example 7: Keeping evidence to show whether services enable or assist a relevant change Frank is a non-resident owner of a Rotorua residential property. Frank has not owned the property long and does not have any plans for the property. However, Frank’s friend recently sold a property on the same street for more than she had expected. Frank wonders whether his property may also have gained in value. Frank emails Valerie, a valuer, and asks her to produce a valuation report for his property. He outlines the situation above in the email. Valerie carries out the valuation and sends Frank the valuation report. The services will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). When Valerie invoices Frank, she wonders what evidence she will need to show Frank’s intention. There is no reason for Valerie to think that Frank’s intention is anything other than as he has stated in his email. In the absence of any reason to think otherwise, Valerie retains a copy of the email as evidence of Frank’s intention. Forming an intention 114. Since a person’s intention is a subjective matter (but objectively tested), the Commissioner’s view is that services will not be zero-rated by s 11A(1)(e) or standard-rated (by being excluded from zero-rating) by s 11A(1)(k) until the recipient has formed a subjective intention that the services supplied are to enable or assist a relevant change. 115. In terms of whether such an intention has been formed, the recipient’s stated intention will be important evidence. However, consistent with the approach to ascertaining a person’s intention described above, stated intentions can be tested against relevant objective evidence. 116. Whether the recipient has formed the requisite intention with respect to the services is particularly relevant where the services might be preliminary to services intended to enable or assist a relevant change. Services that are preliminary to services intended to enable or assist a relevant change may not be captured by the amended provisions. Example 8: Decision not to make an offer Braxton Ltd is a non-resident for GST purposes and a potential bidder in a competitive tender situation in relation to a specific piece of New Zealand land. Braxton is undecided whether it will make an offer in the tender, as it seems a land covenant may cause problems with the land. Braxton suspects the covenant could prevent it from carrying on certain activities on the land. Braxton, therefore, engages a New Zealand law firm to assist with some preliminary investigative work (including advising on the covenant, Overseas Investment Office and Resource Management Act 1993 issues). The law firm’s advice is that the covenant is highly restrictive and will prevent Braxton from using the land in the way that it would like. Because of the advice, Braxton decides not to make an offer. IS 18/07 21 UNCLASSIFIED Frustrated intention 117. Assuming all other requirements in the new test are met, where a person has formed a relevant intention under the new test, the services will be zero-rated by s 11A(1)(e) or standard-rated by s 11A(1)(k). 118. This is important because sometimes services may have been intended to enable or assist a relevant change to the land, but that change may not eventuate. An The law firm bills its clients monthly. It takes about four months for Braxton to carry out the investigative work in relation to the possible purchase before deciding that it will not make an offer. Therefore, by the time the decision is made, the law firm has sent four months’ worth of tax invoices to Braxton in respect of the services it has supplied. The supplies will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). This is because Braxton had not yet formed a relevant intention in accordance with the amended provisions; that is, an intention that the services are to enable or assist a change in the ownership of the land. Example 9: Decision to make an offer This example follows on from example 8. Braxton Ltd decides, in principle, to make an offer to purchase a different parcel of land. However, before submitting the offer, Braxton requires assistance from the New Zealand law firm to prepare the tender documents. Braxton also decides that to formulate the precise terms of its offer, it needs further information from a New Zealand engineering expert. The services the law firm and the engineering expert supply will be standard- rated under s 11A(1)(k). This is because Braxton has formed a relevant intention, so the services can be said to be intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership of the land. These services will be standard-rated irrespective of whether the tender is successful. Example 10: Indistinct intention A New Zealand law firm is engaged to advise Atticus Ltd, a non-resident company, about a proposed acquisition of a New Zealand business, where the transaction could be completed by way of either a share sale or an asset sale. The assets of the target business are predominantly land. Atticus engages the law firm to provide legal services for the acquisition. The legal services include conducting due diligence regarding the assets (including the land), negotiating and drafting the asset sale agreement, attending to settlement, and providing legal and tax advice about the structure to be used to hold the assets and operate the business. The decision whether the transaction is to be implemented through a share sale or an asset sale will be made after due diligence and at least one round of commercial negotiations. The law firm bills its clients monthly. It takes about four months for Atticus to carry out due diligence in relation to the purchase before deciding that it intends to acquire the assets of the New Zealand business rather than the shares. Therefore, by the time the decision is made that the assets will be acquired, the law firm has sent four months’ worth of invoices to Atticus for the services it has supplied. The supplies will be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). Atticus had not yet formed a relevant intention in accordance with the amended provisions; that is, an intention that the services are to enable or assist a change in the ownership of the land. As explained in \[45\], in the context of the provisions, a change in the ownership of a land-owning company is not equivalent to a change in the ownership of land. After Atticus has decided to purchase the assets of the New Zealand business, the law firm’s services will be standard-rated. IS 18/07 22 UNCLASSIFIED example of this might be where a tender is submitted for the purchase of the land, but the tender is unsuccessful. 119. Provided that the recipient intended that the services would enable or assist a relevant change, the new test will apply. The relevant change to the land does not need to occur in fact or as a result of the provision of the services. Example 11: Frustrated intention This example follows on from example 9. Six months earlier, Atticus Ltd had identified a different piece of New Zealand land that it considered an attractive investment opportunity. Atticus decided in principle to proceed with a tender offer on the land. Atticus engaged the same New Zealand law firm to advise on the offer and help it to prepare the offer documents. The law firm also assisted Atticus with Overseas Investment Office and Resource Management Act 1993 issues. Atticus made a bid, but it was unsuccessful. The law firm’s services will not be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). This is because the law firm’s services are in connection with land and Atticus intended that the law firm’s services would enable or assist a change in the ownership of the land, even though that did not occur. Multiple intentions 120. Sometimes the services may have more than one intended result. A question arises as to which intention is relevant. For instance, a New Zealand supplier may supply a variety of services in undertaking an assignment for a non-resident. Some of these services may be intended to enable or assist a change in “ownership ... of the land” (as those words are used in s 11A(1)(k)) and some may be intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership of property other than land. 121. The first step is to consider whether there is a single supply of services or multiple supplies of services. The Commissioner’s view about how that issue should be analysed is set out in “IS 17/03: Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 102. IS 17/03 states that the transaction should be considered from the recipient’s point of view to determine whether there is a “single composite supply” or separate supplies of different elements. 122. If the services that enable or assist a change in ownership of the land can be severed from the other services on a reasonable basis, the approach described in IS 17/03 is to apply zero- or standard-rating to each supply as appropriate. If the supply of services cannot be severed on a reasonable basis, there is a single composite supply. 123. Section 5(14) can separate zero- and standard-rated elements of a single composite supply into multiple supplies. However, the Commissioner’s view in IS 17/03 is that there will be a separation under s 5(14) only where the relevant zero-rating provision (that is, a provision of s 11A) allows for apportionment. IS 17/03 follows the Commissioner’s view on the zero-rating of part of a supply in “IS 08/01: GST – Role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in regard to the zero-rating of part of a supply”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8. 124. The words of s 11A(1)(e) and (k) do not contemplate apportionment. Because of this, the Commissioner’s view is that the correct approach from IS 17/03 is that the IS 18/07 23 UNCLASSIFIED GST treatment of the supply will follow the dominant element of the supply. If there is no dominant element (for example, the supply is made up of several equally important elements that are integral to each other), the GST treatment will be determined by the overall characteristics of the single composite supply. 125. For a more detailed discussion on how to treat single or multiple supplies, suppliers should consult IS 17/03. Example 12: Services intended to enable or assist a change of ownership of land and non-land assets Paul’s Water Storage Ltd, a non-resident company, has decided to expand into New Zealand by acquiring the business assets of Felix’s Tanks Ltd, a New Zealand tank-manufacturing company. The asset acquisition includes land, plant and machinery, business contracts, goodwill, an inventory of tanks, and intellectual property. Paul’s Water Storage engages a New Zealand legal firm to provide legal services for the acquisition. Such legal services include negotiating and drafting the asset sale agreement, attending to settlement, and providing legal and tax advice regarding the structure to be used to hold the assets and operate the business. “IS 17/03: Goods and services tax – single supply or multiple supplies”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 102 requires the law firm to consider the supply of services from the recipient’s point of view to determine whether there is a “single composite supply” of services or separate supplies of different elements. From the perspective of Paul’s Water Storage, the recipient of the legal services, it wants all of the legal services required to enable it to purchase the business. On this basis, the services are not able to be severed into separate supplies on a reasonable basis. Additionally, s 5(14) will not separate the supply into zero- and standard-rated components because s 11A(1)(k) does not contain words of apportionment. For the purposes of this example, assume that the value of the land is 20% of the total value of the business, and that this also reflects a reasonable apportionment of the supply of services. Following “IS 17/03, whether the entire supply is zero- or standard-rated, therefore, turns on whether the dominant element of the supply is services that enable or assist a relevant change to land. In this example, an apportionment on a reasonable basis suggests only 20% of the services relate to land and the remaining 80% of the services relate to the acquisition of non-land assets. Since the dominant element in the supply is not land-related services, the supply of services will be zero-rated. “BR Pub 15/03: Goods and services tax - legal services provided to non- residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand” 126. Before the new test, the Commissioner issued “Public Ruling BR Pub 15/03: GST – legal services provided to non-residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 3 (April 2015): 4. The public ruling applies to the prior provisions that have been retained in the new test. The ruling concludes that certain legal services are not “directly in connection with” land or improvements to land; rather they are one step removed from the transaction that has a direct effect on the land or are ancillary to that transaction. 127. Following the enactment of the amended provisions, the legal services described in BR Pub 15/03 will generally be standard-rated under s 11A(1)(k) because the legal services will enable or assist a relevant change in the land. Suppliers will no longer be able to rely on the ruling because s 91G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that: IS 18/07 24 UNCLASSIFIED \[a\] binding ruling does not apply from the date a taxation law is repealed or amended to the extent that the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law applies in the ruling. When can a non-resident claim input tax deductions? 128. For completeness, two other provisions in the GSTA may allow for input tax deductions. 129. The first provision is s 54B, which allows some non-resident suppliers to register for GST and claim input tax deductions for GST they have been charged. Section 54B is intended to ensure only final consumers are subject to GST. It may be relevant if a non-resident has been charged GST on a supply of land-related services because those services cannot be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(k). 130. To register under s 54B, the non-resident must be registered for a consumption tax in their home country or, if their home country does not have a consumption tax, must be carrying on a taxable activity and be making a sufficient level of supplies that would render them liable to be registered under the New Zealand GSTA. If s 54B applies, the non-resident can register for GST and claim input tax deductions for the GST imposed on land-related services. 131. The second provision is s 22, which relates to pre-incorporation costs. Some non- residents might receive land-related services on behalf of a company that is yet to be formed. This might occur where a non-resident intends to incorporate a New Zealand subsidiary to hold the land. If the non-resident were to do this, s 22 might become relevant and allow the New Zealand subsidiary an input tax deduction for GST charged under s 11A(1)(k). For that to happen: (a) the non-resident would need to become a “member” of the New Zealand subsidiary (s 22(a)); (b) the non-resident would need to be reimbursed by the New Zealand subsidiary for the whole amount of the consideration paid for the services (s 22(a)); (c) the New Zealand subsidiary would need to acquire the services only for the purpose of its taxable activity (s 22(b)); (d) the supply of the services by the non-resident to the New Zealand subsidiary cannot be a taxable supply (this seems unlikely to occur in practice) (s 22(c)) (e) the acquisition of the goods and services would need to occur within the six months before the New Zealand subsidiary was incorporated (s 22(d)); and (f) sufficient records would need to be held (s 22(e)). 132. Assuming the above requirements are met, s 22 would deem the recipient of the supplies to be the New Zealand subsidiary. It would also deem the time of supply to be during the period in which the reimbursement was made. That would allow the New Zealand subsidiary to claim an input tax deduction (provided it is registered). IS 18/07 25 UNCLASSIFIED Further examples 133. The following examples help to explain how the law applies. Examples Example 13: Gardening services Dave, a non-resident for income tax purposes, owns a residential property in Wellington that he purchased in 2016. Dave intends to retire to New Zealand in about five years’ time. Since Dave acquired the property it has been vacant. Dave does not own any other properties in New Zealand. He lives permanently overseas and rarely visits New Zealand. Dave engages Graham to carry out maintenance work on the property. Graham visits the property every three weeks to mow the lawns and tend to the gardens. Dave is a non-resident for GST purposes. This is because, although the residential property might be a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand, Dave has left the property vacant. Because the property has been left vacant, Dave is not carrying on a taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand. Since Dave is a non-resident who is outside New Zealand, s 11A(1)(k) can apply to zero-rate the services, unless the services are “directly in connection” with land, or “in connection with ... land ... and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land”. The lawn-mowing and gardening services Graham provides are directly in connection with land as they have a direct physical effect on the land. Therefore, they will not qualify for zero-rating under s 11A(1)(k). Example 14: Valuation services This example follows on from example 13. After one year of ownership of the Wellington property, Dave decides to get the property valued as he is interested to know its market value. Dave does not intend to use the valuation for any purpose other than to inform himself of the value of the property. Dave engages Rich’s Consultants Ltd, a property consultancy firm, to provide him with the valuation. The valuation services can be zero-rated. This is because the valuation services are not “directly in connection with” land, since they do not have a direct legal or physical effect on land. The services are not covered by the new test because they are not intended to enable or assist a relevant change to the land. Example 15: Surveying services This example follows on from example 14. Dave’s Wellington house is on a relatively large section. The house is at the front of the section, and there is an access way to the rear of the land. The valuation from Rich’s Consultants Ltd, tells Dave that the value of his property has increased. Dave decides that, instead of keeping the whole section, an option might be to subdivide the land and sell the back section. He thinks that on his retirement he is unlikely to need all the land. However, he is still undecided about the subdivision. Dave wants to make sure that having neighbours close by will not interfere with his lifestyle. Dave asks Rich’s Consultants to investigate the possibility of a subdivision. He asks Rich’s Consultants to survey the land and determine the boundaries for a subdivision. The surveying services can be zero-rated. This is because the surveying services are not “directly in connection with” land, since they do not have a direct legal or physical effect on the land. Since Dave has not yet decided to proceed with any subdivision or sale of the back section, the surveying services are not “intended” to enable or assist a relevant change under the new test. IS 18/07 26 UNCLASSIFIED Example 16: Developing the property This example follows on from example 15. Dave decides to go ahead with the subdivision. To maximise the value of the property, he thinks it would be best to build a house on the back section and then sell the house and land together. Dave hires an architect to draw up plans for a house. He also hires a building company to undertake the earthworks and construction work, and a construction supervisor to oversee the development. The architecture services and the supervisory services are not directly in connection with land. This is because, unlike the earthworks and the construction work, they do not have a direct legal or physical effect on the land. However, the architecture and supervisory services are in connection with land and intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition of the land, so must be standard-rated. The earthworks and construction work are directly in connection with land as they have a direct physical effect on land, so they must be standard-rated. Example 17: Real estate agent and lawyer’s services This example follows on from example 16. Dave hires a real estate agent to market the house and land on his behalf. The real estate agent carries out the advertising and negotiation and receives a commission on the sale of the property. Dave also engages a lawyer to take care of the legal aspects of the sale. The services the real estate agent supplies are not directly in connection with land, because the services do not have a direct legal or physical effect on land. The same conclusion applies to the legal services. However, both the real estate agent’s services and the legal services are in connection with land and are intended to enable or assist a change in the ownership of the land, so they must be standard-rated. Example 18: Services relating to a transfer of an equitable interest in land Paris is a non-resident who lives in Sydney. Paris enters into an agreement for sale and purchase ‘off the plans’ for an apartment in a block to be developed in Auckland. The agreement for sale and purchase is conditional and will not become unconditional until the block receives a code compliance certificate, which is not expected to happen for another 12 months. For some time, Paris has also had her eye on her ‘dream home’ in Sydney. Three months later, Paris discovers that the property in Sydney has been listed for sale. However, the asking price is such that Paris cannot afford to buy both properties. Paris decides that she cannot forego the opportunity to buy her dream home and decides to sell her interest in the Auckland apartment to another buyer who will complete the transaction. To sell her interest, Paris engages an Auckland- based real estate agent to market her interest in the property. She also engages a lawyer to advise her on the legal aspects of the transaction. Paris’s interest in the apartment is an equitable interest in the land. Paris no longer intends to complete the purchase of the apartment and gain legal title. Paris now intends only to acquire and dispose of the equitable interest. Therefore, the services the real estate agent and lawyer supplied are in connection with land and intended to enable or assist a change in the legal status of the land. The Commissioner’s view is that the new test applies to services intended to enable or assist a change in an equitable interest in land. The services the real estate agent and lawyer supplied will, therefore, be standard-rated under s 11A(1)(k). Example 19: valuation services for multiple properties Sarah, a non-resident living outside New Zealand, is interested in purchasing a rental property in New Zealand. IS 18/07 27 UNCLASSIFIED Table on GST treatment of particular services relating to specific land in New Zealand 134. The GST treatment depends on whether the services are directly in connection with land, or are in connection with land and are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition or ownership or other legal status of the land (relevant intended change). A relevant intended change is not needed for services directly in connection with land. However, sometimes both the “directly in connection with land” alternative and the “in connection with land” with the relevant intended change alternative will be satisfied. 135. The following table provides examples of particular services relating to specific land in New Zealand and the GST treatment of the services under s 11A(1)(k). The table gives examples for services provided to a person who is a non-resident for GST purposes and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.

Since the services do not relate to specific land in New Zealand, the services the valuer supplies are not directly in connection with land nor are they intended to enable or assist a relevant change to land. Therefore, the services can be zero-rated. Sarah finds 10 properties of interest to her on the internet. To understand the market prices for those properties, Sarah orders computer-generated valuation reports for each of the 10 properties from a website. She pays a fee to the website for the reports. The valuation services supplied to Sarah in relation to the 10 properties relate to specific land in New Zealand but do not have a direct legal or physical effect on the land. The valuation services are, therefore, not “directly in connection with” land. The valuation services do not meet the new test since the services cannot be said to be intended by Sarah to enable or assist a relevant change to any particular property. Therefore, the services can be zero-rated.

This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces “IS 17/03: Goods and services tax - Single supply or multiple supplies” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 4 (May 2017): 102. 2. A registered person who enters into a contract with a recipient to supply several goods and services needs to determine what sort of supply or supplies they have made so they can correctly account for GST. Where multiple elements are 2 Unclassified supplied with potentially different GST treatments, the supplier must determine whether they have made a single composite supply (of all the elements) with a single GST treatment, or multiple separate supplies (of each element or a combination of elements) with different GST treatments. 3. In some cases, it may be clear from the contract that only a single element is supplied to the recipient. Boundary issues do not arise on the supply of a single element. 4. Boundary issues may arise where multiple elements are supplied together. Boundary issues arise where some elements of the supply are subject to GST at the standard rate and other elements are zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST at all. If the GST treatment of each element of the supply is the same then boundary issues do not arise. 5. Sometimes the Act deems supplies of multiple elements to be treated in a particular manner (for example, ss 5(20B), 5(20) and 5(15)). Where the Act does not deem a particular outcome, the arrangement actually entered into and carried out between the supplier and recipient must be carefully considered. The answers to the following questions may help a registered person to decide whether they have made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies:  What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient for their payment?  What are the relationships between the elements supplied?  Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 6. The first question requires a registered person to identify the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient. This is determined objectively and examines what is supplied from the recipient’s perspective. 7. The fact elements supplied to the recipient could have been supplied separately does not mean those elements should be severed from the rest of the supply. In addition, the fact a single price is charged to the recipient does not determine whether one or more than one supply is made. It is the actual supply made to the recipient that must be considered and not how the supply is invoiced or charged to the recipient. 8. In considering the second question, namely the relationships between the different elements supplied, the courts consider whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The phrases “ancillary or incidental to” and “necessary or integral part of” are different descriptions of a similar test. The facts of each case will determine which description is more appropriate. Factors that indicate that elements are ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, a dominant element include whether the element is:  not an aim in itself; instead, the element facilitates, contributes to, or enables the supply of the dominant element;  a means of better enjoying the dominant element;  an optional extra and is not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. 3 Unclassified 9. The third question to answer is whether a sufficient distinction exists between the different elements of a transaction to make it reasonable to sever them into separate supplies. This question requires taking an overall view and looking for the essential purpose of the transaction and not artificially splitting what, from an economic point of view, is a single supply. If, on an objective assessment, it is not reasonable to sever the different elements of the transaction, then there will be only one composite supply. 10. If there is one composite supply, the zero-rating provisions may apply to zero- rate part or all of the supply. The compulsory zero-rating of land provisions may mean the supply is zero-rated if it includes land: s 11(1)(mb). Additionally, despite being a single composite supply, part of the supply may be required to be zero-rated: ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B. If the zero-rating provisions do not apply, the GST treatment will follow the dominant element of the supply. If there is no dominant element (for example, the supply is made up of several equally important elements that are integral to each other), the GST treatment will be determined by the overall characteristics of the single composite supply. 11. If there are multiple supplies, the relevant provisions of the Act are applied to each supply. Where the recipient pays a global amount for multiple supplies with different GST treatments, the consideration is apportioned under s 10(18) between taxable supplies and non-taxable or exempt supplies. 12. The process is summarised in the following flowchart. The flowchart is intended to be an aid to interpretation only. A more detailed discussion of the process follows the flowchart: 4 Unclassified 5 Unclassified Introduction 13. GST is imposed on the supply of goods and services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by a registered person by reference to the value of the supply: s 8(1). Supply is defined broadly to include “all forms of supply”: s 5(1). Supplies can be subject to GST at the standard rate, or be zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST. Issues can arise where different elements of a supply are potentially subject to different GST treatments. These issues are referred to as “boundary issues”. 14. Boundary issues arise only where multiple elements are supplied. Contracts for the supply of a single element do not raise boundary issues. Boundary issues primarily arise where some elements of the supply are subject to GST at the standard rate and other elements are zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST. If the GST treatment of each element of the supply is the same, then boundary issues do not arise. Unlike other jurisdictions, New Zealand has relatively few boundary issues. 15. Where multiple elements are supplied with potentially different GST treatments, the supplier must determine whether they have made a single composite supply with a single GST treatment or multiple separate supplies with different GST treatments. 16. The single composite supply or multiple separate supplies issue arises in various scenarios. For example:  language schools – whether the supply of language tuition (standard-rated) is a separate supply from pre-arrival assistance services (zero-rated), which was considered in Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) and is discussed from \[42\];  credit card surcharges – whether the charge for paying by credit card (exempt) can be separated from the goods or services being paid for (standard-rated); and  loyalty cards – whether the supply of loyalty points (standard-rated) is a separate supply from the supply of credit card services (exempt). 17. The Commissioner considered specific single composite supply or multiple separate supplies issues in the following items:  “Financial Planning Fees – GST Treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001): 37 (IS0079). This statement addresses the GST treatment of financial planning fees charged to investors where the supply comprised exempt financial services and associated potentially standard- rated services.  “QB 12/07: Goods and Services Tax – Treatment of Transitional Services Supplied as Part of the Sale of a Business (that Includes the Supply of Land)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 65.  “Goods and Services Tax – GST and Retirement Villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015) : 6 (IS 15/02). This statement addresses the GST treatment of taxable supplies of care services and accommodation in a commercial dwelling, and exempt supplies of financial services and accommodation in a non-commercial dwelling. 6 Unclassified 18. The purpose of this Interpretation Statement is to set out the general principles for determining whether a supply of multiple elements (supplied together in a single transaction) is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies and to apply those principles to examples. The Commissioner considers that these general principles are consistent with those set out and applied in the items listed at \[17\]. Analysing supplies involving boundary issues 19. Before reviewing how the courts have analysed boundary issues, it is necessary to consider whether any specific deeming provisions of the Act will apply. 20. The Act contains several provisions that prescribe how supplies must be treated. This means that irrespective of how the supply might be analysed under ordinary principles, the Act overrides this and specifies how the supply will be treated. This occurs, for example, in:  s 5(14B) for rights embedded in shares;  s 5(20) for warranty services provided to a non-resident warrantor; and  s 5(15) for supplies including residences. 21. The application of these sections is discussed briefly in \[22\] to \[29\] below. This list is not exhaustive. Other provisions in the Act may have similar effects. Rights embedded in shares 22. Section 5(14B) was enacted (along with the definition of “associated supply” in s 2 and s 14(1B)) in response to the outcome in CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA) for supplies of equity securities and participatory securities (“shares”). Gulf Harbour is discussed from \[31\]. 23. Section 5(14B) provides that if part of a supply of a share is the supply of a right to receive supplies of goods and services that are not exempt supplies, the supply of the right is treated as being a separate supply. This may mean the right is subject to GST rather than being an exempt financial service. For more information about s 5(14B), see “Goods and Services Tax – GST and Retirement Villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6 (IS 15/02), \[142\]–\[155\]. 24. If elements other than the shares (part of which is the right to receive non- exempt supplies) are supplied under the contract, those other elements must still be considered to determine whether there is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. Warranty services provided to a non-resident warrantor 25. Section 5(20) applies to the supply of services under a warranty covering imported goods. Commonly, two types of warranty cover imported goods:  a factory warranty offered by the non-resident manufacturer to the importer; and  an extended warranty offered by the importer or distributor to the final consumer. 7 Unclassified 26. When the final consumer makes a claim on the warranty, the importer or distributor makes two supplies, namely, a supply of:  goods and services to the final consumer; and  the service of remedying a defect under a factory warranty to the non- resident warrantor (zero-rated under s 11A(1)(ma)), who pays for the supply of that service. 27. Section 5(20) requires the supply of goods and services to the final consumer to be treated as the service of remedying a defect to the non-resident warrantor. It effectively ignores the supply of goods and services to the final consumer. This makes it more likely that the supply of warranty services by the importer or distributor can be zero-rated as a service supplied to a non-resident. For more information about ss 5(20) and 11A(1)(ma), see “Zero-rating of Warranty payments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14 No 11 (November 2002): 71. Supplies including residences 28. Section 5(15) deems a supply that includes a principal place of residence to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. The section also applies to a dwelling that has been rented out by the vendor exclusively for accommodation for at least the preceding five years. For example, when a farm (which includes the farmer’s house and its surrounding curtilage) is sold, s 5(15) provides that the vendor’s supply of the farmer’s house and curtilage is a separate supply from the supply of the remainder of the farm. The GST treatment of each supply is determined separately. Usually, the supply of the remainder of the farm must be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb) while the supply of the farmer’s house and curtilage is not subject to GST because it is private and does not form part of the vendor’s taxable activity. 29. Once s 5(15) has been applied, the remaining elements (other than the principal place of residence or dwelling) supplied under the contract must still be considered to determine whether there is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. Whether the supply should be treated as a single composite supply 30. Once any relevant specific deeming provisions have been considered, the next step is to determine the nature of the supply. The approach of the New Zealand courts to identifying what has been supplied is to consider the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA); Gulf Harbour. 31. In Gulf Harbour, the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of identifying the true nature of the legal arrangements entered into between the supplier and the recipient when determining the GST consequences of a supply. In that case, the taxpayer supplied redeemable preference shares that included membership rights in a golf club (the rights were attached to the shares). The Commissioner argued the supply was of a golf club membership, so was subject to GST. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that there were two supplies: a supply of a share and a supply of a golf club membership. The taxpayer argued that there was a single supply of a GST-exempt financial service (a share). 8 Unclassified 32. The Court of Appeal stated that the Commissioner’s argument (at \[39\]) “involves putting the contractual arrangement to one side and looking at what in substance \[the suppliers\] were supplying ...”. The Court of Appeal considered the Commissioner was incorrectly looking at what “in substance” was being supplied, instead of looking at the contractual arrangement. The Court considered the “true nature” of a transaction must be ascertained by a careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out – not by an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction, measured by the results intended and achieved, or of the overall economic consequences. 33. The Court of Appeal held that the golf club membership rights attached to each share were incidents of the share and no independent source or origin of those rights existed. As a result, the Court found for the taxpayer and held that there was a single supply of a share. The Act was subsequently amended in response to this outcome for supplies of equity securities and participatory securities: ss 2 (definition of “associated supply”), 5(14B) and 14(1B). 34. Where it is unclear whether there is one composite supply or multiple separate supplies under the contract, the transaction must be analysed further to determine the issue. Case law has established numerous principles to assist in this enquiry. 35. The leading New Zealand decision considering whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies is the High Court decision in Auckland Institute. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J considered the GST treatment of supplies to international students studying in New Zealand. The taxpayer provided tuition services to students coming to New Zealand from overseas. An associated company provided pre-arrival services. The students paid a single “global fee” to the taxpayer for all supplies from both the taxpayer and the associated company. One of the issues before the Court was whether it was appropriate to split the supply to enable the pre-arrival services to be zero-rated. 36. Hansen J discussed the approach of the House of Lords in Card Protection Plan v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2001\] 2 All ER 143. In that case, the House of Lords considered whether a credit card protection plan offered to cardholders was a single composite supply or two independent supplies comprising the supply of VAT-exempt insurance and a separate supply of VAT-chargeable card registration services. The House of Lords concluded the dominant supply was of VAT-exempt insurance and the supply of the card registration services was ancillary to the exempt supply. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J summarised the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (at \[32\]): • Every supply of a service must normally be regarded as distinct and independent. • A supply which comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split, so as not to distort the functioning of the VAT system. • The essential features of a transaction must be ascertained in order to determine whether the taxable person is supplying the customer, being a typical consumer, with several distinct principal services or with a single service. • There is a single supply in particular in cases where one or more elements are to be regarded as constituting the principal service whilst one or more elements are to be regarded, by contrast, as ancillary services which share the tax treatment of the principal service. A service must be regarded as ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 9 Unclassified • Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 37. After reviewing all the relevant authorities, Hansen J summarised the principles for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (with one or more differing GST treatments) (at \[36\]): \[a\] In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly. \[b\] The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. \[c\] A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 38. Based on these principles, the Commissioner considers it helpful to ask three questions when analysing the transaction:  What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient?  What are the relationships between the elements supplied?  Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 39. When answering these questions, it is important to consider the supply from the perspective of a typical customer. What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient? 40. The first question requires a registered person to identify the essential features of the arrangement – the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient for their payment. In doing so, it is important to examine what is supplied from the point of view of a “typical customer”: Card Protection Plan. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J stated: \[44\] In my view, the attempt to characterise all of the services provided by International as a separate supply is based on a fundamental misconception. It overlooks the need to examine the supply from the point of view of the consumer. It focuses on the arrangements between AIS and International. It fails to consider the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to the consumer. \[45\] The importance of examining the services provided under the contract between the supplier and recipient emerges clearly from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton Ltd v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. ... Richardson J observed at 12,328 that the statutory scheme is directed to contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient of the supply ... \[Emphasis added\] 41. The Commissioner considers that the phrase “the true and substantial nature” does not refer to an “in substance” analysis of the arrangement between the supplier and the recipient. Instead, “the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to the consumer” refers to what the recipient paid for and was supplied with. It requires an examination of the supply from the recipient’s perspective. The true and substantial nature of what is provided to the recipient (the supply or supplies) is determined objectively: British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643 (CA). 10 Unclassified 42. The relevant arrangement is the one between the supplier and the recipient. It is irrelevant that the supplier may arrange some other party to deliver the goods or services to the recipient on the supplier’s behalf. This was the view taken in Auckland Institute. In that case, one member of a group of companies contracted with overseas students to provide tuition services. The tuition services were provided to the students by another company in the group. Hansen J concluded that whether a service could be supplied separately (by another entity or a third party) was irrelevant in determining whether a single supply was made. Hansen J focused on the supply actually made under the contract with the recipient – “the true and substantial nature” of what was supplied to the recipient. 43. In this step, the focus is not on what one of the parties subjectively considered the supply was, or could have been. The relevant perspective is to consider what was supplied to the recipient as viewed objectively from the recipient’s perspective. The fact a single price is charged to the recipient does not determine whether one or more than one supply is made. It is the actual supply made to the recipient that must be considered and not how the supply is invoiced or charged. What are the relationships between the elements supplied? 44. It is also helpful to consider the relationships between the different elements supplied. The courts consider whether one element of the transaction is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The phrases “ancillary or incidental to” and “necessary or integral part of” are different descriptions of a similar test: C & E Commrs v United Biscuits (UK) Limited \[1992\] STC 325 (Ct of Sess). The Court in that case noted that one description might be more appropriate for one set of facts and the other for a different set of facts. This view was echoed in College of Estate Management v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2005\] UKHL 62, where the Court noted that the applicable test will depend on the facts of the case. If one element of the transaction is ancillary or integral to another (dominant) element of the transaction, then there will be a single composite supply, with the GST treatment of that supply following the dominant element. 45. Examples of elements that are ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, a dominant element include where the element is:  not an aim in itself; instead the goods or services facilitate, contribute to, or enable the supply of the dominant part;  a means of better enjoying the dominant supply;  an optional extra and not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. 46. In Auckland Institute Hansen J quoted from Customs & Excise Commissioners v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd \[1997\] STC 445 (EWCA) at 462, where Millett LJ noted that the issue is not whether one element is ancillary or incidental to, or even a necessary or integral part of, the whole, but whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. Hansen J stated (at \[30\]): The issue is not whether one element of a complex commercial transaction is ancillary or incidental to, or even a necessary or integral part of, the whole, but whether one element of the transaction is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The reason why the former is the wrong question is 11 Unclassified that it leaves the real issue unresolved; whether there is a single or a multiple supply. The proper inquiry is whether one element of the transaction is so dominated by another element as to lose any separate identity as a supply for fiscal purposes, leaving the latter, the dominant element of the transaction, as the only supply. If the elements of the transaction are not in this relationship with each other, each remains as a supply in its own right with its own separate fiscal consequences. \[Emphasis added\] 47. Hansen J held that the pre-arrival services were ancillary or incidental to the principal supply of tuition services. Therefore, the supply of tuition services and pre-arrival services comprised a single supply of tuition services: \[48\] ...They are goods and services provided to enable it (or AIS) to better perform the services supplied to students. Students did not contract for the provision of those services. It may be argued that the students benefited from them but, as Richardson J pointed out in Wilson & Horton, that is not the test. ... \[53\] Notwithstanding the Commissioner's concession that pre-arrival services constitute a separate supply, I am of the view that all of the services provided by International/AIS to students overseas are an integral part of the supply of tuition services. In terms of the fourth of the propositions in the Card Plan Protection case, I would regard those services as not constituting an aim in itself but as a means of better enjoying the principal service. \[Emphasis added\] 48. Hansen J concluded (at \[52\] and \[59\]) that the pre-arrival services were ancillary and integral to the supply of tuition, because they facilitated the students undertaking a course of study. 49. Hansen J borrowed heavily from the United Kingdom VAT cases when deciding whether the pre-arrival services were ancillary or integral to the supply of tuition. Although the categories of goods and services that are exempt or zero-rated under the United Kingdom VAT legislation differ from those under the New Zealand legislation, Hansen J considered the approaches taken in the United Kingdom VAT cases to be of assistance. 50. In College of Estate Management, the College provided a distance-learning course and the necessary written materials to complete the course. The Court considered that the written materials were not ancillary to the provision of the course, but neither was the supply of the written materials an end in itself. Lord Rodger stated: \[10\] ... But, since the court envisages that the principal supply may itself comprise more than one element, plainly, in cases where there is no ancillary supply, a single supply may still be made up of more than one element. So where a taxpayer is involved in a transaction in which he performs several services, none of which can be singled out as the dominant or principal supply, it may nevertheless be necessary to consider whether, for tax purposes, they are properly to be regarded as elements of a single supply. The supply of restaurant services is one example (see Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg C- 231/94 \[1996\] All ER (EC) 656, \[1996\] ECR I-2395). \[11\] ... In the present case, however—leaving aside any allocation of a proportion of the price—it would be highly artificial, to say the least, to describe the printed materials as nothing more than a means for the students the better to enjoy the education supplied by the College. In reality, those materials were the means by which the students obtained most of their education. \[12\] But the mere fact that the supply of the printed materials cannot be described as ancillary does not mean that it is to be regarded as a separate supply for tax purposes. One has still to decide whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the College should properly be regarded as making a separate supply of the printed materials or, rather, a single supply of education, of which the provision of the printed materials is merely one element. ... The question is whether, for tax purposes, these are to be treated as separate supplies or merely as elements in some over-arching single supply. ... \[Emphasis added\] 12 Unclassified 51. Lord Walker stated: \[30\] ... But there are other cases (including the Faaborg case \[C-231/94 Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg \[1996\] STC 774 (ECJ)\], the Dr Beynon case \[Beynon and Partners v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2004\] UKHL 53\] and the present case) in which it is inappropriate to analyse the transaction in terms of what is ‘principal’ and ‘ancillary’, and it is unhelpful to strain the natural meaning of ‘ancillary’ in an attempt to do so. Food is not ancillary to restaurant services; it is of central and indispensable importance to them; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the Faaborg case). Pharmaceuticals are not ancillary to medical care which requires the use of medication; again, they are of central and indispensable importance; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the Dr Beynon case). ... \[32\] ... What the judge called ‘a component part of a single supply’ may be (in the fullest sense) essential to it—a restaurant with no food is almost a contradiction in terms, and could not supply its customers with anything—and yet the economic reality is that the restaurateur provides a single supply of services. Without the need to resort to gnomic utterances such as ‘the medium is the message’, the same sort of relationship exists between the educational services which the College provides to a student who takes one of its distance-learning courses and the written materials which it provides to the student. \[Emphasis added\] 52. The House of Lords considered that the written materials were the means by which the students obtained most of their education. Their Lordships implied that the written materials were of central and indispensable importance to the educational services. The written materials were necessary to complete the course. The Court concluded that the supply of the written materials was part of the overall supply of education services. 53. College of Estate Management was recently distinguished in Metropolitan International Schools v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2015\] UKFTT 517 (TC). In Metropolitan International the Court said (at \[66\]) that “an element that is not an end in itself ranks as an ancillary element. Ancillary elements generally contribute to the better enjoyment of the principal element”. On the facts of Metropolitan International, from a recipient’s point of view, there was a supply of VAT-exempt manuals with a separate supply of optional educational services (which would not lead to any qualification unless the recipient undertook exams with a third party). This can be compared with College of Estate Management, where the facts showed that the overall characteristic of the supply was educational services (leading to a formal qualification) with the additional supply of written materials being part of the supply of the educational services. 54. An example of minor or peripheral parts of a composite supply is seen in Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2007\] EWHC 103 Ch. In this case, it was held there was a single supply of membership of a club that conferred on a child the right to attendance at classes involving structured physical play. Other benefits received on admission to membership (a DVD, a CD, a gym bag, a membership card, personal accident insurance for a child while attending a class, and a subscription for a magazine) were not separate supplies, but were peripheral, and ancillary, to the supply of membership. Briggs J considered that it was “a matter of common sense” that the fee was for membership of the club and not the other benefits of membership (at \[27\]). To conclude otherwise “would be to allow the tail to wag the dog” (at \[29\]). 13 Unclassified Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 55. Finally, it is necessary to consider whether it is reasonable to sever the elements of a transaction into separate supplies. This test requires taking an overall view, without over-zealous dissection, and to look for the essential (or dominant) purpose of the transaction: College of Estate Management (per Lord Walker); Card Protection Plan. A supply that comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split: Card Protection Plan. 56. Similarly, in Auckland Institute, Hansen J cites Tipping J’s judgment in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC). In Smiths City, Tipping J noted (at 9,144) that the Court “must decide as a matter of fact and degree whether there is in the transaction under scrutiny a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly”. If, on an objective examination, it is not reasonable to sever the different elements of the transaction, then there will be one composite supply only. 57. It appears from the cases cited above that the “reasonable” test focuses on the essential purpose of the transaction and on the elements themselves (whether there is a sufficient distinction between the elements to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly) rather than on whether a separate amount is charged for the element in question or on how easily a global fee can be apportioned. 58. Further, one of the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (as summarised in Auckland Institute (at \[32\]) is: Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 59. Hansen J also stated in Auckland Institute (at \[61\]): I do not see the fee structure as a decisive consideration but I think it tends to confirm that the services which the plaintiff claims are covered by the overseas assistance fee are more realistically to be seen as among the costs which AIS incurs in providing tuition services. \[Emphasis added\] 60. Hansen J’s comments relate to an argument by the Commissioner that as there was no material difference between the fees charged to domestic and overseas students, the fee structure confirmed that a separate supply of overseas assistance services was not made to students. Hansen J did not consider that the fee structure was determinative. 61. And in Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications Plc \[1999\] BTC 5,273 (which was cited in Auckland Institute of Studies) Lord Slynn said: On the authorities it is clear that the fact that one ‘package price’ is charged without separate charge for individual supplies being specified does not prevent there being two separate supplies for VAT purposes. In my opinion the fact that separate charges are identified in a contract or on an invoice does not on a consideration of all the circumstances necessarily prevent the various supplies from constituting one composite transaction nor does it prevent one supply from being ancillary to another supply which for VAT purposes is the dominant supply. Even though it may be desirable to approach each supply as if it were a separate supply and even though each supply in a composite transaction may be an independent separate 14 Unclassified supply the essential features of a transaction may show that one supply is ancillary to another and that it is the latter that for VAT purposes is to be treated as the supply. \[Emphasis added\] 62. Lord Hope (also in British Telecommunications) similarly considered that in all cases the essential features of the transaction must be identified. All the circumstances of the transaction must be considered and no one factor will determine whether there is a separate supply. Whether a separate charge is made or whether a separate price can be identified, whether the service could be supplied separately or whether the supplies are “physically and economically dissociable” (for example, where there is a supply of goods and a supply of services and the price for each supply can be identified) are not determinative. GST treatment of a single composite supply 63. If it is determined that there is a single composite supply, it is still necessary to determine whether there are any other specific provisions in the Act that may apply. For example, the following matters need to be considered. Some supplies of land must be zero-rated 64. The first is whether the single composite supply includes land and must be zero- rated. Section 11(1)(mb) provides that a supply that wholly or partly consists of land must be zero-rated if at settlement date:  the supply is made by a vendor who is a registered person to a purchaser who is a registered person;  the purchaser acquires the goods (including land) supplied with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and  the land included in the supply is not intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser. 65. If s 11(1)(mb) applies, the single composite supply must be zero–rated, regardless of whether the land is the dominant element of the supply. Other supplies may be partly zero-rated 66. Sections 11, 11A, 11AB and 11B provide that some taxable supplies must be zero-rated. While all the zero-rating provisions apply to “a supply”, some indicate that part of the supply can be zero-rated by using the words “to the extent that” or other equivalent wording. Where a provision of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of a supply to be zero-rated, the different elements of a single composite supply may be subject to different GST treatments. 67. These different GST treatments are achieved through s 5(14). Section 5(14) applies when a supply is subject to GST at the standard rate but any of the provisions of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B require part of the supply to be zero-rated. If s 5(14) applies, the zero-rated part is treated as being a separate supply. For a more detailed discussion of s 5(14), see “IS 08/01: GST — Role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in Regard to the Zero-rating of Part of a Supply” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8. 15 Unclassified Otherwise, GST treatment follows dominant element 68. If the provisions of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B do not apply to the single composite supply, the GST treatment of that supply will follow the dominant element of the supply. If there is no dominant element (for example, the supply is made up of several equally important elements that are integral to each other), the GST treatment will be determined by the overall characteristics of the single composite supply. GST treatment of multiple separate supplies 69. If there are multiple separate supplies, the relevant provisions of the Act are applied to each supply. This means that it is necessary to consider each separately identified supply to determine whether any of the specific provisions (such as, for example, s 11(1)(mb)) apply. 70. In some situations, a recipient may pay a global amount for multiple supplies with different GST treatments (for example, taxable supplies and exempt supplies). Section 10(18) provides that GST should be calculated on that part of the consideration that is properly attributable to the taxable supply. This means the consideration must be apportioned between taxable supplies and non-taxable supplies or exempt supplies. Examples 71. The following examples illustrate how the law applies. All persons mentioned in the examples are GST registered. Example 1 – Services supplied to overseas students to help them to move to New Zealand 72. Ecological Education Ltd offers education services to students in New Zealand. The education services are intended to provide students with a qualification in eco-management. Almost all of Ecological Education’s students are from overseas. To help students moving to New Zealand, Ecological Education provides various pre-arrival services to the students while they are still overseas (for example, interpreting and translating services, assistance with immigration procedures and the completion of enrolment applications). Ecological Education charges the student a single fee for the tuition costs and the pre-arrival services. Are the pre-arrival services separate zero-rated supplies? 73. No. The pre-arrival services are part of a single composite supply of standard- rated education services, so are also standard-rated. 74. First, it is necessary to identify the supply by considering the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances. It is evident from the arrangement that Ecological Education supplies multiple elements, namely education services to the students in New Zealand, and various pre-arrival services to students while they are still overseas, all for a single fee. 75. To decide whether Ecological Education has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies it is helpful to consider the true and substantive nature of what is supplied to the student from the recipient’s (that is, the student’s) 16 Unclassified perspective. From the student’s point of view, the dominant supply is of education services. Considering the relationship between the elements supplied, the pre-arrival services are ancillary or incidental to the supply of education services. The pre-arrival services are not aims in themselves, but are a means of better enjoying the education services. Accordingly, there is a single composite supply of education services that is subject to GST at the standard rate. Example 2 – Tablet provided as part of mortgage promotion 76. Andrew needs to obtain a mortgage of $250,000 to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches New Bank, because of its recent mortgage promotion. He gets his mortgage approved and, as part of the mortgage promotion, he receives a new tablet. 77. If these were separate supplies, the mortgage would be an exempt supply of financial services under s 14(1)(a). The supply of the tablet would be a taxable supply under s 8. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST? 78. No. The tablet is an incidental part of a single composite, exempt supply of the mortgage, so is also exempt from GST. 79. The true nature of the legal arrangement is a loan from New Bank to Andrew (secured by a mortgage over the land). The contract also includes a supply of goods from New Bank to Andrew. Therefore, New Bank supplies multiple elements to Andrew, namely a loan and a tablet. The question is whether these two elements are a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. As with example 1, the nature of the supply has to be considered from the recipient’s (that is, Andrew’s) perspective. 80. Unlike example 1, the supply of the tablet cannot be considered ancillary to the supply of financial services, because it does not facilitate, contribute to or enable the supply of the dominant part of the transaction (the mortgage). The supply of the tablet does not directly affect the supply of the mortgage in any material sense. 81. However, the supply of the tablet is incidental, minor or peripheral to the dominant element of the supply. Andrew would not have entered into a mortgage simply to receive the tablet. Obtaining the tablet is not an aim in itself. Andrew’s aim is to obtain a mortgage. Objectively, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. The supply of the tablet is also not sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the parts. It is the supply of the mortgage that triggers the supply of the tablet. 82. In this situation, there is a single composite, exempt supply of a mortgage. The supply of the tablet is an incidental or peripheral supply to the dominant supply of GST-exempt financial services. This means all elements of the supply under the agreement are exempt for GST. Example 3 – Tablet available at reduced price as part of mortgage promotion 83. As a variation to the facts of example 2, Andrew still needs to obtain a mortgage to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches 17 Unclassified New Bank, because of its recent mortgage promotion. New Bank’s mortgage promotion is that for new borrowings in the range of what Andrew wants to borrow, it is offering customers the opportunity to purchase for $500 a new tablet valued at $1,500. Andrew’s mortgage is approved and, as part of the mortgage promotion, he takes up the opportunity to get a new tablet for $500. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST? 84. Yes. The supply of the tablet is separate to the supply of the mortgage. Therefore, although the mortgage is exempt as the supply of financial services, the tablet is a taxable supply. 85. Unlike example 2, the tablet is not incidental to taking out the mortgage. Obtaining the tablet was an aim in itself. While Andrew’s primary aim was to obtain a mortgage, obtaining the new tablet was a separate objective. As in example 2, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. However, in this case the supply of the tablet is sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the elements. The tablet was not part of the supply of the mortgage – it was separately pursued by Andrew for further consideration. Example 4 – Theatre tickets purchased on credit card and credit card surcharge 86. To celebrate the expansion of his business, Andrew buys theatre tickets for all his employees. Andrew purchases the tickets from the theatre box office using his credit card. The theatre charges Andrew a credit card surcharge. Is the credit card surcharge a separate supply? 87. No. The credit card surcharge is part of a single composite supply of standard rated theatre tickets. 88. The true nature of the legal arrangement is for the supply of multiple elements, namely theatre tickets and the facility to pay for those tickets by credit card, with each element itemised and charged for separately. It is necessary to consider whether there is any relationship between the supply of the tickets and the supply of the payment facility (being the facility to pay with a credit card). Viewing the arrangement between Andrew and the theatre from Andrew’s point of view, the dominant supply is the supply of theatre tickets. While he is paying a surcharge for using his credit card, the dominant supply remains the supply of theatre tickets. Andrew’s ability to use his credit card is not an aim in itself. The facility to pay by credit card is ancillary to the dominant supply of the theatre tickets, in the sense that it enables the supply to occur. 89. There is a single composite, taxable supply of theatre tickets. This means all the elements of the supply under the agreement are subject to GST. Example 5 – Residential accommodation and cleaning services 90. Andrew’s parents are looking to move into a villa that is part of a retirement complex. The villa stands alone and, at this stage, Andrew’s parents do not require any care. When considering the options, Andrew convinces his parents that they should get the option offered by the retirement complex of having a cleaner come to the villa weekly. 18 Unclassified 91. If these are separate supplies, the supply of the right to live in the villa would be an exempt supply of residential accommodation under s 14(1)(c). The supply of the cleaning services would be a taxable supply under s 8. Are the cleaning services subject to GST? 92. Yes. The cleaning services are a separate supply to the supply of the right to live in the villa. 93. The dominant supply is the right to live in the villa. In some respects, the cleaning services could be seen as ancillary or incidental to the right to live in the villa. However, in this case, the cleaning services are not necessary or incidental to the right to live in the villa – they are an extra service that not all recipients require. In this case, a separate amount is charged for the cleaning services. This fact may indicate multiple separate supplies, but it is not determinative. It must still be considered whether the arrangements indicate that Andrew’s parents intended to purchase two distinct services. While Andrew’s parents’ primary aim was to obtain the right to live in the villa, obtaining the cleaning services was a separate objective. In this case the supply of the cleaning services is sufficiently distinct from the supply of the right to live in the villa to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the elements. Example 6 – Loyalty points with a credit card 94. Electronics Ltd (an electronics retail chain) operates a customer loyalty programme in its retail stores. Registered customers receive loyalty points for shopping at Electronics Ltd and these loyalty points entitle them to future discounts at Electronics Ltd. 95. New Bank wants to expand its credit card business. It decides to enter into an arrangement with Electronics Ltd. Under the terms of the arrangement, New Bank and Electronics Ltd intend to provide additional loyalty points in Electronics Ltd’s loyalty programme to registered customers who use the New Bank credit card to purchase goods from Electronics Ltd. 96. New Bank pays Electronics Ltd for services associated with promoting and maintaining the loyalty programme. These services include access to Electronics Ltd’s customer database, marketing the loyalty programme (including the provision of all marketing material), encouraging customers to use the New Bank credit card, managing all non-credit card aspects of the loyalty programme, accepting in-store account payments, assisting the retail stores to accept in-store account payments and provide loyalty points, and training the retail store employees on how the loyalty programme works. 97. Electronics Ltd wants to know how it should treat the services it supplies to New Bank for GST purposes. Should any of the services be exempt as a separate supply of financial services? 98. No. The services are all part of a single composite supply of standard-rated marketing and promotional services. 99. The contract between New Bank and Electronics Ltd provides for the supply of several services from Electronics Ltd to New Bank. It is necessary to consider whether there is any relationship between the various services provided. The 19 Unclassified focus must be on what is supplied to the recipient. The recipient of these services is New Bank, despite the fact some of the services are supplied directly to New Bank’s customers (for example, answering questions about the loyalty programme). 100. The supply could be broken down into separate elements (some taxable at the standard rate and some exempt). However, this would not appropriately reflect what is supplied to the recipient, New Bank. The supply from Electronics Ltd to New Bank is a supply of all the elements. From New Bank’s perspective, it has contracted with Electronics Ltd for the supply of all those elements as a single package of marketing and promotional services. It is helpful to consider the relationship between the different elements of the supply when deciding whether Electronics Ltd has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies to New Bank. 101. The dominant element of the supply to New Bank is marketing and promotional services for the loyalty programme. While Electronics Ltd may, as part of that dominant element, be providing financial services, such as accepting account payments, these are ancillary to the dominant element when packaged together. This is because these parts of the supply are not aims in themselves. They are included so that New Bank can better enjoy the dominant element of the supply of marketing and promotional services. It is also helpful to consider the essential purpose of the transaction between New Bank and Electronics Ltd, namely, the provision of a single package of marketing and promotional services. It would not be reasonable to sever the elements of the transaction into separate supplies. 102. In this situation there is a single composite, taxable supply of marketing and promotional services. The GST treatment of the dominant element of the supply (marketing and promotional services) is a taxable supply at the standard rate. Therefore, the ancillary or incidental supplies are also taxable at the standard rate. Example 7 – Treatment of transitional services supplied as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) 103. “QB 12/07: Goods and Services Tax – Treatment of Transitional Services Supplied as Part of the Sale of a Business (that Includes the Supply of Land)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 65 provides an example of the application of the principles set out in this Interpretation Statement. 104. QB 12/07 considers whether transitional services provided by the vendor as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) will be part of a single composite supply and therefore zero-rated for GST purposes where:  the services and the sale of the business form part of the same contractual arrangement, and  the services are not provided for a separately identifiable consideration. 105. The examples consider two fact scenarios. The first scenario is where the vendor provides basic transitional services as part of the sale of the business. The vendor agrees to be onsite for a week from the day of transfer to show the purchaser how the business operates, to answer any questions that the purchaser has and to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business. 20 Unclassified 106. In this situation there is a single composite, zero-rated supply of a business that includes land. The dominant element of the agreement is the supply of the business (including land). The services are not extensive and are provided for only a short period of time. Further, the nature of the services is to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business to the purchaser. Consequently, the services provided are ancillary and incidental to the supply of the business. They do not constitute an aim in themselves, but rather are a means for the purchaser to better enjoy the supply of the business. 107. The second scenario is where the vendor provides extensive transitional services as part of the sale of the business. The vendor agrees to manage the business for the purchaser for an initial period of 12 months. 108. In this situation there are two separate supplies - one of the land/business and one of transitional services. The transitional services are relatively extensive and are provided over a 12 month period. They are an aim in themselves for the purchaser who requires someone to run the business on an on-going basis. The fact that the services are not provided for a separately identifiable consideration is not determinative. The supply of these transitional services should be standard-rated, as ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24) do not apply. 109.

Different types of expenditure can be incurred on a resource consent. This Interpretation Statement focuses on expenditure that is the “cost” of a resource consent. The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) places a number of restrictions on the way people can use land and resources. Resource consents granted by a consenting authority (usually the local or regional council) remove these restrictions. Various types of resource consents can be obtained under the RMA. However, for tax purposes the Act recognises two categories of resource consents, which this statement refers to as: • “environmental” consents; and • “land” consents. Environmental consents are consents granted under ss 12–15 of the RMA (excluding reclamation consents) and listed in sch 14 of the Act as items of depreciable intangible property. These consents broadly concern resources and the environment. Land consents broadly concern activities on land and are granted under ss 9 and 11 of the RMA (including reclamation consents). These are not included in sch 14. This statement discusses whether deductions for the expenditure incurred in obtaining environmental and land consents are available and on what basis. The tax treatment depends on the particular facts and not all expenditure can be deducted or otherwise depreciated. This statement addresses deductibility of expenditure on resource consents in the following order: • Expenditure that is feasibility expenditure (see \[107\]–\[111\]); • Expenditure on revenue account (see \[112\]–\[117\]); • Expenditure that is deductible under a specific provision of the Act: - s DB 19 (\[119\]–\[122\]) for expenditure incurred in unsuccessful consents; - s DB 46 (\[123\]–\[129\]) for expenditure in controlling pollution; • Expenditure that is capital in nature that may give rise to depreciation: - Environmental consents can be depreciable intangible property (see \[131\]–\[154\]); - Capital expenditure on some land consents might be depreciable in two ways. Firstly, a land consent may be depreciable as an item of depreciable intangible property. The Commissioner considers that this would be rare. Secondly, and more commonly, expenditure on some land consents may be capitalised into the cost base of another item of property and potentially depreciated (although there is no depreciation deduction for land, and buildings with an estimated useful life (EUL) of 50 years or more depreciate at 0%). See \[176\]–\[194\]. The ways expenditure on resource consents may be deductible are summarised in the flowcharts following paragraph \[105\]. Flowchart 1 is for environmental consents and Flowchart 2 covers land consents. Because the tax treatment is so fact-specific, taxpayers can use the flowcharts to identify the parts of the statement that are most relevant to their situation. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 3 IN CONFIDENCE Summary This statement considers the tax treatment of the costs of obtaining a resource consent. The ability to deduct or depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure and the type of consent. It is necessary to understand the different types of resource consents for tax purposes and to be able to identify what expenditure is included in the cost base of the resource consent (or another asset) for depreciation purposes. These key concepts and a discussion of Trustpower Limited v CIR \[2016\] NZSC 91 are covered in Part One of this statement. The tax treatment varies depending on the circumstances and Part Two of this statement considers the specific situations in which expenditure on resource consents may be deductible or depreciable. Summary – Part One The different types of resource consent The RMA places a number of restrictions on the way people can use land and resources. Various types of resource consents can be obtained under the RMA to remove these restrictions. However, for tax purposes the Act recognises two categories of resource consents, which this statement refers to as: • “environmental” consents – that broadly concern the environment and are granted under ss 12–15 of the RMA (excluding reclamation consents) and are listed in sch 14(10); and • “land” consents – that broadly concern land and are granted under ss 9 or 11 of the RMA (or are a reclamation consent) and are not listed in sch 14(10). The different natures of the consents affect the tax treatment of the expenditure. In terms of depreciation, environmental consents are items of depreciable intangible property and the expenditure that forms the cost base can be depreciated over the fixed term of the consent. Land consents are generally of unlimited duration and will not usually be depreciable property. Expenditure on land consents can usually only be depreciated to the extent that the expenditure can be capitalised into the cost of another item of depreciable property. No depreciation deduction is available for any expenditure capitalised into the cost base of: • land; or • buildings (with an EUL of 50 years or more). Identifying “cost” for a resource consent Determining the cost base of a resource consent Working out the amount of expenditure on a resource consent that is depreciable involves identifying the “cost” in s EE 16. Relevant is s EE 16(4)(b)(ii), which says the cost is the cost to the person, excluding expenditure that can be deducted under another provision of the Act. Accordingly, the following are excluded from being a “cost” of a resource consent for depreciation purposes: • Expenditure that is revenue in nature and deductible on that basis. • Expenditure that is deductible under the principles in IS 17/01: “Income tax – deductibility of feasibility expenditure” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3, April 2017) (referred to as IS 17/01 in this statement). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Expenditure otherwise deductible under a specific provision (examples may include legal fees deductible under s DB 62 and land leasing costs deductible under s DB 18). The legislation is of limited assistance in identifying cost but a number of cases have considered the meaning of cost. The Court of Appeal adopted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition, being “that which must be given in order to acquire something” (Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 and similarly Wilke v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,923). The Court also considered that transactions should be viewed in their commercial reality and that “cost” has a wider meaning than payment on purchase. For the purposes of the depreciation rules, cost includes the set-up and installation costs of an asset (BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT 8 AITR 113). However, cost is fixed at the point the asset is ready to use. The exceptions to this are subsequent costs that can be added to the cost base of property under ss EE 18, EE 19 and EE 37. Where “cost” is unclear, courts have derived assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as accepted accountancy practice (CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327 and BP Refinery). Relevant to resource consents are accounting standards NZ IAS 16 and NZ IAS 38. Both include the same principle that for expenditure to be part of the cost, it must be directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating. The accounting standards also suggest that something as integral to the construction of an asset as a resource consent should be capitalised into the cost of the asset for accounting purposes. The types of expenditure incurred in obtaining a resource consent will vary greatly from case to case and what is a “cost” of a resource consent will ultimately be a question of fact. The different meanings of “cost” depending on the context and the factual circumstances make it impossible to cover what the “cost” will be in each situation. This statement focuses on expenditure on resource consents and provides general principles to assist taxpayers in identifying whether expenditure forms part of the cost base of a resource consent depreciable under sch 14 or part of the cost base of other depreciable property. Trustpower v CIR Trustpower is the leading authority concerning some aspects of the tax treatment of expenditure on resource consents. The Commissioner considers that Trustpower supports the view that: • Resource consent expenditure is usually on capital account. • There is limited scope for feasibility expenditure in the context of applying for a resource consent. • Consents within sch 14 (ie, environmental consents) are depreciable intangible property. This means that capital expenditure that is a cost of the property can be depreciated over the fixed life of the consent. • Sometimes expenditure on resource consents will be part of the cost of other property, which may be depreciable property. Summary – Part Two Having discussed the concepts in Part One of the statement, Part Two considers the situations in which expenditure on resource consents may be deductible or depreciable. The tax treatment of a particular consent depends on the facts and not all expenditure will be able to be deducted or otherwise depreciated. Part Two follows the structure of the two flowcharts (one flowchart addresses environmental consents and one flowchart addresses IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 5 IN CONFIDENCE land consents) and addresses deductibility of expenditure on resource consents in the following order: • Expenditure that is deductible under the principles in IS 17/01. • Expenditure that is revenue in nature. • Expenditure that is deductible under a specific provision of the Act, in particular: - s DB 19 for expenditure incurred in unsuccessful consents; - s DB 46 for expenditure in controlling pollution. • Capital expenditure on environmental consents will be depreciable if the environmental consent is depreciable intangible property. • Capital expenditure on land consents might be depreciable in two ways. Firstly, a land consent may be depreciable as an item of depreciable intangible property. The Commissioner considers that this would be rare. Secondly, and more commonly, expenditure on some land consents may be capitalised into the cost base of another item of property and potentially depreciated (although there is no depreciation deduction for land, and buildings with an EUL of 50 years or more depreciate at 0%). The deductibility of expenditure is subject to the general permission under s DA 1(1). For resource consent expenditure to be either deductible or depreciable, a sufficient relationship or nexus must exist between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income- earning activity. Whether a business or an income-earning activity is being carried on is always a question of fact and degree. For some taxpayers, resource consent expenditure will not be deductible or depreciable because it will have been incurred preliminary to, or preparatory to, the commencement of a business or income-earning activity. Deciding when a taxpayer ceases incurring expenditure that is preliminary or preparatory to the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity and commences incurring expenditure during the course or conduct of a business or an income-earning activity is often difficult to determine. The principles to apply to determine when a business or income-earning activity commences are discussed in more detail at paragraphs \[29\]–\[98\] of IS 17/01. Also, any expenditure on resource consents for private purposes will not satisfy s DA 1 (or s EE 6) as the expenditure will not be incurred in deriving assessable income (and will also be denied by the private limitation in s DA 2(2)). Feasibility expenditure deductible under the principles in IS 17/01 and Trustpower The Commissioner has previously set out her views on the deductibility of what might be labelled “feasibility expenditure” in IS 17/01: “Income tax – deductibility of feasibility expenditure”. To the extent that taxpayers have incurred such expenditure they should refer to the principles in IS 17/01 and Trustpower. The Supreme Court in Trustpower considered that expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments may be deductible but this does not extend to costs incurred with the intention of materially advancing the capital project in question. When it comes to applying for a particular resource consent, the expenditure will often be directed to a specific capital asset or towards making tangible progress on a specific capital asset. If that is the case, then the expenditure will not be deductible under the principles in IS 17/01 and Trustpower. Revenue expenditure Applying the principles in Trustpower, the Commissioner considers that resource consents will generally be capital in nature because resource consents will usually relate to the business structure and provide an enduring advantage. Although usually capital in nature, IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 6 IN CONFIDENCE the Supreme Court in Trustpower recognised that in some cases expenditure associated with resource consents could be revenue in nature. The example provided by the Supreme Court was where the resource consent forms part of the stock-in-trade of a land- developer/speculator. In this case the costs of obtaining the consent are on revenue account and deductible under s DA 1 and s DB 23 (under s DB 23 special timing provisions apply). Deductions under specific provisions of the Act Deductions are also available under certain specific provisions in the Act, for instance s DB 62 allows a deduction for legal expenses under $10,000. Also, some types of expenditure, such as petroleum mining expenditure and mineral mining expenditure, have their own regimes. This statement focuses specifically on ss DB 19 and DB 46 as they are the most relevant to resource consents. Section DB 19 allows a deduction (for what would otherwise be “black hole” expenditure) where money is spent on a consent but the consent is never granted or used. However, a deduction is only allowed to the extent that the expenditure would have been deductible or depreciable had the consent been granted or used. If the expenditure was a cost of an environmental consent it is likely to be deductible under s DB 19. This is because the expenditure would have been depreciable as the cost of an item of depreciable intangible property. For expenditure on a land consent, it depends on the depreciation outcome. To be deductible under s DB 19, the expenditure must be able to be capitalised to an item of depreciable property and be depreciable. Section DB 46 provides a deduction for expenditure incurred in pollution control. To qualify under s DB 46, the expenditure must be listed in parts A and B of sch 19 and not otherwise deductible under another provision in the Act. Practically, this leaves limited scope for a deduction for resource consent expenditure, but an example of where this may arise is where a land consent is obtained for earthworks to remove contaminated soil. Environmental consents depreciable as depreciable intangible property If the expenditure is not deductible under another provision it may be able to be depreciated as a cost of depreciable property. Section EE 1 sets out when a person has an amount of depreciation loss and requires that the person owns the depreciable property and it is used or available for use by the person. Assuming that is the case, s EE 6 defines depreciable property as property that might reasonably be expected to decline in value while available for use in deriving assessable income. The nexus requirement is discussed above in the context of s DA 1, but it is important to note that there is no deduction where the resource consent is obtained for private purposes or prior to the commencement of the business or income-earning activity. Section EE 6(3) describes when intangible property (such as resource consents) will be depreciable property. The crucial requirement is that the property comes within the definition of depreciable intangible property in s EE 62. Section EE 62 restricts depreciable intangible property to the items listed in sch 14. Environmental consents are depreciable intangible property as they are listed in sch 14(10). But for their inclusion in sch 14, environmental consents might be considered inseparable from the asset to which they relate. However, the impact of sch 14 is that environmental consents are treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes and their costs cannot be capitalised into another asset. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 7 IN CONFIDENCE Assuming an environmental consent meets the requirements of ss EE 1 and EE 6, it is an item of depreciable intangible property and the cost can be depreciated over its life using the straight-line method (s EE 12(2)(b)(ii)). For environmental consents, this means expenditure on the application, administrative fees under s 36 of the RMA, legal fees (not deductible under s DB 62) in relation to the consent, hearing costs and expenditure on preparing and compiling the assessment of environmental effects are likely to all be part of the cost of the resource consent and depreciable over its fixed life. Whether other expenditure is depreciable as a cost of the consent is a question of fact. For instance, engineering and civil design reports may have been commissioned solely to address a crucial issue relevant to the resource application, in which case the expenditure will be directly attributable to the resource consent. In other circumstances such reports might be a cost directly attributable to the construction of the resulting tangible asset. Where the expenditure is directly attributable to more than one item of property, the expenditure should form part of the cost base of the items on a basis that is appropriate in the circumstances. Land consent expenditure capitalised into other depreciable property Land consents (unlike environmental consents) are not listed as items of depreciable intangible property under sch 14. Consequently, they are neither depreciable intangible property under s EE 62 nor depreciable property under s EE 6(3). An exception exists for land consents that are a right to use land under sch 14(5). However, the Commissioner considers these will only arise in exceptional circumstances because the consent will have to have a finite useful life (the statutory default in s 123 of the RMA is they have an infinite life) and be a right to use land within sch 14. To be a right to use land under sch 14 it must be a right to use exercised independently from the rights of ownership (ANZCO Foods Ltd v CIR \[2016\] NZHC 1015, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-049, Trustees in the CB Simkin Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,001, Trustees of the CB Simkin Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,117). Where a land consent is not a right to use land under sch 14(5), expenditure on a land consent can only be depreciated to the extent that it can be capitalised to the cost base of another item of depreciable property. When changes were made to include environmental consents in sch 14, the intention was that, for depreciation purposes, the cost of land consents that pertain to the erection of a structure should be included in the cost of the structure. A similar intention was also evident in subsequent changes to (what is now) s DB 19. The section was specifically amended to more clearly allow deductions for both resource consents that were depreciable in their own right (ie, environmental consents) and as part of other depreciable property. From s DB 19 it can be inferred that Parliament’s intention is to allow resource consent expenditure to be capitalised into the cost of another item of depreciable property. To the extent that expenditure is a cost of another item of depreciable property, it can be depreciated. Where the expenditure is directly attributable to more than one item of property, the expenditure should form part of the cost base of the items on a basis that is appropriate in the circumstances. There will be no deduction when the land consent is capitalised into the cost of land and a 0% depreciation deduction for buildings with an EUL of 50 years or more. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 8 IN CONFIDENCE Part One – Key concepts The ability to deduct or depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of consent. It is necessary to understand the different types of resource consents for tax purposes. Some resource consents are depreciable intangible property and depreciable as a stand-alone asset. Some resource consents may be capitalised into the cost of another asset and depreciated as part of that asset. Once the type of resource consent is identified, it is then necessary to identify what expenditure is included in the cost base of the resource consent (or another asset) for depreciation purposes. These key concepts as they relate to deductibility of expenditure on resource consents must be understood against the background of the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower Limited v CIR \[2016\] NZSC 91. Part One of this statement addresses: • different types of resource consents; • the meaning of “cost”; and • Trustpower v CIR. Different types of resource consents The different types of consents are identified in s 87 of the RMA, but for tax purposes resource consents can be divided into two groups depending on whether they are items of depreciable intangible property listed in sch 14. The first group includes those resource consents not in sch 14. Consents issued under ss 9 and 11 of the RMA, along with reclamation consents, all broadly concern land. They are referred to as “land consents”. These consents are characterised as follows: • Section 9 of the RMA provides for a restriction on the use of land that contravenes national environmental standards, a regional rule or a district rule. • Section 11 of the RMA provides a restriction on subdivisions. Under s 218 of the RMA the definition of subdivision is wider than the common meaning of dividing a section of land into separate titles. For instance, the definition includes the grant of certain leases. • Reclamation consents are a subset of ss 12–14 of the RMA consents. These are specifically excluded from being depreciable intangible property and so are grouped with ss 9 and 11 of the RMA consents. Reclamation consents concern permanent changes to land and are more like land consents than ss 12–15 of the RMA consents. The second group includes those resource consents in sch 14. Resource consents issued under ss 12–15 of the RMA broadly concern resources and the environment and are referred to as “environmental consents”: • Section 12 restricts the use of coastal marine areas. • Section 13 restricts certain uses of beds of lakes or rivers. • Section 14 provides restrictions relating to water. • Sections 15, 15A, and 15B restrict the discharge of contaminants; this includes various scenarios involving discharges, dumping and incineration. The RMA treats these two types of consents differently: • Land consents are of unlimited duration unless specified otherwise (s 123), are usually attached to the relevant land and can be enjoyed by the owners and occupiers of the land (s 134). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 9 IN CONFIDENCE • Environmental consents have a 5–35-year life span (s 123) and can be transferred (ss 135–137). The default position is land consents are granted for an unlimited duration but the consent can specify a 5–35-year period. Land consents may be for a limited duration where they are issued for short-term activities such as concert performances (for excessive noise levels), carnivals on the beach (for exclusive occupation of space) and flea markets in car parks (where they involve the construction of structures that require resource consent). Time-limited consents may also be required for temporary events, such as the America’s Cup or British and Irish Lions rugby events. Despite having a finite or infinite life, consents can lapse (if they are unused), be cancelled or surrendered (ss 125, 126, and 138 of the RMA). The consent can also be changed. Section 127 of the RMA allows the consent holder to apply to change or cancel conditions attaching to a consent. The RMA also sets out the process for obtaining resource consents. The exact process and the cost will vary greatly depending on the circumstances. If the consent is “notified”, the process can involve advertising, seeking submissions, pre-hearing meetings, a formal hearing, a formal decision and even mediation. Where an application is not notified or subject to limited notification, the process is less arduous. In addition, the RMA allows a right of appeal so there may be litigation and further appeals after an initial decision. The meaning of “cost” For the purposes of determining the amount that is depreciable, it is necessary to determine the cost of the resource consent. There is very little assistance in the legislation as to what constitutes “cost”. The term “cost” is used repeatedly in the Act but is not defined for depreciation purposes. The current depreciation regime was based on the Valabh Committee’s recommendations. The summary to Chapter 1 of the Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (February 1991) concluded that it was not possible to apply a general costing rule or definition to the entire Act because cost concepts are only capable of definition in a particular context. Case law also recognises “cost” is capable of variable meanings and of longer or narrower construction according to the subject matter and circumstances of the particular case (Wilke v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,923 citing PM Scientific Fur Cleaners Ltd v Home Insurance Co (1970) 12 DLR (3d) 177, 184). The Commissioner has published several items on the meaning of “cost” in particular circumstances, including: • IS 10/06: “Deductibility of business relocation costs” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 8 (September 2010)); • QB 15/13: “Income tax – whether the cost of acquiring an option to acquire revenue account land is deductible” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 1 (February 2016)); • BR Pub 09/08: “Cost price of the vehicle” – meaning of the term for fringe benefit tax purposes” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 1 (February 2010)); and • IS 17/05: “Income tax – treatment of New Zealand patents” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 6 (July 2017)). When dealing with resource consents, the Commissioner considers the following principles are key: IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 10 IN CONFIDENCE • Cost includes that which must be given in order to acquire something. A transaction should be viewed in its commercial reality and it is possible to look at business practice and accepted accounting standards. • Cost includes expenses incurred in having an asset installed and ready to use but cost is fixed once the asset is capable of being used. • Cost includes subsequent expenditure after this point only to the extent that it is allowed under the Act; see ss EE 19 and EE 37. • Cost does not include all expenditure associated with the asset where it does not satisfy one of the above principles. Cost includes that which must be given in order to acquire something The definition of cost as “that which must be given in order to acquire something” comes from case law, notably Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA). In Tasman Forestry the taxpayer was allowed a deduction for the cost of certain forestry assets against profits or gains derived from the sale of timber. The Court of Appeal was concerned with determining the cost of the forestry assets acquired. The Court of Appeal adopted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition, being “that which must be given in order to acquire something”. The Court also stated that “cost” has a wider meaning than payment on purchase, and the fact that determination of cost may require a valuation exercise does not mean there is no cost. Further, the Court stated that the taxpayer’s submission that cost is to be equated with economic sacrifice was “perhaps too wide in an absolute sense”. The Court of Appeal also noted at 15,157: \[37\] We consider the correct course is not to dissect the transactions by which the forests were acquired, but to view them in their commercial reality. As the Judge found, the shares were purchased as the means for, and with the intention of, acquiring the forests. For practical purposes the cost to Tasman in acquiring the forests was the amount paid for the company shares which gave access to the forest assets. The appropriate proportion of that cost is to be treated as the cost of the timber. \[Emphasis added\] In CIR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327 the High Court also considered the realities of the situation when determining what was meant by cost. The issue in that case was the value of fringe benefits provided by the taxpayer to its employees. The legislation provided that the value of the benefits was to be determined based on the “cost” of the benefits to the taxpayer. The taxpayer argued that this cost did not include the GST component of the relevant expenditure, because ultimately the taxpayer was able to recover that component by claiming input tax deductions. The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer being able to claim back the GST component did not change the fact that the GST component was part of the cost incurred. The High Court found for the taxpayer and considered that the approach suggested by the Commissioner was unduly restrictive and would not give effect to the realities of the situation (at \[738\]). The Court also had regard to the evidence given by two accountants as to the commonly held commercial understanding of the word “cost”. The Court observed that where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, the Court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. The relevant accounting standards in New Zealand are NZ IAS 16 (where the expenditure is capitalised into a tangible item of depreciable property) and NZ IAS 38 (where the expenditure is a cost of an item of depreciable intangible property). When determining IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 11 IN CONFIDENCE whether an asset that incorporates both intangible and tangible elements should be dealt with under NZ IAS 16 or NZ IAS 38, the accounting standards say taxpayers should use judgement to assess which element is “more significant”. Clause 10 of NZ IAS 16 includes in cost the costs initially incurred to construct an item. Clauses 16 to 22A discuss the elements of cost and particularly relevant are: 16. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises: (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates. (b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. (c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period. 17. Examples of directly attributable costs are: (a) costs of employee benefits (as defined in NZ IAS 19 Employee Benefits) arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment; (b) costs of site preparation; (c) initial delivery and handling costs; (d) installation and assembly costs; (e) costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, after deducting the net proceeds from selling any items produced while bringing the asset to that location and condition (such as samples produced when testing equipment); and (f) professional fees. \[Emphasis added\] Reading clauses 16 and 17 of NZ IAS 16 together suggests that something as integral to the construction of an asset as a resource consent should be capitalised into the cost of the asset for accounting purposes. NZ IAS 38 is broadly similar and includes the same principle that cost must be directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating. For instance, clause 34 (cost of separately acquired intangible assets) includes “any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use” and clause 64 (cost of an internally generated intangible asset) includes “all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.” Accordingly, “cost” is that which must be given in order to acquire the asset. However, a transaction must be viewed in its commercial reality, and assistance may be derived from common business practice or accepted accounting practice. Cost includes expenditure incurred having the asset installed and ready to use In the Australian case BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT 8 AITR 113, Kitto J made the following comments in the context of a discussion of what items were to be included in the cost of an asset for depreciation purposes: ...in my opinion, the word “cost” in section 56(1)(b) bears the meaning which it has in the business life of the community. It seems to me impossible to suppose that the depreciation provisions of the Act are intended to apply only to those simple cases in which the ascertainment of cost is a purely arithmetical process. I interpret it as embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject-matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for his use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. (p. 117) IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 12 IN CONFIDENCE \[Emphasis added\] Kitto J considered that cost has the meaning it has in the business life of the community and that accepted accountancy practice can be used to interpret “cost”. This meant the cost included having the property installed and ready for use for the purpose of producing assessable income. Similarly, in IRC v Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd \[1969\] 1 All ER 732, the House of Lords considered that expenditure that had to be incurred before a capital item could be made available for use was part of the cost of the item and was, therefore, capital expenditure. The issue was whether the cost of excavation, which was necessary to enable a dock at a shipping yard to be built, was capital expenditure. Lord Reid commented: So the question is whether, if the dock is plant, the cost of making room for it is expenditure on the provision of the plant for the purposes of the trade of the dock owner. In my view this can include more than the plant itself because plant cannot be said to have been provided for the purposes of trade until it is installed: until then it is of no use for the purposes of trade. This plant, the dock, could not even be made until the necessary excavating had been done. All the commissioners say in refusing this part of the claim is that this expenditure was too remote from the provision of the dry dock. There, I think, they misdirected themselves. If the cost of the provision of plant can include more than the cost of the plant itself, I do not see how expenditure which must be incurred before the plant can be provided, can be too remote. (p. 741) \[Emphasis added\] “Cost” for depreciation is restricted to the initial cost of an item The scheme of the Act, BP Refinery and Barclay Curle indicate that cost is fixed at the point the property is set up and ready to use. At this point the cost is fixed (with some exceptions discussed below) and IS 10/06: “Deductibility of business relocation costs”, provides the Commissioner’s view on this at \[131\]: In the Commissioner’s view the term “cost” as it is used in the depreciation rules is effectively restricted to the initial cost of an item of depreciable property. Case law and commercial practice dictate that included in the initial cost are set-up and installation costs. However, the scheme of the depreciation rules seems to prevent any costs incurred subsequent to the initial setting up of the item from coming within the “cost” of that item unless they qualify under sections EE 18 and EE 19 (variations to cost) or section EE 37 (improvements). If subsequent costs can be implicitly added to the cost of an item of depreciable property it becomes difficult to understand the need for sections EE 19 and EE 37 in the depreciation rules. Subsequent expenditure added to the cost under ss EE 19 and EE 37 Although cost is fixed, it is possible to add additional costs under ss EE 19 or EE 37. Section EE 19 applies to fixed life intangible property. Additional costs can be added to depreciable tangible property if there is an improvement under s EE 37. For intangible property, it will generally be appropriate to use the specific provision of s EE 19 rather than the more general provision of s EE 37. Section EE 19 allows additional costs incurred to be added to the cost of fixed life intangible property for the purposes of the formula in s EE 16: EE 19 Cost: fixed life intangible property When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a person owns an item of fixed life intangible property; and (b) the person incurs additional costs in an income year for the item; and IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 13 IN CONFIDENCE (c) the person is denied a deduction for the additional costs other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. ... Additional costs for fixed life intangible property (2) For the purposes of the formula in section EE 16, the item’s cost at the start of the income year is treated as being the total of— (a) the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (b) the additional costs the person incurs. While “additional costs” are not defined, there is guidance in some of the supporting materials. Section EE 19 was originally added in 1997 as ss EG 2(3) and EG 8 to the Income Tax Act 1994 as part of the review of the depreciation rules. The focus in the Commentary to the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill 1997 (and echoed in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 12 (November 1997)) is renewal fees and the example used is where an option to renew is exercised and money is paid to extend the life of the intangible property. The Commentary notes the specific issue the amendment is addressing: When a taxpayer incurs additional capital costs during the life of a FLIP, the current mechanism results in part of those costs being deductible only on disposal of the asset. This will generally occur if a taxpayer has a right or contract that may be renewed conditional on the payment of pre- determined fees. The legal life of property includes any such period of renewal. Despite this, s EE 19 is drafted widely and the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th Edition, 2011) defines “additional” as: extra or supplementary to what is already present or available. “Cost” is that which must be given in order to acquire something (Tasman). Based on its plain and natural meaning, “additional costs” are expenditure (or value) extra or supplementary to that already given in order to acquire something. It might be argued that “additional cost” should be interpreted to mean any subsequent expenditure relating to the asset. The Commissioner does not agree with this interpretation. The Commissioner considers that additional costs will usually only apply to expenditure that is an improvement to the asset. Therefore, expenditure incurred after the asset is ready to use and which does not result in an improved asset will not be additional costs. Some expenditure will not be a cost of the asset Not all expenditure that is associated with an asset will be a cost of that asset. The reasons that expenditure might not be part of the cost base of an asset include the following: • It is deductible elsewhere in the Act (eg, it is revenue expenditure). • It is incurred after the cost of the asset has been fixed. • It is a cost directly attributable to another item of property for depreciation purposes. Section EE 16(4)(b)(ii) states that when a person uses a straight-line method to calculate their loss, the item’s cost excludes expenditure for which the person is allowed a deduction under a provision outside subpart EE. This means the following types of expenditure are not part of the cost of an asset for depreciation purposes: • Expenditure that is revenue in nature and deductible on that basis. • Expenditure that is feasibility expenditure and deductible under the principles in IS 17/01. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 14 IN CONFIDENCE • Expenditure otherwise deductible under a specific provision. “Cost” of a resource consent Having identified the two different types of resource consents and how to determine an asset’s cost, the next step is to consider what types of expenditure form the cost base for a resource consent. This is relevant because it is the “cost” of a resource consent that will be depreciable. Cost includes that which must be given in order to acquire a resource consent Whether expenditure is a cost of the resource consent depends on the facts. Expenditure on the application and administrative fees under s 36 of the RMA is incurred to obtain the resource consent and will be a cost of the consent. Expenditure on legal and hearing costs is also likely to be a cost of the consent. Schedule 4 of the RMA sets out the information required in an application for resource consent. This includes an assessment of environmental effects and schedule 4 also prescribes the information this assessment must include and the matters it must address. Expenditure incurred in compiling the information, reports and strategies for the purposes of the application will generally be part of the cost of the resource consent. This could include expenditure on resource monitoring, environmental investigations, engineering reports and the development of mitigation strategies for adverse environmental effects. On larger projects, consultation will often be a necessary step in the process of applying for resource consent. Expenditure on public awareness campaigns, public meetings, mail drops, media releases and consultation with affected persons including iwi, may all be part of the cost of the resource consent. It depends on the particular facts, but all of this expenditure may need to be incurred to acquire a resource consent. Cost includes expenditure having the asset installed and ready to use Case law and commercial practice allow expenditure incurred in having an asset installed and in getting it ready to use, to be added to the cost base of an asset. It is generally easier to identify this type of expenditure for tangible assets than it is for intangible assets. For example, it is usually straightforward to identify installation and setup costs for an item of depreciable plant. There appears to be less scope for this type of expenditure on an intangible asset because: • The nature of fixed life intangible assets is that they will start to depreciate at the point in time when the asset’s life span begins to reduce. Once obtained it will usually be “available to use” (the requirement in s EE 1(2)(c)) and depreciable. Once an item is available to use, the cost of the item is fixed, and it is too late to add subsequent costs to the cost base (outside of the provisions of the Act). • Unlike tangible assets, there is unlikely to be any element of installation. However, there is still some scope to incur expenditure that would be a cost of getting the resource consent ready to use. This seems most likely to arise where the consent has been granted but has not commenced. Under the RMA, a consent does not commence until s 116 is satisfied. There are a number of situations where commencement may be delayed, for instance when the grant of the consent is appealed. Until the resource consent commences it will neither be available for use nor capable of depreciating in value (because its fixed life is not diminishing). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 15 IN CONFIDENCE If a resource consent is subject to a condition that must be fulfilled before the consent commences then this expenditure, although incurred after the consent has been granted, may be a cost of getting the resource consent ready to use. In these circumstances the expenditure should be added to the cost base of the resource consent. Following commencement, a condition will not usually be enough to prevent a resource consent being available to use. Under s 108 of the RMA, councils have very wide powers to impose conditions on resource consents. However, the conditions imposed must still be reasonable and a condition cannot be a condition precedent to the granting of the consent. For more information on conditions, see IS 08/03: “Resource consent application fees and provision of works, provisions of information and transfer of land as conditions of resource consent – GST treatment”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 8 (September/October 2008). Although non-compliance with a condition may eventually lead to some level of enforcement, it will not usually stop the consent from being available to use. Once a resource consent is available to use, any expenditure incurred on meeting the conditions of the consent will not be a cost of the consent unless s EE 19 or s EE 37 applies. Subsequent expenditure added to the cost under ss EE 19 Environmental consents are fixed life intangible property and s EE 19 allows additional costs incurred to be added to the cost of fixed life intangible property for depreciation purposes. In the context of a resource consent, the consent will already have been acquired. To be an “additional cost” of the depreciable resource consent, the expenditure needs to be acquiring something more in relation to the consent, such as an enhancement or improvement to the resource consent by amending an onerous condition. For the purposes of environmental consents, “additional costs” will likely include expenditure incurred under ss 125, 126 and 127 of the RMA to make changes to the consent and its terms. Expenditure incurred on the conditions attaching to a resource consent will not usually be part of the cost base of a resource consent as the expenditure will be incurred after the cost base is fixed. The only way this can be included is if it is an “additional cost” under s EE 19. Expenditure on meeting the conditions attached to a granted environmental consent will generally not be an additional cost under s EE 19 because to be a “cost”, the expenditure must be given to acquire “something”. In this case, the “something” (being the resource consent) has already been obtained. Expenditure on satisfying conditions will often be directed at other assets or purposes distinct from the consent itself and may still be deductible, for example, it might be revenue expenditure or a cost of another item of depreciable property. For instance, a resource consent may be subject to a condition requiring the consent holder to build a retaining wall. Expenditure incurred on removing or modifying conditions is an additional cost under s EE 19 as it enhances or improves the resource consent – something additional in respect of the consent is obtained. Section EE 37 is broadly similar to s EE 19 as it allows additional expenditure on improvements to be added to the cost of an item of depreciable property. Given s EE 19 specifically deals with intangible property the statutory interpretation principle that the specific provision overrides the general provision means that s EE 19 should be used when dealing with resource consents. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 16 IN CONFIDENCE Example 1 XYZ Quarries obtains an environmental consent for a new quarry. However, a downturn in construction and competition from overseas mean the site is dormant and the consent is never used. Nearly five years later market conditions change, and the quarry becomes viable. Because the unused consent is due to lapse (under s 125 of the RMA) the quarry owner applies to the local council under s 125 to extend the period. The costs associated with the application run to $12,000 as the quarry owner engages experts to provide reports on the market conditions and the effects of the extension on the district plan. The $12,000 is an additional cost under s EE 19 and can be added to the cost of the existing consent and depreciated as part of the cost of the resource consent. The expenditure is capital in nature and incurred under the RMA to secure an extension to the terms of the consent. Expenditure directly attributable to multiple items Where expenditure is directly attributable to more than one item of property, the expenditure should form part of the cost base of the items on a basis that is appropriate in the circumstances. Where the expenditure serves two or more objects indifferently and dissection is impractical, then it must be apportioned on a fair and reasonable basis. It is impossible to prescribe any precise formula applicable to all cases because the circumstances of the particular case will usually determine the most appropriate way of deciding how to apportion an amount. However, the case law says the apportionment must be fair, not arbitrary, and must be done as a matter of fact (Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). In apportionment cases the onus of proof lies with the taxpayer (Buckley & Young). However, it is recognised that absolute precision cannot be expected and a reasonable estimate will be sufficient (Omihi Lime Co Ltd v CIR \[1964\] NZLR 731). Some fair and reasonable bases for apportionment may include (Buckley & Young): • the respective values of the advantages arising from the expenditure; and • where the advantages do not lend themselves to measurement, some particular part or fractional share of the total expenditure if the part or share can be established on the basis of sufficient evidence. The Commissioner will accept apportionment of the expenditure on a reasonable basis between the items of property. For instance, when applying for an environmental consent to develop a hydroelectric plant, the taxpayer will likely need designs for the turbine that will be placed into the water. If the designs are high-level drawings undertaken for the resource consent application, then it might be reasonable to allocate the full cost of these designs to the resource consent. On the other hand, if the designs are detailed engineering and construction plans that will be used to build the turbine, it may be reasonable to allocate the expenditure on the designs to the cost of the turbine and nothing to the resource consent. In other circumstances, the allocation of expenditure may not be so straightforward, and it will be necessary to apportion on a fair and reasonable basis. Examples of expenditure The Commissioner considers the following types of expenditure to be examples of expenditure that may be incurred in the resource consent process. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 17 IN CONFIDENCE Examples of expenditure on a resource consent • Resource monitoring • Land access o Licence fees for access to the land to enable the applicant to carry out resource monitoring and environmental studies • Consultation o Costs of determining who is affected o Public awareness campaigns including public meetings, mail drops, media releases o Public meetings and one-on-one meetings with affected parties to identify possible opposition and mitigation o Development of mitigation, including payments to affected parties o Consultation with iwi • Engineering and civil design necessary to support the resource consent application • Detailed environmental investigations to determine potential environmental effects and mitigations o Impact on flora and fauna o Archaeological and cultural impact o Social impact o Transport assessment • Other investigations necessary to support the application o Noise assessment o Dust assessment o Visual impact assessment o Economic impact o Surveys • Salaries and overheads of employees directly involved in the resource consent application and travel and accommodation connected to the consent process • Project management and legal support • Application and processing fees for consent application • Preparation of Assessment of Environmental Effects (AEE) • Peer review of engineering, civil and environmental studies • Preparation of evidence and submissions for consent hearing • Detailed financial and economic studies • Design and creation of areas to mitigate environmental effect • Development of other mitigation strategies for adverse environmental effects • Hearing costs of consent authority o Includes pre-application meetings, pre-hearing meetings and mediation o Payments to experts o Legal fees o Further environmental and engineering studies to provide responses to requests for further information by hearing authority • Consideration of hearing authorities’ decision and considering conditions of consents if granted • Appeal costs The expenses in the table are examples of the types of expenses that might be incurred in obtaining a resource consent. Whether a particular expense forms part of the cost base of IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 18 IN CONFIDENCE the resource consent depends on the facts (see discussion on “cost” from \[39\] onwards). For instance, expenditure on legal fees may be expenditure that can be deducted under s DB 62 rather than treated as a cost of the consent. Also, engineering reports may be a cost of the resulting item of plant, rather than a cost of the resource consent. Summary Whether expenditure is a cost of the depreciable resource consent depends on the facts. Case law defines cost as “that which must be given in order to acquire something” (Tasman Forestry). A transaction must be viewed in its commercial reality and assistance may be derived from common business practice or accepted accounting practice (which may involve considering whether the expenditure is directly attributable to a particular asset). For a resource consent, the cost is effectively restricted to the initial cost of an item of depreciable property. Case law and commercial practice allow set-up costs to get an asset ready to use to be included in the asset’s cost. Whether expenditure is incurred in getting a resource consent ready to use is a question of fact. However, it would be unusual to incur any such expenditure once the period for which the consent has been granted has commenced. Although, it may still be possible to add further expenditure to the cost of a resource consent after the cost is fixed under s EE 19. Not all expenditure associated with a resource consent will form part of its cost base. For example, an expense may have been incurred as an ordinary incidence of business and is deductible under the general permission, in which case it will not be a cost of the consent. Alternatively, the expenditure may have been incurred on meeting a condition of the consent after the cost of the consent has been fixed, in which case it will not be a cost of the consent. Example 2 New Zealand Molluscs Ltd farms oysters for export. It has identified a sheltered harbour that would suit a pacific oyster farm. An environmental consent is obtained to place and use a number of inter-tidal racks within the harbour. When the consent is granted, there are a number of conditions, including the following: • Water quality must be tested regularly, and any change reported to the council. • All equipment used in the harbour must be cleaned regularly and checked for leaks. • A small area of hardstanding for a car park is required for company employees working at or visiting the site to avoid cars driving on to the beach and disturbing wildlife. Expenditure on meeting these conditions will not be a cost of the consent. Firstly, in terms of timing, the consent is available to be used and starts to depreciate as soon as it commences. At this point the cost has become fixed and the expenditure on the conditions is incurred too late to be a cost of the consent. The first two conditions relate to costs that are an ordinary incidence of doing business, and as such are revenue expenditure and deductible on that basis. The expenditure is recurring and does not result in an enduring capital benefit. Monitoring water quality and cleaning and maintaining equipment is an ordinary incidence of business for the company. The expenditure incurred in creating an area of hardstanding for a car park is a cost of the car park – not of the consent. This expenditure is depreciable as a cost of hardstanding under sch 13. There is also a condition requiring the tidal racks to be located at an exact height and position. However, the company subsequently discovers that the inter-tidal racks would be more productive if their position was altered. It applies under s 127 of the RMA to change the condition of the consent to allow it to re-position the inter-tidal racks. This expenditure is an additional cost under s EE 19 and must be added to the cost of the consent. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 19 IN CONFIDENCE Trustpower v CIR Before considering specific situations in which expenditure on resource consents may arise, this statement will address the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower. The case is the most recent authority concerning the tax treatment of expenditure on resource consents. Trustpower maintained a “development pipeline”, which consisted of over 200 possible electricity generating projects, not all of which would be carried through to completion. This case concerned four particular projects and in dispute was the deductibility of expenditure on applying for and obtaining resource consents. The total spent was approximately $17.7m. As a result of the expenditure, Trustpower had obtained resource consents (land use consents, water permits and discharge permits). Apart from some of the land use consents that were of an unlimited duration, the consents were for fixed periods (generally 10, 15 or 35 years). The projects were all in limbo and it was unclear whether they would be abandoned or advanced. Despite this, the Supreme Court thought it reasonable to suppose that the projects were still marketable and they noted that Trustpower had been approached about its willingness to sell two of them. The arguments were refined over the course of the hearings. In the High Court, Andrews J considered the expenditure was revenue in nature primarily because the resource consents were inseparable from what was considered to be revenue account property. Whether the consents were separate property was irrelevant to the approach of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, who both considered that the expenditure was capital in nature. The focus of Trustpower is fairly narrow but in the Commissioner’s view the following principles can be drawn from the litigation: • Resource consent expenditure is usually on capital account. • There is limited scope for deductible feasibility expenditure in the context of applying for a resource consent. (See IS 17/01). • Consents within sch 14 (ie, environmental consents) are depreciable intangible property. This means that capital expenditure that is a cost of the property can be depreciated over the fixed life of the consent. • Sometimes expenditure on resource consents will be part of the cost of other property, which may or may not be depreciable property. This statement will now discuss these principles as they are key to how resource consent expenditure is treated. Resource consent expenditure is usually on capital account The principles that need to be applied in determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue were comprehensively considered by the Courts in Trustpower. The principles identified included the following: • It is necessary to consider what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view (Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA)). • The contrast between the two forms of expenditure corresponds to the distinction between the costs of creating, establishing, acquiring or enlarging the permanent structure of a business (capital) and the costs of using the structure to earn income, or performing the income-earning operations (revenue) (Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines \[1964\] AC 948 (PC)). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 20 IN CONFIDENCE • The indicia discussed in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation for the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 224 (PC) can be used to assist in the determination, but they are not determinative in themselves. • In the end, the answer will depend on a close examination of the facts of the particular case and the character of the particular payment to ascertain the nature and purpose or effect of the relevant expenditure. Applying the principles and the approach of both the Court of Appeal (CIR v Trustpower Ltd (2015) 27 NZTC 22-010) and Supreme Court, expenditure on obtaining a resource consent will usually be capital in nature. The Court of Appeal set out the previous case law that supports this view (the Supreme Court also discussed these cases in a similar manner): \[82\] In both England and New Zealand expenditure incurred in obtaining resource consents and permissions has been held to be on capital and not revenue account: (a) In ECC Quarries Ltd v Watkis (Inspector of Quarries) Brightman J in the English High Court held that while the permissions for a quarry would not themselves produce profits the subsequent operations of working and winning the minerals, which were permitted by the consents, would. Therefore, the assets of the company had radically and enduringly changed when the permissions were granted, and on common sense principles and based on consideration of the authorities, the expenditure was of a capital nature. (b) In Waste Management New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue this Court indicated that expenditure incurred investigating the feasibility of a site as a landfill for disposing of industrial waste, designing the landfill and seeking the planning consents and water rights it needed was capital. (c) In Case T53 the New Zealand Taxation Review Authority (Judge Barber), with a brief reference to the decision in ECC Quarries Ltd, held that legal fees incurred in a successful appeal against the refusal of resource consents required to carry on a second-hand machinery business were not deductible on revenue account because the acquisition of the resource consent was an intangible asset of the objector’s business, a right \[sic\] of benefit and advantage that did not previously exist. (d) In Milburn New Zealand Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Wild J in the New Zealand High Court, relying on ECC Quarries Ltd, held that expenditure incurred in obtaining resource consents for Milburn’s quarries for sourcing aggregate and lime for its cement and concrete business was of a capital not revenue nature because it was a necessary part of the development of those quarries for production of materials for use in the taxpayer’s business. It was relatively clearly of a capital nature. \[footnotes omitted\] The Supreme Court recognised at \[29\] that expenditure associated with resource consents could be revenue. However, there is a legislative assumption that it will usually be capital: We agree with the Court of Appeal on this to the extent that we accept that there are circumstances in which expenditure associated with applications for resource consents are on revenue account. But both the explanatory note and the commentary are suggestive of a legislative understanding that such expenditure will usually be on capital account; thus the need for s DB 13B \[now s DB 19\]. The Court also made similar comments about the legislative assumption at \[49\]: Such assistance as can be derived for \[sic\] the statutory text is in favour of the Commissioner rather than Trustpower. This is by reason of the specific provisions \[ie, s EE 6, Schedule 14 and s DB 19\] of the 2004 and 2007 Acts as to (a) resource consents being depreciable property and (b) deductibility of expenses associated with failed or withdrawn resource consent applications and abandoned consents. These provisions suggest a legislative assumption that, in the absence of such provisions, resource consent expenditure is usually on capital account. \[Emphasis added\] The Supreme Court also provided an example of when expenditure on a resource consent will be revenue in footnote 21 of the decision: By way of example, resource consents may form part of the stock-in-trade of a land-developer/speculator and, if so, the costs of obtaining them are obviously on revenue account. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 21 IN CONFIDENCE In conclusion, expenditure on a resource consent will usually be capital in nature, although there are exceptions to this, such as land developers or traders, where the expenditure may be on revenue account. Limited scope for deductible feasibility expenditure in the context of applying for resource consent In the Supreme Court much of the argument concerned whether the expenditure on resource consents was feasibility expenditure (and deductible on this basis). Ultimately, the Supreme Court considered it was not because the expenditure on the resource consents was directed towards a specific capital project or directed to materially advancing a specific capital project. Accordingly, even if recurrent, it was not deductible. The Supreme Court considered at \[72\]: The expenditure on obtaining resource consents in this case was directly related to specific projects that would be on capital account if they came to fruition. The projects could not proceed without resource consents. Obtaining the consents thus represented tangible progress towards their completion. The expenditure is thus on capital account and not deductible. The Supreme Court did acknowledge that there is some scope for feasibility expenditure in a resource consent context at \[72\]: We are not required to determine the status of the expenditure which preceded the decisions to apply for resource consent. It may be that the Commissioner could have denied deductibility in relation to at least some of that expenditure. We are, however, also of the view that expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments may be deductible. Such assessments can be seen as a normal incident of business. Treating the associated costs as deductible is consistent with the passages of the judgments of Noel ACJ and Davies J which we have set out. It is also consistent with the use of the expression “to the extent” in the capital limitation, which, as noted, suggests that questions of degree may be involved. Expenditure which is not directed towards a specific project or which is so preliminary as not to be directed towards the advancement of such a project is likely to be seen as being on revenue account. \[footnotes omitted\] \[Emphasis added\] This leaves limited scope for deductible feasibility expenditure when it comes to applying for a particular resource consent. In most instances, expenditure incurred in applying for a resource consent is expenditure directed towards a specific capital project or expenditure that materially advances a capital project. Schedule 14 consents are depreciable intangible property It was not necessary for any of the Courts to address depreciation in any detail. However, the Supreme Court did refer to time-limited resource consents within s EE 53 (now s EE 62) as being both depreciable and depreciable intangible property: \[24\] The s OB 1 definition of “property” expressly encompasses resource consents. Resource consents are within the s EE 53 meaning of “depreciable intangible property” and are “depreciable property” for the purposes of s EE 6 when they are time limited unless the costs of obtaining them are deductible. This means that the question whether a time limited resource consent is depreciable or not turns on the application of the capital/revenue distinction. We accept therefore that s EE 53 does not resolve the case in favour of the Commissioner. \[footnotes omitted\] \[Emphasis added\] The reference to resource consents within s EE 53 (now s EE 62) encompasses environmental consents because these are listed (in what is now) sch 14 as depreciable intangible property. The Supreme Court considered that consents within (what is now) s EE 62 and sch 14 are depreciable intangible property and the costs are depreciable unless the cost can be deducted as revenue expenditure. In most cases the expenditure will not IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 22 IN CONFIDENCE be revenue and the correct approach will be to depreciate the cost over the fixed life of the consent. Expenditure on resource consents can be a cost of other property Cases such as ECC Quarries Ltd v Watkis (HMIT) \[1975\] All ER 843 (which concerned planning permission rather than a resource consent) and Milburn NZ Limited v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017, provide support for the view that resource consents will often be inseparable from the asset to which they relate. In such instances expenditure on a resource consent is likely to form part of the cost base of that asset. The existing case law was considered by the High Court (Trustpower Ltd v CIR (2013) 26 NZTC 21-047) because whether the resource consents were a stand-alone asset was a central issue before the High Court. However, as the arguments developed on appeal, this particular issue was not considered further. Nonetheless the High Court seemed to accept (and the appellate courts did not disagree) that resource consents could be either separate items or part of another item (in which case the tax treatment was what applied to the other item). In the High Court Andrews J concluded: \[97\] On the particular facts of this case, I therefore find that the resource consents obtained by TrustPower for the Arnold, Kaiwera Downs, Mahinerangi, and Wairau projects are not stand-alone assets, separate from the projects to which they relate. The resource consents are part and parcel of the projects. It would be artificial from a practical and business point of view to regard them as separate assets in their own right. The expenditure in obtaining them must, therefore, be treated in the same manner as the projects ... This issue was not considered further on the subsequent appeals (it was unnecessary to decide the issue), and the Court of Appeal accepted Andrews J’s finding that the resource consents were not stand-alone assets: \[85\] We start our consideration of the application of the general principles relating to the income/capital distinction by accepting the factual findings made by Andrews J in the High Court relating to Trustpower’s development pipeline for its possible future electricity generation projects, including her finding that the resource consents were not stand-alone assets, separate from the projects to which they related. In other words, we proceed at this stage on the basis that it is unnecessary to determine the Commissioner’s challenges to those findings. We take this course because, as Mr Harley accepted in the course of argument, the correct approach is an objective one. Determining on which side of the line the expenditure falls involves an objective analysis of the factual background relating to the nature and purpose or effect of the expenditure and not a subjective approach based on the views of the witnesses for Trustpower. \[footnotes omitted\] \[Emphasis added\] However, this finding was made on the basis that the depreciation rules in subpart EE did not apply. The Supreme Court indicated (see \[96\] above) that in the depreciation context, environmental consents are discrete items of depreciable intangible property. The Commissioner agrees and considers the effect of the specific statutory regime in s EE 62 and sch 14 is to treat environmental consents as separate property for depreciation purposes (see paragraphs \[152\]–\[153\]). In conclusion, the Courts in Trustpower accepted that resource consents are capable of being part of another asset, and in that case, the tax treatment is that which applies to the other asset. Although not directly addressed, this suggests that where a land consent is inseparable from a resulting item of depreciable property, the expenditure can potentially be depreciable as a cost of the resulting item of property (see paragraphs \[176\]–\[180\]). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 23 IN CONFIDENCE Part Two – Deductibility of expenditure on resource consents The next section of this interpretation statement addresses the different treatment of expenditure on resource consents. Having addressed the key concepts in Part One, Part Two steps through the flowcharts and explains the factors and issues that are relevant in determining the deductibility of expenditure on a resource consent. Accordingly, the statement covers: • feasibility expenditure that is deductible under the principles in IS 17/01; • expenditure on revenue account; • deductibility under a specific provision of the Act, in particular: - s DB 19 may allow a deduction for the costs incurred in un-lodged, withdrawn, refused, lapsed or surrendered resource applications; - s DB 46 allows deductions for certain expenditure in avoiding, remedying, or mitigating the effects of contamination; • capital expenditure and the ability to depreciate depending on whether the taxpayer holds: - an environmental consent – the costs of which will be depreciable as depreciable intangible property; - a land consent – in which case expenditure incurred in obtaining the consent is only depreciable if it forms part of the cost base of a resulting item of depreciable property (there will be no deduction for land, and buildings with an EUL of 50 years or more have a zero deduction because of the 0% depreciation rate). The flowcharts are intended to provide a pathway to deductibility to assist in deciding whether expenditure is deductible or depreciable. They are also intended to be a reference tool to guide taxpayers to the part of the statement that is relevant for them. For instance, if expenditure on an environmental study is deductible feasibility expenditure under the principles in IS 17/01 and Trustpower, then there is no need to consider whether it is deductible on any other basis. If it is not deductible feasibility expenditure, then the next consideration is whether it is revenue expenditure and deductible under the general permission (and so on). IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 24 IN CONFIDENCE Flowchart 1: Environmental consents – ss 12–15 of the RMA excluding reclamation consents – treatment of expenditure Flowchart 2 for land consents follows the same general structure. The main difference is that land consents do not depreciate. However, the cost of obtaining a land consent may be depreciated where it is capitalised into the cost of an item of depreciable property. No depreciation deduction is available for any expenditure capitalised into the cost of land or buildings (with an EUL of 50 years or more). For land consents, deductibility under s DB 19 for unsuccessful consents may not be possible as it depends on the depreciation outcome. However, some expenditure may be deductible if it is for pollution control. Expenditure depreciable on a straight-line basis over the life of the consent. $ Expenditure may be deductible under ss DA 1 and DB 23 when expenditure is on revenue account property.

If taxpayers believe they have incurred expenditure that is deductible on this basis they should refer to IS 17/01: “Income tax – deductibility of feasibility expenditure”. The label “feasibility expenditure” is not determinative when considering deductions because the Act does not prescribe a deduction for amounts of “feasibility expenditure”. Rather deductibility is determined by the same general principles that apply to all expenditure. For expenditure to be deductible it must meet the requirements in the general permission in s DA 1(1). It is then necessary to consider whether any of the general limitations in s DA 2 deny a deduction. IS 17/01: “Income tax – deductibility of feasibility expenditure” includes a discussion on the general principles of deductibility. IS 17/01 analyses feasibility expenditure in two steps: • Firstly, whether there is the ability to deduct under s DA 1(1). IS 17/01 identifies that for many taxpayers, feasibility expenditure will be non-deductible because it will have been incurred preliminary to, or preparatory to, the commencement of a business or income-earning activity. The principles to apply to determine when a business or income-earning activity commences are discussed in detail at paragraphs \[29\]–\[98\] of IS 17/01. • Secondly, whether a deduction is prohibited under the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). The Commissioner’s view following the Supreme Court’s Trustpower judgment is summarised in IS 17/01 at \[129\]: Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, expenditure is likely to be deductible in accordance with the Supreme Court decision if it is of a type incurred on a recurrent basis as a normal incident of the taxpayer’s business and it satisfies one of the following: • the expenditure is not directed towards a specific capital project; or • if the expenditure is directed towards a specific capital project, the expenditure is so preliminary as not to be directed towards materially advancing a specific capital project – or, put another way, the expenditure is not directed towards making tangible progress on a specific capital project. The Supreme Court considered that expenditure associated with early stage feasibility assessments may be deductible. This may occur where expenditure is incurred in the initial investigation of a project. Example 5 in IS 17/01 demonstrates when expenditure on initial investigations may be deductible feasibility expenditure. However, once expenditure is directed towards a particular consent there is limited scope for deducting feasibility expenditure. This is because expenditure incurred in applying for a particular resource consent will often be directed towards a specific capital asset (or making tangible progress on a specific capital project) and so is not deductible under the principles in IS 17/01 and Trustpower. Expenditure on revenue account The Supreme Court in Trustpower considered that expenditure in that case was on capital account. Applying the Supreme Court’s approach, the Commissioner considers that expenditure on resource consents will usually be on capital account. This is because resource consents are usually for a substantial or unlimited duration, provide an enduring benefit and also commonly form part of the profit-earning structure of the business. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 27 IN CONFIDENCE The exception identified in Trustpower is land developers where the expenditure is on revenue account. Where property is “revenue account property”, its cost is deductible under s DB 23(1). “Revenue account property” is relevantly described in s YA 1 as property that if disposed of for valuable consideration, would produce income for the person (other than income under ss EE 48, FA 5 or FA 9). Where the expenditure is on revenue account property, special matching provisions apply to the timing of the deduction (s EA 2). Generally, the deduction is deferred until the time the property (which is the subject of the consent) is disposed of and the income arises. Identifying other exceptions depends on a close examination of the facts of the particular case and the character of the particular payment to ascertain the nature and purpose or effect of the relevant expenditure. For instance, if a stadium owner needs a land consent to use floodlights to allow the stadium to host night-time concerts and events, this will likely be capital as it provides an enduring benefit and enlarges the business structure by allowing them to host concerts and other events. Alternatively, if a concert promoter obtains a similar consent to use floodlights for a one-off concert event, then arguably there is no enduring benefit and the expenditure appears more likely to be revenue. Ultimately, it is a matter of applying the principles discussed in Trustpower (referred to at \[87\]) to the particular facts of the case. Where a deduction is being claimed, the expenditure must also meet the general principles of deductibility. The two leading cases in New Zealand relevant to general deductibility are CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA). A more in-depth discussion of the general principles of deductibility is included in IS 17/01. Briefly, where there is expenditure on a resource consent, for a deduction to be claimed it will be necessary for the expenditure to be incurred by the taxpayer: • in deriving assessable income; and • as an ordinary incident of a particular business or income-earning activity. The deductibility of expenditure is subject to the general permission under s DA 1(1). For resource consent expenditure to be deductible under either paragraph of s DA 1(1), a sufficient relationship or nexus must exist between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. Whether a business or an income-earning activity is being carried on is always one of fact and degree (the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity is discussed in IS 17/01 (at \[29\]–\[106\])). Any expenditure on resource consents for private purposes will not satisfy s DA 1 as the expenditure will not be incurred in deriving assessable income (and will also be denied by the private limitation in s DA 2(2)). When resource consent expenditure is revenue in nature and deductible under s DA 1(1), it is still necessary to consider whether the general limitations in s DA 2 apply. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 28 IN CONFIDENCE Deductibility under a specific provision Obtaining a resource consent can be a complicated and expensive process. Depending on the circumstances, some expenditure may be deductible under a specific provision in the Act. This statement only addresses ss DB 19 and DB 46 as these provisions are the most relevant to resource consents. However, other provisions may also be relevant, for instance, s DB 62 for legal expenses less than $10,000 and ss DB 5 to DB 7 for interest expenditure. Also, some categories of expenditure, such as petroleum mining and mineral mining expenditure, have their own regimes in the Act. Where a resource consent is not obtained or is surrendered or lapses Section DB 19 allows a deduction for costs where an application for a resource consent is not lodged, withdrawn or not granted. Section DB 19 can be described as a deduction provision for costs of unsuccessful resource consents. It also allows a deduction where a consent lapses (s 125 of the RMA) or is surrendered (s 138 of the RMA). Section DB 19 has been amended on several occasions to increase the scope of the section. The most recent amendments in 2014 were part of a series of amendments to address “black hole expenditure”. The section was extended to cover applications that had not been lodged and where the consent had been granted but had lapsed or been surrendered. Section DB 19 currently reads: DB 19 Expenses in application for resource consent When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person who incurs expenditure for the purpose of applying for the grant of a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991— (a) does not obtain the grant because the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or because the grant is refused: (b) obtains the grant but does not use the resource consent before it lapses or is surrendered. Deduction (1B) The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure— (a) that the person incurs in relation to the application or intended application; and (b) that would have been part of the cost of depreciable property, or otherwise a deduction, if the application or intended application had been granted or if the resource consent had been used; and Example 3 Lindsay and Adrian are in partnership as property and land developers. They commonly buy bare land or houses on large plots that they subdivide and sell. They buy an empty 1-hectare site on the outskirts of their town that they rename “Trafalgar Mews”. They are dividing Trafalgar Mews into 12 plots, which they will sell. Lindsay and Adrian obtain s 11 RMA resource consents from the council to subdivide the property into 12 plots. They also obtain s 9 RMA land consents because the density of the housing will be more than is permitted under the district plan. Once the plots are subdivided and capable of being built upon, the plots are sold. As land developers, the land is held on revenue account and costs are deductible under s DB 23. The s 9 and s 11 consents form part of the cost of the land. They also satisfy the general permission in s DA 1, as required by s DB 23. Special timing provisions apply, and Lindsay and Adrian get the deduction for the expenses incurred in obtaining the consents in the year in which they dispose of the property. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 29 IN CONFIDENCE (c) for which the person is not allowed a deduction under another provision. Timing of deduction (2) The deduction is allocated to the income year in which— (a) the person decides not to lodge the application, withdraws the application, or is refused the grant; or (b) the resource consent lapses or is surrendered. Link with subpart DA (3) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission and other general limitations still apply. Crucially s DB 19 does not allow a deduction when the expenditure would not have been part of the cost of depreciable property or otherwise deductible. This means: • Section DB 19 applies to the costs of an environmental consent because environmental consents are always capable of being depreciable as depreciable intangible property. This means that if the requirements of s DB 19(1B) are met, a deduction will be available for the cost of the environmental consent. • The deductibility of expenditure on land consents depends on whether the cost would have been deductible if the project went ahead: - There is no deduction under s DB 19 for expenditure on land consents that are not depreciable or deductible (eg, where the land consent is a stand-alone asset or where expenditure is capitalised to land or buildings with an EUL of more than 50 years). - Where expenditure on a land consent would have been depreciable as a cost of an item of depreciable property, then a deduction is available (eg, it is a land consent required to construct a swimming pool, retaining walls, fences, roads, dams or any other depreciable land improvement in sch 13). This is because had the consent been granted or used, then the costs would have been deductible or depreciable. Under s DB 19, the deduction is available in the tax year when the person decides not to lodge their application, when the application is rejected, when the consent lapses or when it is surrendered. Example 4 Wild Coast Electricity Ltd is an electricity generator and retailer. Part of its business involves identifying and developing potential sites. Whether a site is developed depends on a number of factors including the market conditions. The company decides to develop a solar power installation on an empty site it owns in the South Island. The project will require a number of different resource consents. The company obtains detailed environmental reports that will be used to apply for environmental consents (for waste water and to discharge contaminates during construction) and prepares strategies to mitigate any effects. The company also intends to clear and contour the land to fit as many solar panels as possible onto the site and to maximise the amount of solar energy each panel harnesses. Plans and drawings of the site are obtained and will be used to apply for a land consent for the clearance and contouring of the land. News of the proposed project leaks and is met with significant local community opposition and unsympathetic media coverage. Some directors also believe the projected levels of electricity generation at the site may have been overstated. For these reasons a decision is made not to lodge the application and to permanently abandon the project. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 30 IN CONFIDENCE Pollution control expenditure Section DB 46 allows a person a deduction for expenditure commonly described as “pollution control expenditure”. Broadly, s DB 46 allows a deduction for the expenditure listed in Part A or B of sch 19. Section DB 46 overrides the capital limitation in s DA 2(1) and allows deductions for specified activities that are undertaken to avoid, remedy or mitigate the effects of discharging contaminants. For an expense to be deductible under s DB 46, the taxpayer must: • carry on a business in New Zealand; • incur, in the business or the ending of the operations of the business, expenditure that was of a kind listed in sch 19, Part A or B; and • satisfy the general permission in s DA 1. Section DB 46 only applies where no other provision allows a deduction. The Commentary to the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 identified three ways that taxpayers could claim a tax deduction for environmental expenditure (outside of industry specific provisions): • A deduction for normal operating (revenue) expenditure; • A deduction under the tax depreciation rules for certain types of capital expenditure, such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumping machinery and screens; and • A deduction under section DB 37 (DJ 10) \[now s DB 46\] for other capital environmental expenditure. Section DJ 10 was introduced to permit business taxpayers a deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of treating industrial waste when no other allowance might otherwise be possible. It allows business taxpayers to claim a deduction for the cost of constructing on land in New Zealand any earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or other similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste in order to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. When a deduction is available, it must be spread evenly over five years, beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred. \[Emphasis added\] Environmental consents Under s DB 19 a deduction is available at the point the directors make the decision not to lodge the application. However, the company can only deduct expenditure that would have been deductible or depreciable. The costs of environmental consents are deductible. This is because environmental consents are depreciable intangible property and the expenditure would have been depreciable had the consents been obtained and used. Land consents The plans and drawings were to be used to apply for a land consent for non- depreciable earthworks. For land consents, the operation of s DB 19 depends on the depreciation outcome. The land consent if granted would have been for an unlimited duration and would not have been depreciable property in its own right. While the expenditure could have been capitalised into the cost of the land, there is still no deduction as land is not depreciable property (s EE 7). If the project had gone ahead, the resulting property would not have been depreciable. Therefore, a deduction cannot be taken under s DB 19 for the expenditure. If the plans and drawings were instead required for an application for a land consent to construct an item of depreciable plant, then the expenditure could have been capitalised to the item of plant and depreciated (if built). In this case a deduction would be available under s DB 19 as the expenditure would otherwise have been allowed as a deduction for depreciation as part of the cost of the item of plant. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 31 IN CONFIDENCE Section DB 46 only applies if the amount is not deductible on any other basis. Accordingly, s DB 46 cannot apply to the costs of an environmental consent because these will be depreciable as a cost of an item of depreciable intangible property. Only expenditure on land consents (that would not be otherwise deductible) can be potentially deducted under s DB 46. Section DB 46 allows a deduction for the kind of expenditure listed in Parts A and B of sch 19 but excludes the types of expenditure in Part C. Schedule 19 lists kinds of expenditure relating to avoiding, remedying, or mitigating the detrimental effects of discharging contaminants. The default categories of expenditure are expenditure relating to an activity or improvement to land and expenditure relating to restoration and monitoring. Some examples of the types of expenditure in sch 19 are: • expenditure, in the construction of an improvement on land in New Zealand, incurred to avoid or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant; • expenditure on screen planting, on land in New Zealand, incurred in association with the construction of an improvement to the land that is intended to avoid, or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant; • expenditure related to monitoring the discharge of a contaminant; • expenditure incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from the discharged contaminant; • expenditure incurred after the discharge of a contaminant, on the installation of impermeable surfaces on land in New Zealand with the purpose of avoiding, remedying, or mitigating detrimental effects on the environment from a discharged contaminant. Subsections DB 46(2)–(8) deal with the timing and calculation of any deduction. In Waste Management NZ Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,147 (CA), the Court of Appeal considered s 124 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ITA 1976) (an earlier version of s DB 46). Section 124 of the ITA 1976 was worded differently to s DB 46 and did not specify the categories of qualifying expenditure in detail. Richardson J, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that s 124 of the ITA 1976 was an incentive provision designed to encourage improvements to land for the purpose of treating industrial waste to combat pollution. Richardson J also indicated that the section applied where the taxpayer met the criteria prescribed by the subsection, at 12,148: Where the taxpayer meets the criteria prescribed by the subsection it may spread the expenditure and claim a deduction of one-fifth of the amount in the year in which the expenditure is incurred and in each of the succeeding four years. The section is an incentive provision applying where no other deduction is available and is designed to encourage improvements to land for the purpose of treating industrial waste to prevent or combat pollution. \[Emphasis added\] Section DB 46 is only relevant in the small number of cases where expenses incurred in obtaining a resource consent form part of the expenditure under sch 19 and the expenses are not otherwise deductible. It is most likely to be relevant where the: • cost of the land consent is not depreciable – this means the expenditure is capital in nature and the expenses are neither part of an item of depreciable intangible property nor part of the cost of a resulting item of depreciable property. This is likely to arise in the case of land consents where the resulting asset is a non-depreciable improvement to land (ie, a s 9 RMA consent for earthworks); IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 32 IN CONFIDENCE • property is not owned by the person incurring the expenditure and so cannot be depreciated by them. Section DB 46 may apply where a land consent is obtained to remedy contamination on a neighbouring property, eg, a land consent obtained to remove contaminated soil from a neighbouring property; • capital expenditure is incurred in meeting conditions attaching to a resource consent and that expenditure is not depreciable as a cost of the resource consent. Because the cost of the consent is fixed at the point it is ready to use, subsequent expenditure on meeting conditions will usually not be a cost of the consent. An example is a condition attaching to a consent requiring the consent holder to rectify any pollution or contamination of neighbouring properties. This expenditure will not normally be a cost of the resource consent but may be deductible under s DB 46. Example 5 Cerys runs a haulage business and has specialised tankers that transport various liquids and chemicals. The tankers need to be thoroughly cleaned between jobs and there is specialised cleaning equipment at the depot. On very busy occasions the drains at the depot cannot cope with the volume of water and some excess contaminated water has spilt into an area of native bush on a neighbouring property. Cerys has arranged for extra drainage channels to be created so that in the future any excess water drains away into a lined ditch at the depot. The earthworks involved are significant enough to require a land consent. The expenditure on the land consent is capital (and would not be depreciable because the resulting asset is a non-depreciable land improvement) but is still able to be deducted under a specific provision. Section DB 46 overrides the capital limitation but not the general permission that must still be satisfied. This is expenditure on the construction of an improvement on land in New Zealand, incurred to avoid or mitigate future detrimental effects on the environment from the discharge of a contaminant, and the works are within sch 19(A)(2). As such, s DB 46 allows the cost of the earthworks (including the land consent) to be deducted and spread in accordance with the section. Environmental consents Where a taxpayer holds an environmental consent, the cost will usually be depreciable over the fixed life of the consent. Section DA 1 allows a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including depreciation loss, to the extent that the expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving assessable income. Section EE 1 provides that a person has an amount of “depreciation loss” if: • the person owns a relevant item of property (as described in ss EE 2 to EE 5); • the item is depreciable property (as described in ss EE 6 to EE 8); • the item is used or is available for use by the person in the relevant income year; and • the amount of depreciation loss is calculated under the relevant provisions (ss EE 9 to EE 11). As noted above, from a tax perspective, resource consents available under the RMA can be divided into two general categories; environmental consents and land consents. Section 122(1) of the RMA provides that resource consents are not real or personal property. However, for the purposes of depreciation, the definition of property in the Act includes all types of consents granted under the RMA in, or after, the 1997 income tax year. Specifically, s YA 1 defines “property” as follows (as relevant): property,— IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 33 IN CONFIDENCE (a) in subpart EE (Depreciation), includes consents granted in or after the 1996-97 tax year under the Resource Management Act 1991: The crucial issue in terms of resource consents is whether they are depreciable property under the legislation. Section EE 6 defines “depreciable property” as: Description (1) Depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving assessable income; or (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Subsections (2) to (4) expand on this subsection Property: tangible (2) An item of tangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is described by subsection (1); and (b) it is not described by section EE 7. Property: intangible (3) An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is within the definition of depreciable intangible property; and (b) it is described by subsection (1); and (c) it is not described by section EE 7. Intangible property will only be depreciable property if it comes within the definition of depreciable intangible property (s EE 6(3)(a)). The Commissioner considers the best approach to the analysis is to then consider whether the property is depreciable intangible property under s EE 62. The definition of depreciable intangible property is in s EE 62: EE 62 Meaning of depreciable intangible property Meaning (1) Depreciable intangible property means the property listed in schedule 14 (Depreciable intangible property). Criteria for listing in schedule 14 (2) For property to be listed in schedule 14, the criteria are as follows: (a) it must be intangible; and (b) it must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. Schedule 14 prevails (3) Property that is listed in schedule 14 is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met. Section EE 62(1) limits depreciable intangible property to the items listed in sch 14. Unlike most depreciable tangible property, items of intangible property must be listed in the schedule to be depreciated. This is not an issue for environmental consents, but it is for land consents, which are intangible property but not listed as depreciable intangible property. Schedule 14(10) includes environmental consents: IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 34 IN CONFIDENCE 10 a consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15B of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after— (a) the 1996–97 tax year, if the consent relates to sections 12 to 15 of that Act; or (b) the 2014–15 income year, if the consent relates to sections 15A and 15B of that Act Schedule 14 provides that consents removing the restrictions in ss 12–15B of the RMA are depreciable intangible property. Broadly, those restrictions are on the use of coastal marine areas, on uses of beds of lakes and rivers, in relation to water and on the discharge of contaminants. These environmental consents concern resources and under s 123 of the RMA environmental consents have a fixed life of between 5 and 35 years. They are usually expected to depreciate in value over their life. Consents for reclamation are usually of unlimited duration and concern land and are excluded from sch 14. Environmental consents are depreciable intangible property under s EE 62, so the next step is to consider whether they are also depreciable property under s EE 6 and whether they satisfy both ss EE 6(1) and EE 6(3). Intangible property is not subject to wear and tear so will usually only decline in value (as required by s EE 6(1)) if it has a finite life. The Court of Appeal in Trustpower made the point that consents require a fixed term to decline in value (at \[25\]): The land use consents of unlimited duration are not within the definition of “depreciable intangible property” because without a fixed term they cannot be “expected to decline in value” over time. Environmental consents are usually granted for a period between 5 and 35 years so will decline in value as required by s EE 6(1). This can be contrasted with land consents that generally have an infinite lifespan and will not therefore be capable of being depreciable property. There are two aspects to s EE 6(1) that need to be satisfied. The environmental consent must be used or available for use in deriving assessable income (or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income). The Court of Appeal in Trustpower (at \[27\]) considered that the resource consents were “available for use” in that case once they were granted: Clearly, once the resource consents were granted, they were “available for use” by Trustpower. The fact that they were not being used and would not be used unless and until Trustpower decided to use them and obtained land access did not mean that they were not “available” for use. The expression “available” simply means “capable of being used”. Once Trustpower decided to use them and obtained land access, they would be used. Prior to that they were available for that purpose. \[footnote omitted\] In this case, even lacking the land access to use the consent did not prevent the resource consent being “available for use” upon grant of the consent. Applying this approach, a resource consent will usually be available to use on being granted. However, in some cases there will be a delay between the grant of the consent and the commencement of the consent under s 116 of the RMA. Section 116 is discussed at \[67\] of this statement but does not appear to have been relevant in the Trustpower litigation. Where there is a difference between commencement and grant, the better view is that the consent is available to use on commencement. This might occur where a resource consent is granted but there is an appeal and it will not commence until the appeal has been resolved Whether the environmental consent is available for use in deriving assessable income is a question of fact. This is equivalent to the nexus requirement under s DA 1. The Supreme Court in Trustpower accepted that the “expenditure was incurred by Trustpower in the course of carrying on its existing business as a generator and retailer of electricity, a business which it carries on for the purpose of deriving assessable income”. The Court of IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 35 IN CONFIDENCE Appeal took a contrary view on nexus (under s DA 1 rather than s EE 6). Its view was Trustpower’s profit-making enterprise was the generation and retailing of electricity, not the development of possible new projects and applications for resource consents for those projects. While the Supreme Court took a different approach, this highlights the importance of nexus to deriving income, particularly with new projects not yet part of the profit-making enterprise. On new projects, any expenditure incurred before the establishment of a business or an income-earning activity will not fulfil the statutory nexus, because the expenditure will have been incurred too soon. The Commissioner’s view on the commencement of a business or an income-earning activity is set out in IS 17/01 (at \[29\]–\[106\]). In summary: • The decision as to whether a business or an income-earning activity has commenced is one of fact and degree. Four factors are relevant: o It is critical to determine the true nature of the business. o A commitment must have been made to enter into that business. o The required profit-making structure for the particular business must be in place. o The ordinary current operations of the business must have begun. This is particularly relevant to resource consents because an application for a consent may precede both the profit-making structure being in place and the start of the ordinary current operations of the business. Any resource consents obtained for private or domestic purposes (eg, consents relating to private dwellings) will not be available for use in deriving income or carrying on a business for deriving income. Consequently, such consents will not be depreciable property under s EE 6. Examples 6, 7, 8 and 9 Example 6: Nexus with income required Dave and Barbara own a home on the banks of the Brockhampton River, close to where the river meets the sea. They are avid boaties and want to install a floating pontoon on the river. They check with the council and are told they require an environmental consent for the floating pontoon. In the future, Dave wants to retire from his job as a mid-ranking civil servant and run fishing and boat charters from the pontoon. The environmental consent is not depreciable property because the consent is not used in deriving assessable income. Despite Dave’s future intention, the use is private. Example 7: Nexus with income established Incin-a-lot Ltd provides services collecting and incinerating waste. The company has been successful and wants to offer a new service incinerating medical waste. It intends to build an additional incinerator at its existing premises for this purpose. To operate the new incinerator, it requires an environmental consent under s 15 of the RMA allowing the discharge of contaminants into the atmosphere. The council grants a s 15 resource consent with a 25-year term. The environmental consent is depreciable property because there is sufficient nexus with deriving assessable income. The consent is used in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Example 8: Preliminary expenditure Costco have carried on a successful business for many years selling household products. Costco purchased some vacant land intending to develop another retail outlet, but current market conditions are unfavourable, so Costco has been looking at alternative uses for the land. The tourism industry is booming in the region and IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 36 IN CONFIDENCE In terms of tax treatment, environmental consents are depreciable as items of fixed life intangible property. “Fixed life intangible property” is “depreciable intangible property” that has a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of acquisition, to be the same length as the property’s remaining EUL (s EE 67). The legal life of environmental consents is between 5 and 35 years and will usually be the same as the EUL. Section EE 33 provides for the annual rate of depreciation for “fixed life intangible property”. The annual rate is calculated using the formula: 1 푙푒푔푎푙 푙푖푓푒 As environmental consents are items of fixed life intangible property under sch 14, they must be depreciated using the straight-line method (s EE 12(2)(b)(ii)). This spreads the cost (as determined above from \[39\]) of the environmental consent over its legal life. To the extent that an environmental consent is unused taxpayers can surrender the consent (s 138 of the RMA) and claim a deduction under s DB 19. This is discussed at \[119\]. Environmental consents are treated as separate assets for depreciation Environmental consents would often be inseparable from the asset to which they relate (as happened in Milburn, which predates sch 14 and Trustpower HC which did not apply sch 14). However, the impact of sch 14 is that environmental consents are treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. This raises the question of whether the costs of an environmental consent must always be depreciated as separate items of depreciable intangible property. The Commissioner’s view is that sch 14 is a code for items of depreciable intangible property. Environmental consents are specifically included in sch 14 and they are granted for fixed periods. The Commissioner’s view is that Parliament intended (for depreciation purposes) environmental consents to be treated as stand-alone items of depreciable intangible property, which are depreciable according to their own legal life, rather than according to the estimated useful life of any other depreciable items to which they may relate. Costco have identified a need for more budget accommodation in the city, so seek consents to construct and operate a hotel on its land. Following extensive opposition to the proposal, Costco withdraws its application for consent. The expenditure will not be deductible because Costco was not in the hotel business when the expenditure was incurred. Example 9: Preliminary expenditure Dave runs a company that operates a successful gym franchise. Dave has purchased some vacant land and wants to turn it into another gym. However, a competitor has opened up nearby and Dave decides the current market conditions are unfavourable, so is considering a different business use for the land. He already sells a limited range of sports goods at the gym (energy bars, drinks bottles, towels, yoga mats, weight- lifting accessories etc) and thinks he could expand this side of the business by using the land to open a retail outlet selling sports gear. He applies for a resource consent to build and operate the store. Following extensive opposition to the proposal from existing sports gear retailers, Dave withdraws the company’s application for consent. The expenditure on the withdrawn consent will be deductible under s DB 19 because retailing of sports gear has sufficient connection with his existing business. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 37 IN CONFIDENCE Conclusion for environmental consents In summary, environmental consents are: • separately listed in sch 14; and • depreciated according to their legal life, rather than according to the estimated useful life of any items to which they may relate. Land consents The deductibility of the expenditure for land consents is highly fact-dependent: • In exceptional circumstances a land consent may be depreciable as a right to use land under sch 14(5). In this case the treatment is the same as for environmental consents (see from \[131\]). • Expenditure on land consents may be capitalised to the cost of a resulting item of depreciable property. In this case the costs are depreciable at the rate that applies to the resulting item of property (note that buildings generally depreciate at 0%). Land consents depreciable as a right to use land Like environmental consents, to be depreciable land consents must meet the criteria in s EE 6 (at \[134\] above). Section EE 6(3)(a) provides that intangible property will be depreciable property if it is within the definition of depreciable intangible property: Property: intangible (3) An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is within the definition of depreciable intangible property; and (b) it is described by subsection (1); and Example 10 Incin-a-lot Ltd is building an additional incinerator for medical waste. The council has granted Incin-a-lot Ltd a 25-year environmental consent to discharge contaminants into the atmosphere from this incinerator. The consent cost is $50,000, including legal fees, application fees, design and engineering reports, scientific reports and an environmental report. The costs of the environmental consent are depreciated over the legal life on a straight-line basis. This means the cost of $50,000 is depreciated over a 25-year period resulting in a straight-line depreciation deduction of $2,000 a year. However, developing contracts with customers has been slower than expected and the new incinerator will not be put into operation until next year. Further, due to high operating temperatures, this kind of incinerator only has a 10-year useful life. Does this change how the costs are depreciated? No. The environmental consent can be depreciated from the point where the consent is available to be used. It is available to use and the costs are depreciable, despite the incinerator not actually being used until the following year. The incinerator’s shorter useful life does not affect the environmental consent. The environmental consent should be depreciated as a separate item of depreciable intangible property over its fixed term. Incin-a-lot Ltd may wish to surrender the environmental consent once the incinerator is no longer in use and write off the remaining amount of the un- depreciated cost of the consent. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 38 IN CONFIDENCE (c) it is not described by section EE 7. This means the first step is that land consents need to be depreciable intangible property under s EE 62. Section EE 62 defines depreciable intangible property as the property listed in sch 14, that includes: 5 the right to use land ... 10 a consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15B of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after— (a) the 1996–97 tax year, if the consent relates to sections 12 to 15 of that Act; or (b) the 2014–15 income year, if the consent relates to sections 15A and 15B of that Act While environmental consents are listed in sch 14(10), land consents are not. However, it is possible some consents could come within sch 14(5). As discussed below, the Commissioner’s view is that while it is possible that a land consent could be a right to use land, this is unlikely to occur very often. Outside of sch 14, there is no ability under the Act to depreciate intangible property (as a stand-alone item of property). A right to use land as depreciable intangible property in sch 14(5) Land consents can be depreciated as stand-alone items of depreciable intangible property if they are a “right to use land” under sch 14(5) and depreciable property under s EE 6. “Land” is defined broadly in s YA 1, as including any estate or interest in land, and an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land, but does not include a mortgage. The meaning of a “right to use land” in sch 14 is discussed in ANZCO Foods Ltd v CIR \[2016\] NZHC 1015, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-049. The High Court considered whether a “right to use land” was a separate item of depreciable intangible property or merely part of the inherent rights of fee simple ownership. ANZCO purchased a meat processing plant that had previously been owned by a competitor. When the competitor sold the plant to a third party they had included a covenant preventing certain meat processing activities for a period of 20 years. An encumbrance was registered against the title. Subsequently, ANZCO purchased the property and the competitor considered they were breaching the terms of the encumbrance and commenced legal proceedings. Ultimately, a settlement was reached whereby ANZCO paid the competitor $5.6m and in return the encumbrance was altered to allow the meat processing activities in question. The settlement deed recorded this as being a grant of a right to use land from the competitor to ANZCO. ANZCO depreciated the $5.6m as a cost of the right to use land under sch 14. The Commissioner did not accept that there was a right to use land under sch 14. In ANZCO, Mander J specifically considered the meaning of the term “right to use land”. Mander J considered a “right to use land” under sch 14 refers to: • rights that have a finite life; and • rights to use land that are not part of the inherent ownership of the fee simple estate. Right to use land must have a finite life Section EE 62 reads: Criteria for listing in schedule 14 (2) For property to be listed in schedule 14, the criteria are as follows: IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 39 IN CONFIDENCE (a) it must be intangible; and (b) it must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. Schedule 14 prevails (3) Property that is listed in schedule 14 is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met. On the face of it there is an argument that subsection (3) means a right to use land does not have to have a finite life to be depreciable intangible property (although it would still need to decline in value under s EE 6). This approach was not adopted in ANZCO: \[96\] The “right to use land” as that term is used in sch 14, must be read in its statutory context – the objective of the Act, and in particular the purpose for which sch 14 was provided. The statutory intent of the criteria used in s EE 62 was to limit the interpretation of items of intangible property listed in the schedule to those that depreciate. This is consistent with the statutory purpose of the legislation to allow a deduction for an item of property used in deriving assessable income which declines in value over a finite period. \[97\] In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Trustpower Limited \[Trustpower\] the Court of Appeal considered the depreciation regime provided by the Act. The case concerned deductions for expenditure incurred in the acquisition of various resource management consents. The consents included land use consents, water permits and discharge permits. The land use consents were for an unlimited duration, whereas the other permits were for fixed periods and would expire after a number of years. \[98\] The predecessor to the current regime, sch 17, also listed consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 as items of depreciable intangible property. In considering whether resource consents, as that term is described without qualification in the schedule, were intangible depreciable property, the Court of Appeal distinguished between the land use consents which were for an unlimited duration and the water and discharge permits which had been granted for fixed periods. The Court held: \[25\] In the case of intangible property, this provision \[section EE 6\] will apply if the three requirements of s EE 6(3) are met. As the cl 9 resource consents are “depreciable intangible property”, the first requirement is met. The land use consents of unlimited duration are not within the definition of “depreciable intangible property” because without a fixed term they cannot be “expected to decline in value” over time. \[99\] The approach taken by the Court of Appeal demonstrates that notwithstanding s EE 62(3), which provides that property listed in the schedule is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met, the meaning of items listed in the schedule are still to be interpreted in accordance with the criteria provided in subs (2). Because the land use consents were not subject to any fixed term it was accepted they could not be expected to decline in value. That finding may be viewed as an amalgam of the criterion in s EE 62(2)(b) and the qualifying description of depreciable property in s EE 6(1), but the effect is the same; intangible depreciable property cannot include property that does not have a limited useful life. \[Emphasis added and footnote omitted\] In summary, the “right to use land”, must be read in its statutory context – the objective of the Act and its purpose. The High Court considered the intent of the criteria in s EE 62 is to limit the interpretation of items of intangible property listed in the schedule to those that depreciate. Further the purpose for which sch 14 was provided is to provide a deduction over time for an item of property used in deriving assessable income that declines in value over a finite period. The High Court notes that the finding in Trustpower was an amalgam of ss EE 6(1) (the property must decline in value) and EE 62 (the property must have a finite life) but the effect is the same and intangible depreciable property cannot include property that does not have a limited useful life. The approach adopted in ANZCO requires a land consent to have a finite life to be depreciable intangible property. This approach is consistent with Trustees in the CB Simkin IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 40 IN CONFIDENCE Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,001, where the Privy Council (at \[8\]) were concerned with the predecessor of s EE 62 and considered that the types of intangible property in sch 14 were distinguished by the longevity of their useful lives. Right to use land not part of inherent ownership of fee simple Mander J’s conclusion in ANZCO is that a right to use land in sch 14 does not extend to include rights which form part of the ownership of the fee simple estate: \[108\] The meaning of a “right to use land” as listed in sch 14 as depreciable intangible property does not extend to include rights which form part of the ownership of the fee simple estate. The rights to use the land which became available to ANZCO as a result of the settlement do not have a finite useful life over which they will depreciate. As a consequence the payment made by ANZCO to obtain the variation of the encumbrance in order to access those rights reflects the increased capital value of the property in the hands of the owner. \[Emphasis added\] Mander J draws a clear distinction between the rights of the owner and the right of use, relying on the Court of Appeal’s decision in Trustees of the CB Simkin Trust and the Trustees in the NC Simkin Trust v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,117 (which was upheld by the Privy Council on appeal). The case concerned the meaning of “the right to use a trademark” in sch 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (a predecessor to sch 14) rather than the “right to use land”. Gault J, delivering the decision of the Court, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the scheme of what was sch 17 (now sch 14). Specifically addressing a right to use land, Gault J considered the right to use land is clearly limited to rights distinguishable from right of use inherent in the ownership of the tangible property itself. In ANZCO, the removal of an encumbrance was found to be the return of the inherent rights of ownership and not a right to use land under sch 14. Mander J discusses at \[91\]–\[93\] how some rights to use land are rights inherent to the ownership of the land. In that case, the competitor had the benefit of the encumbrance but it never acquired any right to use the land, only a right to prevent the owner from using it. The right to use the land was with ANZCO at all times. Where a right to use land has been recognised by courts this has been in the context in which the term is usually understood, ie, a right to physically access land you do not own for a particular purpose. For instance, in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289, one aspect of the structure that was ultimately held to be tax avoidance involved the forestry investors being granted a licence to use land for approximately 50 years to grow trees. However, the Supreme Court concluded that absent the tax avoidance conclusion, the licence to use the land for forestry purposes was a right to use land under sch 14 (at \[54\]). Whether a land consent is a right to use land If a land consent is to be a right to use land under sch 14(5), the first hurdle is that it has a finite life. The second hurdle is that it must be a right to use land separate from the rights of inherent ownership, that is, it is not a right obtained through ownership of the land. Land consents will generally not be a right to use land under sch 14 because land consents are usually granted for an unlimited duration (s 123 of the RMA) and so do not have a finite life (part of the criteria in s EE 62(2)). The Court of Appeal confirmed this point in Trustpower (at \[25\]) in relation to resource consents, considering that land use consents of unlimited duration are not within sch 14: IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 41 IN CONFIDENCE As the cl 9 \[now cl 10\] resource consents are “depreciable intangible property”, the first requirement is met. The land use consents of unlimited duration are not within the definition of “depreciable intangible property” because without a fixed term they cannot be “expected to decline in value” over time. \[Emphasis added\] Even if a land consent has a finite life, it still needs to be a right to use land. The RMA prevents people from subdividing property and doing anything contrary to the district plan. Land consents are by default infinite rights (s 123 of the RMA) that attach to the land (s 134 of the RMA). Because they attach to the land they can be used by any owner and cannot be transferred separately from the land. Sections 9 and 11 of the RMA are drafted in a way that restrict certain inherent rights of property ownership and a consent will remove that fetter on ownership rather than create a new and separate right to use land. In most cases where a land owner obtains a land consent (say to build a certain distance from the boundary or to build a three-storey property) they are having rights returned to them that become indistinguishable from the inherent rights of ownership of the land. However, there may be instances where a land consent is a right to use land and has a finite life. This might be the case where the person does not own the relevant property, ie, they may be granted a licence to access the land for a particular purpose. For instance, time-limited land consents may be granted for concert performances, carnivals on the beach, flea markets in car parks, street parades and temporary events. This issue could also arise in relation to land consents for reclamation of seabed, foreshore, rivers and lakes (or using them in a way that is contrary to a district plan) as the person seeking the land consent may not have any rights of ownership in respect of the land. However, these land consents would need to be time-limited to be a depreciable right to use land. If a land consent is a right to use land under sch 14, then it is depreciable intangible property. The costs are depreciable by reference to their fixed life in the same way as environmental consents. However, depending on the circumstances, some time-limited consents may be deductible as revenue expenditure. This may arise where a land consent is granted for a one-off event or a short duration and so provides no enduring benefit. Conclusion on a right to use land under schedule 14 In conclusion, there is limited scope for land consents to be a right to use land under sch 14. This is restricted to rare circumstances where the consents: • are granted for a finite duration; and • give rise to a right to use land, meaning it must be a right to use exercised independently from the rights of ownership, ie, fee simple owners will not usually have a separate right to use. Land consent expenditure capitalised into other depreciable property While most land consents are unlikely to be depreciable as depreciable intangible property under sch 14, expenditure on land consents may be capitalised into the cost of a resulting item of property. However, where this is not possible there will be no depreciation deduction. Whether expenditure on a land consent is a cost of another item of property depends on the terms of the consent and the relationship to the property. To be included in the cost of another item of depreciable property the expenditure must satisfy the general principles in relation to cost, discussed above from \[39\]. It seems generally well accepted that expenditure on a land consent can be capitalised into the cost of a resulting asset. The Officials’ Report on the Taxation (Miscellaneous Issues) Bill 1995 discusses the tax treatment of land use consents: IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 42 IN CONFIDENCE Issue: Cost of land use resource management consents Clause 62 Submission (43 - New Zealand Society of Accountants; 37W - Mercury Energy) Where land use consents that have an infinite life relate to the erection of a structure their cost should be added to the cost of the structure and depreciated. Comment The bill allows depreciation of fixed-life resource management consents. In relation to land use consents that have an infinite life, it was announced in the Commentary on the Bill that Inland Revenue considered that, where such consents relate to the erection of a structure, they have a finite useful life that is the life of the structure. Inland Revenue is therefore currently working on a Tax Information Bulletin item that proposes that, for depreciation purposes, the cost of land use consents that pertain to the erection of a structure should be included in the cost of the structure. Mercury and the New Zealand Society of Accountants note that this policy is both logical and appropriate and is fully endorsed by them. The submission does not seek an amendment to the legislation. \[Emphasis added\] The commentary relating to the introduction and amendment of s DB 13B (now s DB 19 and discussed above from \[119\]) contains comments about the correct tax treatment of land use consents. The reasoning behind the insertion of s DB 13B by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 was explained in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) as follows: A new section DJ 14B has also been added to the Income Tax Act 1994 and new section DB 13B to the 2004 Act to allow deductibility for costs associated with resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn. Again, the costs that are deductible are those that would have been part of the cost of a resource consent (for depreciation purposes) if the application had been granted. On the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, the change applies to both resource consent applications that, if successful, would have resulted in consents with a fixed legal life (fixed life intangible property) as well as non-fixed life consents that would nevertheless have been depreciable by other means (for example, included in the cost of a building or other structures). \[Emphasis added\] Allowing expenditure on a land consent to be added to the cost of the resulting asset, to which it is directly attributable, recognises that the consent’s useful life is not unlimited but mirrors that of the asset. For instance, if a resource consent is granted based on plans to permit a building to extend beyond the building envelope, then in most instances once that building has been completed the resource consent has no further utility. It continues to exist but is inseparable from the building. In these circumstances, it would be unrealistic to say it has an infinite life separate from the building. Where the useful life of a land consent does not correspond to that of a particular asset, it suggests that the resource consent should not be capitalised to the cost of the asset. In the majority of cases the resulting asset will be obvious (eg, if a land consent is obtained for the construction of a road, then the asset is the road). Where consents potentially relate to more than one asset, an issue arises as to how the expenditure should be allocated. Allocating the cost between items of property On large infrastructure projects there could conceivably be improvements to land, new roads and access ways, hardstanding, plant, structures and buildings. Identifying the correct resulting items of depreciable property will have significant implications for taxpayers because some items will not depreciate at all (eg, land) and other items will depreciate at varying rates. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 43 IN CONFIDENCE Where there is expenditure on a land consent, it is first necessary to identify the various items of property for depreciation purposes that the consent relates to. Allocating the cost of a land consent will be possible once the item of depreciable property is clearly identified. The general principles in determining “cost” are discussed above from \[39\]. In short, the cost of an asset includes expenditure that must be incurred to acquire it. This requirement is determined by reference to the commercial reality, with consideration given to standard business practice and what is commercially required to obtain the asset. Case law allows standard accounting practice to be used in interpreting cost. In the accounting standards, construction costs are generally included in the cost of an asset along with any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary to operate it. If a land consent is required for the construction of an asset it will be directly attributable to that asset. The requirements under district plans vary from place to place but the construction of many buildings and structures will require resource consents. In these cases a consent will be obtained based on plans or specifications to build a structure to a certain height, at a certain location or to undertake specific commercial or industrial uses. In these circumstances, expenditure on a land resource consent will likely be part of the cost base of the structure. Resource consent expenditure may be incurred in circumstances where it is not directly attributable to a single item of property. Where that is the case, the Commissioner will require apportionment of the expenditure on a reasonable basis between the items of property. The exact nature of any apportionment will depend on the facts. Sometimes a condition of a resource consent will require the consent holder to construct another asset (see Example 11) that will require further “sub-consents”. The first step is to identify the items of property for depreciation purposes. If the new asset is functionally and physical distinct from the existing assets, it is likely to be a separate item of property for depreciation purposes. Because the sub-consent was required for the construction of the new asset it is likely to be a cost of the new asset. Treatment of different property Land Land is not depreciable property (s EE 7) because it usually appreciates in value. Where the resulting item is land, expenditure on a land consent directly attributable to the land will not be depreciable. In Queenstown Airport Corporation Ltd v CIR \[2017\] NZCA 20, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-002 the Court of Appeal considered that contouring, levelling, draining, excavation, filling and reclamation were inseparable from the underlying land and not likely to be subject to loss in value due to wear and tear or obsolescence: \[46\] Land (apart from certain specified land improvements) is not depreciable because, unlike other assets, it does not have a determinate design life after which replacement in whole or in part is expected to be necessary. Nor is it expected to decline in value over time through ordinary wear and tear. \[47\] The text of the ITA makes it clear that the items listed as improvements in schedule 13 are exceptions to the general rule that land is not depreciable. There is nothing to suggest Parliament intended that the generous approach advocated by the appellant should be adopted in interpreting the specified items. The structure of the relevant provisions does not support this. Rather, Parliament has chosen to specify the items it has concluded are to be treated as exceptions to the general prohibition on the depreciation of land. \[48\] The analysis in the 1992 officials’ paper we have set out above is helpful in identifying two relevant categories of land improvements. The first is improvements to the land itself such as contouring, levelling, draining, excavation, filling, reclaiming and making retaining walls. These were considered to be inseparable from the land and not likely to be subject to loss in value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. The second category comprises structures or other additions to the land itself that were considered likely to diminish in IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 44 IN CONFIDENCE value over time due to fair wear and tear. The examples given were fences, dams, cables and bridges. Since it was considered this category would be difficult to define, the list approach was prepared and adopted. \[49\] The items listed in schedule 13 clearly reflect this approach and may be regarded as improvements or additions on or under the land itself. The items listed are likely to be subject to fair wear and tear such that they would ultimately require replacement in whole or in part during their anticipated design life. \[footnotes omitted\] Accordingly, where a land consent is obtained for improvements to the land itself, such as contouring, levelling, draining, excavation, filling and reclamation, expenditure on the consent will not be depreciable. This is because the expenditure is directly attributable to the land, which is not depreciable property. However, expenditure on land consents for contouring, levelling, draining, excavation, filling and reclamation can still be depreciable where it forms part of the cost of a resulting item of depreciable property that is not land. This might be the case where, for example, a land consent is obtained to excavate foundations for a structure that is depreciable. The land and foundations are not physically or functionally distinct from the structure. Accordingly, the resulting item of property for depreciation purposes is the structure. This treatment recognises that where land is altered to accommodate a structure (eg, excavations for foundations), the altered land and the structure will often have a similar useful life. In summary, where the resulting asset is land, expenditure on land consents will not be depreciable. This may apply to consents for reclamation, earthworks, drainage, levelling or contouring. Similarly, subdivision consents will usually create an asset that is land, in which case there will be no depreciation (although expenditure on subdivision consents may be a cost of revenue account property and deductible this way). Buildings From the 2011–12 income year, the depreciation rate for buildings with an EUL of 50 years or more is 0%. Accordingly, where expenditure incurred to obtain a land consent forms part of the cost of a building of this type there will be no depreciation deduction. An example would be where a land consent is required under the district plan to construct a building (with an EUL of 50 years or more) within a certain distance of the boundary or to a certain height. Expenditure on the consent can be capitalised into the cost base of the building but because the building depreciates at 0% there is no deduction. Schedule 13 depreciable improvements to land In Queenstown Airport the Court of Appeal differentiated between improvements to the land (not depreciable) and improvements on the land (the items listed in sch 13 and depreciable). Expenditure incurred to obtain a land consent required to construct any of the items listed in sch 13 (eg, airport runways, dams, swimming pools, roads, fences) will be depreciable as such expenditure forms part of the cost of the item. Other depreciable property Where a land consent is required to construct or operate an item of depreciable property, the expenditure may form part of the cost of the item of depreciable property. Provided the consent has sufficient connection to be a cost of the asset it can be capitalised into the cost base of the asset and depreciated at the rate that applies to that item. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 45 IN CONFIDENCE Further examples The following further examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the general principles outlined in this statement. Example 13 is based on the lifecycle of an infrastructure project and focuses on a number of narrow issues and principles. Consequently, this is a simplification of what happens on infrastructure projects and the example assumes that the consent is only for the turbines and the example does not address different items of depreciable property nor different depreciation rates. Examples Example 11 – Expenditure on two land consents Incin-a-lot Ltd obtains a land consent to build a new chimney at their existing premises. It needs a land consent because the district plan places a restriction on building structures over a certain height. The expenditure on the land consent forms part of the cost of the chimney, which is an item of depreciable property. Consequently, the company can add the expenditure on the land consent to the cost of the chimney and depreciate it at the applicable rate. As a condition of the resource consent, the council requires Incin-a-lot Ltd to build an earth wall close to the state highway so that the new chimney is less visible from the road. The earth wall requires a land consent for the earthworks and contouring. The expenditure on the resource consent for the earth wall cannot be allocated to the cost of the chimney. The earth wall is functionally and physically distinct from the chimney. Expenditure to obtain the land consent is directly attributable to the earth wall. That means that expenditure on the land consent is capitalised into the cost of the earth wall. Example 12 – Land improvement or asset constructed on land Dave and Barbara’s charter boat business (see Example 6) has been so successful they now have a number of boats and employees. Their floating pontoon is no longer big enough for their business. They want to replace the floating pontoon with a large modern wharf. As part of the construction they must reclaim a strip of land at the water’s edge. This will strengthen the estuary bank to allow heavy construction vehicles to be used in the construction of the wharf. Amongst other things these vehicles are required to drive the supporting structure into the estuary bed. After construction the reclaimed land will be used as a picnic area for Dave and Barbara’s customers and staff. A reclamation consent is a type of land consent and not depreciable property. However, expenditure on land consents can potentially be part of the cost of the resulting item of property. Proper identification of the resulting asset is important because if the expenditure is part of the cost base of the wharf it is depreciable (wharves are depreciable under sch 13). If the expenditure is a cost of a non- depreciable land improvement (that is obtaining the reclaimed land) then there will be no depreciation deduction. Judgement is required to determine whether improvements to land should be part of the cost of the land or part of the cost of some other asset constructed on the land. It may depend on the nature and extent of the land improvements. In this particular case the wharf and the reclaimed land are distinct items of property. The wharf structure is built into the estuary bed not the reclaimed land. Functionally the reclaimed land and the wharf also serve different purposes. There are two items of property and the reclamation consent is directly attributable to the reclaimed land and not the wharf. Consequentially the expenditure is not depreciable. Example 13 – Major infrastructure project After the failure of its solar energy plant, Wild Coast Electricity Ltd (see Example 4) is searching for new wind power sites. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 46 IN CONFIDENCE Wild Coast Electricity engages a contractor to monitor wind readings at numerous sites across the Lower North Island. The contractor accesses the sites and prepares a report comparing the wind readings and suitability of the sites. The expenditure is not directed towards making tangible progress on a specific capital project. The cost of the report and amounts paid to farmers for site access are deductible under the principles in IS 17/01: “Income tax – deductibility of feasibility expenditure”. Based on the contractor’s recommendation, Wild Coast Electricity decides to go ahead and develop three sites in the Wairarapa, that they name Rimu, Kowhai and Kauri. Wild Coast Electricity wants to apply for land consents to erect wind turbines on the sites and commissions detailed environmental reports, drawings showing the placement of the turbines and an engineering report that contains all the specifications for the model of turbine being used. The reports will be used as part of the application. Rimu site The environmental report for Rimu shows that the site is close to the habitat of the Waiohine Robin, an endangered native species. A local volunteer group has been set up to protect the robins. They monitor bird numbers and set traps for predators. Although there are only a dozen volunteers they have a decent following on social media. The company gets an opinion from a specialist resource consent lawyer who believes the proximity of the Waiohine robin means it is 50/50 as to whether they will be granted resource consent. Costly mitigation strategies and additional legal costs are certain to affect the profitability. Wild Coast Electricity also thinks it will be a reputation risk and decides not to lodge an application for resource consent. Expenditure on obtaining a land consent for the construction and use of the turbines would have been able to be capitalised into the cost of the wind turbines and depreciated if the development went ahead. On this basis, s DB 19 allows a deduction once the company decides not to proceed with the development. The expenditure on the environmental report, drawings and legal fees can all be deducted under s DB 19. The engineering report is specific to the model of turbine and the report was to be used for the resource consent applications at all three sites. As the same engineering report will be used for the resource consent application at the other sites it is not appropriate to deduct the entire cost. In these circumstances a reasonable approach is an apportionment of a third to each site. However, a reasonable apportionment on some other basis may also be acceptable, for instance, in some circumstances it might be more reasonable to apportion the expenditure based on the expected number of turbines at each site. Kowhai site At the Kowhai site, access is over a farmer’s land and Wild Coast Electricity decides it wants an initial five-year easement. Wild Coast Electricity negotiates with the farmer for an easement and one of the conditions of the easement is that the company will put in a short single-lane metalled road over the farmer’s land that they will use for egress. They pay the farmer $15,000 for the grant of the easement and laying the metalled road costs a further $10,000. The easement is a right to use land under sch 14(5) and is depreciable over its fixed life. The metalled road is not owned by Wild Coast Electricity but is part of the cost of the right to use land and so can be capitalised to that easement and depreciated. Kauri site The development of the Kauri site looks promising. However, one close neighbour is a rural school. The resource consent specialist lawyer advises that without the school’s agreement the resource consent application is likely to end up in a contested Environment Court hearing. If opposed by the school, it will cost the company significantly more and there is a strong possibility resource consent would be blocked. Even if resource consent was granted the conditions imposed could make the development un-commercial. The school and Wild Coast Electricity enter into an agreement where the school will support the granting of the resource consent. In return, Wild Coast Electricity will build a new school playground away from any development on the other side of the school. Wild Coast Electricity goes ahead and builds the new playground at a cost of $25,000 and wants to know how this expenditure is treated for tax purposes. IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 47 IN CONFIDENCE To be deductible or depreciable the expenditure must be either deductible under the general permission, deductible under a specific provision in the Act or able to be capitalised into the cost of depreciable property owned by the company. To determine whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature it is necessary to apply the principles in Trustpower (and other case law), including considering the need or occasion giving rise to the expenditure. In this case, the need or occasion of the expenditure is to obtain the school’s agreement (or agreement not to object) to the resource consent for building the Kauri windfarm on terms that are commercially viable. The Kauri windfarm will be part of and extend Wild Coast Electricity’s capital structure. On these facts, the Commissioner considers the expenditure is capital in nature as it is a one-off cost incurred to expand Wild Coast Electricity’s capital structure. In this case the expenditure is not deductible under the general permission as it is capital. Where a taxpayer incurs capital expenditure on obtaining an item of property they would usually capitalise this to the cost of the property and (assuming it is depreciable property) depreciate the cost. The playground is not owned by Wild Coast Electricity and cannot be depreciated by it. A depreciation deduction is only available to the extent that the expenditure is a “cost” of an item of depreciable property owned by Wild Coast Electricity. The case law says a cost is “that which must be given in order to acquire something”. A transaction must be viewed in its commercial reality and assistance may be derived from common business practice. In this particular circumstance, the commercial reality is that the expenditure incurred under the agreement with the school is necessary to obtain the resource consent. On these facts the expenditure is directly attributable to the consent. The purpose of the expenditure incurred on building the playground is to acquire the consent and Wild Coast Electricity did not obtain any other property or asset to which the expenditure could be attributed. The expenditure is also necessary, proportionate and has a temporal relationship with obtaining the consent. Whether expenditure is a “cost” of an item of property will depend on the particular facts, but in this instance the $25,000 is expenditure that is a cost of obtaining the land consent to build the wind turbines. Kowhai site stalled The market conditions are such that a single development at the Kauri site will be sufficient to meet current demand, so Wild Coast Electricity decides to stall any development of the Kowhai site for the time being. A deduction under s DB 19 for expenses for the various reports for the Kowhai site is not available at this point because the project is stalled rather than abandoned. In the meantime, Wild Coast Electricity wants to store equipment at the Kowhai site. The site is logistically important to Wild Coast Electricity’s long-term operations and is also close to the Kauri site. Wild Coast Electricity applies for a land consent for a storage building. The consent is granted and a building with a useful life of more than 50 years is constructed. The expenditure on the land consent can be capitalised to the cost base of the building but in this case the depreciation rate is 0%. Consent obtained for Kauri site With the school’s support, land consent for the construction of the wind turbines at the Kauri site is granted. The consent is not depreciable as a stand-alone asset, has an unlimited duration and is not depreciable property that has a fixed legal life. However, the expenditure on obtaining the consent can be capitalised into the cost of the turbines and depreciated at the rate that applies to the turbines. One of the conditions imposed on the resource consent is that Wild Coast Electricity must monitor and keep a record of all bird strikes for the life of the turbines. As part of this, it must also provide an email address that members of the public can contact to report any hurt or dead birds. Expenditure on monitoring bird strikes is an ongoing and recurring part of Wild Coast Electricity’s business. It provides no enduring benefit. For Wild Coast Electricity, this sort of expenditure is revenue in nature as it is an ordinary incident of business and is therefore deductible. Kauri site expansion IS 18/06: 5 November 2018 48 IN CONFIDENCE After a couple of years, Wild Coast Electricity successfully negotiates the purchase of land adjoining the Kauri site from a farmer. Wild Coast Electricity applies for a new resource consent for stage 2, which will involve adding additional wind turbines. In applying for a new resource consent, Wild Coast Electricity reuses some of the reports from the previous application. The expenditure incurred on these reports has already been capitalised and depreciated. The reports were obtained and used specifically for the resource consent applications for stage 1 and in this circumstance it is appropriate that the entire expenditure is allocated as a cost of stage 1. If the developments had been contemporaneous an apportionment on a reasonable basis would have been appropriate.

This Interpretation Statement provides further guidance on directors’ fees by explaining when you must withhold tax from directors’ fees paid to non-residents, and how much you must withhold if you are required to do so. 2 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED If you pay directors’ fees to a non-resident director, you may be making a “schedular payment”. If you make a schedular payment, you must withhold tax from that payment and pay the tax you withhold to Inland Revenue. If you make a payment of directors’ fees that is not a schedular payment, then you are not required to withhold tax from that payment. Payments of directors’ fees to resident and non-resident directors have two main differences. The first difference is that directors’ fees paid to non-residents might be non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. If the income is non-residents’ foreign- sourced income, it is not subject to tax in New Zealand and you are not required to withhold tax from it. The second difference is that the non-resident contractor regime might apply. Some payments to non-resident contractors are excluded from being schedular payments. This means you do not need to withhold tax from these payments. Whether a payment of directors’ fees is a schedular payment largely depends on who you contracted with to provide directorship services and, in some cases, where those services are performed. Identifying who you contracted with Both non-resident individuals and non-resident entities, such as companies or partnerships, can provide directorship services to New Zealand companies. While the Companies Act 1993 requires the person holding the office of director to be a natural person, this does not mean contracts for directorship services must be with an individual director. Non-resident entities can contract to provide the services of a non-resident individual as a director, for example, an employee of a non-resident company or a partner in an overseas law firm. Therefore, the non-resident individual holding the office of director is not necessarily the person (or entity) that you contracted with to provide the directorship services. Knowing whether you have contracted with a non-resident individual or a non- resident entity is important for working out whether the directors’ fees you are paying for any directorship services have a New Zealand source. It is also important in the case of New Zealand–sourced directors’ fees when determining whether any of the exclusions to the schedular payment rules apply. This interpretation statement does not cover directors’ fees paid to non-resident executive directors who are employed under a contract of service to perform directorship duties. These fees will be “salary or wages” or “extra pay”, and will be subject to PAYE. They are excluded from the schedular payment rules under s RD 8(1)(b)(i) and (ii), respectively. Note that you may be paying “directors’ fees” to a person who you might not ordinarily consider to be a “director”. “Director” is broadly defined under the Act and may include: (a) a person occupying the position of director, even if they do not have the title of “director”; (b) a person who gives directions or instructions to a director, and that director is accustomed to act in accordance with those directions or instructions; (c) a person treated as being a director by any provision of the Act; and (d) for an entity without directors but which is treated as a company under the Act, any trustee, manager, or other person who acts like a director of a 3 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would act. Entities that are treated as a “company” under the Act include: (i) listed limited partnerships; (ii) unit trusts; (iii) incorporated societies; and (iv) other body corporates. Determining the source of directors’ fees Unlike when you pay directors’ fees to a New Zealand resident, when you pay directors’ fees to a non-resident you first need to determine whether the directors’ fees have a New Zealand source or a foreign source. If the directors’ fees you are paying have a New Zealand source, you need to consider whether any of the exclusions to the schedular payment rules apply to determine whether you must withhold tax from the payment. However, if you determine that the directors’ fees you are paying have a foreign source, the schedular payment rules do not apply, and you can make the payment without withholding any tax. Non-residents’ foreign-sourced income is generally not “assessable income”. The Commissioner considers that it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Act to require tax to be withheld from income that is not “assessable income”. The rules for determining the source of income – the source rules – are set out in s YD 4. The source rules relevant to directors’ fees paid to non-residents are in: • s YD 4(2) – Business in New Zealand; • s YD 4(3) – Contracts made or performed in New Zealand; • s YD 4(4) – Personal services in New Zealand • s YD 4(17D) – Income taxable under double tax agreement; and • s YD 4(18) – Any other source in New Zealand. How the source rules apply depends on the facts of each case. It is not uncommon for more than one source rule to apply to a particular amount of income. The specific source rules in s YD 4(2) to s YD 4(17D) are not “exhaustive”. Even if the specific source rules do not treat an amount of income as having a New Zealand source, that income may still have a New Zealand source under the general source rule in s YD 4(18) (Tillard v Commissioner of Taxes \[1938\] NZLR 795). This interpretation statement considers the source of directors’ fees paid to non- resident individuals (from \[15\]). It then discusses the source of directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities (such as companies and partnerships) (from \[32\]). Directors’ fees paid to non-resident individuals The Commissioner considers that directors’ fees a New Zealand company pays to a non-resident individual will, in most cases, have a New Zealand source, regardless of whether the directorship services are performed in New Zealand or from overseas. For clarity, a person attending a board meeting via videoconference from overseas is not considered to be performing directorship services in New Zealand. 4 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Non-resident individuals from most double tax agreement countries For non-resident individuals from most double tax agreement (DTA) countries (DTA countries) who are contracting in their personal capacity to provide directorship services to a New Zealand company, the directors’ fees they receive will have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D) regardless of where the directorship services are performed. Section YD 4(17D) provides: Income taxable under double tax agreement (17D) Income that may be taxed in New Zealand under a double tax agreement has a source in New Zealand. Section YD 4(17D) was added by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 and applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Most DTAs to which New Zealand is a party include a “directors’ fees” article based on the “directors’ fees” article found in the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD directors’ fees article). An OECD directors’ fees article permits New Zealand to tax directors’ fees that a New Zealand company pays to an individual who is resident in the other country. For example, art 16 of the Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 1972 (Australian–New Zealand DTA) states: Article 16 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Because art 16 of the Australian–New Zealand DTA permits New Zealand to tax directors’ fees paid by New Zealand companies to Australian resident individuals, those fees have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D). Example 1 illustrates this. The full texts of New Zealand’s DTAs can be found on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Example 1: Directors’ fees paid to non-resident individual from Australia Buttercup is a professional director resident in Australia. Royal Humperdinck Ltd (a New Zealand–registered company) asks Buttercup to act as a director because of her knowledge of the Australian market. Buttercup accepts and contracts in her own name. Royal Humperdinck Ltd agrees that Buttercup can attend up to six board meetings via videoconference per year. Buttercup must attend the rest of the year’s board meetings in person in New Zealand. In her first year as a director, Buttercup attends four board meetings via videoconference from Australia and attends the remaining eight board meetings in person in New Zealand. She comes to New Zealand for a total of eight days over a 12-month period, one day for each board meeting. Because art 16 of the Australia–New Zealand DTA gives New Zealand a right to tax all the directors’ fees that a New Zealand company pays to Australian resident individuals, all of the directors’ fees that Royal Humperdinck Ltd pays to Buttercup have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D), even though some of the directors’ fees were for meetings Buttercup attended via videoconference from Australia. As a result, all directors’ fees that Royal Humperdinck Ltd pays to Buttercup will be schedular payments. Therefore, Royal Humperdinck Ltd must withhold tax from 5 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED these payments unless one of the exclusions to the schedular payment rules applies. This scenario is continued in example 6 at \[59\]. Although most of New Zealand’s DTAs include an OECD directors’ fees article, some DTAs include alternatively worded directors’ fees articles that do not give New Zealand taxing rights over directors’ fees paid by New Zealand companies in all situations. Other DTAs, such as the DTA between the United States (US) and New Zealand, do not include directors’ fees articles at all. The US–New Zealand DTA, for example, deals with directors’ fees paid by a New Zealand company to a US resident (both individuals and entities) under art 7, “Business Profits”. Article 7 prevents New Zealand from taxing directors’ fees that a New Zealand company pays to a US resident, except where the US resident has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand and the directors’ fees are attributable to that permanent establishment. As a result, unless a US resident individual has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, s YD 4(17D) will not apply. Because of the differences between New Zealand’s various DTAs, not all directors’ fees paid to non-resident individuals from DTA countries will necessarily have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D). Directors’ fees paid to non-residents individuals from countries that do not have DTAs with New Zealand (non-DTA countries), cannot have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D) given the absence of a DTA. In situations where s YD 4(17D) does not apply, it becomes necessary to consider other relevant source rules. Source rules under s YD 4(4) and (18) The Commissioner considers that even where s YD 4(17D) does not apply, directors’ fees paid to non-resident individuals will, in most cases, have a source in New Zealand under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18), for example, when paid to: • a US-resident individual who does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand; or • a resident of a non-DTA country. Note that for residents from DTA countries without an OECD directors’ fees article, the DTA that New Zealand has with that country still governs the final New Zealand income tax result. Under s YD 4(4), employment income under s CE 1, which includes directors’ fees, has a New Zealand source if it is “earned” in New Zealand. Under s YD 4(18), the “catch-all” source rule, income has a New Zealand source if it is “derived”, directly or indirectly, from any other source in New Zealand. In several cases, when deciding the source of employment income, the courts have considered s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18) together for the same employment income. The test that courts have applied to decide where employment or personal services income is “derived” under s YD 4(18) is essentially the same test the courts have applied when deciding where employment income has been “earned” under s YD 4(4) (Case E46 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,277; Case H6 (1986) 8 NZTC 153; Case P17 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,115; and Dow Chemical Overseas Management Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,143). The approach used when considering issues of source, is that source is a “practical, hard matter of fact”, not a question of law. The question to be posed is, “Where would a ‘practical person’ regard the real source of the income to be?”. This 6 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED question involves balancing the factors for and against each potential source of that income (CIR v NV Philips’ Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868). When considering the source of employment income specifically, the New Zealand courts have referred to Australian case law, which sets out three main factors that need to be weighed to determine source, namely: • the place where the arrangement for the provision of the services was made; • the place where the services were performed; and • the place from which the payment was made. (For instance, see C of T v CAM & Sons Ltd (1936) 4 ATD 32; FCT v French (1957) 98 CLR 398; and FCT v Mitchum (1965) 113 CLR 401 (HCA).) While all three factors are relevant, in the absence of special circumstances, the “place of performance” will likely have a stronger influence on the source of employment income than the other two factors combined. However, this is not an absolute rule, and several New Zealand cases have held that amounts of employment income have a New Zealand source under the earlier equivalents of s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18), despite the services being performed overseas (Case E46 and Case H6). The courts reached this conclusion because of additional special factors identified in each case. The Commissioner considers that unlike most other roles, special factors exist for directors of New Zealand companies. Where directorship services are physically performed overseas, the following special factors diminish the importance normally given to the place of performance or strengthen the practical connection between the directors’ fees and New Zealand, such that those fees will most likely be found to have been “earned” or “derived” in New Zealand under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18) respectively: • Directors are unlike “ordinary” employees in that they have a special statutory connection with New Zealand. The office of director is a statutory position provided for by the Companies Act 1993. In addition, the Companies Act 1993 sets out who is permitted to hold a directorship and requires the details of directors (including their names and addresses) to be recorded on the New Zealand Companies Register as a matter of public record. • The Companies Act 1993 also sets out the duties and obligations of a director. These duties and obligations are owed in New Zealand and apply for the purposes of New Zealand law. • The amounts paid as directors’ fees are subject to certain statutory requirements under s 161 of the Companies Act 1993. • A director who fails to discharge their statutory duties faces the possibility of prosecution under New Zealand legislation, for example, the Companies Act 1993, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and Takeovers Act 1993. • Directors’ are often engaged for their knowledge and experience, rather than for the performance of a particular task. The Commissioner considers that because directorship services can be provided without physical presence in New Zealand, the place where the directorship services are performed carries less significance than it ordinarily would (Mitchum). Even where some or all of the directorship services are physically performed outside New Zealand, the Commissioner considers that a “practical person” would 7 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED conclude that directors’ fees paid by a New Zealand company to a non-resident individual have their “real” source in New Zealand because: • the director has a special statutory connection with New Zealand; • the contract is most likely formed in, and subject to, New Zealand law; and • payment is likely being made from New Zealand. Consequently, directors’ fees paid to non-resident individuals will, in most cases, have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18). However, because source is a question of fact and, ultimately, turns on the specific factors of each case, the Commissioner accepts that situations could arise where directors’ fees paid to a non-resident individual might not be found to have been “earned” or “derived” in New Zealand under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18) respectively. Example 2 illustrates this “balancing of factors” approach. Example 2: Directors’ fees paid to a non-resident individual from a non–DTA country Iocane Imports Ltd (a New Zealand company) appoints Inigo Montoya, a professional director resident in Venezuela, to be a director. Inigo has specialist knowledge of the industry and South American markets. Inigo contracts personally with Iocane Imports Ltd. The contract is formed in New Zealand, and payment is made by Iocane Imports Ltd from New Zealand. New Zealand does not have a DTA with Venezuela. Iocane Imports Ltd agrees that Inigo can attend all board meetings remotely via videoconference from Venezuela. Because New Zealand does not have a DTA with Venezuela, s YD 4(17D) will not treat the directors’ fees paid to Inigo as having a New Zealand source. However, the Commissioner considers that the directors’ fees that Iocane Imports Ltd pays to Inigo will have a New Zealand source because the fees will be employment income that is both “earned” (s YD 4(4)) and “derived” (s YD 4(18)) in New Zealand. The fact the services are performed in Venezuela may initially suggest the fees have a Venezuelan source. However, on balance, the Commissioner considers that given the contract is formed in New Zealand and that payment is made from New Zealand, together with the nature of directorships and their statutory connection with New Zealand, Inigo’s directors’ fees have a closer practical connection with New Zealand than to Venezuela. Therefore, Iocane Imports Ltd must consider whether the schedular payment rules apply to its payments of directors’ fees. Source of directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities The source rules relevant to directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities are in s YD 4(2), s YD 4(3) and s YD 4(17D). Directors’ fees that a non-resident entity derives from a business carried on in New Zealand will have a New Zealand source if the business is wholly carried on in New Zealand (s YD 4(2)). If the business is only partly carried on in New Zealand, directors’ fees will have a New Zealand source only to the extent apportioned under s YD 5. A business of providing directorship services is likely to be “carried on” in New Zealand to the extent that services are physically performed in New Zealand. Similarly, directors’ fees derived from a contract will have a New Zealand source to the extent they are paid for directorship services physically performed in New Zealand (s YD 4(3)) and as apportioned under s YD 5. For completeness, 8 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED s YD 4(4) does not apply to directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities, because only individuals can derive such fees as employment income. Apportionment of directors’ fees under s YD 4(2) and s YD 4(3) is determined by s YD 5(2) and (3). The directors’ fees apportioned to a New Zealand source for the purposes of s YD 4(2) and s YD 4(3) is the amount that would have been paid to an independent third party for carrying out the non-resident entity’s New Zealand directorship activities. This means the directors’ fees apportioned to a New Zealand source under s YD 5 may differ from the amount the New Zealand company has contracted to pay the non-resident entity for directorship services to be performed in New Zealand. That said, the amount apportioned under s YD 5 cannot exceed the total directors’ fees paid to the director. Where directors’ fees are paid as a global amount, it is necessary to identify the range of directorship services being performed. Once this has been done, the directors’ fees are to be apportioned to a New Zealand source in proportion to those services physically performed in New Zealand. Appropriate records, such as timesheets, will need to be maintained to substantiate the apportionment. The Commissioner considers that directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities are unlikely to have a source under s YD 4(17D) because directors’ fees paid to non- resident entities are not dealt with under the OECD director’s fees articles found in most DTAs. This is because although a non-resident entity may contractually derive directors’ fees, only individuals (natural persons) can derive directors’ fees “in \[their\] capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company”. Instead, directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities are covered by the “business profits” article found in many DTAs. “Business profits” articles generally prevent New Zealand from taxing the business income of a non-resident entity, except where that entity has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. If a non-resident entity has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, generally the directors’ fees it receives from a New Zealand company that are attributable to the permanent establishment will all be treated as having a New Zealand source under s YD 4(17D). Practically however, this scenario is likely to be rare. In situations involving a non-resident entity from a non-DTA country with a permanent establishment in New Zealand, s YD 4(17C) would likely give rise to a similar source result as produced for a non- resident entity from a DTA country under s YD 4(17D). Example 3 illustrates the more common position for an entity from a DTA country. 9 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3: Directors’ fees paid to a non-resident entity Westley is a professional director resident in Australia. ROUS Pest Control Ltd, a New Zealand company, has approached Westley to act as a director. Westley accepts and contracts with ROUS Pest Control Ltd through his Australian-resident personal services company, DPR Services Pty Ltd, of which Westley is an employee. DPR Services Pty Ltd does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Westley attends six of the 12 New Zealand board meetings in person and six via videoconference from Australia. Each meeting is five hours long. DPR Services Pty Ltd is paid $1,000 per meeting Westley attends, regardless of whether he attends in person. Valerie, the payroll manager for ROUS Pest Control Ltd, knows that s YD 4(2) and s YD 4(3) means only the directors’ fees paid to DPR Services Pty Ltd for directorship services physically performed in New Zealand have a New Zealand source to the extent apportioned under s YD 5. Valerie initially decides that because DPR Services Pty Ltd provides directorship services throughout the year, then the six days Westley spends in New Zealand attending the six board meetings represents just 6/365th of the total directorship services provided to ROUS Pest Control Ltd. On this basis, Valerie calculates that only $197.26 of the $12,000 of directors’ fees should be apportioned to a New Zealand source. Valerie decides to check with Vizzini, the company’s accountant. Vizzini correctly tells Valerie the portion of the directors' fees to be apportioned to a New Zealand source is the amount that would have been paid to an independent third party for carrying out DPR Services Pty Ltd’s New Zealand directorship activities (s YD 4(2), s YD 4(3), and s YD 5). Vizzini tells Valerie it would be inconceivable for an independent third-party director to receive only $197.26 for attending six board meetings in New Zealand. 10 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Vizzini advises that on the basis that the $1,000 DPR Services Pty Ltd receives per meeting represents what an independent third-party director would also receive for the same activities, then: • $6,000 of directors’ fees paid for the six meetings Westley attends in person will have a New Zealand source; and • $6,000 of directors’ fees paid for the six meetings Westley attends from Australia via videoconference will have a foreign source. The foreign-sourced directors’ fees are not subject to the schedular payment rules and can be paid without any tax being withheld. To decide if ROUS Pest Control Ltd must withhold tax from the New Zealand–sourced directors’ fees, the company needs to consider whether any of the exclusions to the schedular payment rules apply. Alternative scenario Vizzini asks Valerie what services the $1,000 per board meeting fee is intended to cover. Valerie confirms that the $1,000 is intended to cover time spent preparing for meetings, as well as other attendances, such as company correspondence undertaken between board meetings. Valerie also tells Vizzini that DPR Services Pty Ltd is likely to be providing at least some directorship services from Australia. Vizzini recommends that DPR Services Pty Ltd (that is, Westley) keeps accurate records of the time spent performing directorship services for ROUS Pest Control Ltd and whether those services are performed in Australia or New Zealand. These records show that for each five-hour board meeting, DPR Services Pty Ltd spends an equivalent amount of time performing other directorship services such as meeting preparation and correspondence. These other services are all performed in Australia. Accordingly, the source of the $12,000 of directors’ fees paid to DPR Services Pty Ltd over the year is apportioned as follows: • $3,000 of the directors’ fees relating to the six board meetings that Westley physically attends in New Zealand (25% of total time spent) have a New Zealand source; • $3,000 of the directors’ fees relating to the six board meetings that Westley attends via videoconference from Australia (25% of total time spent) have a foreign source; and • $6,000 of the directors’ fees relating to other non-meeting services such as preparation and company correspondence (50% of total time spent) also have a foreign source. For the foreign-sourced amounts, no withholding is required. ROUS Pest Control Ltd may be required to withhold tax from the New Zealand–sourced directors’ fees, so the company needs to consider whether any of the exclusions to the schedular payment rules apply. This is discussed further in example 4 at \[54\]. Flowchart 1 at the end of this statement summarises how the source rules apply to directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities and non-resident individuals. If the directors’ fees you are paying have a New Zealand source, then you need to consider the schedular payment rules and whether any of the exclusions to those rules apply to the payments you are making. These exclusions are discussed next. However, if the directors’ fees you are paying have a foreign source, they will not be subject to the schedular payment rules and can be paid without any tax being withheld. 11 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED How the schedular payment rules apply If a payment of directors’ fees to a non-resident has a New Zealand source, it will be a “schedular payment”, unless one of the exclusions in s RD 8(1)(b) applies. The exclusions to the definition of “schedular payment” are set out in s RD 8(1)(b): A schedular payment— ... (b) does not include— (i) salary or wages; or (ii) an extra pay; or (iii) a payment for services provided by a public authority, a local authority, a Maori authority, or a company, other than a non-resident contractor, a non- resident entertainer, or an agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company; or (iv) an exempt payment referred to in section 24H and schedule 5, part C, clause 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies 1 ; or (v) a payment for services provided by a non-resident contractor who has full relief from tax under a double tax agreement, and is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days in a 12-month period; or (vi) a contract payment for a contract activity or service of a non-resident contractor when the total amount paid for those activities to the contractor or another person on their behalf is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. The exclusions under s RD 8(1)(b)(i) and (ii), relating to payments of “salary and wages” and “extra pay”, are not covered in this item. These types of payments will arise only when a person is employed (under a contract of service) to perform directorship duties. The Commissioner considers that, in most cases, non-resident individuals who perform directorship services, do so as contractors (under contracts for service), not as employees. For further information on the exclusions under s RD 8(1)(b)(i) and (ii), see “IS 17/06: Income tax – application of schedular payment rules to directors’ fees” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 8 (September 2017): 7. The exclusions under s RD 8(1)(b)(iii), (v) and (vi), as they apply to directors’ fees paid to non-residents, are discussed next. Section RD 8(1)(b)(iv), which relates to exempt payments, is discussed separately in \[60\]. The discussion of s RD 8(1)(b)(iii), (v), and (vi) is grouped together because each of these three exclusions refers to “non-resident contractors”. Definition of “non-resident contractor” Section YA 1 defines a “non-resident contractor” as: non-resident contractor, in the PAYE rules, means a person who— (a) is not resident in New Zealand under subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand); and (b) undertakes under a contract, agreement, or arrangement (other than a contract of service or apprenticeship)— (i) to perform services of any kind in New Zealand: 1 This wording of s RD 8(1)(b)(iv) applies from 1 April 2019. Prior to 1 April 2019, s RD 8(1)(b)(iv) read, “a payment covered by an exemption certificate provided under section 24M of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or”. 12 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED (ii) to supply the use, or right to use, in New Zealand any personal property or services of another person For the purposes of considering directors’ fees paid to non-residents, the main requirement for being a “non-resident contractor” is that the non-resident individual or entity performs or provides services in New Zealand. Payments for services provided by a company (s RD 8(1)(b)(iii)) If you are paying directors’ fees to a non-resident company, you need to consider the exclusion under s RD 8(1)(b)(iii), which provides: A schedular payment— ... (b) does not include— ... (iii) a payment for services provided by a public authority, a local authority, a Maori authority, or a company, other than a non-resident contractor, a non- resident entertainer, a company in relation to a payment described in schedule 4, part J or part W, or an agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural company; or The definition of “company” is very wide and includes a variety of body corporates, such as limited liability partnerships, incorporated in New Zealand or overseas. Importantly, however, companies that are non-resident contractors are not subject to this exclusion. If you pay directors’ fees to a non-resident company for directorship services performed entirely from overseas, those fees are unlikely to have a New Zealand source, so will already be outside the scope of the schedular payment rules. In these situations, you do not need to consider the exclusion under s RD 8(1)(b)(iii). If you are paying a non-resident company for directorship services performed or provided in New Zealand, that company will be a non-resident contractor. As a consequence, s RD 8(1)(b)(iii) will not apply and, unless another exclusion applies, the directors’ fees you pay to that company for directorship services performed in New Zealand will be a schedular payment. Full relief under a DTA (s RD 8(1)(b)(v)) As noted in \[19\], most DTAs permit New Zealand to tax directors’ fees paid by New Zealand companies to non-resident individuals. As a result, s RD 8(1)(b)(v) is unlikely to apply to directors’ fees you might pay to a non- resident individual. This is because, regardless of whether they are present in New Zealand for no more than 92 days, they will not be entitled to full relief on those fees under a DTA, as required by s RD 8(1)(b)(v). However, if you are paying directors’ fees to a non-resident entity from a DTA country, any New Zealand–sourced portion of those fees you pay is likely to be excluded from the schedular payment rules under s RD 8(1)(b)(v). You need to consider s RD 8(1)(b)(v) only in relation to New Zealand–sourced directors’ fees (those paid for directorship services performed, entirely or in part, in New Zealand) because any foreign-sourced directors’ fees paid are not subject to the schedular payment rules in any case. 13 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Section RD 8(1)(b)(v) provides: A schedular payment— ... (b) does not include— ... (v) a payment for services provided by a non-resident contractor who has full relief from tax under a double tax agreement, and is present in New Zealand for 92 or fewer days in a 12-month period; or As noted in \[36\], most DTAs provide that income derived by a non-resident entity has full relief from New Zealand tax so long as the non-resident entity does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. If the non-resident entity you are paying does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand, you will still need to confirm that the non-resident entity has not been, and will not be, present in New Zealand for more than 92 days in a 12-month period. If a non-resident entity is entitled to full relief under a DTA but has been or will be present in New Zealand for more than 92 days, they may wish to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption for those payments (s RD 8(1)(b)(iv)), as discussed later at \[60\]. Entities such as companies have no “physical” presence of their own. For the purposes of s RD 8(1)(b)(v), where an individual (in most cases an employee) is physically present in New Zealand performing services on behalf of a non-resident entity, that entity will also be considered present in New Zealand. Examples 4 and 5 illustrate this. Example 4: Exclusion as full relief under DTA – s RD 8(1)(b)(v) In the alternative scenario of example 3, $3,000 of the $12,000 directors’ fees paid to DPR Services Pty Ltd were apportioned to a New Zealand source. Therefore, ROUS Pest Control Ltd must consider whether the schedular payment rules apply to those New Zealand–sourced directors’ fees. Under s RD 8(1)(b)(v), the New Zealand–sourced portion of the directors’ fees paid to DPR Services Pty Ltd is excluded from being a schedular payment because DPR Services Pty Ltd: • is a non-resident contractor because services are performed on its behalf through its employee, Westley, in New Zealand; • has full relief from New Zealand tax under the Australia–New Zealand DTA, since business income derived by the company in New Zealand is subject to New Zealand tax only if DPR Services Pty Ltd has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, which it does not; and • is not in New Zealand for more than 92 days, as prescribed in s RD 8(1)(b)(v). As a result, no tax is required to be withheld from the New Zealand–sourced portion of the directors’ fees that ROUS Pest Control Ltd pays to DPR Services Pty Ltd. 14 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Example 5: Directors’ fees paid to non-resident individual from the US Fezzik, a US tax resident, is approached by Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd, a New Zealand company, to be a director. Fezzik contracts in his own name to provide the directorship services to Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd. The contract is formed in New Zealand, and payment is made by Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd from New Zealand. Fezzik does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Fezzik physically attends half of Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd’s board meetings in New Zealand and the other half via videoconference from the US. As part of physically attending board meetings in New Zealand, Fezzik spends 10 days in New Zealand. On balance, the Commissioner considers the directors’ fees Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd pays to Fezzik have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18) regardless of where Fezzik physically performs the directorship services. The combination of the place where the contract is formed, the place where payment is made, together with the nature of directorships and their statutory connection with New Zealand, leads to the conclusion that Fezzik’s directors’ fees have a closer practical connection with New Zealand than the US. Because Fezzik performs some of his directorship services physically in New Zealand, he is a “non-resident contractor”. Furthermore, because Fezzik does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand, art 7 of the US–New Zealand DTA provides that New Zealand is not permitted to tax Fezzik’s directors’ fees. Therefore, the directors’ fees that Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd pays to Fezzik are excluded from the schedular payment rules under s RD 8(1)(b)(v) because Fezzik is: • a non-resident contractor; • entitled to full DTA relief from New Zealand tax on his directors’ fees; and • is present in New Zealand for 92 days or fewer in a 12-month period. Accordingly, Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd pays Fezzik his directors’ fees without withholding any tax. If Fezzik were to be present in New Zealand for more than 92 days, s RD 8(1)(b)(v) would not be satisfied. It is possible that some of Fezzik’s directors’ fees might be excluded from the schedular payment rules under the de minimis provision in s RD 8(1)(b)(vi). These exclusions are discussed from \[55\]. However, for all of the directors’ fees paid by Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd to be excluded, Fezzik would need an exemption\* from the Commissioner. Fezzik would be eligible to apply for an exemption because he is entitled to full relief under the US–New Zealand DTA (by virtue of not having a permanent establishment in New Zealand). \*Prior to 1 April 2019, this exemption would be given by the Commissioner in the form of an exemption certificate. De minimis for non-resident contractors (s RD 8(1)(b)(vi)) Directors’ fees that you pay to non-resident contractors (individuals or entities) for directorship services performed in New Zealand will be excluded from the schedular payment rules if the total amount of contract payments that the non-resident contractor has received, or will receive, for any contract services or activities performed in New Zealand do not exceed $15,000 in a 12-month period (s RD 8(1)(b)(vi)). 15 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Section RD 8(1)(b)(vi) provides: A schedular payment— ... (b) does not include— ... (vi) a contract payment for a contract activity or service of a non-resident contractor when the total amount paid for those activities to the contractor or another person on their behalf is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. Contract payment for a contract activity or service Section RD 8(1)(b)(vi) applies only to directors’ fees that are paid for directorship services performed in New Zealand by a non-resident contractor. The term “contract payment” is broadly defined under s YA 1 as being any payment that is not a reimbursement of expenses or other payment types that are not relevant to directorship services. However, a “contract activity or service” is defined narrowly and limited to activities or services performed in New Zealand. Accordingly, if you pay directors’ fees to a non-resident contractor specifically for directorship services performed in New Zealand, s RD 8(1)(b)(vi) will exclude those fees from the schedular payment rules as long as “the total amount paid for those activities to the contractor or another person on their behalf is $15,000 or less in a 12-month period”. This means contract payments for all contract activities or services are to be included in the calculation of the $15,000 cap, not just those received for directorship services and not just those you have paid to the contractor or another person on their behalf. Directors’ fees paid specifically for directorship services performed from overseas are not contract payments for a contract activity or service, so are not included in the calculation of the $15,000 cap. However, because directors’ fees paid specifically for directorship services performed from overseas are not contract payments for a contract activity or service, s RD 8(1)(b)(vi) does not exclude them from the schedular payment rules. Therefore, tax will need to be withheld from such fees unless one of the other exclusions to the schedular payment rules applies. Example 6 illustrates how the exclusion for exempt payments works, under s RD 8(1)(b)(iv). 16 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Example 6: De minimis exclusion under s RD 8(1)(b)(vi) Following on from example 1, Royal Humperdinck Ltd pays Buttercup $18,000 for attending all 12 board meetings during the year ($1,500 per meeting). Because Buttercup has performed some services in New Zealand, she meets the definition of a non-resident contractor. In the last 12 months, Buttercup has not received (and will not receive in the next 12 months), any other contract payments for New Zealand contract activities or services. The $12,000 of directors’ fees paid to Buttercup for attending the eight meetings in New Zealand constitute contract payments of $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. Therefore, s RD 8(1)(b)(vi) excludes those fees from the schedular payment rules. Royal Humperdinck Ltd may pay those fees without withholding tax from them. The $6,000 of directors’ fees paid to Buttercup for attending the four meetings from Australia are not contract payments for contract activities or services. Therefore, they do not count towards the $15,000 cap. However, because the $6,000 of directors’ fees Buttercup receives for attending the four board meetings from Australia are not contract payments for New Zealand contract activities or services, they are not excluded from the schedular payment rules under s RD 8(1)(b)(vi). Therefore, Royal Humperdinck Ltd must withhold tax from the $6,000 it pays Buttercup for attending meetings from Australia. It is important to note that even though Royal Humperdinck Ltd is not required to withhold tax from some of the directors’ fees it pays to Buttercup, Buttercup is still liable for New Zealand income tax on all the directors’ fees she receives from the company (see example 1 for details). Therefore, Buttercup may wish to ask Royal Humperdinck Ltd to treat the directors’ fees she is paid for attending board meetings in New Zealand as “voluntary schedular payments”. If Royal Humperdinck Ltd agrees to do so, it would need to withhold tax from all directors’ fees it pays to Buttercup throughout the year. This would reduce Buttercup’s final New Zealand income tax liability. Voluntary schedular payments are discussed at \[74\]. Exempt payments (s RD 8(1)(b)(iv)) Generally, if a non-resident individual or entity notifies you that they have an exemption for the directors’ fees you are about to pay them, you are not required to withhold any tax from those exempt payments. You do not need to include exempt payments, or the details of the person you are paying them to, as part of the employment income information you file with the Inland Revenue. Prior to 1 April 2019, the non-resident individual or entity would notify you of their exemption by providing you with an “exemption certificate”. Example 7 deals with exemptions. 17 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Example 7: Directors’ fees paid to non-resident individual from US This example is a variation of Fezzik’s situation discussed in example 5. Fezzik, a US tax resident, contracts in his own name to provide directorship services to Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd. The contract is formed in New Zealand and payment is made by Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd from New Zealand. Fezzik does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. Because Fezzik contracts in his own name, all of his directors’ fees have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(4) and s YD 4(18). Fezzik “attends” all board meetings via videoconference from overseas. By not performing any of his directorship services in New Zealand, Fezzik does not meet the definition of a “non-resident contractor”. This means the exclusions under s RD 8(1)(b)(v) and (vi) do not apply. Unless Fezzik obtains an exemption and notifies Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd of it before any payment is made, Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd must withhold tax from Fezzik’s directors’ fees. Alternative scenario Fezzik applies to the Commissioner for his directors’ fees to be exempt payments on the basis that under the US–New Zealand DTA, he is entitled to full relief from New Zealand tax on his directors’ fees. The Commissioner allows Fezzik an exemption for the directors’ fees, which Fezzik notifies Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd of before any payment is made. As a result, Fezzik’s directors’ fees are excluded from the schedular payment rules under s RD 8(1)(b)(iv), and Miracle Max Healthcare Ltd can pay Fezzik’s directors’ fees to him without withholding any tax. Flowcharts 2 and 3 at the end of this item summarise how the schedular payment rules apply to directors’ fees paid to non-resident individuals and non-resident entities that have contracted to provide directorship services to a New Zealand company. Your withholding obligations from directors’ fees Withhold at the time of payment If the directors’ fees you are paying are schedular payments and you are required to withhold tax from them, you must withhold at the time you make the payment. You are then required to pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue. You will also need to record details of the non-resident individual or entity you are paying, the amount of the payment, and the tax withheld as part of the employment income information you file with Inland Revenue. For further information about your PAYE record-keeping, payday filing and withholding tax payment obligations, see the Inland Revenue website. Select the correct withholding rate Different withholding rates may apply depending on who you are paying and the information they give you. Therefore, it is important you determine the appropriate rate for each person or entity you pay. 18 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Before you pay a schedular payment to a non-resident, they should complete a Tax Rate Notification for Contractors form (IR330C). The IR330C will record the person’s name and New Zealand tax number. If the non-resident you are paying wants to elect their own withholding rate, they also need to record this in the IR330C. Elected rates are discussed in \[68\] and \[69\]. If a non-resident has been given a prescribed rate or additional deduction rate by the Commissioner, they must notify you of this in their IR330C. Prescribed rates and additional deduction rates are also discussed in \[72\] and \[73\]. Default withholding rates If the non-resident individual or entity (other than a non-resident company) you are about to pay has not provided you with an IR330C recording their name and New Zealand tax number, you must withhold at the default withholding rate of 45%. The default withholding rate for a non-resident company is 20%. Prior to 1 April 2019, the default withholding rate was called the “no-notification rate”. Standard withholding rate is 33% If the non-resident you are about to pay provides you with an IR330C recording their name and tax number with no elected rate, and they are not subject to a prescribed rate or additional deduction rate, you must withhold tax at a rate of 33%. This is the standard withholding rate for directors’ fees. Because Schedule 4 provides a specific withholding rate for directors’ fees, this rate prevails over the “non-resident contractor” rate set out in Part A of Schedule 4, even though the recipient is also a “non-resident contractor”. Elected rates must be at least 15% A non-resident entitled to receive a schedular payment is allowed to elect their own withholding rate. However, the elected rate for non-residents (and temporary visa holders) cannot be less than 15%. A non-resident who wants to elect their own withholding rate must do so in their IR330C. As long as the elected rate is not less than 15%, you must withhold at that elected rate. A non-resident can change their elected rate. However, if that person has already elected to change the withholding rate twice in the last 12-month period, you are not required to withhold at the newly elected rate unless you agree to the change. Special tax rates You may be obliged to withhold tax at a different rate if the non-resident you are paying has received a special tax rate from the Commissioner. A non-resident can elect a withholding rate below the minimum rate of 15% only if they have been granted a corresponding special tax rate. If the non-resident you are paying directors’ fees to has elected a rate less than 15%, you must deduct at that rate only if they have notified you of their corresponding special tax rate. Prior to 1 April 2019, a special tax rate was issued in the form of a “special tax rate certificate”, which needed to be provided to the payer prior to payment being made. Where a non-resident has a 0% special tax rate, the directors’ fees you pay to them will still be schedular payments even though you will not need to withhold any tax. Because they are still schedular payments, you must record the payments, and details of the non-resident you are paying, as part of the employment income information you file with Inland Revenue. 19 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Prescribed rates and additional deduction rates Occasionally, the non-resident you are paying may have outstanding tax liabilities with Inland Revenue. In this situation, the Commissioner may have prescribed a specific withholding rate for that non-resident and may have also prescribed an additional deduction rate for you to withhold and pay to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue applies the additional deduction rate amounts to reduce a non-resident’s outstanding tax liabilities. You will be notified of this type of prescribed rate or additional deduction rate by the non-resident you are paying or by Inland Revenue directly. If you are notified of a prescribed rate or an additional deduction rate, you must withhold at those rates even if the person you are paying has elected a different rate. Voluntary schedular payments If you are going to be paying directors’ fees that are not schedular payments, the person or entity you are paying may nonetheless want you to withhold tax from those payments. If you agree to this, those directors’ fees may be treated as “voluntary schedular payments”. An agreement to treat non-schedular payments as voluntary schedular payments must be recorded in writing. If you have agreed in writing to treat certain payments of directors’ fees as voluntary schedular payments, you must withhold tax from those payments and pay the tax withheld to Inland Revenue, as you would for any other schedular payments. Deduct from fees net of GST and reimbursements Once you have determined the appropriate withholding rate for a payment, you must then apply that rate to the total amount of the schedular payment, exclusive of any GST charged. If you reimburse a non-resident for an amount they have incurred as a necessary part of performing their role as director, for example, the cost of flights to attend a board meeting, that payment is not a director’s fee. Accordingly, any reimbursement amount will not be a schedular payment, so you will not need to withhold tax from it. 20 IS 19/01 UNCLASSIFIED Flowcharts Flowchart 1: Source of directors’ fees paid to non-resident entities and non- resident individuals \* As discussed in \[23\]-\[31\], directors’ fees paid to a non-resident individual will, in most cases, have a New Zealand source under s YD 4(4) and (18).

The focus of this statement is setting out how the Commissioner will treat a lump sum payment received under a settlement agreement for claims that (if successful) would have resulted in receipts of both a capital and revenue nature. 2. Whether a settlement payment is taxable depends on what it is paid for – in this case, what was given up in return for the payment – and its nature in the hands of the recipient. It is essential to first determine what a payment is for before determining whether apportionment is necessary. 3. It has been suggested that two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and All sop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 4. Given this, where a single undissected sum is received, it should be apportioned between its capital and revenue elements where possible. Any apportionment must be made on an objective basis. The starting point for determining an appropriate apportionment will be the settlement agreement and any related documents (for example, the statement of claim (if there is one)). Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the agreement and other relevant evidence (such as evidence of any negotiations between the parties) should be considered. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer to show the apportionment is appropriate. 5. In the rare circumstance where the payment cannot be appropriately apportioned, the whole amount should be treated the same. Where the lump sum includes an 2 UNCLASSIFIED amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. Introduction 6. We have been asked to clarify the Commissioner’s position on how to treat lump sum payments made to settle claims partly capital and partly revenue in nature. There has been uncertainty as to how such payments should be treated. In particular, some people have taken the view that the lump sum should be treated as always wholly capital and, therefore, not subject to income tax. This is based on an interpretation of two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62. This item sets out the Commissioner’s view on this issue. Analysis How to determine whether an amount is capital or revenue 7. To decide whether a payment is capital or revenue, it is necessary to determine what the payment is for (Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). The character of a cause of action discharged by a payment will determine the nature of the payment (Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA)). Therefore, where a payment is received in return for settling claims, it is necessary to consider what the nature of any payment received would have been if those claims had been successful. A payment received to settle claims of a revenue nature would be revenue. A payment received to settle claims of a capital nature would be capital (Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092). This is regardless of the nature of the legal rights to make the claims for payment – that is, whether made in contract or tort or under statute or in any other way in which a right to claim may arise (London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll \[1967\] 2 All ER 124 at 134 per Diplock LJ). 8. Sometimes a payment will be made to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. As discussed below, in the Commissioner’s view, generally such payments should be apportioned. An exception to this is where one of the advantages sought is ancillary or incidental to the other. In such a case it may be proper to characterise the payment as wholly capital or wholly revenue (Buckley & Young (at 61,275): Difficulties of characterisation may arise where the director or employee agrees to resign and to give a restrictive covenant. The proper conclusion may be that the payment secures one advantage and the other provision is merely ancillary or incidental, not affecting the character of the payment (cf. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited v Dale (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) \[1932\] 1 K.B. 124, 139-140). In other cases distinct and separately identifiable advantages may be gained by the payment. There the payment is of a dual character. The statement of the problem highlights the importance of identifying the true character of the payment for which deduction is sought. \[Emphasis added\] In that case, it would not be necessary to go on and consider apportionment. 9. For an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C (and not exempt or excluded income). In the context of settlement payments, common provisions that could apply include s CB 1 (amounts derived from business) and s CE 1 (amounts derived in connection with employment). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “revenue” amounts in this statement assume that a provision in Part C would apply to treat the amount as assessable income. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 10. At issue is the tax treatment of a lump sum paid to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. Apportionment New Zealand approach 11. The Commissioner considers the approach of the New Zealand courts is to seek to apportion a payment into its capital and revenue elements wherever possible. This is demonstrated in Richardson J’s judgment in Buckley & Young – one of the leading New Zealand cases on apportionment. Although Buckley & Young considered the apportionment of expenditure rather than income, in the Commissioner’s view the same principles are relevant to both. Buckley & Young shows the approach of the New Zealand courts is to apportion where possible, rather than applying an all-or-nothing approach. However, an all-or-nothing approach can arise where the taxpayer fails to provide a reasonable basis for apportionment. 12. Buckley & Young concerned a series of agreements aimed at removing an unsatisfactory employee. The payments made were for both capital (restrictive covenant) and revenue (payment made to remove employee) elements. The contract did not specify how the amounts paid were to be apportioned. 13. Richardson J noted that the purpose of apportionment is to determine how much of an amount the parties have attributed to a particular item. This is done by considering the terms of the contract and, where relevant, the context and background to the agreement. Richardson J took the view that a situation where apportionment was impossible was likely to be rare and the fact an apportionment might be difficult was not, of itself, a reason not to apportion. 14. He also noted that “absolute precision” was not required, nor was it necessary that the apportionment could be “calculated by some kind of scientific process”. Apportionment cannot, however, be based on mere speculation and there must be sufficient evidence to justify the result. Ultimately, apportionment was not possible on the facts of that case as the taxpayer had not put forward any argument as to how apportionment should be made. 15. Case V8 considered the characterisation of a lump sum settlement payment. In that case, the taxpayer (the operator of a kiwifruit packhouse and storage facility) had filed a statement of claim alleging breach of contract by the supplier and manufacturer of an allegedly defective fruit-processing machine, misrepresentation and negligence. The taxpayer claimed compensation of $1,050,561.25. Mediation resulted in an out of court settlement under which the taxpayer received $170,000 from the designer of the machine and $100,000 from the manufacturer. The agreement included a denial of liability by all parties. It was also entered into in “full and final settlement of all issues between the parties in or in connection with” the proceedings. 16. Judge Barber considered that in determining the character of the settlement payment it was necessary to consider the statement of claim, the mediation agreement, the settlement agreement and the circumstances surrounding the case. As the mediation agreement referred to the attached settlement agreement and the statement of claim, these documents were intended to be read together. Judge Barber considered that the settlement payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for the losses specified in the statement of claim. 17. The taxpayer argued that, because the payment was received as a lump sum, it could not be apportioned between the ingredients of the original claim made by 4 UNCLASSIFIED the taxpayer. Judge Barber held that, as the payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for loss of profits and for repair costs as per the statement of claim, the settlement payment was income, being compensation for revenue losses. The judgment suggests that if it had been established that the settlement payment was compensation for losses of both a capital and revenue nature, apportionment would have been required. Unlike in Allsop (considered in more detail below), the fact that the agreement included a general clause settling all issues between the parties was not seen as relevant – even though there may have been capital claims that the taxpayer could have (but did not) bring. Foregoing the right to sue was an incident of settlement; it did not characterise the payment. 18. Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 related to personal grievance proceedings against an employer. The settlement agreement had been lost so the Taxation Review Authority had to consider whether (and how) a lump sum settlement payment should be apportioned (between revenue amounts (for loss of income) and capital amounts (for humiliation, loss of dignity and hurt feelings)). The taxpayer argued that the entire settlement payment was compensation for injury to feelings. 19. Judge Barber considered all of the available evidence and circumstances and chose to apportion the payments on a pro rata basis of the amounts claimed in the original proceedings. In his view, this was a fair apportionment (at 7,608): I consider that the non taxable element of the settlements needs to be now fixed by this Authority because it has heard the available evidence, and regardless of what limit may have been imposed by the Settlement Agreement. The issue must be what, in commercial and personal reality, was a fair apportionment of each settlement to compensation for feelings injury. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 involved an employment court award for wrongful dismissal. The Employment Court awarded Mr Sayer compensation including $62,142 as compensation for lost remuneration, $50,000 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings and $5,000 for costs (a total of $117,142). Mr Sayer applied to wind up the company and also took action against the directors and shareholders of the company for any shortfall that he might suffer as a result of the company’s liability to him, as well as interest and exemplary damages. 21. Mr Sayer entered into a deed of settlement and assignment with the directors and shareholders of the company. At that time, the company owed Mr Sayer $130,944.30. Under the deed of settlement, in consideration of the amount of $100,000, Mr Sayer agreed to assign to a second company all claims that he might have against the company and to release the directors and shareholders from any claims that he had against them. The deed provided that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration for the assignment of Mr Sayer’s claim against the company. 22. The Commissioner had assessed $50,000 as monetary remuneration and had attributed the other $50,000 to compensation for humiliation (capital). Mr Sayer argued that no part of the $100,000 was monetary remuneration as it was paid to bring about the discontinuance of his proceedings against the directors and shareholders (rather than to settle his dispute with the company). However, Doogue J considered that the deed of settlement made it clear that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration paid for the assignment of the claim against the company and that it was not possible to go behind the deed. 5 UNCLASSIFIED 23. The taxpayer also argued that the $100,000 could not be apportioned and must be considered as a whole. This was on the basis of McLaurin and Allsop (which are considered below). Doogue J rejected the taxpayer’s argument on the basis that it was not supported by the facts and distinguished McLaurin and Allsop on the basis that the settlement agreement in Sayer involved settling a claim for liquidated damages (which was squarely within one of the exceptions noted in McLaurin). 24. In Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 the majority of the Court of Appeal (Richardson J and Hardie Boys J) held that payments received under a contract for services were partly capital in character as the payments were received in return for both acting services (income) and for the restraint of trade (capital). The majority also held the payments could be apportioned. 25. In determining an appropriate apportionment, Richardson J was willing to take into account the TRA’s finding as to what level of fee would have been commercial in the circumstances (ie attributing a value to that element of the contract). This, in conjunction with implications from the contract, provided the basis for Richardson J’s conclusion that the TRA’s apportionment was appropriate. 26. On the other hand, Hardie Boys J appears to have been trying to work out from the contract how much the parties intended to allocate to each element (which he found in clause 11 of their contract). In the absence of any indication to this effect, Hardie Boys J suggested that apportionment may have been impossible. Conclusion on New Zealand approach 27. The New Zealand courts have tended to take a broad approach to apportionment. The default position is that the courts will apportion where there is a reasonable basis for doing so. In determining an appropriate apportionment, the courts have looked at the documentation between the parties, as well as the relevant context and background. United Kingdom case law 28. Two United Kingdom cases directly on point are Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL) and Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA). Both cases considered the apportionment of undissected lump sum settlement payments. 29. Wales v Tilley was a decision of the House of Lords (which was followed by the House of Lords more recently in Mairs (Inspector of Taxes) v Haughey \[1993\] 3 All ER 801). It concerned the managing director of a company. The company had agreed to pay Mr Tilley a salary of £6,000 a year and had also agreed to pay him a pension of £4,000 a year for 10 years after he ceased to be managing director. Mr Tilley agreed to release the company from the obligation to pay the pension and agreed to a reduced salary of £2,000 a year in consideration for a lump sum payment of £40,000 in two equal instalments. 30. The House of Lords held that, to the extent the payment was received for surrendering a right to a pension, it was capital and, to the extent the payment was made in consideration of a reduction of salary, it was income. There was nothing in the agreement that apportioned the amount between the two rights that had been surrendered. Nor was there any other evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. 31. Viscount Simon noted that if the court considered tax was due under one head but not the other, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, had accepted the amount should be treated as apportionable. On the same point, Lord Thankerton commented that, on the issue of practicability, Mr Tilley’s accountants had 6 UNCLASSIFIED provided a basis for apportionment. Lord Porter considered that although there were difficulties in determining the amount attributable to each component (which depended, for example, on when Mr Tilley’s employment ceased), it was not impossible to do so (at 285): It only remains, therefore, to see whether the sum attributable to the release of the pension can be separated from that payable for the reduction of salary. It was only faintly argued on behalf of the Crown that such a division was not possible; but it was said that there were no materials upon which such a calculation could be made inasmuch as the cessation of the salary and the commencement of the pension were dependent on many unascertainable matters, amongst others on the Appellant’s choice of the time of his retirement. No doubt there are difficulties but the resultant figure seems no more incalculable than, say, the length of time during which an injured workman would have continued to earn wages had he not received his injury, a period difficult no doubt to ascertain, but one which has constantly to be estimated in dealing with cases of personal injury. \[Emphasis added\] 32. Therefore, in considering whether an apportionment was possible, Lord Porter considered whether it was possible to objectively calculate the respective values of the rights given up in return for the lump sum payment. The fact the respective amounts would have to be estimated (as they could not be calculated exactly) did not mean apportionment was not possible. The case was referred back to the Special Commissioners to determine the appropriate apportionment. 33. A similar issue was considered by the UK Court of Appeal in Carter v Wadman. In that case, the taxpayer (Mr Carter) was employed as the resident manager of a public house for a salary of £10 per week plus a quarter share of the net profits of the business. The term of the agreement began on 30 January 1942 and ended on 24 June 1949. In 1942 the employer (Mrs Pierce) wished to assign the lease and the licence for the premises and to sell the goodwill, chattels and stock relating to the premises. Mr Carter’s consent to the assignment was required as it was a term of Mr Carter’s agreement with Mrs Pierce that she could not, without his consent, sublet or part with possession of any part of the premises or the goodwill or assets of the business, except in the ordinary course of business. 34. Mr Carter and Mrs Pierce entered into an agreement under which Mrs Pierce agreed to pay Mr Carter £2,000 in consideration of his agreeing to the transfer of the licence to the purchaser and in full settlement of “all past, present and future claims” he might have against her under the management contract. At the time the agreement was made Mr Carter had been paid his salary up to the cancellation date (2 December 1942), but his share of the profits for the 1942 year had not been calculated. In view of the agreement, Mr Carter could no longer make any claim against Mrs Pierce for a share of the profits. Subsequently, it was determined that Mr Carter’s share of the profits would have been £1,090. 35. The Court of Appeal had to determine whether any part of the £2,000 was employment income. It considered the payment was, in part, the price for the cancellation of the agreement and, in part, paid in settlement of past and present claims. One of the possible claims was for the taxpayer’s share of the profits up to 2 December 1942 (this would be employment income). The court considered it was possible to determine the value of the unexpired term of the agreement, at 52-53: Mr. Mustoe sought to argue that, as the consideration was one lump sum of £2,000, it was impossible to point to any portion of the £2,000 and say that it was a profit arising from his employment: but the Crown might equally well have argued that, as it was impossible to fix any sum which represented a capital payment, the whole must be income. ... But we respectfully agree with their Lordships \[in Wales v Tilley\] that in principle there must be apportionment, and we think that on the facts of the present case, though the calculation of the value to the Appellant of the unexpired portion of the agreement must be a matter of estimate, there is no insuperable difficulty in estimating its 7 UNCLASSIFIED value. \[Emphasis added\] 36. It can be seen from this that the court was concerned with apportioning the lump sum based on the values of the respective elements. Consistent with Wales v Tilley, there was no consideration given to trying to determine any agreement between the parties as to how the amount was made up. This emphasis on valuation is consistent with the order the court gave regarding apportionment when referring the case back to the General Commissioners. 37. The court found apportionment should be made on the basis of the proportion the sum of £1,090 (the share of the profits to which the taxpayer would have been entitled) bore to the aggregate of £1,090 and the sum the taxpayer would have been entitled to recover from Mrs Pierce as damages for breach of the employment contract, if he had been paid his salary and a share of profits up to cancellation date and had then repudiated the contract. Australian case law 38. The leading Australian cases on this issue are the High Court of Australia decisions in McLaurin and Allsop. The taxpayer in McLaurin had made claims for a total amount of £30,240 as compensation for damage to property as a result of a fire that had spread from a property owned by the Commissioner of Railways. Some of the claims were for amounts that were capital in nature and some for amounts that were revenue in nature. The Commissioner of Railways made a settlement offer of £12,350 and the taxpayer accepted it “in full settlement of all claims for damage arising out of” the fire. 39. The £12,350 lump sum offer was based on a valuation of the items of property for which the claims had been made, as carried out by a valuer employed by the Commissioner of Railways. There had been various discussions between the valuer and the taxpayer in the course of the valuer arriving at his valuation. However, the court found no information was given to the taxpayer as to how the amount was arrived at. 40. The Commissioner considered £11,000 of the compensation was income, being compensation for the revenue items claimed, determined on the basis of the valuation. The court accepted the valuation was based on a list of items supplied by the taxpayer and the taxpayer could make a confident guess as to the amount allowed by the valuer for each item claimed. However, the court considered the character of the payment in the hands of the recipient could not be determined by the payer’s (the Commissioner of Railways) uncommunicated reasons for agreeing to pay the amount. The court considered the offer made and accepted was for a single undissected amount (not payments for each individual item claimed). 41. The court accepted that it may be appropriate to apportion a single payment of a mixed nature made in settlement of specific claims where at least some of the claims are for liquidated amounts or are amounts that are “otherwise ascertainable by calculation”. In this context, the court referred to Carter v Wadman and Wales v Tilley. It gave Carter v Wadman as an example of a case that included liquidated claims and Wales v Tilley as an example of a case where some of the distinct claims were ascertainable by calculation. 42. However, the court considered apportionment was not appropriate where a payment is made only for claims for unliquidated damages under a compromise that treats the payment as a single undissected payment. I n such circumstances, the amount must be considered as a whole. The court considered the damage caused by the fire (whether included in the taxpayer’s claim or not) was 8 UNCLASSIFIED compensated for by one entire sum. There was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument that the settlement payment was income on the basis it had the same character as the profits the taxpayer would otherwise have derived. The court, therefore, held the entire sum was capital in nature. 43. The court was concerned with establishing what the parties had agreed the amount was paid for. It was not relevant what one party had originally claimed was payable. It was also not relevant what the other party was willing to pay for (ie the uncommunicated reasons of the payer for making the payment were not relevant). Further, there was no discussion of the possibility of valuing the respective claims given up and apportioning on that basis. This may be because the parties had not argued the case on this basis. 44. Allsop concerned a taxpayer who was in the transport business. The taxpayer had paid the Commissioner for Motor Transport permit fees totalling £54,868 and had been allowed deductions for the permit fees. Following a decision by the Privy Council that the fees were not legally payable, the taxpayer sought recovery of the fees paid on the basis that the amounts had been improperly demanded under the colour of office. A settlement was negotiated under which the taxpayer was paid £37,500. 45. The settlement deed was made without any admission of liability on the part of the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport. The deed provided that, in consideration of the payment, the taxpayer released the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport from all actions, suits, proceedings, causes of action, arbitrations, debts, dues, demands, costs, charges and expenses the taxpayer had in connection with or arising out of anything done or omitted to be done under the relevant legislation. 46. The High Court of Australia rejected the Commissioner’s argument that, as the payment was a refund of expenditure for which a deduction had been allowed, the amount was income. The court considered there was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument. 47. Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the taxpayer would have had valid claims against the Commissioner for unlawful interference with the taxpayer’s vehicles and his business (even though no such claims had been made by the taxpayer). As the settlement deed provided the amount was paid for the release of all potential claims, Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the entire payment was made by way of compromise of all claims the taxpayer had. No part of the payment was attributable solely to the refund of the fees paid. 48. Windeyer J held the consideration for the payment was the release of a variety of claims the taxpayer had or might be thought to have had against the Government. No part of the payment was received as a refund of permit fees paid by the taxpayer. In particular, Windeyer J appears to have been seeking evidence as to how the parties had calculated the amount before he would have been willing to apportion (at 65): It does not appear from the material before us that the sum of £37,000, or any definite part of it, was computed, paid and received as a refund of particular amounts that had been paid by the appellant for road charges and which had been allowed as deductions in the assessment of his taxable income. 49. The court did not consider attempting to value the respective claims given up. Rather the court seems to have been looking for evidence as to how the parties calculated the amount (ie what they agreed the amount was paid for). As the agreement contained (and, in that case, was limited to) a general release clause covering all potential claims, it was not possible to determine that any specific 9 UNCLASSIFIED amount was paid for any specific claim. The court, therefore, found the whole amount should be treated as capital. 50. McLaurin and Allsop have also been followed in later Australian decisions. In determining whether apportionment is possible, the courts have sought evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. See, for example, FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) at 4128: After negotiation, an entire sum of $200,000 was accepted. Its payment was the subject of agreement, but there was no agreement as to the way in which it was made up. The evidence as to the way the settlement was seen, from one side or another is scant. \[Emphasis added\] 51. The Court held that the entire amount was capital as the payment was received as a lump sum, the ingredients of which were not identified, so there was no basis for apportionment. Conclusion on apportionment 52. In the Commissioner’s view, the Australian and UK courts have taken different approaches to apportioning lump sum settlement payments. The courts in Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman were willing to accept apportionments based on objectively estimated values for different elements of the agreements. On the other hand, the High Court of Australia in McLaurin and Allsop seemed concerned with trying to find evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. In the absence of this, the courts found that no apportionment was possible. 53. Although McLaurin distinguished Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman, this, arguably, does not fully explain the different approaches to apportionment. The fact the agreement in Carter v Wadman included a liquidated amount did not appear to assist the court with determining any agreement between the parties. It was not a case where the court concluded an amount equal to the amount of the liquidated damages (in that case £1,090) was allocated to that head. In such a situation, it would be easier to argue that the parties had implicitly agreed on the amount to be allocated. However, the court found the £2,000 was paid as a lump sum to cover all of the rights given up. It found that £2,000 had to be apportioned according to the respective values of the different claims. In this regard, the fact there was an amount of liquidated damages was of no more assistance to the court than any other right that could be valued. 54. Similarly, the amounts making up the lump sum in Wales v Tilley do not seem to be any more easily “ascertainable by calculation” than the amounts in McLaurin or Allsop. 55. Neither McLaurin and Allsop nor Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman have been applied in New Zealand. The court in Sayer did suggest that, if the facts had been different, the taxpayer would have been able to argue that McLaurin and Allsop applied – however, this does not mean that such an argument would necessarily have been accepted. Rather, i n the Commissioner’s view, the broad approach taken in New Zealand apportionment cases is more consistent with the UK approach than the Australian one. It has been suggested that McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 10 UNCLASSIFIED 56. It is noted that McLaurin and Allsop have also been judicially criticised by the High Court of Australia (see FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001). In that case, the Commissioner was seeking leave to appeal to the High Court. He argued that McLaurin and Allsop should be overturned despite their longevity. Ultimately, although critical of McLaurin and Allsop, the High Court denied the application for leave to appeal. This was because the cases had stood for (at that time) 40 years and Parliament had not chosen to overturn them by legislation. This was despite a recommendation by the Asprey Committee in 1975 that specific legislation be introduced to apportion on a valuation basis. As McLaurin and Allsop have never been applied in New Zealand, the High Court’s reasons for not considering overturning McLaurin and Allsop are not relevant. However, their criticisms are equally valid in New Zealand as in Australia. How should an appropriate apportionment be determined? 57. Any apportionment must be undertaken on an objective basis. The ultimate aim of apportionment is to determine what the amount was paid for and to split it into its capital and revenue parts. As well as considering any settlement agreement, it is likely to be necessary to look at the surrounding circumstances and other, related documentation. 58. Where it can be established that the parties to the settlement have agreed how the payment is made up, this will generally be an appropriate basis for determining the apportionment between capital and revenue amounts. However, the Commissioner may not accept such an apportionment where taking into account the relevant circumstances, the amount allocated to the capital element is excessive, the agreement is a sham, or the agreement is part of a tax avoidance arrangement (see Case S96 at 7,606). 59. Often there will be no agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. The nature of settlement agreements is that they represent a compromise between parties with competing interests. For example, an employee may want a higher payment for hurt and humiliation, but their employer may prefer a higher payment for lost wages. Other times, the parties may care only about the total amount of the payment and may not have given any thought as to how it is made up. 60. Where there is no (or insufficient) evidence of how the parties intended the amount to be apportioned, it may be appropriate to calculate (or estimate) the value of the respective claims given up in return for the payment. 61. The terms of any statement of claim should be considered. How helpful a statement of claim is will depend on the particular circumstances. For example, a statement of claim is likely to be highly relevant where there is an express link to it in the settlement agreement (as in Case V8). At the other end of the spectrum, if the dispute was settled on a different basis to the statement of claim, it may be of little or no relevance in determining an appropriate apportionment (see du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD)). In situations in between, it is likely to be of some assistance along with evidence of later negotiations between the parties. 62. Evidence of negotiations between the parties prior to settlement and other background facts may also be relevant if they help determine what the payment was made for. 63. The relevance of a general clause releasing a party from all liability will be similarly fact dependent. In some circumstances, it will be included as an incidental element of a settlement agreement (as in Case V8 and Sayer). In other cases, it may be intended to cover one or more claims (as in Carter v 11 UNCLASSIFIED Wadman). This will generally be a question of characterisation, rather than apportionment. As discussed above, it is essential to work out what the payment is for before considering apportionment. In Allsop the agreement consisted entirely of a general release clause. In the Commissioner’s view, no apportionment would be required on the facts of Allsop as the full payment was made to settle a claim by the taxpayer of a revenue nature. 64. All relevant factors need to be considered when determining a reasonable basis for apportionment. Amounts that cannot be apportioned 65. In the Commissioner’s view, it will be possible to find an appropriate basis for apportionment in most situations. The taxpayer has the burden of proving that any apportionment is reasonable. Where a taxpayer does not make an apportionment, the Commissioner may, depending on the relevant facts and the information available, make an apportionment that the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. 66. There may be rare situations where no apportionment is possible. In these cases, the whole amount received should be treated the same. As noted above, for an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C. Where no part of the amount comes within a provision in Part C, none of the amount will be taxable. 67. However, where the lump sum includes an amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. This is consistent with Buckley & Young ( at 61,283): If there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a conclusion, any answer must be mere speculation and the taxpayer will have failed to discharge the onus of proof upon him ... 68. This is also consistent with the Commissioner’s position as set out in the Commentary to BR Pub 05/12 Taxability of payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings: Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is settled by the Human Rights Commissioner under the Human Rights Act. The onus of proof regarding the taxability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] 12 UNCLASSIFIED References Related rulings/statements “BR Pub 05/12: Taxability of payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 6 (August 2005): 4 “IS 16/04: Income tax – treatment of the receipt of lump sum settlement payments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 12 (December 2016): 33 Subject references Income Tax Lump sum Settlement payment Case references Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 (HCA) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA) Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092 du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD) FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001 Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA) Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 (CA) McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 (HCA) FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL)
Interpretation Statement IS 08/03 RESOURCE CONSENT APPLICATION FEES AND PROVISION OF WORKS, PROVISION OF INFORMATION AND TRANSFER OF LAND AS CONDITIONS OF RESOURCE CONSENT—GST TREATMENT Introduction All references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 1 Resource consent may be required for the use of land or other natural resources. A resource consent may be granted subject to conditions, including conditions requiring the consent holder to provide services or works, provide information relating to the exercise of a resource consent (such as information relating to measurements and tests required as a condition of a water discharge permit or an emission consent), or to transfer land. 2 Examples of conditions relating to the provision of services or works include: • a requirement to plant trees along a boundary to reduce the visual impact of a piggery activity: Ebben v Manuwatu-Wanganui Regional Council \[1994\] NZRMA 115; • a requirement to replant an orchard, upgrade packing facilities, attend to drainage work and clear up rubbish: Auckland Regional Council v Rodney District Council \[1994\] NZRMA 428; • a requirement that the applicant for a fertiliser works consent purchase farms affected by the proposal and owned by objectors if requested to do so within a three-year period: Lange v Town and Country Planning Appeal Board (No 2) \[1967\] NZLR 898; and • a condition requiring the construction of a road: Waitakere City Council v Estate Homes Ltd \[2007\] 2 NZLR 149. 3 The relevant local authority deals with applications for resource consent. 4 A fee is payable in respect of applications for resource consent. 5 The purpose of this Interpretation Statement is to consider the GST treatment of: • fees payable in respect of applications for resource consent; • the provision of services or works required as a condition of resource consent; • the provision of information as a condition of resource consent; and • the transfer of land as a condition of subdivision consent. 2 Summary Resource consent application fees 6 Resource consent application fees are consideration for the supply of services (considering and making a decision on an application for resource consent) by a local authority. GST is chargeable on the fees. Provision of works 7 Local authorities do not make a supply of goods or services for the provision of works required as a condition of resource consent. 8 If a resource consent is exercised and works required as a condition of resource consent are carried out, a supply of services may be made by the consent holder but this is not necessarily so in all cases. If a consent holder makes a supply of services by carrying out works, consideration is not given for the supply in the form of the grant of resource consent or for the supply of any other services by a local authority. GST is not chargeable on the supply of the provision of works by a consent holder who is registered for GST (that is, a registered person). 9 If a local authority pays compensation to a consent holder for works required as a condition of resource consent over and above the requirements of the activity for which consent is given, the compensation is consideration for the supply of services by the consent holder. If the consent holder is a registered person and the activity in respect of which the consent is given is carried out in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, GST is chargeable on the compensation paid. 10 If the activity in respect of which consent is granted is part of a taxable activity carried on by the applicant and the activity could not be carried out unless works required as a condition of resource consent are provided, an input tax credit is allowable in respect of goods and services acquired in order to carry out such works. Provision of information 11 Local authorities do not supply goods or services for the provision of information required as a condition of resource consent. 12 The provision of information under a condition of resource consent does not constitute a supply of services by a consent holder. Transfer of land 13 A local authority that grants subdivision consent subject to the transfer of land does not supply resource consent or any other services for the supply of land by the applicant. The transfer of land required as a condition of subdivision consent is not consideration for a supply of goods or services by a local authority. 14 The consideration for the transfer of the land as a condition of subdivision consent is the compensation paid by a local authority for the land (including any additional survey costs in respect of an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip over 3 and above the survey costs that the applicant is required to incur in respect of the subdivision). 15 If the subdivider is a registered person and the supply of land is made in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, GST is chargeable on the compensation received. 16 The local authority is entitled to a credit for input tax (GST charged on the supply of the land by a registered person or input tax in terms of section 3A(2)) on the compensation paid. Background Nature of resource consent 17 The Resource Management Act 1991 (“RMA”) prohibits the use of land or other natural resources in a manner that contravenes a rule in a district plan or proposed district plan (or regional plan or proposed regional plan) unless the activity is permitted by a resource consent or the activity is an existing use: sections 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 15A–15C of the RMA. 18 A resource consent permits the consent holder to do something that would otherwise contravene a provision of the RMA restricting the use of land, the subdivision of land, the use of water rights or the discharge of contaminants or waste: section 87 of the RMA. A resource consent is neither real nor personal property: section 122(1) of the RMA. 19 Generally, a resource consent commences when the time for lodging appeals against the granting of the consent has expired and no appeals have been lodged, or any appeal that has been lodged has been determined or withdrawn: section 116 of the RMA. A resource consent lapses on the date specified in the consent or, if no date is specified, five years after the date of commencement of the consent unless the consent has been given effect to or an extension of the consent has been granted: section 125 of the RMA. Local authority’s obligations 20 Applications for resource consent must be made to the relevant local authority: section 88(1) of the RMA. 21 The process that the local authority is required to follow in dealing with applications for resource consent is specified in the RMA. 22 The local authority’s district plan or regional plan is the framework within which resource consent applications are considered. The rules in a district plan take effect as regulations: section 76(2) of the RMA. Sections 104A to 104D of the RMA permits different degrees of control for different categories of activities. A district plan or regional plan determines whether an activity is a permitted activity, prohibited activity, controlled activity, discretionary activity or non-complying activity. 4 23 Section 77C of the RMA specifies that certain types of activity are prohibited activities. A resource consent is not required for a permitted activity and resource consent cannot be given for a prohibited activity: section 77B(1) and (7) of the RMA. 24 A consent authority has discretion as to whether to grant consent to discretionary or non-complying activities. If consent is granted for such activities, the authority may impose conditions: sections 77B(4) and (5) and 104B of the RMA. 25 A consent authority must grant a resource consent for a controlled activity “unless it has insufficient information to determine whether or not the activity is a controlled activity” and may impose conditions in respect of matters specified in its district plan or regional plan: sections 77B(2)(aa), (b) and (c) and 104A of the RMA. See Discount Brands Ltd v Westfield (NZ) Ltd \[2005\] NZLR 597. 26 Notice of a decision granting resource consent must be given within the time limit specified in section 115 of the RMA. Conditions 27 Section 108(1) of the RMA provides that “except as expressly provided in this section and subject to any regulations” a resource consent may be granted on “any condition that the consent authority considers appropriate”, including any condition of the kind referred to in section 108(2). The conditions referred to in section 108(2) include the following. • A condition requiring that a financial contribution be made. A “financial contribution” may be made in the form of money or land and money: see the definition of “financial contribution” in section 108(9) of the RMA. Where a local authority requires a financial contribution as a condition of resource consent under the RMA, the local authority makes a supply to the person who provides the financial contribution: section 5(7B). If a person makes a financial contribution in the form of land, the person is treated as supplying goods or services to the local authority: section 5(7C). • A condition requiring that services or works (including the protection, planting or replanting of any tree or other vegetation or the protection, restoration or enhancement of any natural or physical resource) be provided: section 108(2)(c) of the RMA. • In respect of a subdivision consent, a condition requiring the creation of an esplanade reserve or an esplanade strip: sections 108(2)(f) and 220 of the RMA. Land contributed for an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip as a condition of a subdivision consent is not a financial contribution: see definition of “financial contribution” in section 108(9) of the RMA. 28 A local authority may also include as a condition of resource consent a requirement that the consent holder supply to the local authority information relating to the exercise of the resource consent: section 108(3) of the RMA. 5 29 Conditions imposed under section 108(2) of the RMA must be for the purpose of the RMA, must fairly and reasonably relate to the permitted activity and must not be unreasonable: Waitakere City Council v Estate Homes Ltd \[2007\] 2 NZLR 149. 30 Section 108 of the RMA does not permit the imposing of a condition that has the effect that the resource consent will not be in existence until the condition is fulfilled: Director-General of Conservation v Marlborough District Council \[2004\] 3 NZLR 127 (at para 16). Fees 31 Section 36(1)(b) of the RMA permits local authorities to fix the charges payable by applicants for resource consent “for the carrying out of its functions in relation to the receiving, processing and granting of resource consents”. The scale for application fees for resource consent is set by the relevant local authority following public consultation: Harrison v Northland Regional Council 28 October 2003, Environment Court W67-03. A local authority may require the payment of an additional charge if the charge fixed under section 36(1)(b) of the RMA is inadequate to enable a local authority to recover its actual and reasonable costs: section 36(3) of the RMA. However, a local authority cannot recover more than its reasonable costs in dealing with a resource consent application: section 36(4) of the RMA. 32 Section 36(7) of the RMA authorises a local authority to refuse to take further steps in relation to a resource consent application until outstanding fees in relation to the application have been paid. Legislation Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 33 “Consideration” is defined in section 2(1) as follows. Consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: 34 Section 3A provides: (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means— (a) Tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) Tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) An amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). (2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if— 6 (a) The supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) The goods are not supplied by a supplier who— (i) Is a non-resident; and (ii) Has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) The goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and— (i) The taxable supplies are not charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r); or (ii) The taxable supplies are charged with tax at the rate of 0% under section 11A(1)(q) or (r) and the goods have never, before the acquisition, been owned or used by the registered person or by a person associated with the registered person. (3) The amount of input tax is— (a) If the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of— (i) The tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) The tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) The tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) If the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of— (i) The tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) The tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) The tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) If the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of— (i) The tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) The tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) The tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) If the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of— (i) The tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) The tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) In all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. (4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include— (a) The delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) The making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. (4A) For the purpose of subsections (1) and (2), if a supply of goods and services acquired by a non-profit body is not acquired for the principal purpose of making exempt supplies, the supply is treated as being acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 7 35 Section 5(7B) and (7C) provide: (7B) For the purposes of this Act, a local authority is treated as supplying goods and services to a person if the local authority requires a contribution from the person as— (a) A financial contribution that is a condition of a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991: (b) A development contribution under the Local Government Act 2002. (7C) For the purposes of this Act, a person who makes a contribution to a local authority is treated as supplying goods and services to the local authority to the extent that the contribution consists of land and is— (a) A financial contribution that is a condition of a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991: (b) A development contribution under the Local Government Act 2002. 36 Section 6(1) provides: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. 37 Section 8(1) provides: (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 38 Section 20(3)(a) and (b) provides: (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) Input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b); and 8 (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Input tax paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b), to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount; and ... Resource Management Act 1991 39 Section 36 of the RMA provides: (1) A local authority may from time to time, subject to subsection (2), fix charges of all or any of the following kinds: (a) Charges payable by applicants for the preparation or change of a policy statement or plan, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to such applications: (b) Charges payable by applicants for resource consents, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to the receiving, processing, and granting of resource consents (including certificates of compliance and existing use certificates): (c) Charges payable by holders of resource consents, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to the administration, monitoring, and supervision of resource consents (including certificates of compliance and existing use certificates), and for the carrying out of its resource management functions under section 35: (ca) charges payable by persons seeking authorisations under Part 7A, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to the allocation of authorisations (whether by tender or any other method), including its functions preliminary to the allocation of authorisations: (cb) charges payable by holders of resource consents, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to reviewing consent conditions, if— (i) the review is carried out at the request of the consent holder; or (ii) the review is carried out under section 128(1)(a); or (iii) the review is carried out under section 128(1)(c): (d) Charges payable by requiring authorities and heritage protection authorities, for the carrying out by the local authority of its functions in relation to designations and heritage orders: (e) Charges for providing information in respect of plans and resource consents, payable by the person requesting the information: (f) Charges for supply of documents, payable by the person requesting the document: (g) Any kind of charge authorised for the purposes of this section by regulations. 9 Charges fixed under this subsection shall be either specific amounts or determined by reference to scales of charges or other formulae fixed by the local authority. (2) Charges may be fixed under subsection (1) only— (a) in the manner set out in section 150 of the Local Government Act 2002; and (b) after using the special consultative procedure set out in section 83 of the Local Government Act 2002; and (c) in accordance with subsection (4). (3) Where a charge fixed in accordance with subsection (1) is, in any particular case, inadequate to enable a local authority to recover its actual and reasonable costs in respect of the matter concerned, the local authority may require the person who is liable to pay the charge, to also pay an additional charge to the local authority. (3A) A local authority must, upon request by any person liable to pay a charge under this section, provide an estimate of any additional charge likely to be imposed under subsection (3). (4) When fixing charges referred to in this section, a local authority shall have regard to the following criteria: (a) The sole purpose of a charge is to recover the reasonable costs incurred by the local authority in respect of the activity to which the charge relates: (b) A particular person or persons should only be required to pay a charge— (i) To the extent that the benefit of the local authority's actions to which the charge relates is obtained by those persons as distinct from the community of the local authority as a whole; or (ii) Where the need for the local authority's actions to which the charge relates is occasioned by the actions of those persons; or (iii) In a case where the charge is in respect of the local authority's monitoring functions under section 35(2)(a) (which relates to monitoring the state of the whole or part of the environment), to the extent that the monitoring relates to the likely effects on the environment of those persons' activities, or to the extent that the likely benefit to those persons of the monitoring exceeds the likely benefit of the monitoring to the community of the local authority as a whole,— and the local authority may fix different charges for different costs it incurs in the performance of its various functions, powers, and duties under this Act— (c) In relation to different areas or different classes of applicant, consent holder, requiring authority, or heritage protection authority; or (d) Where any activity undertaken by the persons liable to pay any charge reduces the cost to the local authority of carrying out any of its functions, powers, and duties. (5) A local authority may, in any particular case and in its absolute discretion, remit the whole or any part of any charge of a kind referred to in this section which would otherwise be payable. (6) Sections 357B to 358 (which deal with rights of objection and appeal against certain decisions) shall apply in respect of the requirement by a local authority to pay an additional charge under subsection (3). (7) Where a charge of a kind referred to in subsection (1) is payable to a local authority, the local authority need not perform the action to which the charge relates until the charge has been paid to it in full. 40 Section 108(2)(a), (c) and (f) of the RMA provides: A resource consent may include any one or more of the following conditions: 10 (a) Subject to subsection (10), a condition requiring that a financial contribution be made: ... (c) A condition requiring that services or works, including (but without limitation) the protection, planting, or replanting of any tree or other vegetation or the protection, restoration, or enhancement of any natural or physical resource, be provided: ... (f) In respect of a subdivision consent, any condition described in section 220 (notwithstanding any limitation on the imposition of conditions provided for by section 77B(2)(c) or (3)(c)): 41 Section 108(3) and (4) of the RMA provides: (3) A consent authority may include as a condition of a resource consent a requirement that the holder of a resource consent supply to the consent authority information relating to the exercise of the resource consent.\] (4) Without limiting subsection (3), a condition made under that subsection may require the holder of the resource consent to do one or more of the following: (a) To make and record measurements: (b) To take and supply samples: (c) To carry out analyses, surveys, investigations, inspections, or other specified tests: (d) To carry out measurements, samples, analyses, surveys, investigations, inspections, or other specified tests in a specified manner: (e) To provide information to the consent authority at a specified time or times: (f) To provide information to the consent authority in a specified manner: (g) To comply with the condition at the holder of the resource consent's expense. 42 “Financial contribution” is defined in section 108(9) of the RMA as follows. (9) In this section, financial contribution means a contribution of— (a) Money; or (b) Land, including an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip (other than in relation to a subdivision consent), but excluding Maori land within the meaning of the Maori Land Act 1993 unless that Act provides otherwise; or (c) A combination of money and land. 43 The conditions described in section 220 of the RMA include: (a) Where an esplanade strip is required under section 230, a condition specifying the provisions to be included in the instrument creating the esplanade strip under section 232: (aa) A condition requiring an esplanade reserve to be set aside in accordance with section 236: (ab) A condition requiring the vesting of ownership of land in the coastal marine area or the bed of a lake or river in accordance with section 237A: (ac) A condition waiving the requirement for, or reducing the width of, an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip in accordance with section 230 or section 405A: 11 Analysis 44 GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services in the course of a taxable activity carried on by a registered person by reference to the value of the supply: section 8(1). The value of the supply is the consideration paid for the supply. The activities of a local authority constitute a taxable activity: section 6(1). 45 Local authorities are registered persons for GST purposes. Applicants for resource consent may also be registered persons. 46 An input tax credit is allowable in respect of goods or services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: sections 3A and 20(3). “Purpose” means “the object which the taxpayer has in mind or in view”: CIR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,111; Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,003; Wairakei Court Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,202. 47 A principal purpose is the “main or primary or fundamental” purpose: CIR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services Ltd; Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; Case T39 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,261; Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR. Consideration 48 A fundamental principle of GST is that it is a tax on transactions. Therefore, not all payments received by a registered person will necessarily be consideration for GST purposes. GST is imposed on supplies, so it is necessary to identify a supply before there can be a liability for GST. For a payment to be consideration, there must be a sufficient connection between the payment and a supply: CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187, 13,193. 49 To determine whether a payment is consideration for GST purposes, it is necessary to consider the legal nature of the arrangement between the parties. In Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075, Blanchard J said (at para 17): Although the linkage or nexus between a payment and the activity to which it gives rise may be very broad, it is still necessary to have regard to the legal form which is being employed: ... in taxation disputes the Court is concerned with the legal arrangements actually entered into ... not with the economic or other consequences of the arrangements. (\[CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187, 13,192, citing Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694, 706, also reported as Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR; CIR v Marac Life Assurance Ltd (1986) 8 NZTC 5086 at pp 5,097, 5098\]). The tax being one on transactions, it is necessary to pay close attention to the legal nature of what has been done. The Crown does not of course suggest that it set up the transaction in a way which disguised or distorted its real nature. 50 There need not be a contract between the parties. The supply also need not be made to the person providing the consideration. See Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032. 12 51 The statutory definition of “consideration” includes, but is wider than, the contract law meaning of the term. However, the statutory definition of “consideration” (like the contract law definition) requires an element of reciprocity: Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147. 52 Therefore: • to determine whether a payment is consideration, it is necessary to consider the legal nature of the arrangement between the parties; • for a payment to be consideration, it is necessary to identify a supply and establish a sufficient relationship between the payment and the supply; • there need not be a contract between the parties, and the supply need not be made to the person providing the consideration. Whether fees payable in respect of applications for resource consent are consideration for a supply by local authorities 53 Section 36(1)(b) of the RMA permits a local authority to recover costs incurred in carrying out its administrative functions in relation to a resource consent (including certificates of compliance and existing use certificates). Existing use certificates and certificates of compliances are treated as if they are resource consents: sections 139(6) and 139A(9) of the RMA. The charges referred to in section 36(1)(b) of the RMA relate to all steps a local authority must carry out in the course of dealing with an application for resource consent: Wellington Regional Council v Aifric Developments (1996) 2 ELRNZ 265. 54 The fee payable in respect of applications for resource consent is not paid for the grant of resource consent. A fee is payable whether or not resource consent is granted: Harrison v Northland Regional Council (at para 17). 55 A local authority has a duty under the RMA to consider whether to grant resource consent and whether a resource consent should be subject to conditions having regard to the matters specified in section 104 of the RMA. Where an application for resource consent is made and the fee payable by applicants for resource consent is paid, a local authority has an obligation to consider and make a decision on the application in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the RMA. The fee is consideration for the supply of services (that is, considering and making a decision on the application) by the local authority. 56 GST is chargeable on the fees. If the applicant is registered for GST and applied for resource consent for an activity that is part of their taxable activity, they are entitled to an input tax credit in respect of the fees. 57 This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion in Question We’ve Been Asked “Building permit fees” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 8 (April 1993), p 13, which states that GST is chargeable on building permit fees (a similar transaction to the payment of resource consent application fees). 13 Whether provision of works is consideration for a supply by a local authority 58 Section 108 of the RMA does not permit the imposing of a condition that has the effect that a resource consent is not effective until the condition is fulfilled: Director-General of Conservation v Marlborough District Council (at para 16). 59 A resource consent may lapse (if the consent is not “given effect to” within the period specified in the consent or in section 125 of the RMA) without the works having been carried out. A resource consent gives the holder the right to carry out the activity permitted by the resource consent. However, the consent holder is not obliged to carry out that activity. 60 If a condition is imposed in respect of a resource consent requiring the provision of services or works, the condition relates to the applicant’s ability to carry out the activities for which consent is granted: Director-General of Conservation v Marlborough District Council (at para 17). In other words, if the holder of a resource consent exercises the resource consent, the consent holder must comply with the terms of the resource consent. A local authority may apply to the Environment Court for an enforcement order if a condition of a resource consent has been breached: sections 314 and 316 of the RMA. 61 A local authority is not entitled to retain a financial contribution if the activity permitted by a resource consent does not proceed: section 110 of the RMA. It would be inconsistent with section 110 of the RMA if a local authority could require the provision of works under a condition of resource consent if the activity permitted by the resource consent is not carried out. The provision of services and works is required to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of the permitted activity. These adverse effects will not eventuate if the activity is not carried out. 62 Resource consents are granted subject to conditions rather than for the performance of conditions. This distinction is similar to the distinction under contract law between consideration and a condition: Thomas v Thomas (1842) 2 QB 851. 63 The consent holder’s right to exercise the resource consent is conditional on the provision of works, but the provision of works is not consideration for resource consent or a supply of any other nature by the local authority. A resource consent takes effect and remains in existence for the duration of the resource consent regardless of whether works under a condition of the resource consent are carried out. Consent holders are obliged to carry out works required as a condition of resource consent only if they exercise the resource consent. A resource consent may lapse without the works required as a condition of the consent having been carried out. A local authority does not undertake any specific obligations in return for the provision of services or works. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that services or works required as a condition of resource consent are not consideration for the grant of resource consent or for a supply of any other nature by a local authority. 64 Specific legislation was required in order to make it clear that a requirement for the provision of a financial contribution as a condition of resource consent gives 14 rise to a supply by the local authority and that the provision of a financial contribution gives rise to a supply by the person providing the financial contribution: section 5(7B) and (7C). Sections 5(7B) and 5(7C) were intended to apply only to contributions made in the form of money and/or land (ie, “financial contributions” as defined in section 108(9) of the RMA). Sections 5(7B) and 5(7C) was not intended to apply to other types of conditions imposed under the RMA. Other types of conditions were omitted from the amendments because of the difficulty of valuing non-monetary contributions and because it was considered that the value of such contributions would not be significant: Inland Revenue Department and The Treasury (2003) Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003: Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill, Wellington: Inland Revenue Department and The Treasury, available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/files/offrep03.doc. Therefore, it was accepted that non-monetary conditions imposed in respect a resource consent would not result in a supply by the local authority. Whether provision of works is a supply by the consent holder for consideration 65 If a resource consent is exercised and works required as a condition of resource consent must be carried out. The provision of works or services as a condition of resource consent could constitute a supply by the consent holder but this is not necessarily so in all cases. Although “services” is widely defined, for services to be supplied, there must be some action that helps or benefits the recipient: Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408; F B Duvall Ltd v C of IR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,470. Generally works undertaken as a condition of resource consent are necessitated solely by the carrying out of the activity permitted by the consent. Therefore, it could be argued that services are not supplied by the consent holder as the provision of works is carried out for the consent holder’s own benefit (being undertaken to enable the activity permitted by the resource consent to be carried out). 66 For the provision of works to be subject to GST, consideration must be provided for the provision works in the form of money or in the form of a supply of goods or services by the local authority. Consideration need not be in the form of money: section 10(2). GST applies to barter transactions: Case T61 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,461; Lanauze v King (2001) 20 NZTC 17,360. Under a barter transaction, the supply of goods or services by one party is the consideration for the supply by the other party. If a local authority does not make payments of cash to a consent holder who has provided works or services, information or transferred land to the local authority, it is necessary to consider whether the local authority has provided consideration in the form of a supply of goods or services to the consent holder. 67 As local authorities do not grant resource consent and do not underake any obligations for the provision of works, it follows that local authorities do not provide non-monetary consideration in the form of a supply of goods or services for the provision of works required as a condition of resource consent. 68 There may be circumstances where a consent holder receives consideration in the form of money from a local authority for the provision of works. In 15 Waitakere City Council v Estate Homes Ltd the council paid compensation to a developer because the developer was required to carry out work in excess of the requirements of the development for which consent had been given. The payment of such compensation was required in order to make the condition reasonable. 69 If a consent holder receives compensation for carrying out works in excess of the requirements of the activity for which consent was given, the compensation is consideration for a supply of services by the consent holder. Such compensation is subject to GST, if the consent holder is a registered person and the activity in respect of which the consent was given was carried out in the course of furtherance of a taxable activity. However, in the absence of a payment in cash by the local authority, as a local authority does not supply goods or services for the provision of works, the supply of works by a consent holder would not be a supply for consideration (in the form of a supply of goods or services) provided by the local authority. 70 If the activity in respect of which consent is granted is part of a taxable activity carried on by the applicant and the activity could not be carried out unless works required as a condition of resource consent were provided, an input tax credit is allowable in respect of goods and services acquired in order to carry out such works. In such circumstances, although the provision of works may not be a taxable supply, the fundamental purpose of the acquisition of the goods and services is to enable the applicant to carry out the activity. On that basis, the goods and services would be acquired for the principal purpose of the taxable activity. Whether provision of information is consideration for a supply by the local authority 71 A condition requiring the consent holder to supply to the local authority information relating to the exercise of the resource consent may (among other things) require the consent holder to make and record measurements; take and supply samples; carry out analyses, surveys, investigations, inspections or other tests; and provide information to the local authority: section 108(4) of the RMA. This information is to be provided at the cost of the consent holder: section 108(4)(g) of the RMA. A requirement to supply information on an ongoing basis could be appropriate, for example, to a water discharge permit or an emission consent. 72 A local authority has a statutory obligation to monitor the exercise of resource consents in its area and to take appropriate action: section 35(2)(d) of the RMA; Woodland Farms (Ruawai) Ltd v Otamatea County Council 18 September 1985, Planning Tribunal A65/85, at p 4. 73 Under section 36(1)(c) of the RMA a local authority is entitled to charge a fee to holders of resource consents in relation to the carrying out of its functions under section 35 of the RMA. 74 The RMA contemplates self-monitoring by the holder of a resource consent, and a consent holder must establish that the exercise of the consent complies 16 with the conditions of the consent: Juken Nissho Ltd v Northland Regional Council \[2000\] 2 NZLR 556 (at para 36). 75 The purpose of a condition requiring the provision of information relating to the exercise of a resource consent is to enable the local authority to adequately police compliance with the terms of a consent: Alliance Freezing Co v Southland Catchment Board (1977) 6 NZTPA 247, 255; Juken Nissho Ltd v Northland Regional Council (at para 17). 76 Although the obligation of a local authority to police compliance with the terms of a resource consent is a separate and possibly more onerous obligation, local authorities have a right to charge holders of resource consents a fee to cover their costs in carrying out their monitoring function: section 36(1)(c) of the RMA. 77 For similar reasons to those outlined above, the Commissioner considers that the provision of information by the holder of a resource consent under a condition of resource consent is not consideration for the supply of a resource consent or for a supply of any other nature. No specific obligations are undertaken by a local authority for the provision of information. Whether provision of information is a supply by the consent holder for consideration 78 The Commissioner also considers that the consent holder does not supply services (in the form of the provision of information) to a local authority. The holder of a resource consent has an obligation to “self-monitor” compliance with the terms of a resource consent. . Consideration for the transfer of land as a condition of subdivision consent 79 Local authorities are authorised to grant subdivision consents subject to any of the conditions described in section 220 of the RMA. These conditions relate to the creation of esplanade strips or esplanade reserves, the vesting of ownership of land in the coastal marine area or in the bed of a lake or river, or the waiving of a requirement for or reducing the width of an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip. A condition relating to the creation of an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip is imposed in order to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of development and to meet the sustainable management objectives of the RMA: MacDonald v Christchurch City Council 3 October 2002, Environment Court C121/2002, at para 101. 80 Land for an esplanade reserve is transferred to the local authority. When an esplanade strip is created, an interest in land is conferred on the local authority. In some circumstances, land is transferred to the Crown as a condition of resource consent: see sections 231(1), 232 and 237A of the RMA. 81 Compensation is not payable when the allotment created by the subdivision is smaller than four acres: section 237E of the RMA. In other cases the amount of the compensation payable for the land or interest in land is to be agreed between the parties: sections 237E–237G of the RMA. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount of the compensation, the amount is to be determined in 17 accordance with the procedure specified in section 237H of the RMA. Any additional survey costs required in connection with the creation of an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip are to be taken into account in determining the compensation payable: section 237H(4) of the RMA. 82 A local authority that grants subdivision consent subject to the transfer of land does not supply resource consent or any other services for the transfer of land. The consideration for the transfer of land as a condition of subdivision consent is the compensation agreed between the parties or determined in accordance with the procedure in section 237H of the RMA (including any additional survey costs in respect of the esplanade reserve or esplanade strip over and above the survey costs that the applicant is required to incur in respect of the subdivision). 83 Accordingly, if the subdivider is a registered person and the supply of land is made in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, GST is chargeable on the compensation received. The local authority is entitled to a credit for input tax (GST charged on the supply of the land by a registered person or input tax in terms of section 3A(2)) on the compensation paid as the land is acquired for the principal purpose of the local authority’s taxable activity.
1 This is a reissue of the interpretation statement “Income tax treatment of New Zealand patents” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005). This new interpretation statement replaces that interpretation statement. There were some errors in the examples included in the previous interpretation statement. These examples have been corrected and some further text added to this interpretation statement to clarify certain matters raised in the examples. INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF NEW ZEALAND PATENTS 1. SUMMARY 1.1 This Interpretation Statement covers the income tax treatment for New Zealand patent applications, New Zealand patents and New Zealand patent rights, particularly: • patent applications, patents, patent rights and their depreciation; • costs incurred in legal proceedings; • proceeds and allowable deductions on the sale of patent applications and patent rights; and • patent-related expenses and proceeds under old legislative rules, which still apply in some circumstances. 1.2 All legislative references in this statement are to the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the Act”) unless otherwise indicated. The Act states that, except for the identified policy changes specified in Schedule 22A, its provisions are those of the Income Tax Act 1994 in rewritten form and they are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. Section YA 3(3) states: Intention of new law (3) Except when subsection (5) applies, the provisions of this Act are the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 in rewritten form, and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. 1.3 None of the provisions referred to in this statement are specified in Schedule 22A and it is considered that the position as to the law, set out in this statement, would equally apply to the income tax treatment of New Zealand patents under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. 1.4 The Act refers generally to “patent rights” rather than “patents”. Section OB 1 of the Act defines “patent rights” as meaning “the right to do or authorise the doing of anything that would but for the right, be an infringement of a patent”. “Patent” is not defined in the Act, but is defined in the Patents Act 1953 as meaning “letters patent for an invention”. It is considered that “patent rights” include the rights granted to the patent holder and also rights subsequently 2 assigned to other parties. In discussing the legislative provisions, this statement uses the term “patent” in those places which refer to a “patent”. Where the provisions refer to “patent rights”, sometimes for clarity, the discussion uses the terms “patent” and “patent rights”. 1.5 In summary, the conclusions of this Interpretation Statement are: • References in the legislation to a “patent” refer to the legal rights that the owner of the patent obtains as a result of the grant of that patent. In the case of New Zealand patents, this will be the legal rights obtained as the result of a patent granted under the Patents Act 1953. • Other intellectual property rights are not patent rights. • The treatment of expenditure on research and development for tax purposes, including that on the construction of prototypes, will be in accordance with: • section DB 25 for scientific research; • sections DB 26 and DB 27 for other research and development if the taxpayer both complies with the relevant requirements of FRS-13, and chooses to apply these sections; or • sections BD 2, DA 1 to DA 4 and DY 2. • The current statutory provisions relating to “patents” only affect income and expenditure incurred in the patenting process, i.e. typically the administrative and legal costs incurred in the application for the patent, not income and expenditure incurred in devising the invention to which the patent relates. • Legal expenses incurred in either defending or attacking a patent are generally revenue in nature. • For a person who devised an invention for which a patent has been granted and who uses the patent for deriving income, the person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993: section DB 29(2). • If the person who devised the invention sells the patent rights relating to the invention, a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred in deriving the invention to the extent that a deduction has not already been allowed under section DB 29(2): section DB 29(3). • When patent rights acquired on or after 1 April 1993 are sold, a deduction is allowed of the total cost to the person of those patent rights less total amounts of depreciation loss: section DB 31. • The disposal of patent rights is the disposal of a capital item unless it is the rare situation where the taxpayer is in the business of buying and 3 selling patent rights, in which case, patent rights are trading stock and their disposal is a revenue item. Patent rights, which are trading stock, are not depreciable. • An amount that a person derives from the sale of patent rights is income of the person, section CB 26. 1.6 The position in respect of patents applied for after section DJ 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994 (replaced by sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Act) came into force is considered first. (Section DJ 9A came into force on 24 October 2001, with application to the 2001-02 and subsequent income years.) Discussion of the statutory provisions relating to patents and patent rights applied for prior to the application of sections DB 26 and DB 27 is in the latter part of the statement. 2. BACKGROUND Patents, patent rights and income tax 2.1 Under the current legislation, patent applications, patents and the rights to use a patent are generally depreciable intangible assets which, when sold, give rise to assessable income. 2.2 A “patent” refers to the legal rights, granted to an applicant, to exclude others from using a particular mode of manufacture. The patent does not include the invention to which the patent relates. The depreciable value of a patent or a right to use a patent relates only to costs incurred in obtaining the patent. These costs are typically legal and administrative costs. As a result, research and development costs incurred in devising an invention, for which a patent is sought, are not included in the depreciable value of that patent or the right to use that patent. Former tax treatments of patents and patent rights 2.3 The tax treatment of patents and patent rights has changed several times. Before 1945, there was no specific tax treatment applicable to patents. Patents were capital assets under ordinary principles, unless the taxpayer was in the business of selling patents. 2.4 Under the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1945, provisions were enacted that dealt with the costs of devising the invention and purchasing patents. These provisions also dealt with the costs of granting, maintaining and extending patents, and the receipts from the sale of patents. Generally, proceeds from the sale of patents were assessable, the costs deductible and the income and deductions could be spread. A provision was also introduced relating to scientific research expenditure. 2.5 Further provisions relating to the depreciation of patents were enacted in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993 and the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, and, under the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997, the ability to 4 spread income derived on the sale of a patent provided for under section DJ 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now section DJ 28 of the Act) was removed. 2.6 Under the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005, a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 is included as depreciable intangible property under Schedule 17. The Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 also inserted sections EE 27B to EE 27D in the Income Tax Act 2004, which provide formulae for the respective annual rates to be used for the depreciation calculations of patent applications and patents. Patents generally The Patents Act 1953 2.7 In New Zealand, the Patents Act 1953 governs the granting of patents for inventions. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand, formerly known as the New Zealand Patent Office, administers the Act. Under the Patents Act, a person can apply for a patent for “any manner of new manufacture”. This may include a saleable article or commodity, an apparatus or a process. By preventing others from using that patented specification for a term of 20 years, the grant of a patent provides the applicant, now the “patentee”, with the sole right to exploit the patent for that period. The patent application 2.8 A patent applicant usually engages a patent attorney to file the patent application. Amongst other things, the work of the patent attorney will include the search of published patent specifications at the Intellectual Property Office before the application is filed. 2.9 The patent application may be filed with either a provisional or a complete specification of an invention. A provisional specification is a general description of the invention. A complete specification is a detailed description of the invention. In all cases, a complete specification must be filed within 12 months of the application. 2.10 After examining the application, the Office may accept and publish the specification. If no one opposes the application, the Office may then grant a patent for which a fee is payable by the applicant. The patent date 2.11 The date of the patent is the date that the complete specification is filed. Although the patent is not necessarily granted on this date, the 20-year term of the patent runs from this date. As a result, the patent expires at some time less than 20 years after the patent is granted. This is in accordance with section 30 of the Patents Act 1953, which states: 5 (1) Every patent shall be dated with the date of filing the complete specification: Provided that no proceeding shall be taken in respect of an infringement committed before the date of the publication of the complete specification. ... (3) The term of every patent shall be 20 years from the date of the patent. The effect of a patent 2.12 Following the grant of a patent, a patentee, as the patent holder, has a number of options. The patentee may license the patent rights to a third person, permitting that person to manufacture the patented article, or use the patented process, in return for a royalty. Alternatively, the patentee may exploit the patent by using the patented process themselves or by merely retaining the patent rights. Another option would be for the patentee to sell or assign the patent rights to a third person to similarly exploit. In each case, the holder of the patent rights can exclude others from the use of the particular patented specification. The patent holder is able to prevent others from making, using or selling the patented invention in New Zealand or importing the patented invention into New Zealand. When a patent or patent application is bought 2.13 When a person buys a patent or the right to use a patent, what is purchased is the right to use the complete specification for an invention. Provided the person is not purchasing an item, such as a prototype of a patented invention, and is only purchasing the patent, the purchase is of the patent rights and the complete specification. In this situation, there is no necessity for any splitting of the cost. The purchaser’s asset is the patent inclusive of the complete specification. Patents outside New Zealand 2.14 The Patents Act 1953 governs patents registered and applicable for use in New Zealand. Patents can also be registered in other countries and the relevant local legislation in any particular country may give the patentee rights to make, use, sell, or import the invention in that country. This statement only applies to the income tax treatment of patents and patent applications applied for or granted under the New Zealand Patents Act 1953. “Patent or the right to use a patent” does not include similar intellectual property rights 2.15 Although it may be suggested that other similar intellectual property rights are within the ambit of “patent”, for the purposes of the Act, the Commissioner’s view is that the word “patent”, in the Income Tax Act, refers to the rights registered, granted and protected as a patent. For New Zealand patents, these are the rights registered, granted and protected under the Patents Act 1953. This view is in accord, firstly, with the ordinary meaning of “patent” and, secondly, with the text of the legislation, which refers to different types of intellectual property in specific terms. An example is Schedule 17 of the Act. 6 Schedule 17 distinguishes, in some detail, between types of depreciable intangible property and lists both “a patent or the right to use a patent” and “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005” separately from other depreciable property. 3. LEGISLATION Patents Act 1953 3.1 Section 2, defines a “patent” and an “invention” as follows: “Patent” means letters patent for an invention: “Invention” means any manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies and any new method or process of testing applicable to the improvement or control of manufacture; and includes an alleged invention: \[emphasis added\] Income Tax Act 2004 3.2 The Income Tax Act 2004 has a number of specific provisions dealing with patents and patent rights. For ease of reference, these will typically be set out where appropriate in the body of the Interpretation Statement. However, the following provisions are key to the tax treatment of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in devising an invention that may be patented, both before and after the enactment of the specific research and development provision of section DJ 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994 (replaced by sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Act). Section DJ 9A came into force on 24 October 2001, with application to the 2001-02 and subsequent income years. 3.3 The general provision, section BD 2, states in respect of allowable deductions: BD 2 Deductions— An amount is a deduction of a person if they are allowed a deduction for the amount under Part D (Deductions). 3.4 Section DA 1 sets out the general permission. The section states: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. 7 General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 3.5 Section DA 2 sets out general limitations in respect of deductions. The section states: Capital limitation (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. ... Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7) Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. 3.6 Section DA 3 provides for the effect of specific rules on general rules. The section states: Supplements to general permission (1) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may supplement the general permission. In that case, a person to whom the provision applies does not have to satisfy the general permission to be allowed a deduction. Express reference needed to supplement (2) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to supplement the general permission only if it expressly states that it supplements the general permission. Relationship of general limitations to supplements to general permission (3) Each of the general limitations overrides a supplement to the general permission in any of subparts DB to DZ, unless the provision creating the supplement expressly states otherwise. Relationship between other specific provisions and general permission or general limitations (4) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ may override any 1 or more of the general permission and the general limitations. Express reference needed to override (5) A provision in any of subparts DB to DZ takes effect to override the general permission or a general limitation only if it expressly states— (a) that it overrides the general permission or the relevant limitation; or (b) that the general permission or the relevant limitation does not apply. Part E (6) No provision in Part E (Timing and quantifying rules) supplements the general permission or overrides the general permission or a general limitation. 3.7 Section DA 4 provides for the treatment of an amount of depreciation loss. The section states: 8 The capital limitation does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item of property is itself of a capital nature. 3.8 Section DB 25 provides for a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with scientific research. The section states: DB 25 Scientific research— Deduction: scientific research (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur in connection with scientific research that they carry on for the purpose of deriving their assessable income. Exclusion (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure that the person incurs on an asset that— (a) is not created from the scientific research; and (b) is an asset for which they have an amount of depreciation loss for which— (i) they are allowed a deduction; or (ii) they would have been allowed a deduction but for the Commissioner's considering that incomplete and unsatisfactory accounts were kept by or for them. Link with subpart DA (3) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 3.9 Section DB 26 provides that expenditure on research and development may, in some circumstances, be expensed by a taxpayer in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. This can apply to expenses incurred by taxpayers in research or development that may be intended to lead to a patent application. This section and section DB 27(1), which provides some definitions applicable to section DB 26, state: DB 26 Research or development— Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur on research or development. This subsection applies only to a person described in any of subsections (2) to (5) and does not apply to the expenditure described in subsection (6). Person recognising expenditure as expense (2) Subsection (1) applies to a person who recognises the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraph 5.1 or 5.2 of the reporting standard. Person not recognising expenditure as asset (3) Subsection (1) also applies to a person who does not recognise the expenditure as an asset for financial reporting purposes because of paragraph 5.4 of the reporting standard. Person recognising expenditure otherwise (4) Subsection (1) also applies to a person who— 9 (a) recognises the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes because of paragraph 2.3 of the reporting standard; and (b) would be required to recognise the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraph 5.1 or 5.2, or because of paragraph 5.4, of the standard if— (i) any 1 of those paragraphs were applied to the expenditure; and (ii) the expenditure were material. Person with minor expenditure (5) Subsection (1) also applies to a person who— (a) incurs expenditure of $10,000 or less, in total, on research and development for a tax year; and (b) has not treated the expenditure as material, as described in paragraph 2.3 of the reporting standard; and (c) has recognised the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes. Exclusion (6) Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure that the person incurs on property to which all the following apply: (a) the property is used in carrying out research or development; and (b) it is not created from the research or development; and (c) it is 1 of the following kinds: (i) property for which the person is allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss; or (ii) property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction by way of amortisation under a provision of this Act outside subpart EE (Depreciation); or (iii) land; or (iv) intangible property, other than depreciable intangible property; or (v) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 8 (Election that property not be depreciable) to treat as not depreciable. Section need not be applied (7) A person may return income and expenditure in their return of income on the basis that this section does not apply to expenditure incurred on research or development in the tax year to which the return relates. Relationship with section EA 2 (8) If expenditure to which this section applies is incurred in devising an invention that is patented, the expenditure is not treated as part of the cost of revenue account property for the purposes of section EA 2 (Other revenue account property). Link with subpart DA (9) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. DB 27 Some definitions— Definitions (1) In this section, and in section DB 26,— 10 development is defined in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the reporting standard as interpreted by paragraphs 4.3 to 4.7 Financial Reporting Standard No 13 1995 (Accounting for Research and Development Activities) means the standard approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, or an equivalent standard issued in its place, that applies in the tax year in which the expenditure is incurred reporting standard means Financial Reporting Standard No 13 1995 (Accounting for Research and Development Activities) research is defined in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the reporting standard, as interpreted by paragraphs 4.3 to 4.7. 3.10 In short, under section DB 26, the taxpayer is treated as having incurred expenses of a revenue nature, rather than expenditure of a capital nature, if the expenditure would be recognised as a revenue expense under the Financial Reporting Standards (No 13) 1995. Some of the relevant parts of Financial Reporting Standard No 13 (“FRS-13”), to which section DB 26 refers, are: 4 Definitions STANDARD The following terms are used in this Standard with these meanings: 4.1 “Development” is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. 4.2 “Research” is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 3.11 Paragraph 5 of FRS-13 provides for the treatment of research and development costs: 5 Financial Reporting Recognition of Research Costs STANDARD 5.1 Research costs shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Recognition of Development Costs STANDARD 5.2 The development costs of a project shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless the criteria for asset recognition identified in paragraph 5.3 are met. 5.3 The development costs of a project shall be recognised as an asset when all of the following criteria are met: (a) the product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably; (b) the technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated; (c) the entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process; 11 (d) the existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated; and (e) adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process. 5.4 The development costs of a project recognised as an asset shall not exceed the amount that is probable of recovery from related future economic benefits, after deducting further development costs, related production costs, and selling and administrative costs directly incurred in marketing the project. 3.12 Sections DB 28 provides for a deduction from a taxpayer’s annual gross income, for expenditure incurred in the patent process, if the taxpayer acquired the patent before 23 September 1997. Effective 1 October 2005 and with application for the 2005-06 and subsequent income years, section DB 28B provides for a deduction from a taxpayer’s assessable income in respect of expenditure they incurred in the patent process in relation to a patent application that is refused or withdrawn if the person “is not allowed a deduction under another provision”. These sections state: DB 28 Patent expenses— Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur in connection with the grant, maintenance, or extension of a patent if they— (a) acquired the patent before 23 September 1997; and (b) use the patent in deriving income in the tax year in which they incur the expenditure. Link with subpart DA (2) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. DB 28B Expenses of failed or withdrawn patent application Deduction (1) A person who applies for the grant of a patent and is refused the grant or withdraws the application is allowed a deduction for expenditure - (a) that the person incurs in relation to the application; and (b) that would have been part of the cost of fixed life intangible property if the application had been granted; and (c) for which the person is not allowed a deduction under another provision. Timing of deduction (2) The deduction is allocated to the income year in which the grant is refused or the application is withdrawn. ... 3.13 Section DB 28B only applies if the person is not allowed a deduction under another provision. However, for patent applications with complete specifications lodged on or after 1 April 2005 which constitute depreciable intangible property, section EE 41 allows an amount of depreciation loss on the cessation of the rights in the intangible property where the patent is refused 12 or the patent application is withdrawn. Section DB 28B does not apply in this situation. 3.14 Sections DB 29(1) and DB 29(2) provide for a deduction from a person’s annual gross income for expenditure incurred in devising an invention for which a patent has been granted, if the expenditure is incurred before 1 April 1993. Section DB 29 states: When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person incurs expenditure in devising an invention for which a patent has been granted. The section applies whether the person devised the invention alone or in conjunction with another person. Deduction: expenditure before 1 April 1993 (2) When the person uses the patent in deriving income in a tax year, they are allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993, but not if a deduction has been allowed for the expenditure under any other provision of this Act or an earlier Act. ... 3.15 Section DY 2 provides for amounts that are not deductions under Parts F to I. DY 2 Amounts that are not deductions under Parts to be rewritten— No deduction (1) An amount of expenditure or loss is denied as a deduction if it is denied as a deduction under a provision in any of Parts F to I. General permission (2) A provision in any of Parts F to I may, without expressly stating so, override the general permission or any provision that supplements the general permission. 4. PATENT APPLICATIONS, PATENTS AND PATENT RIGHTS: THEIR COSTS AND THEIR DEPRECIATION Summary 4.1 The Commissioner considers that a “patent” refers to the legal rights to exclude others from using a particular mode of manufacture. The patent does not include the invention to which the patent relates. 4.2 References to a patent application in the discussion below generally refer to “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005”, which is depreciable intangible property under Schedule 17. 4.3 The original patentee or the purchaser of the patent application, patent or patent rights may depreciate the cost of the patent application, patent or patent rights, using the straight line method of depreciation. Under this method, the cost of the patent application, patent, or patent rights is spread over the legal life of the patent rights. 13 4.4 Sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D, which came into force on 1 October 2005 and apply to the 2005-06 and later tax years, provide formulae for depreciation deduction annual rates for patents and patent applications. An amendment to section CB 26 also came into force on 1 October 2005 and this provides that an amount derived by a person from the sale of a patent application with a complete specification lodged after 21 June 2005 or from the sale of patent rights is income of the person. What is a patent? 4.5 Although the Act does not define “patent”, “patent rights” is defined in section OB 1: patent rights means the right to do or authorise the doing of anything that would, but for the right, be an infringement of a patent 4.6 Section 2 of the Patents Act 1953 distinguishes between “patent”, being the rights granted, and “invention”, being the subject of those rights: “Patent” means letters patent for an invention: “Invention” means any manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies and any new method or process of testing applicable to the improvement or control of manufacture; and includes an alleged invention: 4.7 The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed, 2001) defines “patent” as particular legal rights: Patent n. a government licence to an individual or body conferring a right or title for a set period, especially the sole rights to make, use or sell an invention. 4.8 Accordingly, the ordinary meaning of “patent” is the legal rights obtained by the grant of a patent and does not include the invention or any prototype of the invention that is the subject of the patent. The courts’ interpretation of “patent” 4.9 The Court of Appeal has considered what is meant by a “patent”. In Re Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc \[1994\] 2 NZLR 706, the Court held that the grant of a patent guarantees the patentee the right to exploit a specific invention without competition and in Pharmaceutical Management Agency Ltd v Commissioner of Patents \[2000\] 2 NZLR 529, Gault J stated: \[8\] The patent system rests on the policy that a limited-term monopoly will be granted as an incentive to innovation but subject to the invention and the best method of carrying it out being disclosed and made available to public use at the end of the term of protection. 4.10 Similar views have been expressed in decisions in Australia, England and the United States. This is illustrated by the cases referred to in the following discussion. 14 4.11 The High Court of Australia in The Grain Pool of WA v The Commonwealth of Australia (2000) 202 CLR 479 held that patent law was concerned with a monopoly right to exclude others from employing either a particular mode of manufacture or invention. The High Court referred to and quoted from the House of Lords’ decision in Steers v Rogers \[1893\] AC 232: What the letters patent confer is the right to exclude others from manufacturing in a particular way, and using a particular invention. (per Lord Hershell LC, p 235) 4.12 In the English case of Re Wardwell’s Patent (1913) 30 RPC 408, a similar view was expressed. In this case, it was held that the patent is not based on a physical entity called an invention, but on a specification upon which the patent is granted and from which, subsequently, a patented article may be manufactured. 4.13 In Butterworth (Inspector of Taxes) v Page \[1935\] All ER Rep 943, Romer LJ agreed that a patent is a right of monopoly. He stated: A patentee has, of course a monopoly, and that monopoly, which is a right of preventing other people utilising his invention, is a capital asset in his hands. (p 955) 4.14 In the Supreme Court of United States’ decision in United States v American Bell Telephone Co (1897) 167 US 224, Brewer J came to a similar decision. He stated: The only effect of \[the patent\] was to restrain others from manufacturing and using that which \[the patentee\] invented. (p 239) 4.15 There is, therefore, a common view across a number of jurisdictions that “patent” refers to a legal right to prevent others from using a particular invention. A distinction between a patent and an invention in the legislation Provisions for the tax treatment of patents acquired before 23 September 1997 and inventing expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993 4.16 Section DB 29 distinguishes between a patent and an invention. Section DB 28 applies to expenditure incurred by the taxpayer, in connection with the grant, maintenance or extension of a patent, for a patent acquired before 23 September 1997. This is expenditure incurred by the taxpayer solely for the patent process. In contrast, section DB 29(2), although only applicable to expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993, provides that where a patent has been granted for any invention, a deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the devising of the invention. 4.17 Section DB 29(1) sets out when section DB 29(2) applies. Section DB 29(1) refers to two processes; the grant of the patent and the devising of the invention. By providing for separate tax treatments for each process, section DB 29 indicates recognition that a patent and an invention, although related concepts, are not synonymous for the purposes of income tax treatment. 15 The arguments supporting the view that “patent” includes inventing costs 4.18 It can be argued that “patent” in the Act means the patent rights and the invention. 4.19 The strongest of the arguments in support of the view that the cost of a “patent” includes associated inventing costs for depreciation purposes, is that when the legislation was enacted to make patents depreciable, section DJ 6(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now replaced by section DJ 29(1) and (2) of the Act), which gave immediate deductions for inventing expenditure, was terminated. Therefore, although it might be suggested that those inventing expenses were intended to be depreciated with the cost of the patent to which they relate, this argument, in the Commissioner’s opinion, is inconclusive. 4.20 Although following the termination of section DJ 6(2), some expenditure incurred in devising an invention remained deductible, the deduction was limited. Before the introduction of section DJ 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994, which provided for deductions for expenditure incurred on research and development (now replaced by sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Act), the deduction was available only when the patent rights, to which the inventing expenditure related, were sold. This deduction, which is now provided under section DB 29 of the Act, is discussed in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3. It is considered that the intention of the legislation was not to depreciate the expenditure on the inventing process, but to limit the deductibility of such expenditure by linking it to the time at which income is derived from a patent or patent rights that result from that expenditure. The current provisions for the tax treatment of patents and patent rights 4.21 The current rules in the depreciation provisions refer to the cost of a “patent” only. Although there is no reference to the tax treatment of inventions, there is no evidence that the meaning of “patent” was intended to be changed to mean “the patent and the invention” under the current depreciation legislation. Had this been the intention, it would be expected that such change would have been explicitly made. As this is not the case, it is the Commissioner’s view that, in the depreciation rules, the patent costs means the costs of acquiring the patent and not expenditure incurred in devising an invention. 4.22 Further, the reference in section DB 26(8) to “... devising an invention that is patented” indicates an understanding that a patent and an invention, although intrinsically linked, are not synonymous. The invention may be the subject of the patent, but “patent” refers to the legal rights only. A patent is an intangible asset with a limited life 4.23 This interpretation of “patent” is consistent with the policy behind bringing certain intangible assets into the depreciation regime; a policy proposed by the Valabh Committee, in its Tax Accounting Issues paper published in February 1991. 16 4.24 The Committee’s recommendation was confined to intangible assets with a limited life. In this respect, inventions do not necessarily have a limited life. In contrast, a patent’s life is restricted by statute. Accordingly, it may be argued that an invention is not within the types of intangible assets that the Valabh Committee considered and recommended should be depreciated. Conclusion on the meaning of “patent” 4.25 Taking into consideration the ordinary meaning of “patent”, the view of the Court of Appeal, the referral to “patent and patent rights” in the Act and the enactment of section DJ 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994, (now sections DB 26 and DB 27, which provide for expenditure on research and development to be expensed in the year in which it is incurred), it is the Commissioner’s opinion that for tax purposes, “patent” refers to the legal rights granted to an applicant to exclude others from using a particular mode of manufacture. A “patent” does not include the invention that is the subject of the patent. Accordingly, the patent costs able to be depreciated are those costs incurred by the taxpayer that are directly attributable to the patent. 4.26 It is noted that this view, that a patent does not include the invention, is consistent with the way in which “patent rights” are defined in section OB 1. The definition of “patent rights”, set out above, refers to a right to do “anything which would, but for that right, be an infringement of a patent”. In addition, this reference to “an infringement of a patent” appears to endorse the view that, when the Act refers to a “patent”, it is only referring to the legal rights that are a “patent” and not also to the invention. The infringement is not of the invention. The infringement is of the right to use that invention. A patent application is made but a patent is not granted 4.27 Section DB 28B, which is effective 1 October 2005, provides that in some situations, where the application for the grant of a patent made by a taxpayer is refused or withdrawn in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they have incurred in relation to the application. Such deduction is allowed if the expenditure incurred would have been part of the cost of fixed life intangible property if the application had been granted and provided the taxpayer is not allowed a deduction under another provision for such expenditure. Such expenditure will include patent application fees and legal fees incurred in making the application. However, section DB 28B only applies if the taxpayer is not allowed a deduction under another provision. Depreciating a patent application, a patent or the right to use a patent 4.28 Under the Act, “a patent or the right to use a patent” and “a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005” are “depreciable intangible property” as defined in section OB 1 and listed in Schedule 17. Section OB 1 states: 17 depreciable intangible property is defined in section EE 53 (Meaning of depreciable intangible property) 4.29 Section EE 53 states: EE 53 Meaning of depreciable intangible property— Meaning (1) Depreciable intangible property means the property listed in schedule 17 (Depreciable intangible property). Criteria for listing in schedule 17 (2) For property to be listed in schedule 17 (Depreciable intangible property), the criteria are as follows: (a) it must be intangible; and (b) it must have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition. Schedule 17 prevails (3) Property that is listed in schedule 17 (Depreciable intangible property) is depreciable intangible property even if the criteria are not met. 4.30 Schedule 17 lists intangible property, which is depreciable. Items 3 and 3b on the list are: 3 a patent or the right to use a patent 3b a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005 4.31 Therefore, a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005, a patent or the right to use a patent is depreciable, providing the other requirements for depreciation are met. However, depreciation of a patent or patent rights can only be claimed when the patent rights are used or available for use in deriving income. If an asset has not been used or is not available for use in deriving income or in a business, section FB 7, which is set out in paragraph 4.43, provides for an adjustment in the depreciation calculation to reflect this. Depreciation method effective prior to 1 October 2005 4.32 The following discussion relates to the depreciation method for patents generally. However, effective 1 October 2005, the calculations of annual rates to be used for the depreciation of patent applications and patents will be in accordance with sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D. These are discussed in paragraph 4.46. 4.33 Sections EE 12(1) and EE 12(2) provide that the straight-line method of depreciation must be used to calculate depreciation for “fixed life intangible property”. The section states: EE 12 Depreciation methods— Meaning of depreciation method 18 (1) Depreciation method means a method that a person may use to calculate an amount of depreciation loss. Methods described (2) The depreciation methods are— ... (b) the straight-line method, which— (i) may be used for any item of depreciable property; and (ii) must be used for an item of fixed life intangible property: ... \[emphasis added\] 4.34 The straight-line method, as defined in section OB 1, requires that each year, a constant percentage of the cost of the property to the taxpayer is deducted from the property’s adjusted tax value. straight-line method, for depreciation, is defined in section EE 58 (Other definitions) 4.35 Section EE 58 states that in the Act: straight-line method means the method of calculating an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property by subtracting, in each income year, a constant percentage of the item's cost, to its owner, from the item's adjusted tax value 4.36 Because a patent or the right to use a patent is depreciable property with a legal life which, on acquisition, can reasonably be expected to be the same as the property’s remaining useful life, a patent or the right to use a patent is also “fixed life intangible property” as defined in section OB 1. fixed life intangible property is defined in section EE 58 (Other definitions) 4.37 Section EE 58 states that in the Act: fixed life intangible property means property that— (a) is depreciable intangible property; and (b) has a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of the property's acquisition, to be the same length as the property's remaining estimated useful life 4.38 “Legal life” is defined in section OB 1: legal life is defined in section EE 58 (Other definitions) 4.39 Section EE 58 states that in the Act: legal life means the number of years, months, and days for which an owner's interest in an item of intangible property exists under the contract or statute that creates the owner's interest, assuming that the owner exercises any rights of renewal or extension that are either essentially unconditional or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees 4.40 Accordingly, the legal life of the patent or the right to use a patent is required to be calculated assuming rights of renewal are exercised. (For patents registered in New Zealand, renewal fees are payable in years 4, 7, 10 and 13 19 and the legal life of a patent is 20 years. If the holder of a patent does not exercise the rights of renewal, the patent expires and the Act treats this situation as a disposal of the patent and, as a result, the cost of the patent, not already depreciated, is deductible.) 4.41 Section EE 27(3), however, modifies the definition of “legal life”. If section EE 19 applies, the legal life of the intangible property is from the start of the income year in which it was acquired by the taxpayer who incurs additional costs. Section EE 27 effective prior to 1 October 2005 states: EE 27 Annual rate for fixed life intangible property— What this section is about (1) This section is about the annual rate that applies to an item of fixed life intangible property (not including an item of excluded depreciable property, for which a rate is set in section EZ 14 (Annual rate for excluded depreciable property: 1992-93 tax year)). Rate (2) The rate is the rate calculated using the formula— 1 legal life Definition of item in formula (3) In the formula, “legal life” is,— (a) if section EE 19 applies, the item's remaining legal life from the start of the income year in which a person incurs the additional costs referred to in that section: (b) if section EE 19 does not apply, the item's remaining legal life from the time at which a person acquires it. How rate expressed (4) The rate given by the formula is expressed as a decimal and rounded to 2 decimal places, with numbers at the midpoint or greater being rounded up and other numbers being rounded down. \[emphasis added\] 4.42 Section EE 19 states: EE 19 Cost: fixed life intangible property— When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a person owns an item of fixed life intangible property; and (b) the person incurs additional costs in an income year for the item; and (c) the person is denied a deduction for the additional costs other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. Additional costs for fixed life intangible property (2) For the purposes of the formula in section EE 16, the item's cost at the start of the income year is treated as being the total of— (a) the item's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (b) the additional costs the person incurs. 20 4.43 If, for part of an income year, the patent or patent rights are not used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in a business carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable income, section FB 7 provides a formula by which the depreciation deduction is reduced to reflect the period during which the patent or patent rights were used or available to derive income. This section states: FB 7 Depreciation: partial income-producing use— (1) Subsection (2) applies when— (a) a person has an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property for an income year, other than an amount arising under section EE 41(2); and (b) at a time during the income year, the item is partly used, or is partly available for use, by the person— (i) in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; or (ii) in a way that is subject to fringe benefit tax; and (c) at the same time, the item is partly used, or is partly available for use, by the person for a use that falls outside both paragraph (b)(i) and (ii); and (d) the item is not a motor vehicle to which subpart DE applies. (2) The deduction the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss must not be more than the amount calculated using the formula— depreciation loss x qualifying use days all days (3) In the formula,— (a) depreciation loss means the amount of depreciation loss for the income year: (b) qualifying use days means the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it, or has it available for use, for a use that falls within subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii): (c) all days means the number of days in the income year on which the person owns the item and uses it or has it available for use. (4) A unit of measurement other than days, whether relating to time, distance, or anything else, is to be used in the formula if it achieves a more appropriate apportionment. (5) Subsection (6) applies when— (a) a person has an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property arising under section EE 41(2); and (b) the item was, at any time during the period the person owned it, dealt with in— (i) subsection (2); or (ii) any applicable paragraph in section EZ 10; and (c) the item is not a motor vehicle to which subpart DE applies. (6) The deduction the person has for the amount of depreciation loss is calculated using the formula— disposal depreciation loss x all deductions (base value – adjusted tax value) (7) In the formula,— (a) disposal depreciation loss is the amount resulting from a calculation made for the item under section EE 41(2): (b) all deductions is all amounts of depreciation loss relating to the item for which the person has been allowed a deduction in each of the income years in which the person has owned the item: 21 (c) base value has the applicable one of the meanings in sections EE 48 to EE 50: (d) adjusted tax value is the item's adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or event occurs. 4.44 The depreciation rate is then multiplied by both the cost of the property and the fraction of the year that the property is owned by the taxpayer. This formula is set out in section EE 16, which states: EE 16 Amount resulting from standard calculation— Amount (1) For the purposes of the comparison of amounts required by section EE 14(1), the amount dealt with in this section is calculated using the formula— annual rate x value or cost x months 12 Definition of items in formula (2) The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) to (5). Annual rate (3) Annual rate is the annual rate that, in the income year, applies to the item of depreciable property under the depreciation method that the person uses for the item. It is expressed as a decimal. Value or cost (4) Value or cost is,— (a) when the person uses the diminishing value method, the item's adjusted tax value at the end of the income year before the deduction of an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the income year; and (b) when the person uses the straight-line method, the item's cost to the person, excluding expenditure for which the person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart. (Variations to cost are in sections EE 18 and EE 19.) Months: income year of normal length or shorter (5) Months, for a person whose income year contains 365 days or fewer (or 366 days or fewer in a leap year), is the lesser of the following: (a) 12; and (b) the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year in which— (i) the person owns the item; and (ii) the person uses the item or has it available for use for any purpose. Months: income year of longer than normal length (6) Months, for a person whose income year contains more than 365 days (or more than 366 days in a leap year) is the number of whole or part months in the income year in which— (a) the person owns the item; and (b) the person uses the item or has it available for use for any purpose. 22 4.45 Therefore, prior to 1 October 2005, the depreciation of a patent or patent rights is by a straight-line method (section EE 12), with the annual rate calculated in accordance with section EE 27. The standard calculation to determine the amount of depreciation loss is then provided in section EE 16. For the purposes of that calculation, section EE 19 provides that the cost at the start of the income year is treated as being the total of the adjusted tax value of the patent or patent rights and the additional costs the person incurs for the item in an income year for which a deduction is denied other than for an amount of depreciation loss. Depreciation rates for patents and patent applications effective on or after 1 October 2005 4.46 Effective 1 October 2005, section EE 27(1) is amended so that the formula for the annual rate calculation of 1/legal life set out in section EE 27(2), for application in section EE 16, does not apply to a patent or patent application, for which a rate is set in sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D. Section EE 27(1), effective 1 October 2005, states: EE 27 Annual rate for fixed life intangible property— What this section is about (1) This section is about the annual rate that applies to an item of fixed life intangible property, not including - (a) an item of excluded depreciable property for which a rate is set in section EZ 14 (Annual rate for excluded depreciable property: 1992-93 tax year): (b) a patent or patent application for which a rate is set in sections EE 27B or EE 27D: (c) plant variety rights for which a rate is set in section EE 27E. ... 4.47 Sections EE 27B to EE 27D provide the formulae for the calculation of the annual rate for patent applications and patents. Sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D provide for three different circumstances depending on when the patent application, complete with full specification, is lodged. 4.48 Section EE 27B provides for the annual rate for patents where the application for the patent is lodged with complete specification before 1 April 2005. This provision provides that the depreciation rate for the first income year of depreciation of the patent will also include depreciation from the time of the patent application with the full specification to the time of the grant of the patent. Section EE 27B states: EE 27B Annual rate for patents: applications lodged with complete specifications before 1 April 2005 When this section applies (1) This section applies if — (a) an application for a patent with a complete specification is lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand or a similar office in another jurisdiction; and (b) the application is lodged with the complete specification before 1 April 2005; and 23 (c) the patent is granted to a person in an income year of the person that corresponds to the 2005 - 06 or a later tax year. Income years for which usual rate applies (2) The rate given by subsection (3) applies for the patent for an income year that begins — (a) after the date on which the patent is granted; and (b) before the date that is 240 months after the patent application date. Usual rate (3) The rate is calculated using the formula - months depreciation months Rate for first income year of use (4) For the patent and the income year that includes the date on which the patent is granted, the rate is found by adding together the following rates: (a) the rate calculated using the formula – months before grant depreciation months (b) the rate calculated for the income year under subsection (3). Effect of change in ownership of patent application (5) If the patent is granted to a person who does not lodge the application for the patent with the complete specification, the rates calculated under subsections (3) and (4) for the person depend on the period between the date on which the person acquires the application and the date on which the patent is granted. Definition of items in formulas in subsections (3) and (4) (6) The items in the formulas in subsections (3) and (4) are defined in subsections (7) to (9). Months (7) Months is the number in the income year of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of the income year, — (a) in which the patent is used or is available for use; and (b) that include or begin after the date on which the patent is granted; and (c) that end before the date that is 240 months after the patent application date. Depreciation months (8) Depreciation months is, — (a) if subsection (5) does not apply, 240: (b) if subsection (5) applies, 240 reduced by the number of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of an income year of the person, that – (i) include or begin after the patent application date; and (ii) end before the date on which the person acquires the application. Months before grant 24 (9) Months before grant is the number of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of an income year of the person, that, — (a) if subsection (5) does not apply, - (i) include or begin after the patent application date; and (ii) end before the date on which the patent is granted: (b) if subsection (5) applies – (i) include or begin after the date on which the person acquires the application; and (ii) end before the date on which the patent is granted. 4.49 Section EE 27C provides for the annual rate for patent applications lodged with complete specification on or after 1 April 2005. This provision provides for the depreciation rate for the period from when the patent application is lodged with complete specification until the application is granted, refused or withdrawn. Section EE 27C states: EE 27C Annual rate for patent applications lodged with complete specifications on or after 1 April 2005 When this section applies (1) This section applies if – (a) an application for a patent with a complete specification is lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand or a similar office in another jurisdiction; and (b) the application is lodged with the complete specification on or after 1 April 2005. Income years for which rate applies (2) The rate given by subsection (3) applies for a patent application for an income year that - (a) includes or begins after the patent application date; and (b) begins before the date on which – (i) the patent is granted; or (ii) the patent application is refused or withdrawn. Rate (3) The rate is calculated using the formula - months depreciation months Months (4) Months is the number in the income year of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of the income year, that - (a) include or begin after the patent application date; and (b) end before the date on which - (i) the patent is granted; or (ii) the patent application is refused or withdrawn. Depreciation months (5) Depreciation months is, - (a) if subsection (6) does not apply, 240: (b) if subsection (6) applies, 240 reduced by the number of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of an income year of the person, that - (i) include or begin after the patent application date; and 25 (ii) end before the date on which the person acquires the application. Effect of change in ownership of patent application (6) If the person who owns the patent application when the patent is granted, or when the patent application is refused or withdrawn, is not the person who lodges the application for the patent with the complete specification, the rate calculated under subsection (3) for the person depends on the period between the patent application date and the date on which the person acquires the application. 4.50 Section EE 27D provides for the annual rate for patents, the application for which was lodged with complete specification on or after 1 April 2005. This provision is applicable only to patents. It is noted that for patents applied for on or after 1 April 2005, in the year in which a patent is granted, section EE 27C will be applicable until the grant and section EE 27D will be applicable from the date of the grant to the end of the income year. The formula in section EE 27D is applicable for the remaining legal life of the patent. Section EE 27D states: EE 27D Annual rate for patents: applications lodged with complete specifications on or after 1 April 2005 When this section applies (1) This section applies if - (a) an application for a patent with a complete specification is lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand or a similar office in another jurisdiction; and (b) the application is lodged with the complete specification on or after 1 April 2005; and (c) the patent is granted to a person in an income year of the person that corresponds to the 2005 - 06 or a later tax year. Income years for which rate applies (2) The rate given by subsection (3) applies for a patent for an income year that– (a) includes or begins after the date on which the patent is granted; and (b) begins before the date that is 240 months after the patent application date. Rate (3) The rate is calculated using the formula - months depreciation months Months (4) Months is the number in the income year of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of the income year, that - (a) include or begin after the date on which the patent is granted; and (b) end before the date that is 240 months after the patent application date. Depreciation months (5) Depreciation months is, - 26 (a) if subsection (6) does not apply, 240: (b) if subsection (6) applies, 240 reduced by the number of months, beginning on or a whole number of months after the beginning of an income year of the person, that – (i) include or begin after the patent application date; and (ii) end before the date on which the person acquires the application. Effect of change in ownership of patent application (6) If the patent is granted to a person who does not lodge the application for the patent with the complete specification, the rate calculated under subsection (3) for the person depends on the period between the patent application date and the date on which the person acquires the application. 4.51 Effective 1 October 2005, the appropriate rates calculated in accordance with sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D are the “annual rate” for application in section EE 16 (refer paragraph 4.44) for determining the amount of depreciation for an income year for patents and patent applications. 4.52 The Commissioner is aware that the amount of depreciation of a patent or patent application under the current legislation is reduced twice by a factor relating to the length of time the patent or patent application is owned. For patents granted on or after 1 April 2005, the annual rate derived from the application of sections EE 27B to EE 27D is proportional to the time that the patent or patent application is held (i.e. the fraction of months/depreciation months). However, when that rate is inserted in the formula in section EE 16 to derive the amount of depreciation, that rate is multiplied again by the fraction, months/12. This issue is addressed by amendments included in The Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. When the legal life starts for tax purposes 4.53 Although, under the Patents Act, the patent date is the date of the filing of the complete specification irrespective of the date that the patent is granted, for tax purposes, prior to 1 October 2005, the Commissioner considers that the legal life of a New Zealand patent starts from the date the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand grants the patent. This is the date that the patent is available for use. 4.54 In the Commissioner’s view, for patents granted before 1 April 2005, the time at which the intangible property is acquired by the taxpayer is the start of the legal life of the patent (section EE 27(3)(b)). This is because section FB 7 provides that, if property is not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer for the derivation of assessable income at any time during the income year, the depreciation deduction is apportioned and depreciation can only be claimed for the period for which the asset was available for use. Accordingly, the legal life/remaining legal life for tax purposes of patents granted before 1 April 2005 is less than the 20-year patent term. 4.55 However, effective 1 October 2005, the Act does not require “legal life” to be determined in respect of patents for the calculation of depreciation. Effective 27 1 October 2005, sections EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D refer to “depreciation months”. This term is defined in these sections as 240 or 240 reduced by the number of whole months from the patent application date to the date on which the person acquires either the patent application or the patent. This figure is then used as part of the formulae also set out in these sections to determine the depreciation rate of the patent or patent application. What is included in the cost of a “patent application”, “patent” or “patent rights”? 4.56 Depreciation is calculated on the cost of a patent application, patent or patent rights. If a taxpayer has purchased the patent application, patent or patent rights, the cost of purchasing them is depreciable. If the taxpayer developed the invention that is patented, the Commissioner considers that the cost of a “patent application”, “patent” or “patent rights” does not include the cost of research or development work that may have led to the application for a patent. Although this research and development work may include, for example, the construction of a prototype of the invention, the specification of which is ultimately the subject of a patent application, for tax purposes, these costs are not considered part of the cost of a patent application or patent and are not part of the depreciable cost of the patent application, patent or patent rights. A patent refers solely to the legal right to exclude others from the use of that patented specification. 4.57 This view accords with the ordinary usage of the word “patent” (being the sole rights to make, use or sell an invention, which are conferred by statute) and the definition of “patent rights” in section OB 1: patent rights means the right to do or authorise the doing of anything that would, but for the right, be an infringement of a patent Depreciable patent costs 4.58 If the taxpayer has lodged a patent application with full specification or had a patent for an invention granted, the costs of the patent include fees charged by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand, fees charged by other patent authorities and patent attorney fees. In short, it is the administrative and legal fees incurred in the patent process that are the depreciable patent costs. 4.59 On the granting of a patent, those patent application costs form part of the adjusted tax value of the patent and the amounts continue to be depreciated over the same term of 240 months. The Commissioner is of the view that there is no disposal of the patent application in terms of section EE 37. 4.60 If the taxpayer has purchased the patent application, patent or patent rights, the cost of the patent application, patent or patent rights is depreciable. In this case, the taxpayer has either purchased the application for or the right to use a particular specification, which is protected by a patent, and to exclude others from such use. It is the cost incurred in buying that right or application for that right that is depreciable. As above, there is no disposal of the patent application when the patent is granted. If the taxpayer also bought an item 28 such as a prototype of the patented invention, the cost of the prototype is not part of the cost of the patent application, patent or the right to use the patent. Treatment of invention expenditure 4.61 As set out above, it is the Commissioner’s view that allowable deductions for the costs incurred in the “patent” process do not include expenditure incurred in the investigative process that may culminate in an invention. This means that invention expenditure, which is capital in nature, cannot be depreciated as part of the cost of a patent application, patent or the right to use a patent. 4.62 Although, under the present legislation, some invention expenditure may be deductible under other provisions, there may, in some circumstances, be expenditure incurred on an invention that is neither deductible nor depreciable. The following discussion considers the tax treatment of various invention expenditure. It must be reiterated that this does not apply to a person who simply purchases a patent application, patent or right to use a patent. Research and development expenditure 4.63 Expenditure on research and development that may lead to an invention may be deductible: • if a taxpayer chooses to utilise the provisions of section DB 26, expenditure incurred on research or development, up to the point of “asset recognition” (defined in FRS-13, paragraph 5.3), can be expensed in the year in which it is incurred (the five criteria in FRS-13 required to be complied with to satisfy “asset recognition”, include the demonstration of both the technical feasibility of a product and the existence of a market for the product, and, therefore, expenditure beyond the point of “asset recognition” which is required to be capitalised, can be made by the taxpayer with that knowledge); or • if the taxpayer’s annual research and development expenditure does not exceed $10,000 (section DB 26(5) provides for the entire quantum of such research and development costs to be expensed in the year in which it is incurred provided that the expenditure has not been treated as material for financial reporting purposes and the expenditure has been recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes); or • if the expenditure is revenue in nature, i.e. if the expenditure is incurred in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income and it is not capital in nature (an example might be expenditure on materials consumed in research related to a taxpayer’s business: the expenditure would be deductible without the benefit of section DB 26 but, research expenditure contributing to the cost of an asset, or related to establishing a new line of business, is likely to be capital in nature and non-deductible); or • if the expenditure is on scientific research, section DB 25 provides for deductions; or 29 • if a person who devised an invention for which a patent is granted and uses the patent in deriving income in an income year, under section DB 29(2), they are allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993 provided a deduction is not otherwise allowed; or • if a person who devised and patented an invention, sells all of the patent rights relating to the invention, under section DB 29(3), they are allowed a deduction from their annual gross income for expenditure incurred in connection with devising the invention, whenever it is incurred, to the extent that it not already allowed under section DB 29(2) or some other provision such as section DB 26; or • similarly, if only some of the patent rights are sold, a proportional deduction of the expenditure incurred is allowed, section DB 29(4). Deductions allowable for expenditure incurred in devising an invention only to extent of total expenditure 4.64 Under section DB 29, a taxpayer, who devises an invention to which the patent relates and who then sells the patent rights, is allowed a deduction of the amount of the expenditure incurred in connection with devising the invention that has not already been allowed under section DB 29(2). To the extent that a taxpayer, who devised the invention, has already claimed the invention costs in full, under sections DB 25 or DB 26, section BD 4(5) ensures that the allowable deductions for the expenditure are only available once. 4.65 Section BD 4(5) provides: Allocation (5) If an expenditure or loss gives rise to more than 1 deduction, the deductions are allocated to income years to the extent that their total is no more than the amount of the expenditure or loss. Depreciation of assets used for or developed in the inventing process 4.66 In some circumstances, invention expenditure that forms part of the cost of an asset may be deducted by way of depreciation, if the asset is depreciable property that is used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Intangible assets are depreciable only if they are listed in Schedule 17 to the Act. 4.67 However, section DB 26, by the application of the FRS-13 criteria, provides for the cost of assets used on a project, in the inventing process up to the point of “asset recognition”, to be treated as revenue expenditure in the year in which the cost is incurred. After the point of asset recognition, such costs are required to be capitalised and unless those costs are for an asset that is otherwise depreciable property, no depreciation allowance is available. (Where section DB 26(5) applies, i.e. where the person incurs expenditure of $10,000 or less, in total, on research and development for a tax year and the 30 expenditure is not treated as material and is recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes, the person is allowed a deduction for that expenditure.) 4.68 Section EE 6 defines “depreciable property”: EE 6 What is depreciable property?— Description (1) “Depreciable property” is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving assessable income; or (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. ... Prototypes and other tangible assets used in the inventing process 4.69 Expenditure on the construction of prototypes or other assets used to develop or trial an invention may be of a capital nature under general case law principles. In Case N55 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,434, Judge Barber held that expenditure on the development of a prototype farm vehicle was capital in nature. Judge Barber found that the prototype was part of the establishment or expansion of a profit making structure and, as such, was made prior to the commencement of ordinary business operations in relation to the manufacture of that vehicle. 4.70 However, if the taxpayer utilises section DB 26, FRS-13 lists “pre-production prototypes” as an example of a typical activity that would be included in “development”. The expenditure incurred in the manufacture of such prototype or other tangible assets used in the inventing process can be expensed, in the year in which the cost is incurred, provided the project has not yet met the five criteria for “asset recognition”. After the point of “asset recognition” has been reached, development expenditure on the project, including the expenditure on a prototype, is required to be capitalised. Additional costs that are depreciable 4.71 Although section EE 19 provides for “additional costs” to be added to the depreciation cost base of an intangible asset, “additional costs” are not defined. Section EE 19 states: EE 19 Cost: fixed life intangible property— When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a person owns an item of fixed life intangible property; and (b) the person incurs additional costs in an income year for the item; and (c) the person is denied a deduction for the additional costs other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. 31 Additional costs for fixed life intangible property (2) For the purposes of the formula in section EE 16, the item's cost at the start of the income year is treated as being the total of— (a) the item's adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (b) the additional costs the person incurs. 4.72 Accordingly, additional costs are costs that the taxpayer incurs in relation to fixed life intangible property that the taxpayer owns, and for which a person is denied a deduction other than a deduction for depreciation loss. If additional costs are added, the adjusted cost base is then depreciated over the remaining legal life of the patent. Patent renewal fees 4.73 Patent renewal fees are payable to the Intellectual Property Office at intervals to keep patent rights in existence. These fees are payable before the end of the fourth, seventh, tenth and thirteenth years from the date of the filing of the complete specification of the patent. If the patent renewal fees are not paid, the patent expires (refer to paragraph 4.76, “What happens if a patent is not renewed?”). 4.74 In the Commissioner’s opinion, patent renewal fees relate to the ownership of the patent, are capital in nature and are “additional costs” within section EE 19. Patent renewal fees are not paid to maintain a patent, in the sense of keeping it up to date, and they are not simply an administrative fee. The Commissioner considers that Parliament intended to include this type of expenditure as “additional costs” subject to section EE 19. Therefore, the nature of the fee will determine whether or not it is an “additional cost” and whether or not it is depreciable under section EE 19. 4.75 However, if the patent was acquired before 23 September 1997, patent renewal fees remain deductible under section DB 28. Section DB 28 provides for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with the grant, maintenance, or extension of a patent used by the taxpayer in the production of the taxpayer’s income for that year. This provision is discussed further in paragraphs 7.1- 7.5. What happens if a patent is not renewed? 4.76 If the patent renewal fees are not paid, the patent rights end. The owner of the patent is no longer able to exercise those patent rights and section EE 40(9) provides that sections EE 41 to EE 44 apply. In this situation, section EE 41(2) provides for an amount of depreciation loss. This is the amount “by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value ...”. This can be seen from the following legislation. 4.77 Section EE 37 states: 32 EE 37 Application of sections EE 41 to EE 44— When sections apply (1) Sections EE 41 to EE 44 apply when a person derives consideration from the disposal of an item or from an event involving an item, if— (a) the consideration is consideration of a kind described in section EE 38; and (b) either— (i) the item is an item of a kind described in section EE 39; or (ii) the event is an event of a kind described in section EE 40. Exclusion (2) Sections EE 41 to EE 44 do not apply when a person disposes of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind. 4.78 Section EE 40 lists those events to which sections EE 41 to EE 44 apply. It includes section EE 40(9), which states: Cessation of rights in intangible property (9) The eighth event is an occurrence that has the effect that the owner of an item of intangible property is no longer able, and will never be able, to exercise the rights that constitute or are part of the item. ... 4.79 Section EE 41(2) provides: Amount of depreciation loss (2) For the purposes of section EE 37, if the consideration is less than the item's adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the person has an amount of depreciation loss, for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs, that is the amount by which the consideration is less than the item's adjusted tax value on that date. This subsection does not apply if the item is a building. 4.80 Therefore, when patent rights are voided or disposed of, being the eighth event as described in section EE 40(9), any cost of the patent or patent rights, which has not already been depreciated, can be deducted under section EE 41. 4.81 Section EE 37 refers to consideration derived from the disposal of an item. In the case of a patent which is allowed to lapse, the Commissioner considers that in light of the other provisions in Part E, relating to losses on disposals, (including express references to a number of transactions where no actual consideration would be received) a nil amount of consideration is derived. This has now been clarified by an amendment to the legislation. Section EE 38(1B) now provides specifically that, for the purposes of section EE 37, an amount that a person derives as consideration may be nil or a negative amount. This amendment applies for income years corresponding to the 2005-2006 and subsequent tax years. 4.82 However, section EE 37(2) provides that sections EE 41 to EE 44 do not apply when a person disposes of an item of intangible property, if the disposal of that property is part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type (refer paragraph 4.77). 33 4.83 In summary, subject to the exception discussed above, the non-renewal of a patent is an event, for the purposes of sections EE 41 to EE 44, and any costs, not already depreciated, can be deducted. Should worthless patent applications, patents or the rights to use a patent be recognised as assets and depreciated? 4.84 Sometimes a patent might be applied for or registered “just in case” the protection that a patent offers, for a particular invention, may one day prove to be valuable. The same situation could also occur with the acquisition of patent rights. It could be argued that these patents or patent rights should not be treated as assets, until the feasibility of the invention is known. 4.85 The Act does not make this distinction. In sections EE 14, EE 16, EE 19, EE 27, EE 27B, EE 27C and EE 27D, the Act provides rules for the depreciation of the cost of patents and patent rights, if these were used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in a business carried on for the purpose of deriving assessable income. The cost includes all of the costs incurred in acquiring the patent or the right to use a patent. It has been held that the test of whether something is used in deriving income or in a business is satisfied not only if the asset directly produces income, but also if the asset is used in the course of deriving income or in a business (C of IR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236). Sections EE 14 states: EE 14 Diminishing value or straight-line method: calculating amount of depreciation loss— Most depreciable property (1) The amount of depreciation loss that the person has for an income year for an item of depreciable property is the lesser of the amounts dealt with in sections EE 15 and EE 16. Exclusion: petroleum-related depreciable property (2) The amount of depreciation loss that the person has for an income year for an item of petroleum-related depreciable property is the lesser of the amounts dealt with in sections EE 15 and EE 17. 4.86 For section EE 16, refer paragraph 4.44. For section EE 19, refer paragraph 4.71. 5. LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN DEFENDING OR ATTACKING A PATENT 5.1 The legal fees may relate to an opposition action or a revocation action. An opposition action is taken when a patent has not yet been granted and the action is taken against another person’s application for a patent, to prevent that patent being granted. A revocation action is taken against someone who has had a patent granted, to revoke that patent. 5.2 The Commissioner’s opinion is that the same principles apply to both opposition and revocation actions. In both cases, the action relates to an asset 34 of the person who is bringing the action, whether it is a patent or a patent application. The terms “defending” and “attacking” respectively are used to mean defending, and taking, a revocation action (including an opposition action). General principles 5.3 Legal expenses incurred in either attacking or defending a patent are generally incurred in the maintenance or preservation of a capital asset which, in the case of a patent, is a right. 5.4 The Privy Council in BP Australia v FC of T \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 has provided a number of factors to consider in the determination of whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. The factors for consideration have since been summarised by the Court of Appeal in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5233 in the judgment of the court given by Richardson J under the heading “The capital-income distinction”: Amongst the factors weighed by the Judicial Committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. (pp 5,235, 5236) 5.5 The approach of the Privy Council in BP Australia has subsequently been adopted in a number of other New Zealand cases. These include CIR v L D Nathan & Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209, Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 and Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. The most recent New Zealand Privy Council case in this area, CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, also adopted the BP Australia approach. 5.6 Fundamental to the capital/revenue determination is the “enduring benefit” test of the House of Lords in British Insulated and Helsby Cables v Atherton \[1928\] AC 205, which has become the commonly accepted test in the English Courts: ... when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital ... (p 629) 5.7 The “enduring benefit” test that has been approved and affirmed by both the House of Lords (in Lawson (Inspector of Taxes) v Johnson Matthey plc \[1992\] 2 All ER 647), and the Privy Council (in BP Australia) since the Atherton test was interpreted and applied in Southern v Borax Consolidated Ltd \[1940\] 4 All ER 412. 35 5.8 The BP Australia approach to the determination of expenditure as capital or revenue was applied by Moller J in the Supreme Court decision of CIR v Murray Equipment Limited \[1966\] NZLR 360, and the expenditure incurred on legal costs in attacking patent applications of others was held to be revenue in nature. In this instance it might well be that the identical situation might not have to be faced by the company again, but the very fact that this one arose is a clear indication that there might well occur, in the future, similar threats to the money-earning process. (p 369) 5.9 It was considered that the payment would be made from circulating capital, and although an identical situation might not have to be faced by a business again, Moller J considered that the fact that this one arose, indicates that a similar threat might well occur in the future. It was also considered that under ordinary principles of commercial accounting the expenditure would be treated as being of a revenue nature. 5.10 Moller J’s comment in Murray could equally apply in either a situation of attacking another’s patent or the defence of a patent. An identical situation may not arise for the company again, but the fact that the situation arose indicates that a similar threat, requiring either defence or attack, may arise in the future. Therefore, the expenditure was not incurred in the production of assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. 5.11 It is noted that the approach taken following BP Australia, is not consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Taxes v Ballinger and Co Ltd (1903) 23 NZLR 188. In that case, it was held that expenses, incurred in unsuccessfully defending the taxpayer’s patent against an action by the prior patent holder who claimed that the taxpayer’s patent had infringed the prior patent, were capital in nature: ...the moneys expended have been lost in an unsuccessful endeavour to retain the means for earning additional profit for the company. Such expenditure has not resulted in a profitable investment, but it is none the less an investment of capital. (pp 193, 194). 5.12 This decision has been the subject of considerable criticism, particularly in the later patent case of Murray Equipment. With respect, it is considered that the approach in the later case of Murray Equipment following BP Australia is to be preferred. This is consistent with the doctrine of stare decisis or judicial precedent. Under this doctrine, a court is required to follow previous decisions unless they are inconsistent with a higher court’s decision. At the time of both BP Australia and Murray Equipment, the Privy Council was New Zealand’s highest Court and, as such, its decisions were required to be followed by New Zealand courts if the relevant New Zealand law was common with that of the jurisdiction that originated the appeal to the Privy Council. 36 Conclusion 5.13 It is the Commissioner’s opinion that the application of BP Australia is the correct authority by which to determine whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that expenditure incurred on legal costs in actions either defending or attacking a patent, including infringement proceedings, is revenue in nature. A similar analysis would also apply in the case of the right to use a patent. 6. PROCEEDS AND ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS ON THE SALE OF PATENT RIGHTS OR A PATENT APPLICATION Sum received income 6.1 An amount derived by a taxpayer, in respect of a sale of any patent rights or a patent application with a complete specification, whether a capital asset or trading stock, is income of that taxpayer under section CB 26. For patent applications, this is applicable only to those lodged for the first time after 21 June 2005. The section states: CB 26 Sale of patent applications or patent rights— If a person derives an amount from the sale of a patent application with a complete specification or from the sale of patent rights, the amount is income of the person. Sections EE 37 to EE 44 can also apply to the disposal of depreciable property such as patents and patent applications other than by way of sale. Amount of deduction 6.2 The amount of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application or patent rights depends on the circumstances of the taxpayer. Such deductions may, in some circumstances, be allowable for a taxpayer in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights. For example, if a taxpayer is in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights, but they buy and retain a patent and derive income from it by licensing the patent rights to a third party to exploit, when those patent rights are sold, allowable deductions are in accordance with sections DB 30 and DB 31. These deductions are allowable despite the fact that other patents or patent rights of that taxpayer may be trading stock and, therefore, required to be treated in accordance with the trading stock rules in Subpart EB – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock). 6.3 Similarly, if a taxpayer in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights, also devises the invention to which a patent application or patent relates, but is not in the business of inventing, allowable deductions in respect of the sale of the patent application or those patent rights will be in accordance with section DB 29. 6.4 Sections DB 29, 30 and 31 provide: 37 DB 29 Patent rights: devising patented inventions— When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person incurs expenditure in devising an invention for which a patent has been granted. The section applies whether the person devised the invention alone or in conjunction with another person. Deduction: expenditure before 1 April 1993 (2) When the person uses the patent in deriving income in a tax year, they are allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993, but not if a deduction has been allowed for the expenditure under any other provision of this Act or an earlier Act. Deduction: devising invention (3) If the person sells all the patent rights relating to the invention, they are allowed a deduction for the expenditure that they have incurred (whenever it is incurred) in connection with devising the invention to the extent to which a deduction has not already been allowed under subsection (2). Deduction: devising invention: proportion of expenditure (4) If the person sells some of the patent rights relating to the invention, they are allowed a deduction for part of the expenditure described in subsection (3). The part is calculated by dividing the amount derived from the sale by the market value of the whole of the patent rights on the date of the sale. Link with subpart DA (5) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. DB 30 Patent rights acquired before 1 April 1993— When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person sells patent rights that they acquired before 1 April 1993. Deduction (2) The person is allowed a deduction on the sale of the patent rights. Amount of deduction (3) The amount is calculated using the formula— unexpired term of the patent rights at the date of sale x cost unexpired term of the patent rights at the date of acquisition Link with subpart DA (4) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 38 DB 31 Patent applications or patent rights acquired on or after 1 April 1993— When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person sells a patent application with a complete specification or patent rights that they acquired on or after 1 April 1993. Deduction (2) The person is allowed a deduction on the sale of the patent application with a complete specification or patent rights. Amount of deduction (3) The amount is calculated using the formula— total cost – total amounts of depreciation loss Definition of items in formula (4) In the formula,— (a) total cost is the total cost to the person of the patent application with a complete specification or patent rights: (b) total amounts of depreciation loss is the total of the amounts of depreciation loss for the patent application with a complete specification or patent rights for which the person is allowed a deduction. Link with subpart DA (5) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 6.5 If a taxpayer sells a patent application with a complete specification or patent rights that they acquired on or after 1 April 1993, section DB 31 will apply to the sale. Sections EE 37 to EE 44 can also apply to the disposal of depreciable property, such as patents or patent applications, other than by way of sale. Timing of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application, a patent or patent rights, purchased for the purpose of resale 6.6 If a taxpayer, not in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights, buys a patent application, a patent or patent rights for the purpose of reselling them, the cost is deductible, but only when the taxpayer on-sells that patent application, that patent or those patent rights. Section EA 2 requires deductions for “revenue account property”, which is not trading stock, to be deferred until those patent or patent rights are disposed of or cease to exist. Section EA 2 states: EA 2 Other revenue account property— When this section applies (1) This section applies to revenue account property that is not— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EB (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer's livestock)); or ... Timing of deduction (2) A deduction for the cost of revenue account property of a person is allocated to the earlier of— 39 (a) the income year in which the person disposes of the property; and (b) the income year in which the property ceases to exist. \[emphasis added\] Timing of allowable deductions on the sale of a patent application, a patent or the right to use a patent, being trading stock of a business 6.7 If the proceeds of sale of property are income, then the property is “revenue account property”. In the rare case of a business dealing in patent applications, patents or patent rights, those patent applications, patents or patent rights will also constitute trading stock and, accordingly, their cost, and any additional expenditure relating to them, is deductible and not depreciable. The deductions will be subject to the trading stock rules in Subpart EB. 6.8 Similarly, if a person is in the business of buying and selling patent applications, patents or patent rights and also in the business of inventing, income and expenditure relating to research carried out for the business of inventing would be on revenue account and anything produced for sale would be subject to the trading stock rules. 7. THE TREATMENT OF PATENT-RELATED EXPENSES AND PROCEEDS UNDER PREVIOUS RULES Summary 7.1 Before patents and the right to use a patent became depreciable property in 1993, there were specific provisions in the Act applicable to patents. The costs of applying for, maintaining or extending a patent, were deductible. Expenses incurred in devising an invention and the cost of buying a patent were also deductible, although spread. Proceeds from the sale of a patent were income, but these too could be spread. 7.2 Some of these old provisions remain relevant because the Commissioner required these expenses to be spread over the 20-year term of a patent and some of these terms have not yet expired. In addition, fees for maintaining or extending a patent remain deductible if the patent was acquired by the taxpayer before 23 September 1997. Expenditure incurred for the grant, maintenance, or extension of a patent (section DB 28) 7.3 Section DB 28 (refer paragraph 3.12) is briefly mentioned earlier in relation to the distinction between patents and inventions in the legislation. Under section DB 28, if a patent was acquired before 23 September 1997, a taxpayer may claim a deduction for expenditure incurred in connection with the grant, maintenance, or extension of a patent used by the taxpayer in the production of the taxpayer’s income for that year. Because a patent can have a life of 20 years, section DB 28 will continue to apply to the costs for maintaining and extending patents acquired before this date, until the year 2017. 40 7.4 The types of expenditure covered under section DB 28 are renewal fees and extension costs charged either by the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand or an overseas patent authority, plus associated legal fees. Prior to 1 January 1995, a patentee could apply under the Patents Act 1953 to have the term of their patent extended. The facility to extend the term of patents is no longer available under New Zealand legislation, although there may be a few extensions still operative. Extensions may continue to be available from overseas patent authorities and, therefore, provided the patent was acquired before 23 September 1997, the fees for these extensions will remain deductible, under section DB 28. 7.5 The Commissioner considers that section DB 28 includes the cost of amending a patent. An amendment ensures the validity of a patent by narrowing the claims or correcting an obvious mistake. An amendment, therefore, can be viewed as maintenance, or as a continuation of the pre-grant proceedings. Expenditure incurred in devising an invention before 1 April 1993 (section DB 29) 7.6 If a patentee both devised an invention and derived income from the use of its patent, section DB 29(2) provides for a deduction for expenditure incurred before 1 April 1993 in connection with the devising of the invention. 7.7 However, under section DJ 6(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (now replaced by section DB 29(2)), allowance of the deduction was originally available as the Commissioner thought fit. The expenditure was required to be spread over the life of the patent. (The allowance of a deduction is no longer discretionary.) In addition, although the allocation usually commenced from the date of grant, if the use of the invention began in a subsequent income year, the Commissioner considered that the spread should commence from that later year. 7.8 It is also noted that those taxpayers who commenced the spreading exercise while the patent term was 16 years, and, under the Patents Amendment Act 1994, have since obtained the automatic extension to 20 years effective from 1 January 1995, should re-spread their allocated deductions over the remaining life of the patent. This approach is consistent with the depreciation legislation and generally accepted accounting principles. Inland Revenue will not disturb allocations that have already resulted in the full cost being deducted. Patent rights bought before 1 April 1993 and used in the production of income (sections DZ 8 and EZ 5) 7.9 Section DZ 8 provides that if a taxpayer bought patent rights before 1 April 1993 and has used those patent rights in deriving income, a deduction is allowed of the amount quantified in section EZ 5. The amount of the deduction is the expenditure that the person incurred in buying the patent rights and this deduction is allocated over the unexpired term of the patent rights at the date of their purchase. The amount allocated to an income year is deductible in that income year. Sections DZ 8 and EZ 5 state: 41 DZ 8 Buying patent rights before 1 April 1993— When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person buys patent rights before 1 April 1993 and uses them in deriving their income. In this section, if the person dies after incurring expenditure on buying the rights, references to the person include their personal representative, a trustee of their estate, and a beneficiary of their estate. Deduction (2) The person is allowed a deduction of the amount quantified in section EZ 5(2) (Buying patent rights before 1 April 1993). Link with subpart DA (3) This section supplements the general permission. The general limitations still apply. EZ 5 Buying patent rights before 1 April 1993— When this section applies (1) This section applies when section DZ 8 (Buying patent rights before 1 April 1993) applies. Amount of deduction (2) The amount of the deduction is the expenditure that the person has incurred in buying the patent rights. Amount when patent rights expired or disposed of (3) If, before the expiry of the patent rights, the rights have come to an end or have been disposed of, the person is allowed a deduction of an amount that bears to the total sum of the expenditure on the purchase of the rights the same proportion as the unexpired term of the rights when they came to an end or were disposed of bears to their unexpired term at the date of their purchase. An amount that the person has otherwise been allowed as a deduction is not included. Timing of deduction: subsection (2) (4) The deduction referred to in subsection (2) is allocated to the income years in relation to which the term of the patent rights that is unexpired at the date of purchase applies. Timing of deduction: subsection (3) (5) The deduction referred to in subsection (3) is allocated to the income year in which the rights have come to an end or been disposed of. 7.10 In accordance with sections DZ 8 and EZ 5(3), when patent rights bought before 1 April 1993 come to an end, or the taxpayer sells the patent rights before they expire, the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the remaining portion of the allocation, in the income year that the patent rights either come to an end or are sold. The amount of the deduction is calculated using the following formula. 42 Unexpired term of the patent rights, at the date they come to an end or are sold Deduction = Total sum expended by the taxpayer to purchase the patent rights x Unexpired term of the patent rights, at the date the taxpayer purchased them EXAMPLES Example 1 – how depreciation is calculated (sections EE 12, EE 14, EE 16, EE 27C and EE 27D) and what happens when a patent is not renewed A company devises an invention for a new light bulb. The company has a 31 March balance date. The company files the patent application with the complete specification for the new light bulb on 20 October 2005. The company spends $320 on filing fees and $4,480 on patent attorney fees. The Intellectual Property Office grants a patent for the invention on 3 December 2006. The company begins making the light bulbs in June 2007. The patent will expire on 20 October 2025. The term of the patent rights under the Patents Act 1953 is 20 years (240 months), and runs from the date the complete specification is filed. The patent life is, therefore, from 20 October 2005 to 20 October 2025. Although, the patent rights have not been used in deriving income in the year ended 31 March 2007 (or any previous year), the patent rights are available for use by the company in the 2006-07 income year to derive income or to carry on the business. Therefore, the depreciation calculations for the income years of: • 2005-06 (the year in which the patent application is filed with complete specification); • 2006-07 (the year in which the patent is granted); and • 2007-08 (a typical year following the grant of the patent), are as follows: 2005-06 income year (1 April 2005 – 31 March 2006) (the year the patent application is filed with complete specification) Depreciation of the patent application. Annual rate (section EE 27C) = months / depreciation months = 6 / 240 \[October 05 – March 06\] = 0.025 = 0.03 (to two decimal places). For the income year ended 31 March 2006, section EE 27C(4) provides for the depreciation rate of the patent application to be calculated on the basis of six calendar months, i.e. the number of whole months the patent application has been owned, but inclusive of the month of the application date. 43 Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.03 × $4,800 × 6 / 12 = $72 2006-07 income year (1 April 2006 – 31 March 2007) (the year the patent is granted) Depreciation of the patent application. Annual rate (section EE 27C) = months / depreciation months = 8 / 240 \[April 06 – November 06\] = 0.0333 = 0.03 (to two decimal places). For the income year ended 31 March 2007, the patent application has been owned for eight calendar months. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.03 × $4,800 × 8 / 12 = $96 Depreciation of the patent or patent rights. Annual rate (section EE 27D) = months / depreciation months = 4 / 240 \[December 06 – March 07\] = 0.01667 = 0.02 (to two decimal places). For the income year ended 31 March 2007, section EE 27D provides that the depreciation rate for the patent or patent rights is calculated on the basis of four calendar months i.e. inclusive of the month in which the patent is granted. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.02 × $4,800 × 4 / 12 = $32 Therefore, for the 2006-07 income year, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $96 for the patent application and $32 for the ensuing patent or patent rights, i.e. $128. 2007-08 income year (1 April 2007 – 31 March 2008) (a typical year in which the patent or patent rights are owned) Depreciation of the patent or patent rights. Annual rate (section EE 27D) = months / depreciation months = 12 / 240 = 0.05 (to two decimal places). 44 For the income year ended 31 March 2008, the patent application has been owned for a full twelve calendar months. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.05 × $4,800 × 12 / 12 = $240 For the 2008-09 income year, the depreciation for the patent or patent rights is again for a full 12 months and the depreciation deduction is as for the 2007-08 years, i.e. $240. Before the expiry of the fourth year after the complete specification of the patent application is filed (2009-10), the company decides not to renew the patent, and so the patent expires on 20 October 2009. Under sections EE 37 and EE 40(9), this is an event to which section EE 41 applies. The taxpayer can deduct the cost of the patent not already depreciated. Section EE 11(1) provides that depreciation for the last year is not claimed twice, i.e. once as the year’s depreciation, and once under section EE 41(2) for a loss on disposal. Section EE 11(1) provides that a person does not have a depreciation loss for the year in which they dispose of the depreciable property. Section EE 41 applies so that the taxpayer can deduct the remaining cost of the patent that has not already been depreciated. Depreciation already claimed for year ended: 31 March 2006 72 31 March 2007 (96 + 32) 128 31 March 2008 240 31 March 2009 240 Total depreciation claimed $680 Therefore, for the 2009-10 income year, the taxpayer can deduct the following amount from assessable income for loss on disposal of the patent: Cost of the patent 4,800 Less depreciation claimed 680 Deduction for loss on disposal $4,120 Example 2 – how depreciation is calculated if a patent application with complete specification is lodged before 1 April 2005 (sections EE 12, EE 14, EE 16 and EE 27B) The facts and dates are the same as for Example 1, except that the patent application for the light bulb was lodged with complete specification on 20 December 2004, i.e. before 1 April 2005 and, therefore, section EE 27C, which provides for the depreciation of a patent application, is not applicable. As stated in Example 1, the patent is granted 3 December 2006. Pursuant to section EE 27B, in this situation, the first year in which a depreciation loss is allowed is the year in which the patent is granted, i.e. the 2006-07 income year. There is no depreciation loss allowed for either the 45 patent or the patent application, before the year in which the patent is granted. However, section EE 27B provides for a rate in this first year that provides a one-off “catch up” depreciation loss allowance for the period from the date the patent application with complete specification was lodged. 2006-07 income year (1 April 2006 – 31 March 2007) (the year the patent was granted) Depreciation of the patent. First income year rate (section EE 27B(4)) = months before grant / depreciation months = 4 mths (in the 2005 year \[Dec 04 – Mar 05\]) + 12 mths (in the 2006 year \[Apr 05 – Mar 06\]) + 8 mths (in the 2007 year \[Apr 06 – Nov 06\]) / 240 = 24 / 240 = 0.10 (to two decimal places). and Usual rate (section EE 27B(3)) = months / depreciation months = 4 / 240 \[Dec 06 – Mar 07\] = 0.0167 = 0.02 (to two decimal places) Therefore, the rate for the 2006-07 year is: 0.10 + 0.02 = 0.12 For the income year ended 31 March 2007, the patent or patent rights have been owned for four calendar months, inclusive of the month in which the patent is granted. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.12 × $4,800 × 4 / 12 = $192 For the 2007-08 and subsequent typical years that rate is the same as for the calculation for the typical year (2007-08) in Example 1. Example 3 – how depreciation is calculated if a patent application with complete specification is lodged after 1 April 2005, but the application is later either withdrawn or refused (sections EE 12, EE 14, EE 16 and EE 27C) The facts are the same as for Example 1, except that the patent application for the light bulb was not granted but was refused or withdrawn on 3 December 2006. 2005-06 income year (1 April 2005 – 31 March 2006) (the year the patent application is filed with complete specification) 46 The calculation for the depreciation for the patent application is as for Example 1. 2006-07 income year (1 April 2006 – 31 March 2007) (the year the patent is refused or withdrawn) Section EE 11(1) provides that a person does not have a depreciation loss for the year in which they dispose of the depreciable property. Under sections EE 37 and EE 40(9), the refusal or withdrawal of the patent application on 3 December 2006 is an event to which section EE 41 applies. The taxpayer can deduct the cost of the patent application not already depreciated as in Example 1. Depreciation already claimed for year ended 31 March 2006, being the total depreciation claimed: 31 March 2006 72 Therefore, the amount that the taxpayer can deduct from assessable income for loss on disposal of the patent application is: Cost of the patent 4,800 Less depreciation claimed 72 Deduction for loss on disposal $4,728 Example 4 – how depreciation is calculated when the patent or patent rights are purchased from another person (sections EE 16 and EE 27) On 1 May 2006, a taxpayer purchased the patent rights to manufacture and sell a therapeutic bed. The taxpayer paid $240,000 for the patent rights which expire on 31 October 2010. The taxpayer begins making and selling the beds. The taxpayer’s balance date is 31 March. Because the patent was granted prior to the income year ended 31 March 2006, section EE 27 determines the annual rate. The remaining legal life of the patent right is 4 years and 6 months (counting full and part calendar months), i.e. 4.5 years. Annual rate (section EE 27) = 1 / legal life = 1 / 4.5 = 0.22 (to two decimal places). The annual depreciation deduction on the patent rights in the 2006-07 income year is: Depreciation deduction = 0.22 × $240,000 × 11/12 = $48,400 and in the 2007-08 income year: Depreciation deduction = 0.22 × $240,000 × 12/12 = $52,800 47 Example 5 – depreciation and deductions for additional costs for a patent acquired before 23 September 1997 (section DB 28) A taxpayer manufacturing computers devises an invention for a computer that listens and talks. The taxpayer instructs a patent attorney to take out a patent in New Zealand. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. • The patent attorney files the patent application with the provisional specification on 14 November 1995, and on 22 November 1995 charges the taxpayer the following fees: Patent search 500 Preparing the working drawings for the provisional specification 1,300 Intellectual Property Office provisional application filing fee 80 Total amount due $1,880 • On 22 September 1996 the attorney files the complete specification and charges the following fees on 30 September 1996: Preparing complete specification $2,400 • The attorney resolves two objections raised, and on 1 February 1997 charges the following additional fees: Reporting and responding to examiner’s report 800 Intellectual Property Office sealing (registration) fee 100 Total amount due $900 The Intellectual Property Office grants the patent on 15 February 1997 and the taxpayer immediately begins manufacturing the listening and talking computers. The taxpayer pays the renewal fees of $170 in September 2000, $340 in September 2003, $540 in September 2006, and $1,000 in September 2009. Section DB 28 provides that if a patent is acquired before 23 September 1997, costs incurred in connection with granting, maintaining and extending a patent are deductible. As the taxpayer’s patent was acquired on 15 February 1997, section DB 28 applies. Therefore: The taxpayer can deduct $3,300 (being $2,400 + $900) in the income year ended 31 March 1997, as expenditure incurred in connection with the grant of the patent and incurred during the tax year in which the patent was used in deriving income. The amount of $1,880 is not deductible under section DB 28 as the patent was not used in deriving income in the tax year in which the expenditure was incurred. The renewal fees are incurred in connection with the maintenance of a patent and are also deductible under section DB 28, but only because the patent was acquired by the taxpayer, who incurred the costs, before 23 September 1997 48 and the taxpayer was using the patent in deriving income in the tax year in which they incurred the expenditure. Therefore: The taxpayer may deduct the renewal fees of $170, $340, $540, and $1,000 in the income years in which they are incurred. If the renewal fees are paid in advance, a deduction is allowed for the $2,050 (the total of the renewal fees) in the year in which they are paid but this is subject to section EA 3 which provides that the unexpired portion of the patent is income of the taxpayer . Example 6 – additional costs for a patent acquired on or after 23 September 1997 (section EE 19) A taxpayer manufacturing locks devises an invention for a lock that will only respond to a personal voice signal. The taxpayer lodges a patent application with a complete specification for a patent in New Zealand, on 30 October 2005. The taxpayer incurs costs in relation to the patent application, including patent attorney fees. These form part of the cost of the patent application. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. • Some further costs are incurred. The taxpayer’s patent attorney resolves two objections raised, and on 1 March 2006 charges the following additional fees: Reporting and responding to examiner’s report 900 Intellectual Property Office sealing (registration) fee 150 Total amount due $1,050 The Intellectual Property Office grants the patent on 15 April 2006 and the taxpayer immediately begins manufacturing the new locks. The taxpayer pays the renewal fees of $170 in October 2009, $340 in October 2012, $540 in October 2015, and $1,000 in October 2018. As the patent was not acquired before 23 September 1997, section DB 28 does not apply. However, section EE 19 provides that where a person owns an item of fixed life intangible property, incurs additional costs in an income year for the item and is denied a deduction for the additional costs (other than a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss), such costs are added to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year. In this case, once the taxpayer lodged a patent application with complete specification after 1 April 2005, he or she owned an item of fixed life intangible property. Therefore: Although the taxpayer’s patent attorney fees were only incurred at the end of the income year ended 31 March 2006, the additional fees of $1,050 can be added to the patent application’s adjusted tax value at the start of the 2005-06 income year, for the purposes of section EE 16. This is because 49 they are an additional cost incurred in the income year in which the taxpayer owned the patent application. The renewal fees for the patent are incurred also as additional costs for an item of fixed life intangible property owned by the taxpayer, in this case the patent. As such, under section EE 19, these additional costs will be added to the patent’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year in which the additional costs are incurred. Example 7 – income and deductions on sale of patent rights (sections CB 26 and DB 29) The light bulb company in Example 1 spends $45,000 in the 2005 income year devising the light bulb. The company filed for a patent with a complete specification on 20 October 2005. The company received the patent on 3 December 2006, and began production on 20 June 2007. Instead of letting the patent expire on 20 October 2009, the company sells the patent on 20 October 2009 for $750,000. The company cannot claim depreciation for the income year ending 31 March 2010, because section EE 11(1) says that depreciation cannot be claimed in the year a depreciable asset is sold. The proceeds of $750,000 from the sale is income, under section CB 26. The company can claim the cost of the patent, less depreciation already deducted, as a deduction, under section DB 31. The cost of the patent to the company was $4,800. Depreciation already deducted up to and including the year ended 31 March 2009 is $680. Therefore, the deduction on sale is: Cost of the patent 4,800 Depreciation already claimed 680 Deduction $4,120 The expenses of $45,000 incurred in devising the invention can also be deducted under section DB 29. This is on the basis that a deduction has not already been allowed under another provision such as section DB 26. Example 8 – legal expenses incurred in defending and attacking a patent (section BD 2 and subpart EE) A pharmaceutical company, Company A, was granted a patent on 1 April 2006 for a cold medication. The syrup was a combination of known substances – analgesics and decongestants, and a new substance. Company B, another pharmaceutical company manufacturing cold medications, applied for the revocation of the patent in the High Court on the ground of obviousness. The Court held that the patent was valid. Company A spent $300,000 in defending the attack on its patent, while Company B spent $225,000 in attacking the patent. 50 The amounts spent by Company A and Company B are deductible under section BD 2. Example 9 – research and development expenses incurred in devising an invention (sections DB 26, EE 16, EE 27C and EE 27D) In the 2005-06 income year, a tyre manufacturing company spends $10,000 on research and development into coloured snow tyres, for which the company hopes eventually to obtain a patent. The $10,000 is the total amount of expenditure the company has incurred in that year on research and development. The company has a 31 March balance date. For income tax purposes, the treatment of the company’s research and development costs for the 2005-06 income year is: Under section DB 26, provided the company does not treat the expenditure as material, as described in paragraph 2.3 of the financial reporting standard, and recognises the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes, section DB 26(5) provides that that company can expense all development expenditure in the year in which it is incurred. In the 2006-07 income year, the same company spends $50,000 on equipment to assist the research (equipment that is not otherwise depreciable) and various sums on prototype tyres. The project has not yet satisfied the five criteria for asset recognition set out in FRS-13. For income tax purposes, the treatment of the company’s research and development costs for the 2006-07 income year is: As for the 2005-06 income year, under section DB 26(1)–(4) and DB 26(9), the company can expense all research and development expenditure on the project, including the sums on the equipment and prototypes. In June 2007, the project satisfies the five criteria for “asset recognition”, but additional development is required prior to the company’s application for a patent for the coloured snow tyres. On 1 October 2007, after additional development expenditure of $100,000, which included expenditure on further prototypes, the company files for a patent, incurring $15,000 in costs. The patent is granted 1 December 2007. For income tax purposes, the treatment of the company’s research and development costs for the 2007-08 income year is: As for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years, under sections DB 26(1)-(4) and DB 26(9), the taxpayer company can expense all research and development expenditure incurred prior to asset recognition in June 2007. The $100,000 of development expenditure, incurred subsequent to the point of “asset recognition”, cannot be deducted. Effective 1 October 2005, a patent application with complete specification is an item of Schedule 17 depreciable intangible property and section EE 27C 51 provides the calculation for the rate at which the $15,000 costs incurred in making the patent application can be depreciated. 2007-08 income year (1 April 2007 – 31 March 2008) (the year the patent is granted) Depreciation of the patent application for the period 1 October 2007 to 1 December 2007, i.e. 2 months. Annual rate (section EE 27C) = months / depreciation months = 2 / 240 = 0.0083 = 0.01 (to two decimal places). For the income year ended 31 March 2008, the patent application has been owned for 2 whole calendar months. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.01 × $15,000 × 2 / 12 = $25 Depreciation of the patent or patent rights for the period 1 December 2007 to 31 March 2008, i.e. 4 whole calendar months. Annual rate (section EE 27D) = months / depreciation months = 4 / 240 = 0.0166 = 0.02 (to two decimal places). For the income year ended 31 March 2008, the patent or patent rights have been available for use for 4 whole calendar months. Depreciation deduction = (section EE 16) annual rate × value or cost × months 12 = 0.02 × $15,000 × 4 / 12 = $100 Therefore, for the 2007-08 income year, the taxpayer has a depreciation loss of $25 for the patent application and $100 for the ensuing patent or patent rights. Example 10 – treatment of research and development costs where a patent application has been made, but has been refused or withdrawn (sections DB 28B, EE 16, EE 27C, EE 41, EE 47, and EE 48) The tyre manufacturing company in Example 9, instead of having its patent granted, has had its patent application refused on 1 December 2007. As noted in Example 9, the company has had development expenditure of $100,000. The company employed a patent attorney to make their patent application. As a result of the patent attorney fees and ancillary charges associated with the patent application, the company incurred an extra $15,000 making the patent application. 52 For income tax purposes, the treatment of the company’s development costs for the 2007-08 income year is: As for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years, under sections DB 26(1)-(4) and DB 26(9), the taxpayer company can expense all research and development expenditure but only that incurred prior to “asset recognition” in June 2007. Although the taxpayer company had the patent application for 2 months before the patent grant was refused on 1 December 2007, section EE 11(1) provides that a person does not have an amount of depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property for the year in which they dispose of it. Section DB 28B provides that the company is allowed a deduction, in the year in which the grant is refused or the application is withdrawn, for expenditure incurred in relation to the application that would have been part of the cost of the patent if the application had been granted and for which the company is not allowed a deduction under another provision. However, for patent applications with complete specifications lodged on or after 1 April 2005 section EE 41 allows an amount of depreciation loss. The consideration received is nil, so will be less than the patent application’s adjusted tax value. The adjusted tax value is provided by the formula in section EE 47(1) which is: base value – total deductions There have been no “total deductions” in this case. The base value is found by applying section EE 48 which provides that the base value is the cost of the item to the person. Therefore, the company is allowed a deduction of the $15,000 incurred in making the patent application.
\[Interpretation statement IS2228 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in March 2000\] TRANSFERABLE TERM FISHING QUOTA—ACQUISITION AND CONVERSION: Sections 104, 104A, 106, and 107A, Income Tax Act 1976 Summary All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1976 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on how the cost of a Transferable Term Fishing Quota (“TTQ”) is to be treated for income tax purposes. The main focus is first, whether the cost of acquiring a TTQ is deductible, and secondly whether a TTQ is “depreciable property” within the definition provided for in the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). This statement concludes that any expenditure incurred in acquiring a TTQ is not deductible under section 104 as the expenditure is capital expenditure under section 106(1)(a). As expenditure is not deductible under section 104, the provisions of section 104A will not apply. It has also been concluded that a TTQ is “depreciable property”, being fixed life intangible property, by virtue of it being “a right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule of the Act. When a TTQ is converted to an Individual Term Quota (“ITQ”), it is not a “disposal” for the purposes of section 117(10). The issues The issues considered in this interpretation statement are: • • • Is the acquisition of a TTQ (at a cost) deductible expenditure, and if so, can the cost be amortised. If not, what is the correct treatment of the expenditure? Is a TTQ a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule and therefore able to be depreciated? If a TTQ is able to be depreciated, is the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ a “disposal” in terms of the Act? Background By the early 1980s, fishing pressure had reduced the size of a number of New Zealand’s major fisheries stocks. The Quota Management System (“QMS”) was introduced in 1986 through amendments to the Fisheries Act 1983. The aim of the QMS was to conserve major fisheries’ stocks and improve the economic efficiency of the industry. Fish species are managed under the QMS through ITQ. An ITQ is the right to catch a specified quantity of quota species each fishing year within a Quota Management Area (“QMA”), in perpetuity. 1 Due to the many Maori claims pending in relation to the various fisheries, Government agreed that for spiny rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and packhorse rock lobster (Jasus verreauxi), transferable term quota would be allocated instead of individual transferable quota. This necessitated the removal of the existing quota in respect of rock lobster from an ITQ and putting these into a separate category of their own, being TTQ. Rock lobsters were the only species of fish subject to the TTQ system. The original allocation of TTQ was made by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (“MAF”), in most instances at no cost to the holder. TTQ were subsequently traded on the open market. TTQ were first introduced as from 1 April 1990 under the Fisheries Amendment Act 1990 (No.2). Legislation provided for TTQ to have a term life of 25 years expiring on 31 March 2015. This prevented further allocations being made on a permanent basis before the Crown and Maori reached final agreement on a Deed of Settlement for all commercial fishing claims. It was envisaged that this would allow sufficient time for Maori grievances to be settled while not detrimentally affecting the catching capabilities of the commercial fishery. As from 1 October 1996, TTQ and the relevant interests attached to them were converted to ITQ. No compensatory payments were made in respect of the conversion. As TTQ were, in most instances, originally allocated to holders at no cost, the issues in this statement relate solely to TTQ acquired at a cost, which, in most instances therefore, will be acquisitions subsequent to that initial allocation. The TEO (in newsletter No 45 (20 September 1991)), stated that the Department’s policy (Technical Rulings Para 20.14.6.6) was to treat payments in relation to TTQ as a lease and allow the amount paid for the quota to be amortised over the time TTQ was held. Owing to some interpretative difficulties arising in practice, this statement aims to clarify the law as it relates to the acquisition and subsequent conversion of TTQ. Legislation Income Tax Act 1976 Section 104 states: In calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it- (a) Is incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (b) Is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purposes of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year- may, except as otherwise provided in this Act, be deducted from the total income derived by the taxpayer in the income year in which the expenditure or loss is incurred. Section 104A states: (1) For the purposes of this section- 2 “Accrual expenditure”, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after the 1st day of August 1986 by the person that is deductible under this Act other than expenditure incurred- (a) In respect of trading stock; or (b) In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c) In respect of a lease to which section 222A to 222D or section 222E of this Act apply; or (d) Pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 8:30 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on the 31st day of July 1986: (2) The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be- (a) Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in the production of assessable income: (b) Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (ba) Subject to subsection (2B) of this section, where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of such expenditure that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (2A) of this section: (c) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. (3) Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure, that expenditure shall be deductible when it is incurred in accordance with the provisions of this Act but the unexpired portion (if any) of that expenditure shall be taken into account in ascertaining the assessable income of the person for the income year in which that expenditure is incurred and subsequent income years. (4) The amount of the unexpired portion of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person at the end of an income year shall be included in the assessable income of the person for the income year and such amount shall be deductible in the following year. Section 106(1) states: Notwithstanding anything in section 104 of this Act, in calculating the assessable income derived by any person from any source, no deduction shall, except as expressly provided in this Act, be made in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a) Investment, expenditure, loss, or withdrawal of capital; money used or intended to be used as capital; money used in the improvement of premises occupied; interest which might have been made on any such capital or money if laid out at interest; the acquisition price of any financial arrangement (as defined in section 64B(1) of this Act) to which sections 64B to 64M of this Act applies: Provided that this paragraph shall not deny a deduction in respect of any amount of expenditure deemed to be expenditure pursuant to sections 64B to 64M of this Act: Section 111 states: (1) Where a taxpayer has acquired any property from an associated person (as defined in section 245B of this Act) entitled to a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property, irrespective of whether or not any deduction has in fact been allowed to that associated person, the Commissioner shall not allow to the taxpayer any greater deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property than that which would have been allowed to the associated person if the associated person had retained the property: Provided that where any amount so allowed as a deduction to the associated person has been dealt with under section 117 of this Act, the Commissioner may allow to the taxpayer a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property based on the aggregate of the total of all amounts so dealt with and the amount of that depreciated value of the property immediately before it was acquired by the taxpayer. 3 (2) This section shall not apply where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the circumstances are such that a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property based on the actual price or other consideration given for the property should be allowed. Section 117(7) states: Subject to this Act, where any depreciable property has been disposed of-- (a) Other than in accordance with a matrimonial agreement; and (b) Along with any other property; or (c) For a consideration that the Commissioner believes is not the market value; or (d) In accordance with subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (a) of the definition of the term “disposal” in subsection (10) of this section,-- the Commissioner shall deem the property to have been disposed of for a consideration equal to the property’s market value or, if the market value cannot be ascertained, for a consideration specified by the Commissioner. “Annual depreciation rate” is defined in section 107A(1)as: “Annual depreciation rate”, or “annual rate”, in relation to any depreciable property of a taxpayer, is the rate applying in respect of that property and that taxpayer pursuant to-- (a) Section 108G of this Act, in the case of fixed life intangible property (not being excluded depreciable property): (b) Section 108H of this Act, in the case of excluded depreciable property: (c) Section 108D of this Act, in the case of other depreciable property acquired before the end of the taxpayer’s 1994-95 income year: (d) Section 108E of this Act, in the case of international aircraft acquired in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 income year or any subsequent year: (e) Section 108F of this Act, in the case of other depreciable property acquired in the taxpayer’s 1995- 96 income year or any subsequent year: The annual depreciation rate for fixed life intangible property in section 108G states: The annual depreciation rate for any fixed life intangible property of a taxpayer (not being excluded depreciable property) shall be the rate, expressed as a decimal and rounded to two decimal places (with numbers at the midpoint or greater being rounded up and other numbers being rounded down), calculated in accordance with the following formula: 1 -------------------- legal life where “legal life” means the legal life of the property at the time at which it was acquired by the taxpayer. “Depreciable intangible property” is defined in Schedule 22 as being the following: 1. The right to use a copyright. 2. The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. 3. A patent or the right to use a patent. 4. The right to use land. 5. The right to use plant or machinery. 6. The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7. The right to use a trademark. 8. Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. “Depreciable property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: 4 “Depreciable property” in relation to any taxpayer, - (a) Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons - (i) In gaining or producing assessable income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing income; but (b) Does not include - (i) Trading stock (as defined in section 85(1) of this Act) of the taxpayer: (ii) Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in the Twenty-first Schedule to this Act): (iii) Financial arrangements, as defined in section 64B of this Act: (iv) Intangible property other than intangible property which is of a type listed in the Twenty-second Schedule to this Act, which Schedule describes intangible property that has – (A) A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (B) If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes: (iva) Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section 108O of this Act: (v) Property the cost of which is deductible under any of sections 104, 127, 131, 134 to 139, 142, 143, and 214F of this Act, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction available under any section of this Act (such as sections 128A, 128B, 128C, 144, and 222E) other than sections 108 to 108N and section 113A: (vi) Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive any compensation for any such decline in value on disposition of such property: “Disposal” is defined in section 117(10) as: (a) Includes-- (i) The acquisition of property of a taxpayer by any person empowered to do so by statutory authority: (ii) Ceasing to use in New Zealand and taking out of New Zealand for use outside New Zealand any property of a taxpayer in respect of which a first-year allowance has been granted under section 112 of this Act (other than under subsection (8) of that section), except where the Commissioner is satisfied that - (A) The property has been taken out of New Zealand only temporarily; and (B) The property will, after its return to New Zealand, be used in or for the purpose of a business in New Zealand: (iii) In any income year, any change of use, or change of location of use, occurring in a preceding income year, as a consequence of which the application of section 108A of this Act gives rise to a nil deduction on account of depreciation for that subsequent income year, in which case the property shall be deemed to have been disposed of on the first day of that subsequent income year and no deduction on account of depreciation shall be claimed in that subsequent income year: (iv) Any event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property: (v) Any event as a consequence of which the property is irreparably damaged; but (b) Does not include, in the case of intangible property, the disposal of that property as part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. “Excluded depreciable property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Excluded depreciable property” means, in respect of any taxpayer, any depreciable property- (a) That was used or was available to be used by the taxpayer for any purpose whatever within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before the 1st day of April 1993; or (b) For which a binding contract for its purchase or construction was entered into by the taxpayer before the 16th day of December 1991; or (c) That is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying asset within the meaning of section 108N (1) of this Act; or 5 (d) To the extent that the property is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying improvement within the meaning of section 108N of this Act; or (e) That is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before the 1st day of April 1993;- but does not include any item of property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was permitted by the Commissioner to be accounted for in that income year using any of the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation methods: “Fixed life intangible property” is defined in section 107A(1) as: any intangible property that- (a) Is depreciable property; and (b) Has a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of the creation or acquisition of the property, to be the same as the property’s remaining estimated useful life. “Legal life” is defined in section 107A(1) as: “Legal life”, in respect of any intangible property and the owner of that property, means the number of years and any monthly fraction thereof that the property may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the property for the owner assuming any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre- determined fees, are exercised: Fisheries Act 1983 “Transferable term quota” is defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1983 as: means quota that confers on the holder the right to take rock lobster at any time in the period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990 (being quota that may be transferred as if it were individual transferable quota allocated under Part IIA of this Act). Section 28BA(1) states: The taking of rock lobster in the quota management areas described in the Third Schedule to the Maori Fisheries Act 1989 is hereby declared to be subject, for the period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990, to the quota management system established under this Part of this Act. Section 28 OA(3) further describes a TTQ by saying: Subject to subsection (4) of this section \[which requires a fishing permit to be held\], each transferable term quota shall enable the holder, or if there is more than one holder, the combined holders, and any lessee or lessees of the rights to take rock lobster under the quota, to take in total within the quota management area concerned in any year rock lobster, or rock lobster of the species shown in the quota, up to a tonnage shown in the quota. Section 334 of the Fisheries Act 1996 states: (1) All transferable term quota (within the meaning of the Fisheries Act 1983) that- (a) Was owned by any person immediately before the commencement of this section; and (b) Relates to packhorse rock lobster or spiny rock lobster in a particular quota management area- is hereby declared to be individual transferable quota under Part II A of that Act for the species in that quota management area. 6 (2) The conversion of quota by subsection (1) of this section does not constitute an allocation of new quota for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law. (3) All quota allocated under section 28 OA of the Fisheries Act 1983 after the commencement of this subsection, as a result of an appeal to which section 335(1) of this Act applies, shall be allocated in the form of individual transferable quota under Part IIA of the Fisheries Act 1983. (4) All individual transferable quota to which this section applies shall be perpetual even though it has been converted from quota that has been declared by section 28 BA of the Fisheries Act 1983 to be subject to the quota management system established under the Act for a period of 25 years commencing on the 1 st day of April 1990. (5) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that sections 28E and 28OE(1)(a) of the Fisheries Act 1983 do not apply and have never applied to transferable term quota under the Fisheries Act 1983 or to individual transferable quota for rock lobster created under this section. \[Emphasis added\] “Territorial Sea” is defined in the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 as: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires; The territorial sea of New Zealand comprises those areas of the sea having, as their inner limits, the baseline described in sections 5 and 6 \[and 6A\] of this Act and, as their outer limits, a line measured seaward from that baseline, every point of which line is distant 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. And section 7 of the above Act states: Subject to the grant of any estate or interest therein (whether by or pursuant to the provisions of any enactment or otherwise, and whether made before or after the commencement of this Act), the seabed and subsoil of submarine areas bounded on the landward side by the low-water mark along the coast of New Zealand (including the coast of all islands) and on the seaward side by the outer limits of the territorial sea of New Zealand shall be deemed to be and always to have been vested in the Crown. The “Continental Shelf” is defined in the Continental Shelf Act 1964 as: The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that extend beyond the territorial limits of New Zealand, throughout the natural prolongation of the land territory of New Zealand, to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (as described in sections 5 and 6 \[and 6A\] of the Territorial Sea and Economic Zone Act 1977) where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend to that distance. Section 3 of the same Act states: All rights that are exercisable by New Zealand with respect to the continental shelf and its natural resources for the purpose of exploring the shelf and exploiting those resources are hereby vested in the Crown. Application of the Legislation Is the cost of acquiring a TTQ deductible? Various possible interpretations exist as to the correct treatment of the cost of a TTQ. One interpretation is that the cost may be fully deductible under section 104. If this is so, then the amount paid for the TTQ would be either deductible in full in the year of expenditure, or, more likely, able to be amortised over the period it is held, in terms of section 104A. This section 104A interpretation would also mean that, on the disposition of a TTQ, any unexpired portion of expenditure, as at the date of 7 conversion to an ITQ, would not be required to be added back as income under section 104A(4). The effect of this interpretation would be that a deduction for the full amount of the acquisition cost has been made. A second interpretation is that the cost of a TTQ is not fully deductible in terms of section 104 because it is capital expenditure in terms of section 106(1)(a). In this situation, the cost of a TTQ cannot be amortised over the period it is held, under section 104A, and, ordinarily, any loss incurred by the taxpayer on the disposition of a TTQ will be a capital loss. This interpretation would also mean that there is no unexpired portion of expenditure as at the date of conversion. NOTE: If a taxpayer was buying and selling TTQ as part of a business activity, e.g. dealers, traders etc., the treatment of the costs of acquiring TTQ is likely to be different. Thirdly, if a TTQ is considered to be a capital asset in terms of section 106(1)(a), it may be able to be depreciated. General capital v revenue principles In CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101, Richardson J described the governing approach to the capital/revenue distinction to be the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v FCT (\[1966\] AC 224). In BP Australia the general approach to the question of whether a payment is a capital or revenue expense was outlined by Lord Pierce at p.264: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in border-line cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process” (per Dixon J. in Hallstroms Pty. Ltd. v F.C. of T. (1946) 72 C.L.R. 634 at p.648). In BP Australia, Lord Pearce applied the tests formulated in Sun Newspaper Limited and Associated Newspapers Ltd v FCT ((1939) 61 CLR 337) to determine whether payments made by BP to secure trade tie agreements were capital or revenue. In that decision Dixon J set out three important matters to take into account, namely: • the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part; • the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part; and • the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payments so as to secure future enjoyment. 8 In CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd (\[1972\] NZLR 209) the taxpayer company claimed a deduction for the payment of goodwill which had been made in the course of a take- over of another company. The Court of Appeal rejected the claim on the ground that a payment for goodwill is an outgoing of a capital nature. North J identified six tests applicable in border line cases, which have been enunciated in a number of the leading decisions, namely: • the tests of recurrence; • the distinction between fixed and circulating capital; • the distinction between the business entity or structure or the profit-yielding subject as contrasted with the process by which it operates or is operated in order to obtain regular returns by means of regular outgoings or outlays; • whether the expenditure was made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade; • whether the expenditure is an ordinary expenditure of the regular conduct of the business or an organisation for earning profits; and • the nature of the asset obtained or sought in which its enduring character may play a part. North P delivered the judgment of the Court, and in the course of his judgment his Honour said at p.215: In this case a good deal was made of the fact that the import licences held by Entricans were reviewed each year and a purchaser would have no assurance that the licences would be renewed or indeed that the categories therein mentioned would not be altered or indeed substantially reduced. Likewise, there was no guarantee that Entrican’s customers would be willing to do business with Nathans and therefore it was argued there was no certainty of Nathans deriving an enduring benefit from the contract. In my opinion, there is no substance whatever in either of these contentions. I cannot do better than adopt the words of Rich J in the well known Australian case, Sun Newspaper Limited and Associated Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1939) 61 CLR 337: “The purpose (of the payment) was to buy opposition and secure so far as possible a monopoly. The fact that the benefit was not perpetual does not deprive it of its capital attributes. If physical assets of a terminating or wasting description were bought, no one would say on that account that the money was a revenue expenditure.” In the Commissioner’s view, TTQ are the business structure from which any income would be derived. The ability to derive income from a rock lobster operation is only possible by virtue of the taxpayer being in possession of a TTQ. The acquisition cost of a TTQ is a once-only expenditure which brought into existence an asset for the enduring benefit of a trade. The fact that TTQ were not perpetual and only had a limited life of 25 years does not mean that TTQ were not capital in nature (CIR v LD Nathan). Those receiving a TTQ are receiving a valuable right that is clearly providing an enduring benefit to the business . 9 On this basis, it is considered that, because a TTQ is a capital asset, the expenditure in acquiring a TTQ is expenditure of a capital nature and is precluded from deduction under section 104 by virtue of section 106(1)(a). As a result of this conclusion, the cost of a TTQ cannot be amortised under section 104A, because section 104A only applies where expenditure is ordinarily deductible under the Act (whereas TTQ are capital in nature). Is a TTQ “depreciable property”? The current depreciation regime was introduced into the Income Tax Act 1976 as taking effect from the 1993/1994 income year. Included as part of the regime were certain types of intangible assets, listed in the 22nd Schedule. Prior to the current depreciation regime, no provision was made for the depreciation of intangible property of any kind. The ability to depreciate intangible property that existed before the new regime was introduced is denied by the definition of “excluded depreciable property”, as provided for at section 107A, which specifically excludes depreciable property used or available to be used prior to 1 April 1993. Depreciation on intangible assets only applies to those assets acquired after 1 April 1993. As TTQ were first created in 1990, it is only those TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 that would meet the “depreciable property” definition. To come within the definition of “depreciable property”, the following criteria need to be satisfied: • • • • The property is depreciable intangible property of a type within the 22nd Schedule The property might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use; and The property has been used in deriving gross income; or The property has been used in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. The intangible property listed in the 22nd Schedule is as follows: 1. The right to use a copyright. 2. The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. 3. A patent or the right to use a patent. 4. The right to use land. 5. The right to use plant or machinery. 6. The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7. The right to use a trademark. 8. Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. 9. A consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15 of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after the 1996-97 income year. 10. The copyright in a sound recording, if the copyright was produced or purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 July 1997, and copies of the recording have been sold or offered for sale to the public. 10 A fishing quota provides the owner with the right to catch a defined percentage of the Total Allowable Commercial Catch and therefore potentially, the only category from this schedule which could be considered to apply to fishing quota, is the “right to use land”. Is the use of fishing quota the “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule? In order to be depreciable property, a TTQ must be depreciable intangible property and therefore it must come within Schedule 22, i.e. it must be the right to use land. Rock lobster, which are the only species of fish subject to the TTQ system, are generally sourced from an area close to the foreshore and are largely found in and around rocks, which are on the sea-bed. They may be collected in any one of three ways: by diving, potting and hand-gathering, but generally, the most favoured is the potting method, which results in the largest catches. Potting takes place in areas where the rocks are easily reached for the purpose of placing pots. Therefore, it is necessary to decide whether the right to use the sea-bed in the area where the lobster are located constitutes a right to use land. Neither “right to use land” nor “land” are defined in the Act for the purposes of Schedule 22. “Land”, however, is defined in section 67 in relation to profits or gains from land transactions as: (a) Any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal, freehold or chattel; and (b) Any option to acquire land and any such estate or interest in land;- but does not include a mortgage. This definition relates to interests, and in this respect is concerned with the “rights” in land, not what things are considered to actually be land for the purposes of TTQ. We are concerned with what goes to make up land, that is, its composition and in this regard, this definition provides no assistance. “Land” is also defined in a number of other Acts, e.g. Marine Farming Act 1971, Resource Management Act 1991, Foreshore and Seabed Endowment Revesting Act 1991, that are consistent with an interpretation that land includes the seabed. These definitions, however, are only defined for purposes of those particular Acts – they are not specifically shown to apply for tax purposes. In the absence of a specific definition of “land” in the Income Tax Act stating what land includes or is composed of, and the fact that the definitions in other legislation apply only to those particular Acts, it is necessary to consider the common law meaning of “land” as to whether the rights in waters include rights to the land below them. If, therefore, it can be established in common law that these rights extend to include that land beneath the water, then, by analogy, any right the Crown has granted to fish in a particular area of water will also include a corresponding right to use or take from the land. Case law on water rights 11 A number of cases have considered water rights and whether these extend to include the land below the water. In Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153, the Privy Council had to consider whether the legislature of British Columbia could authorise the Government of the Dominion to grant fishing leases and licenses in both tidal and non-tidal waters, and below the low water mark and in parts of the open sea. Therefore, the case concerned the authority of the legislature of British Columbia. The legislature of British Columbia had granted to the Government of the Dominion a strip of land known as the railway belt. This railway belt included both tidal and non-tidal waters. In discussing what had passed under the grant of the railway belt, the Privy Council said at pp.167-168: \[Their Lordships\] are unable to see any ground for construing the grant of the railway belt as excluding such lands situated within it as are covered with water. The solum (ground) of a river bed is a property differing in no essential characteristic from other lands..... ...In the present case, therefore, their Lordships entertain no doubt that the title to the solum and the water rights in the Fraser and other rivers and lakes so far as within the belt are at present held by the Crown in right of the Dominion, and that this title extends to the exclusive management of the land and to the appropriation of its territorial revenues. It remains to consider the consequences as regards fishing rights. These are, in their Lordships opinion, the same as in the ordinary case of ownership of a lake or river bed. The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit a prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal heriditament.....But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non-tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. \[emphasis added\] Their Lordships went on to say (at p.171): It follows from these considerations that the position of the rights of fishing in the rivers, lakes, and tidal waters (whether in rivers and estuaries or on the foreshore) within the railway belt stand prima facie as follows: In the non-tidal waters they belong to the proprietor of the soil, i.e. the Dominion, unless and until they have been granted by it to some individual or corporation. In the tidal waters, whether on the foreshore or in creeks, estuaries, and tidal rivers, the public have the right to fish, and by reason of the provisions of the Magna Carta no restriction can be put upon that right of the public by an exercise of the prerogative in the form of a grant or otherwise. It will of course be understood that in speaking of this public right of fishing in tidal waters their Lordships do not refer in any way to such fishing by kiddles, weirs, or other engines fixed to the soil. Such methods of fishing involve a use of the solum which, according to English law, cannot be vested in the public, but must belong to the Crown or some private owner. The Privy Council drew a distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways which meet the sea, and as such, are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of 12 streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. It held that, in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right, and as such, exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers, this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the particular facts of the British Columbia case, this meant that the right was a property right over which the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority, except that the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. In respect of tidal waters, Viscount Haldane said: But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public...... So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. In respect of the rights relating to the open seas, the Privy Council said that it did not propose to express an opinion on the question of whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark. However, it went on to say (at p.173): Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. In re Ninety-Mile Beach \[1963\] NZLR 461, the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered whether the Maori Land Court had jurisdiction to consider claims over the foreshore. The Court of Appeal did not actually consider whether the foreshore was land, but it is implicit from their discussions that they clearly considered it to be so. The following are some examples: ...the question we are asked to consider in this appeal is whether the jurisdiction of the Maori Land Court to investigate the title to customary land and to issue freehold orders in respect thereof extends to the investigation of title to and the issue of freehold orders in respect of land lying between mean high water mark and mean low water mark... (p.466). The main submission made by the Solicitor General was that on the assumption of sovereignty by her majesty Queen Victoria, the foreshore of the lands of New Zealand including the land in question became and has ever since remained vested in the Crown, and that the Maori Land Court-as it is now called- has not and never did have jurisdiction to investigate the title to land below the high water mark. (p.467) Has the Maori Land Court jurisdiction to investigate title to, and to issue freehold orders in respect of the foreshore- namely that part of the land which lies between the mean high water mark and the mean low water mark? (p.474) The facts were that on 13 December 1864 the Crown had made a grant of land on the foreshore at Timaru down to the low water mark... (p.476) 13 The issue of ownership of the river bed was also considered in re the bed of the Wanganui River \[1955\] NZLR 419, where the Court of Appeal considered the river bed to be land. Cooke J said (at p.429): ...by the Treaty the soil of the bed became vested in the Crown as part of its demesne \[domain\] lands and unaffected by any native customary title. North J went on to say (at pp.461-463): I can see no justification for the Solicitor General’s argument that some distinction is to be drawn between dry land and land covered with water; both were tribal territory, and both had their uses and served the needs of the tribe. ...It seems to me however, to be clear, that this section recognised the possibility of the existence of rivers running through the tribal lands, and in the absence of any statutory provision excluding the soil of the bed of the rivers from the tribal customary lands, it is difficult to imagine that such river beds could have been excluded from a certificate of title granted to a tribe in respect of its tribal lands. It is implicit in the two New Zealand cases above that there is no distinction between title to bare land and title to land over which water is flowing. The rights which attach to waters are derived from the rights to the land below such waters. However, the nature of the particular land being looked at in these cases is such that it would normally be subject to the Land Transfer Act 1952, whereby the owner would, in effect, hold a title to the land, regardless of whether water flowed over it or not. The rights to a TTQ are rights in the open sea, an area not subject to the Land Transfer Act and this may be of significance. In British Columbia, the Privy Council, whilst recognising that, prima facie, the right to fish in tidal waters or open seas is primarily a public right, held that the Dominion (in whom the title was vested, in this instance the Crown of New Zealand) may legislate against this right. This means that the proprietary right to the territorial waters is vested in the Crown. Legislation of this nature has been effected by the provisions of section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977, which states that the sea-bed to the outer limits of the territorial waters is vested in the Crown, and as such, is a legal interest. As referred to earlier, the area where rock lobster are gathered is within the territorial waters of New Zealand, meaning that the area where rock lobster are gathered is vested in the Crown. If, as the Privy Council considered to be the case in British Columbia, the title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum, then this right arises by virtue of there being an interest in the solum. Hence, the Crown, by virtue of it having the legal interest in the land, also has title to the fishery above such land. The enactment of the Fisheries Act 1983 (and the subsequent amending Acts) specifically provided the Crown with sole rights to grant to others the right to take species of fish from particular waters. In addition, the Fisheries Act also provided for the holder of a fishing quota to transfer by way of sale or lease the rights held in a TTQ. On the basis of the British Columbia case, the Crown has the ability to permit others to fish in the Crown’s solum, i.e. to take some of its interest in the land (the fish). This raises the question of whether the right to take fish is the right to use land. Is the right to take fish a “right to use land” 14 The meaning of the “right to use land” should be considered from the perspective of its context for the purposes of Schedule 22. Schedule 22 allows the depreciation of certain intangible assets used by the taxpayer in the income earning process. This means that the intangible “right to use land” must be a right which is exercised in the course of the taxpayer deriving his or her income. A fishing quota confers on the holder a right to take fish, whose sale provides income to the holder. However, the issue is whether the right to use the water to take fish, means that it is a right to use the land below that water. From all three cases referred to earlier it has been established that, where there is title to an area, that area is defined by reference to the sub-soil, and therefore forms part of that title. As stated above, the Crown has vested in it the territorial waters and the sea-bed below such waters. On this basis, we consider that a fishing quota, which confers on the holder the right to use the waters for the purpose of taking the entitlement of fish, also includes the right to use the land below those waters. This is on the basis that the “right to use” is the right to use the land to the extent necessary to exercise the rights conferred by the fishing quota. Additionally, in the case of rock lobster it can also be argued that, as the lobster's habitat is, usually, on the sea-bed or rocks resting on the sea-bed, the lobster themselves are gathered from the land. This conclusion holds equally for all other species of fish. Is a TTQ a profit à prendre? It could be argued that a TTQ, being a right to use land, is a profit à prendre. A profit à prendre (a right to take profits from the land) also includes a right to use land as it confers on the holder a right to take from the water, including the land below it. However, a profit à prendre is an interest in land, which is a tangible right. Therefore, although a TTQ has many of the same characteristics as a profit à prendre, the better view is that a TTQ is not a profit à prendre. To elaborate on this view, it is necessary to determine what distinguishes a TTQ from a profit à prendre. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something off land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water which flows over land. In Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1987\] 2 Ch 96, the plaintiffs held an exclusive right of fishing with rod and line for a specified period in a certain part of a river. The plaintiffs succeeded in bringing an action for trespass against the defendants, who had polluted the river by way of discharge of clay and gravel-washings. The pollution resulted in fish being driven almost entirely out of the plaintiff’s fisheries, interfered with the natural spawning process, deprived the fish of food and rendered the remaining fish unsuitable to take. Lindley LJ cited with approval the dictum in Smith v Kemp (1693) 2 salk.637 on the subject of “piscary” where the Court said: 15 If a grant be de liberia piscaria, the grantee shall have the property of the fish there, and shall maintain trespass for fishing there. Lindley LJ went on to say (at p.99): The right to fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights. The second characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. Section 90 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 also specifically provides for the registration of the interest in a profit à prendre on the legal title to the land. In this respect, a profit à prendre confers rights of a possessory nature. As a result of this legal interest, the owner of a profit à prendre can bring an action for trespass at common law for an infringement of those rights. However, although both a TTQ and a profit à prendre have these similar features, the right of action in respect of each is not the same. A person holding the rights in a profit à prendre can bring an action for trespass for an infringement of those rights, because a profit à prendre is a property right and the right is actionable as a right in rem. This feature can be distinguished from a TTQ where, if an unauthorised person was fishing in the quota area or prevented a TTQ holder from exercising his or her rights in any manner, no action for trespass is available to the holder of a TTQ. The legal right of action (e.g. prosecution action) for any unauthorised conduct (e.g. trespass) lies with the Crown, exercised by the Ministry of Fisheries on behalf of the Crown. In addition to this, the rights in a TTQ, in contrast to those in a profit à prendre, are not registerable under the Land Transfer Act because the territorial waters and land below such waters are not subject to that Act. The case law referred to above indicates that, generally, a fishing right is a profit à prendre. However, based on the analysis above, we consider that the rights in a TTQ, whilst similar to those in a profit à prendre, can be sufficiently distinguished so as to conclude that a TTQ is not an interest in land and therefore, not a tangible interest in land. Can the property be reasonably expected in normal circumstances to decline in value? In order to be “depreciable property”, property must also meet a further test, i.e. the requirement that it might reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use. In the Commissioner’s view, as a TTQ existed for a fixed term only, prima facie, the value of such quota would reasonably be expected to decline, in terms of resale value, as the term came closer to an end. However, it is acknowledged that extraneous factors such as economic conditions and scarcity of rock lobster may also directly affect the value of the quota during the term 16 of the right, so that at a given point in time the value may fluctuate upwards or downwards. The fact that property may fluctuate in value over the period of its life was recognised by the Valabh Committee in their report “Tax Accounting Issues” (Feb 1991) which recommended the inclusion of fixed life intangible property in the definition of “depreciable property”. It said (at p.111): In general, the approach adopted by the Commissioner has been to exclude from the class of depreciable property those assets that are not used in the derivation of assessable income, as well as those assets that are not expected “systematically” to decline in value over the estimated useful life of the asset. This approach has not resulted in the exclusion of assets that exhibit an increase in their nominal value at some stage over their useful life. Assets that are expected to fall in value over their estimated useful lives are still depreciable even if they increase in value at certain times during that period. However, it has resulted in the exclusion of certain “investment” assets that can be expected to appreciate in value over most of the asset's life (such as, original works of art, vintage cars etc.), even though it is recognised that the value of those assets at the end of their useful lives will inevitably be less than their original cost. It is noted that two tests are to be applied when considering an expectation of decline: • • The decline must be reasonably expected. Consideration is made having regard to normal circumstances. “Reasonably”, as an adverb, is not defined specifically in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. However, “reasonable” is stated to mean: 1. having sound judgment; moderate; ready to listen to reason. 2. In accordance with reason, not absurd. 3. Within the limits of reason; not greatly less or more than might be expected. The “reasonable expectation” is that from the point of view of the person who is purchasing or intending to purchase, in this instance, a TTQ. This is because it is only this person who is concerned with whether a TTQ would appreciate or decline in value. A factor most likely to be taken into account by an intending purchaser when making any purchase decision. This also means that it is an initial test, taken at the time of acquisition. A similar test is provided for in the penalties regime where, in assessing whether a taxpayer has exercised “reasonable care”, the effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with that of a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. On this basis an interpretation of the dictionary definitions above would mean that the taxpayer is only expected to exercise such an expectation based on practical or sensible factors, and relative to what a taxpayer in that person’s position would be expected to know. “Normal” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as meaning: conforming to a standard; regular, usual, typical. “Normal circumstances” are circumstances which, according to past practice have shown a typical pattern or outcome. Exceptional factors which may arise or be 17 present when considering a “reasonable expectation” are not ones that are required to be considered in “normal circumstances”. In summary, the words “can be reasonably expected” and “in normal circumstances” mean that whether there is likely to be a decline in value of an asset over the period it is held, is to be regarded from the point of view of the ordinary taxpayer who is purchasing a TTQ. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, such “reasonable expectation” will therefore need to be based on historical evidence of whether, in the past, these type of assets have generally declined in value over the period they are held. Whether an asset appreciates or declines in value is relative to the particular class of asset and any exceptional circumstances at the time, and such tests are to be appropriately determined in the context of each asset. The legislation makes it clear that a TTQ can only exist for a period of 25 years, and apart from normal market fluctuations in value according to supply and demand, it could be reasonably expected that the value of the quota would, in normal circumstances, decline over this period whilst being used or available for use. In view of this, and the earlier conclusion that TTQ are a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule, TTQ are “depreciable property” within the definition provided for in section OB 1 of the Act. However, the definition of “depreciable property” in referring to intangible property of the type listed in the 22nd Schedule also states that such Schedule describes intangible property which: 1. has a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and 2. has, if made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes A literal reading of the words “such schedule describes” suggests that this is a direction to the 22nd Schedule which describes what one might find there. On this basis, a literal reading suggests this wording is merely an ancillary point, in this instance, adding description to the types of assets covered by the 22nd Schedule, as an aid to interpretation. Additionally, the type of factors described in 1 and 2 above would not, in ordinary circumstances, be factors which Parliament would expect the taxpayer to have to consider. Adopting this interpretation means that these are tests to be applied by Parliament, through its advisors, prior to the addition of the asset category to the 22nd Schedule. However, it is possible that these two requirements are not in fact tests to be applied by Parliament’s advisors prior to the addition of the asset category to the 22nd Schedule, but are additional tests which fall to the taxpayer to satisfy, after it has been established that the asset is one of the types within the 22nd Schedule. As the meaning of this provision is not clear, it is necessary to consider whether TTQ would meet these requirements if in fact, they are additional requirements to be satisfied. Finite useful life 18 In respect of the first element, it must be possible to determine a finite life for the asset at its creation or date of purchase. In regards to TTQ, the definition of Transferable Term Quota in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1993 states that a right to take rock lobster is conferred for a period of 25 years beginning on the 1st day of April 1990. The rights conferred allow the collection of rock lobster up to a certain tonnage per year. This means the quota can be re-used in each of the 25 years on a continual basis. Therefore, a TTQ has a useful life for the whole of its existence, that is, 25 years. As the life of a TTQ has been written into legislation at the date of creation, this element has been satisfied as a matter of fact, and would in all likelihood be known to any prospective purchaser. It would definitely be known to Inland Revenue. For these reasons, we consider that either the taxpayer or Inland Revenue can determine this factor as it relates to TTQ at the time of creation, or, for purchasers, post creation. Low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes The type of situation possibly envisaged by this provision would be where the asset is sold at an inflated value. Generally, these types of arrangements take place between associated persons. However, the legislation provides a remedy for this situation in section 111 \[EG 17\]. On this basis, it can be inferred that a possible situation which section 111 does not specifically cover, is where the sale price of an asset is inflated between non-associated persons. However, there is a possibility that the Commissioner could apply the provisions of section 117(7) \[EG 19(7)\] to deem the property to have been disposed of for a consideration equal to the property’s market value. In the case of a TTQ, it would not have been possible for a taxpayer to purchase the asset for the purpose of being used in a tax avoidance scheme. This is because the asset has never previously been held to be depreciable property, and therefore could never have been originally acquired by a taxpayer for any tax avoidance purpose relating to depreciation. In addition to this, TTQ are no longer in existence and therefore it is not now open to any taxpayer to acquire a TTQ, and hence cannot be used for the purposes of any future tax avoidance scheme. Based on the wording of the legislation, the correct interpretation is that where an asset has been included in the 22nd Schedule it has already met the two requirements above, and therefore these factors are not required to be considered separately in relation to any of the types of assets included in the 22nd Schedule. These factors have already been considered before the asset has been added to the 22nd Schedule. Excluded depreciable property Although a TTQ can be considered to come within the definition of “depreciable property”, it must not be depreciable property which is “excluded depreciable property”. “Excluded depreciable property” is defined as depreciable property: (a) That was used or available to be used by the taxpayer for any purpose whatever within New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before the 1st day of April 1993; or (b) For which a binding contract for its purchase or construction was entered into by the taxpayer before the 16th day of December 1991; or 19 (c) That is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying asset within the meaning of section 108N (1) of this Act; or (d) To the extent that the property is or has been in respect of the taxpayer a qualifying improvement within the meaning of section 108N of this Act; or (e) That is an intangible asset that was used or was available for use by the taxpayer before the 1st day of April 1993;-- but does not include any item of property in existence at the end of the 1992-93 income year that was permitted by the Commissioner to be accounted for in that income year using any of the standard value, replacement value, or annual revaluation methods: Assets considered to be “excluded depreciable property” include assets used or available for use prior to 1 April 1993. This means that only those TTQ acquired after that date can be depreciated. Having determined that TTQ are depreciable property, provided they were acquired after 1 April 1993, the next issue is the rate of depreciation that applies to these assets. The definition of “annual depreciation rate” states that the rate to be applied in the case of “fixed life intangible property” is, pursuant to section 108G, calculated as the fraction of one over the legal life of the asset. In order to be “fixed life intangible property” the property must be depreciable property and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition to be the same length as the property’s remaining estimated useful life. As it has already been established earlier that a TTQ is depreciable property, it now needs to be established that a TTQ has a “legal life” equal to its “useful life”. “Legal life” is, in respect of intangible property and the owner of that property, the number of years and any monthly fraction thereof that the property may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract that creates the property for the owner assuming any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of pre-determined fees, are exercised (section 107A(1)). TTQ were created pursuant to section 28 AB of the Fisheries Act 1993 for a period of 25 years beginning on 1 April 1990. The legal life, therefore, expires on 31 March 2015. As the tonnage available to be caught under the quota system remains constant throughout each of those 25 years, and ceases on the same date as the legal life, it can be said that the useful life of a TTQ is equal to its legal life. On this basis, a TTQ meets the definition of “fixed life intangible property” and is subject to such rate as provided for in section 108G. The rate set out for fixed life intangible property in section 108G is the formula, “one over the legal life”. The depreciation rate will be calculated on a straight-line method, from the date of acquisition and with regard to that period remaining up until 31 March 2015. In summary, a TTQ is depreciable property as it is a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule and the rate of depreciation is that rate provided for in section 108G. The ability to depreciate will only apply to those TTQ acquired on or after 1 April 1993. 20 Having determined that a TTQ is “depreciable property”, it is necessary to now look at the effect of the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ as from 30 September 1996, and whether this constituted a “disposal” in terms of the legislation. If in fact the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ constitutes a “disposal”, any depreciation claimed in those years from 1 April 1993 until 30 September 1996 will need to be taken into account when determining any income tax liability, that is, a depreciation “clawback”. If a TTQ is able to be depreciated, is the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ a “disposal”? In order for a TTQ to be a “disposal” on its conversion to an ITQ, it will need to satisfy one of the provisions within the definition of “disposal” in section 117(10). Two provisions within this section relate to intangible property that could potentially apply to TTQ. These are that a “disposal”: • • Includes any event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property. Does not include, in the case of intangible property, the disposal of that property as part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. Is the conversion of a TTQ an event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property mean that it will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owns that property? Although “disposal” is defined specifically in relation to depreciation, the words of the legislation state that the definitions given are inclusive. This means that the definition of “disposal” in section 117(10), which includes the two factors above, is not exhaustive. In view of this, it is necessary to also look at the meaning given to the word at common law. The meaning of the word “disposal” or “disposition” has been considered in a number of jurisdictions. In Ward v CIR \[1955\] NZLR 361, Gresson J referred to the meaning given to “disposition” by the House of Lords in Duke of Northumberland v AG \[1905\] AC 406. He said: \[It\] is clear that the terms “disposition” and “devolution” must have been intended to comprehend and exhaust every conceivable mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by act of the law. In FCT v Wade \[1951\] 84 CLR 105, the High Court of Australia had to consider whether diseased cattle, destroyed compulsorily and for which compensation had been received, had been disposed of “by sale or otherwise”. On the meaning of “disposed” Dixon and Fullager JJ said: The words “disposed of” are not words possessing a technical legal meaning, although they are frequently used in legal instruments. Speaking generally, they cover all forms of alienation. 21 In Grey v IRC \[1958\] 2 All ER 428, Lord Evershed MR said: The word “disposition” is one of wide import, general rather than precise. Many context could no doubt be found in which the word or its derivatives would cover any means whereby the owner of any right or property succeeded in getting rid of that which he formally enjoyed.....The meaning of the word must be discerned from and as I think limited by the context. The House of Lords affirmed the judgment, but no specific comment was made on the general meaning of disposition. Victory Hotels Ltd v MNR \[1962\] CTC 614 concerned the timing of when a business had been disposed of. The Court said that “disposed of” as used in the relevant section meant: “to part with”, “to pass over the control of the thing to someone else” so that the person disposing no longer has the use of the property. In Coles Myer Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue 98 ATC 4,537, Ormiston JA considered the meaning of the word “transfer”. However, in his judgment, he distinguished a transfer from a disposition. He said that transfer “is not a mere disposition, a ridding oneself of the right or interest”. The case law above supports the view that, for a disposition to occur, all that is required is an alienation of property. However, other cases support the view that there must be intention and activity on the part of the disposer and that the property must remain in existence after it has been disposed of. These further requirements are discussed in Wade (referred to above), where the High Court of Australia held that diseased cattle had not been disposed of “by sale or otherwise”. The Court reasoned: Such a thing involves no voluntary act on the part of the taxpayer, no alienation of property on his part and, except for the fact that it is authorised by law and compensation is payable, can hardly be differentiated from the destruction of the assets by external force or accident. In Henty House Property Ltd (in voluntary liquidation) v FCT 10 ATD 231, a building was resumed by the Commonwealth from the taxpayer who received a lump sum payment as compensation. In considering the meaning of the phrase “disposed of, lost or destroyed”, the Full High Court said: No doubt the notion primarily conveyed by the words “disposed of” is the notion of a disposition by the taxpayer; but it is not necessarily so confined, and the use of the passive voice, without specific words of restriction referring to the person by whose act the disposal takes place, leaves ample room for a construction in keeping with the general tenor of the section, and with its place in the scheme which ss 54 to 62 provide. The entire expression “disposed of, lost or destroyed” is apt to embrace every event by which property ceases to be available to the taxpayer for use for the purpose of producing assessable income, either because it ceases to be his, or because it ceases to be physically accessible to him, or because it ceases to exist. In the context of s 59 there is ample reason for rejecting a narrow construction. In particular, the words “is disposed of” are wide enough to cover all forms of alienation, as Dixon and Fullagar JJ remarked in FCT v Wade, and they should be understood as meaning no less than “becomes alienated from the taxpayer,” whether it is by him or by another that the act of alienation is done. Neither the words themselves nor the setting in which they appear afford any support for the view that cases of involuntary alienation fall outside their meaning. 22 It is obvious that the case for a construction of the expression “disposed of” as extending to compulsory acquisition is even stronger. The words “disposed of” are not technical words. They mean disposed of in a commercial sense. Similar words in other acts have been given a very wide meaning in suitable contexts. Compulsory acquisition was also considered in New Zealand in Public Trustee v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 1034. The issue was whether land compulsorily acquired under the Public Works Act was a disposition for the purposes of section 79(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act which is now section CD 4. In discussing the issue Hutchinson J, of the Supreme Court, said: In their ordinary meanings, “sale” and “disposition” require intention and activity on the part of the person selling or disposing. It was put thus by Viscount Simmonds, in relation to the words “sale” and “sold”, in Kirkness v John Hudson & Co Limited \[1955\] All ER 345: “To say of a man who has had his property taken from him against his will and been awarded compensation in the settlement of which he has had no voice, to say of such a man that he has sold his property appears to me to be as far from the truth as to say of a man who has been deprived of his property without compensation that he has given it away. Alike in the ordinary use of language and in its legal concept a sale connotes the mutual assent of two parties.” ... It was put thus in the High Court of Australia, in relation to the word “disposed”, in Henty House Pty. Ltd. v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1953) 5 A.I.T.R. 557: “No doubt the notion primarily conveyed by the words ‘disposed of’ is the notion of a disposition by the taxpayer...” (ibid., 560) and by Fullager J., in the same case: “The term ‘disposed of’ is not a technical term, and its ‘ordinary’ “or ‘popular’ meaning does not, to my mind, cover a case in which a person is deprived of his property against his will or without his consent”. But, of course, those words may bear an extended meaning if the context requires it. There has been case law considering disposition in relation to the redemption of shares. In Case Q52, Barber J found that the redemption of the shares was a “disposition” for the purposes of section 65(2)(e). The taxpayers had not bought the shares for resale, but had bought them for redemption at a higher price than they had paid for them. The redemption involved a transfer of property - the shares on redemption were not extinguished, as they would remain part of the authorised share capital of the company. That redemption should have resulted in a profit which Barber J considered would have been assessable. This meant that the transaction was revenue in character so that the loss should be deductible. Barber J had this to say about what amounts to a disposition in this context (at p.5,298): I agree with Mr Wood that when redeemable preference shares are redeemed there is the fulfilment of a contract between the company and the shareholder rather than a sale and, after redemption, the former shareholder no longer has any interest in the shares. I do not think that the shares can be regarded as being extinguished because they remain part of the authorised capital of the company and can be re- issued to someone else. While there is no sale by the shareholder to the company at the time of redemption, I consider that the property in the shares does pass from the shareholder to the company. The shareholder has parted with his rights in return for a redemption payment. That seems to me to be a disposition in terms of the above statement of Gresson J in Ward v CIR \[\[1965\] NZLR 367,370\] and in terms of the various dictionary definitions. It may seem that Public Trustee v CIR \[\[1961\] NZLR 1,034\] and Railway Timber Co Ltd v CIR \[(1976) 2 NZTC 61,172\] run counter to my view in that they seem to require a positive act from the disponer. I respectfully agree with Hutchinson J when he said at p.1,042 of Public Trustee v CIR: “In their ordinary meanings, ‘sale’ and ‘disposition’ require intention and activity on the part of the person selling or disposing.” 23 However, I do not think that this is an ordinary situation, and, in any case, I consider that there has been “intention and activity” on the part of the objectors. They always intended redemption for 6c more than they paid and they intended to enter into the activity of completing redemption procedures with the company. Had that arrangement been completed, the profit should have been returned as assessable under the second limb of s 65(2)(e). In terms of Inglis, this means that the transaction was revenue in character so that the loss should be deductible. However, Willy DJ in Case Q57 did not seek to rely on the shares remaining in the hands of the company. His Honour rejected any argument that there was no disposition because the shares once redeemed were no longer in existence on the basis that continuing existence of the property disposed of was a necessary feature of the notion of disposition. His Honour preferred to rely on the authorities which emphasised the broad meaning of “disposition” (e.g. Ward) - an approach he considered had been supported by Barber J in Case Q52. Willy DJ considered that the passing of the shares from the shareholder back to the company clearly created a new legal and equitable interest in that property, i.e. there was passing of property, because the company on the one hand would be relieved of a liability to pay for the cost of the moneys acquired from the investing public, and the investor on the other hand had received back his money plus a capital profit. In his Honour’s view the emphasis in the authorities was on the mode by which the property passed, not what became of the property after it had passed. He considered this latter point to be irrelevant. In summary, case law shows that the elements required to be present in order for a disposition to exist are: • • • • • A “disposition” and/or “disposing of” property must involve total alienation of that property by the disposer. Whether anything further must be established in terms of the ordinary meaning in a particular situation will depend on the context in which the concept is used, including whether the relevant statutory provision expressly extends the meaning - extending the meaning tends to suggest that the ordinary meaning is narrower. Generally, a disposition will involve the disposing of property that is already in existence at the time of the disposal. A disposition usually needs to be intended by the disposer and be something that the disposer is actively involved in, as opposed to being something unilaterally done by a third party. This is the notion of the disposer doing the alienating, rather than being passive and the disposee or some other party making the alienation occur. The requirement that there be some degree of “dealing with” the property being disposed of by the disposer is closely linked to the requirement that the property being disposed of must stay in existence following the disposal from one party to another. However, this does not seem to be an absolute requirement given that the courts have held that disposition may arise even though the disposal results in the extinguishment of the property. 24 To recap on the elements of a TTQ: a TTQ was created by virtue of section 28BA of the Fisheries Act 1983. This declared rock lobster to be subject to the quota management system for a period of 25 years from 1 April 1990. The allocation of tonnages of rock lobster for TTQ was made primarily to those persons who already held licences to fish for rock lobster under the ITQ system using as a basis the proportion that the commercial catch of that person over the last 6 years bore in relation to the total commercial catch in that quota management area. The QMS under Part II of the Act specifies the total allowable catch for all species of fish. Section 28 CA states that the total allowable commercial catch for rock lobster is that which appears in the final column of the Second Schedule of the Maori Fisheries Act 1989. Section 28D provides that the Minister may vary the tonnages from time to time according to certain considerations. As from 1 October 1996, TTQ are no longer in existence. Sections 28 BA and 28EA of the Fisheries Act 1983 (which declared rock lobster subject to quota fishing and made provision for subsequent allocation) were repealed by section 314 of the Fisheries Amendment Act 1996 (No.88). In the same amendment, section 334 provided for the treatment of TTQ as a result of the change in legislation. It states that the conversion from TTQ to ITQ is not a new allocation. Applying the criteria emanating from the case law above as being required in order for there to be a disposition of a TTQ: • • • • The conversion of a TTQ is not a total alienation of the rights or interests in that property. All of the rights or interests that existed under a TTQ remain undisturbed after the conversion to an ITQ, except that there has been a variation to the term, i.e. the number of years that the fishing quota is valid for. The rights or interests that existed under a TTQ are still the same rights or interests under an ITQ (i.e. the ability to catch or harvest a certain amount of rock lobster in a certain area), except that the term has changed, i.e. the quota no longer has an ending date. This is supported by the words in section 334(2) Fisheries Act 1996: “The conversion of quota by subsection (1) of this section does not constitute an allocation of new quota for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law”. That a court is unlikely to extend the ordinary meaning of “disposition” unless clearly a number of requisite elements, in particular total alienation, could be satisfied. That the disposition (conversion) was not intended by the holder of such quota and the holder had no active involvement in its disposal. It is arguable that the holder, at the date of acquisition, was aware that a TTQ may have a limited life, but, in any event, it is not sustainable to argue that the purchaser of a TTQ would, ordinarily, have acquired that property with the purpose of resale. Ordinarily, a purchaser would have acquired a TTQ in order to catch rock lobster and, under the law prevailing at that time, this was the only means available. 25 • • • • • • That the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ by operation of law did not involve any activity or degree of “dealing with” the property on behalf of the holder of a TTQ. As noted earlier, the wording of section 334(2) of the Fisheries Act 1996 also supports the view that the conversion is not a disposal, as it explicitly states that this conversion “is not a new allocation”. This confirms that Parliament did not intend there to be an alienation on conversion. On this basis, the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ does not constitute a “disposal” for the purposes of this provision \[Fisheries Act 1983, subsection (2) - not a new allocation; subsection (4) - ITQ perpetual even though previously only for 25 years\]. The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is not a “disposal” because it is not an event whereby the rights which constitute or are part of an item of intangible property mean that it will no longer be able to be exercised, at any time, by the taxpayer who owned that property. It is not necessary to consider whether the conversion of a TTQ would be excluded from the definition of “disposal” by virtue of such disposition being part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. In summary: A TTQ is an asset of a capital nature, and therefore the costs of acquisition and any profit or loss on the sale of a TTQ are of a capital nature and therefore not deductible. The cost of a TTQ is not deductible under section 104, and as the cost is not able to be amortised in terms of section 104A, no unexpired portion of the expenditure can be claimed on conversion of to an ITQ. A TTQ is a right to use land, as the courts have stated that the right to use or take from the water includes the land below such waters and, in addition to this, it may also be necessary to use the land in order to exercise the fishing rights. A TTQ is “depreciable property” within the meaning of Act pursuant to it being a “right to use land” within the 22nd Schedule. A TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 can be depreciated from the date of acquisition up until 30 September 1996, in accordance with the formula in section 108G. The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is not a “disposal” within the definition provided for in the Act. Effect on whether the conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ is a “disposal” The effect of these conclusions is that the cost of a TTQ acquired after 1 April 1993 is able to be depreciated. However, this depreciation will cease as at 30 September 1996, being the date of the conversion to an ITQ. The conversion of a TTQ to an ITQ does not constitute a “disposal” in terms of section 117(10), and so any depreciation claimed in those prior years is not recoverable and there will be no gain or loss on conversion. No deduction of any kind is available for TTQ acquired prior to 1 April 1993, as TTQ were not included within “depreciable property”. 26 27 Conclusions The overall effect is that qualifying taxpayers are unable to deduct the cost of acquiring TTQ, and any gain or loss on conversion is not assessable. Those taxpayers are, however, able to claim depreciation for a maximum period of three and a half years, being 1 April 1993 to 30 September 1996. Any depreciation claimed is not recoverable by Inland Revenue at the date of conversion, as there is no disposal.
\[Interpretation statement IS2539 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in December 1998\] LEASE RENEWALS AND EXTENSIONS—SECTION 29, STAMP AND CHEQUE DUTIES ACT 1971 Summary This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the application of section 29 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. In particular, it focuses on the application of section 29 to instruments of extension and renewal of lease, as it is in this area that difficulties in interpreting the section have arisen. This interpretation statement replaces the relevant parts of the Commissioner’s statement published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994), at pages 2 and 3. Under section 29, if an instrument increases the rental payable under any lease, stamp duty will be computed on that instrument only to the extent of the increase. In order for an instrument to be dutiable under section 29, a particular lease must already exist at the time an instrument increasing or agreeing to increase the rental is executed, and the instrument must be executed “during the term of the lease”. Therefore, if an instrument is executed after the term of a lease has expired, section 29 will not apply and any such instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. If an instrument is executed to vary the term of a lease so that the lease is extended to cover a further period, effectively a new lease is created and the instrument will be dutiable under section 26. This will be the case whether or not there is a corresponding increase in rental. If the term of a lease is renewed, effectively a new lease is granted following the termination of the earlier lease. This means that when a lease is renewed and the rental payable under the lease is increased, section 29 will not apply and the instrument evidencing the renewal will be dutiable under section 26. If the term of a lease is varied by way of a memorandum of extension in Form L of the Second Schedule to the Land Transfer Act 1952, effectively a new lease is created and consequently the instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. If an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised unilaterally and the rental payable under the lease is increased, the instrument will be dutiable under section 29. Where on the other hand an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised bilaterally and the rental payable under the lease is increased, effectively the parties are varying the term of the lease and accordingly the instrument will be dutiable under section 26. Legislation 1 2 All legislative references in this item are to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 unless otherwise stated. Section 26 states: (1) Stamp duty payable on a lease shall be a lease duty computed - (a) At the rate of 40c for each $100, and for such amount as may be less than $100, of - (i) The maximum rent that is or may become payable under the lease in any year; or (ii) If the lease is for a term of less than 1 year, the maximum rent that is or may become payable for that term; and (b) At the rate of $1 for each $100 and for such amount as may be less than $100, of any premium, fine, or other consideration whatsoever other than rent, payable under the lease. (2) If any lease is granted without consideration, or for a consideration that in the opinion of the Commissioner is inadequate, lease duty shall be computed on the value of the lessee's interest under the lease, determined in accordance with Part III of this Act, at the rate of $1 for each $100, and for such amount as may be less than $100, of that value, to the extent that the lease is without consideration or the consideration for the lease is inadequate. Section 29 states: Notwithstanding anything in section 26 of this Act, lease duty shall be computed on every instrument whereby the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease is increased or agreed to be increased during the term of the lease as if the instrument were a new lease for a consideration equivalent to the increase in rent or other consideration, or the increase in the value of the lessee’s interest. Section 8 states: For the purposes of this Act, the term “lease” means any instrument whereby at law or in equity - (a) Any leasehold interest in land; or (b) Any easement over land - is created or agreed to be created; and includes any instrument by which the rent, consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest in any lease is increased or agreed to be increased. Section 3 states: For the purposes of this Act, the term “instrument” includes every writing, whether executed in New Zealand or elsewhere, affecting - (a) Any property situated in New Zealand; or (b) Any property situated or to be situated on the continental shelf beyond the territorial limits of New Zealand, but that pursuant to the Continental Shelf Act 1964 would or will be deemed to have taken place in New Zealand,- but does not include a will or other instrument operating only by way of a testamentary disposition, or a bill of exchange. Section 116 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 states: 3 (1) The term of any lease may from time to time be extended by a memorandum of extension in Form L in the Second Schedule to this Act signed by the lessor and lessee for the time being and registered before the expiry of the then current term of the lease. (2) Subject to the provisions of this section, the memorandum of extension shall have the same effect as if it were a memorandum of lease for the extended term subject to the same covenants, conditions, and restrictions, with the necessary modification, as are contained or implied in the lease. Upon the registration of the memorandum of extension the estate of the lessee thereunder shall be deemed to be subject to all encumbrances, liens, and interests to which the lease is subject at the time of registration of the memorandum of extension. For the purposes of this subsection all references in any Act or in any agreement, deed, instrument, notice, or other document whatsoever to the lease or to the estate of the lessee thereunder shall, unless inconsistent with the context or with the provisions of this section, be deemed to be references to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension or to the estate of the lessee thereunder, as the case may be. (3) The covenants, conditions, and restrictions contained or implied in the lease may be expressly varied, negatived, or added to by the memorandum of extension. ... (4) Notwithstanding that the term of the lease is not extended, the covenants, conditions, and restrictions contained or implied in any lease may be expressly varied, negatived, or added to by a memorandum of variation in the said Form L (with the necessary modifications) signed by the lessor and the lessee for the time being and registered before the expiry of the then current term of the lease. (5) The memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation may be registered in the same manner as the original lease: Provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 66 hereof, a memorial of a memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation of any lease in respect of which a certificate of title has been issued under that section shall be entered on all relevant instruments and on that certificate of title, which shall have full validity and effect during the extended term. (6) If the land affected by the memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation is at the time of the registration of the memorandum subject to any mortgage, the memorandum shall not be binding on the mortgagee unless he has consented thereto in writing on the memorandum. Application of the Legislation Section 26(1) imposes stamp duty on leases of commercial land and buildings. Stamp duty is payable at the rate of 40 cents per $100 (or part thereof) on the maximum rent that is payable or may become payable under the terms of the lease in any year. If the lease is for a term that is less than a year, stamp duty is payable on the maximum rent that is payable or may become payable over the term of the lease. Prima facie, every instrument that falls within the section 8 definition of lease is dutiable pursuant to section 26 at the specified rate. Under section 29, if an instrument increases the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease stamp duty will only be computed on that instrument to the extent that there is an increase in rent or other consideration or there is an increase in the value of the lessee’s interest. 4 Example 1 – rental increased at some point during the term of the lease C Ltd leases a commercial building from D Ltd for a ten-year period from 1 December 1998 at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Lease duty of $200 is paid. Under the lease, the rental is to be reviewed after five years by agreement, and if no agreement can be reached, by arbitration. By way of an instrument dated 24 December 2003, the rental is increased to $75,000 per annum. The lease provides that the rental payable is to be increased at a specified date in the future, and an instrument effecting this increase has been executed. In this situation section 29 will apply and stamp duty of $100 will be payable on the instrument. The use of the words “under any lease” in section 29 indicate that in order for an instrument to be dutiable under the section, a particular lease must already be in existence at the time an instrument increasing or agreeing to increase the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest is executed. This indicates that instruments will not be dutiable under section 29 if: • a lease is entered into for the first time; or • during the term of a lease a new lease is agreed upon and entered into (including occasions where by operation of law an instrument effects a new demise). In these situations it cannot be said that the instrument is entered into under “any lease” (meaning the specific lease in question), as a new lease is, in effect, created. Any such lease will be a fresh demise, dutiable under section 26. The wording of section 29 also indicates that in order for the provision to apply, the instrument increasing or agreeing to increase the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease must be executed “during the term of the lease”. Therefore, if an instrument is executed after the term of a lease has expired, section 29 will not apply and any such instrument will be dutiable under section 26. Example 2 - entering into a lease F Ltd enters into an agreement to lease a commercial building from S Ltd for a four- year period from 1 December 1998, at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Stamp duty of $200 is paid under section 26(1). A new lease has been entered into between the parties, there is no existing lease and therefore section 29 has no application. Example 3 - lease expires, new lease agreed H Ltd enters into an agreement to lease a commercial building from L Ltd for a four- year period from 1 December 1998 at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Lease duty of $200 is paid under section 26(1). 5 On 31 March 2003 the parties agree to enter into a new lease for a further four-year term, and further lease duty of $200 is paid under section 26(1). The existing lease entered into on 1 December 1998 expired on 1 December 2002. Therefore, section 29 does not apply – it applies only if an instrument is entered into under an existing lease. In this instance the lease has expired and the parties have entered into a new lease. Varying the terms of a lease The parties to a lease may wish to vary their existing rights under the lease so as to extend or renew its term, or alternatively to introduce an option to renew or extend the term of the lease at some time in the future. In Re Savile Settled Estates, Savile v Savile \[1931\] All ER 556, the plaintiff granted two leases, both for a period of 60 years. The plaintiff later sought to vary both leases by substituting a term of 100 years from the date when the leases took effect. Maugham J stated at page 557: I think there is no doubt that the law, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2 nd Ed., vol. 20, p.271, para. 303, is that any arrangement between the landlord and tenant which operates as a fresh demise will work as a surrender of the old tenancy... ... I should add that, in my opinion, an alteration of an existing lease, so that it will operate for a term extending beyond the original term, can only operate in law as a surrender of the old lease and a grant of a new one... In Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657, by a lease under seal in 1947, the lessor demised premises to the lessee for a term of seven years from 1 November 1946, at a yearly rent of £150. A supplemental deed made between the lessor and the lessee in March 1949, and endorsed on the lease provided that: “if the tenant shall give notice...to the landlord before Nov 1, 1952, of such his desire the within written lease thereupon shall read, construed and take effect as though the term thereby granted was for a period of eleven years from Nov 1, 1946...”. In 1951 the lessee assigned the lease and option to the first assignee, who in turn assigned it in the same year. In 1952 the second assignee exercised the option to extend the term of the lease, and subsequently in that year assigned it to the last assignee, who in 1957 gave up possession owing rent and being in default on the repairing covenant. The lessor brought an action against the original lessee claiming rent and damages for breach of covenant. Sellers LJ at pages 669-670 said: \[T\]he supplemental deed of March, 1949, had the effect in law of supplanting the original lease by a new one, the terms of which were derived from reading the two documents together. The effect is to include the option as if it had been in the original lease. There was therefore, whilst the lessor and lessee were in direct contractual relationship, a contractual right by unilateral action of the lessee to enlarge the term from seven to eleven years and to vary by the same action the provisions as to painting of the outside of the premises. ... what was done in 1949 was not a mere agreement for the future; it was the granting and obtaining by mutual agreement of a right which the lessee could at his option exercise and which at once became an enforceable part of the contract. The agreement itself did not enlarge the original term, but it provided that it might be extended without any further consent of the lessor and was therefore a substantial alteration of a character to which the rule applies. 6 Whilst the agreement for the option was consensual and in law effected a new lease, the exercise of the option...was unilateral...Here the notice had the effect of enlarging the demise, of its own force. It was in fulfilment of and in accordance with the agreement and not inconsistent with it or a variation of it. No new bargain was struck in 1952. That which had been agreed as permissible became effective. Pearce LJ at pages 671-672 said: I think it would be wrong to hold that the demise was unaffected by the option until its exercise in 1952. ... It is not easy on the authorities to avoid the implication of a surrender and fresh grant where such a change is made in the term, viz., a variation of a term of seven years with an option for a further four years. In O F Gamble Pty Ltd v Whitemore Pty Ltd (1990) 2 WAR 327, Commissioner Anderson QC made the following relevant comments at pages 332-334: Any variation having the effect of extending the term of a lease is, as I have observed, held to work a surrender and fresh grant. In Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657, it was held that the insertion into a lease by supplemental deed of an option to extend the demise from seven years to eleven years had the same effect. It had the effect of supplanting the existing lease by a new one. It was not necessary for the option actually to be exercised. The mere insertion, by variation, of an option to extend, sufficiently changed the estate to bring the doctrine of surrender and fresh grant into operation. Counsel for the defendant pointed out the distinction between the facts of Baker v Merckel and the facts of the instant case. In the instant case, the option does not provide for the enlargement of the existing term; but, instead provides that the lessee can “require the lessor...to grant to the lessee a new lease of the property for a further term of eight years...on the same terms and conditions...”. The point of distinction is that in Baker v Merckel the option was to extend the existing demise, whereas in the instant case the option is for the grant of a new lease. This seems to be a very fine distinction. ... In my opinion, a demise with a covenant of renewal is an estate or interest in the land that is different from a demise containing no covenant of renewal, and this is so regardless of whether the covenant of renewal is in a form which provides for the enlargement of the existing term, or is in a form which provides for the grant of a new lease. I would therefore hold that the introduction into a lease by deed of variation of an option of renewal works a surrender of the old lease by operation of law and a grant of a new lease. ... It is true that, when an option of renewal is exercised, the position is that there is a new lease, a new demise. Plainly, that new lease or new demise does not come into existence until the option is exercised; but that is not to say that if the option of renewal is introduced by variation, the variation is not also effective to create a new lease. In Jenkin R Lewis & Son Ltd v Kerman \[1971\] Ch 477, the question to be decided was whether a document between the lessee and the landlord in 1961 increasing the rent, and/or a similar deed between the two parties in 1968 had the effect of creating a new contract of tenancy between those persons, and consequently a surrender and cesser of the 1941 contract of tenancy. The Court found that a mere agreement between landlord and tenant for an increase in rent did not necessarily result in a surrender of the existing tenancy and the creation of a new one. Delivering the judgment of the court, Russell LJ stated at page 496: It is not possible simply to convert the existing estate in land into a different estate by adding more years to it, and even if the parties use words which indicate that this is what they wished to achieve the law will achieve the result at which they are aiming in the only way in which it can, namely by 7 implying a fresh lease for the longer period and a surrender of the old lease: see In re Savile Settled Estates \[1931\] 2 Ch 210; Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657. On the basis of the above discussion it is evident that: • Any arrangement between the lessee and lessor which operates as a fresh demise will work as a surrender of the old tenancy. • Some terms of a lease can only be varied by an instrument which operates as a surrender and regrant, e.g. the lengthening of the term of a lease. On this basis it is evident that if an instrument is executed varying the term of a lease so that the lease is extended to cover a further term, the lease will be dutiable under section 26. This will be the case whether or not there is a corresponding increase in the rental or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest in the lease. Example 4 – parties agree to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term K Ltd leases a commercial building from B Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of three years at a rental of $100,000 per year. Lease duty of $400 is payable. On 30 October 1996 the parties enter into negotiations and decide to vary the lease and extend its term for another 3 years, increasing the rent payable to $150,000. The variation of a lease so that its term is lengthened operates as a surrender and regrant by operation of law. On this basis lease duty is assessable pursuant to section 26, and stamp duty of $600 is payable on the new lease. Renewals and extensions of lease generally Many leases include a provision granting the lessee a right to extend the term of a lease or to renew the lease for a further term or terms at the end of the current term. This right may be presented as a covenant on the part of the lessor to grant a further term or terms, or as an option to renew or extend the lease in favour of the lessee. Alternatively, the parties to a lease may wish to renew or extend a lease by varying their existing rights under a lease during the term of the lease or after the lease has expired. A distinction between an “extension” of a lease and a “renewal” of a lease is generally accepted, albeit that it is sometimes difficult to determine. In Brooke v Clarke, 1B & Ald. 399, the Court considered the term “extension” at page 399: “Extension”, is a term properly used for the purposes of enlarging, or giving further duration to, any existing right, but does not import the re-vesting of an expired right; that would not be an ‘extension’ but a ‘re-creation”. In Muller v Trafford \[1901\] 1 Ch. 62, the Court found that a covenant by an under- lessee with his sub-lessee to grant an “extension” of the latter’s term on the under- lessee obtaining a further term from the freeholder, “is not a covenant to renew”. 8 In Regor Estates v Wright \[1951\] 1 KB 689, the Court found that a “renewal of a tenancy” meant an agreement for a fresh tenancy following on the termination of the earlier one. In Green v Wilson & Horton (1983) 2 NZCPR 94, Savage J at page 102 said: I think it is clear that a renewal of a lease for more than three years, which in effect is the grant of a new lease, is required to be in writing and thus comes within s 2(1)(b) Contracts Enforcement Act 1956. And later at page 103: A further difficulty that would lie in the way of the plaintiff is that for a lessee to take advantage of a right of renewal, which is in effect an option to a new lease... Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. reissue (1994) vol 27(1), para 467) states: Where a lease contains an option to renew the lease the exercise of the option will ordinarily involve the creation of a new lease, and as regards the new lease there will be no privity of contract between the landlord and the original lessee under the old lease which contained the option to renew: however, the right given to a tenant may be simply to extend the term, in which case privity of the contract will endure between the parties, even during the extended term. Halsbury’s indicates that where a lease contains a renewal option, the exercise of the option will not ordinarily constitute the extension of the original lease’s term. In Brooker’s Land Law Volume 2, Ch 11, Leases, at 11-125: A preliminary question, which may be of importance, is the construction of the lease provision to determine whether the lessee has been granted an option to renew the lease, meaning to be granted a new lease on the same or substantially the same terms as the expiring term, or alternatively, an option to extend the present lease term for a further period. Woodfall, Landlord and Tenant, Release 38 at page 18/3 states that: Sometimes a lease contains an option to extend the term rather than an option to renew it. The grant of a lease pursuant to an option to renew creates a new interest, whereas the extension of the term keeps the old term in being, with the consequence that the original tenant is bound by the extension, even where the option is exercised by an assignee. Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657. The following points can be taken from the above discussion: • The “renewal” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies the granting of a new lease following on from the termination of an earlier lease. • The “extension” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies a continuation of the old lease for a further period, but does not import the re-vesting of an expired right. If it is unclear as to the nature of a further term contemplated, it will be necessary to look at “the true construction of the respective rights and obligations as expressed in the relevant documentation - Per Henry J in Sina Holdings Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation \[1996\] 1 NZLR 1 at page 5. 9 Renewals of lease – application to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 The “renewal” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies the granting of a new lease following on the termination of an earlier lease. On this basis, if a lease is renewed as well as the rental being increased, section 29 will not apply and the instrument evidencing the renewal will be dutiable under section 26. Example 5 – option to renew a lease M Ltd leases a commercial building from G Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of ten years at a rental of $50,000 per year. The lease contains an option to renew the lease for a period of 5 years. Lease duty of $200 is payable. In June 2003, M Ltd exercises its right to renew the lease for a further five years and the rental is increased to $70,000 per year. In this situation stamp duty of $280 is payable under section 26(1). The renewal of a lease constitutes the surrender of the lease followed by the regrant of a new lease. Therefore, section 29 will not apply. Extensions of lease – application to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 The word “extension”, when used in its proper and usual sense in connection with a lease, means a prolongation of the previous leasehold estate. This could be seen as supporting the view that when an option to extend a lease is exercised it is merely a continuation of the existing lease, and therefore stamp duty on the instrument evidencing the extension is assessable under section 29. However, there are a number of ways the terms of a lease could potentially be extended which could influence the application of section 29, dependent on whether the lease is registered or unregistered. Registered leases If a lease is registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 (LTA), the parties may agree to extend the term of the lease by way of memorandum of extension under section 116 of that Act. Under section 116 of the LTA, the term of a registered lease may be extended by the registration of a memorandum of extension in Form L in the Second Schedule to the Act. The use of Form L is mandatory, and the memorandum of extension must be signed by the lessee and lessor. The memorandum of extension must be filed before the expiry of the current term of the lease. Section 116(2) of the LTA stipulates that upon registration of the memorandum of extension the memorandum shall have the same effect as if it were a memorandum of lease for the extended term subject to the same terms and conditions contained or implied in the lease. Under this section, all references in any Act or in any agreement, 10 deed, instrument, notice, or other document are deemed to refer to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension . The wording of section 116 of the LTA is clear that a memorandum of extension must stand on its own terms and conditions rather than on those of the previous lease. The memorandum of extension is treated as having the same effect as a memorandum of lease, and references to the lease are deemed to refer to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension. As discussed previously, some terms of a lease can be varied only by an instrument which operates as a surrender and regrant, e.g. when the term of a lease is lengthened. Under section 116 of the LTA, the length of term of the premises demised is clearly being altered: the parties are entering into a bilateral arrangement whereby the terms of their lease are materially varied. On this basis, if the term of a lease is varied by way of a memorandum of extension in Form L of the Second Schedule to the LTA, the effect is that a new lease is created and accordingly the instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act. Section 29 will not apply, as the extension (by way of variation) constitutes a new lease and section 29 applies only to instruments increasing the rental payable under an existing lease. This view is supported by comments made in Law of Stamp Duty in New Zealand, 3 rd ed., where Adams states at page 186 that: Stamp duty on extension of leases – An extension of a lease – e.g., one executed in the form prescribed by s.116 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 – is liable to the same duty as a lease, for it is in fact a fresh demise... Example 6 – parties agree to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term A Ltd leases a commercial building from B Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of three years at a rental of $100,000 per year. A condition of the lease provides that the parties may agree to extend the term of the lease for a further 3 years at some time in the future. Lease duty of $400 is payable. On 30 October 1996 the parties enter into negotiations and decide to extend the term of the lease for another 3 years and increase the rent payable to $150,000 under section 116 of the LTA. Lease duty of $600 is payable on the new lease. The extension of the term of a lease under section 116 of the LTA operates as a surrender and regrant by operation of law. On this basis lease duty is assessable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Unregistered leases If a lease is not registered for the purposes of the LTA, the lease may be extended or varied by deed executed by both landlord and tenant. Extensions of equitable leases may be effected by deed or written agreement. The parties may agree before the end of the term to the extension, or alternatively the lease may not contain an option to 11 extend the term of the lease and the parties may agree before the end of the term to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term. The application of section 29 to the situation where an instrument merely realising a right that is already available under an existing lease is executed is not clear. It is apparent, for example, that there will be situations when a lessee may have an option, to be exercised bilaterally or unilaterally, to extend the term of a lease. If such an option is taken up, is a new leasehold interest created or is the term of the old lease merely increased? This is relevant in so far as section 29 relates to instruments whereby the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease is increased or agreed to be increased during the term of the lease. In Baker v Merckel an option to extend the term of a lease was exercised unilaterally. The Court in that case found that the original variation of the lease was consensual and in law effected a new lease. The new lease which was to be gathered from reading the original lease and the supplemental deed, required nothing more than the option to be exercised by way of a unilateral act, and therefore the exercise of the option was merely an extension of the current lease rather than the creation of a new lease: that creation took place when the earlier lease was created. The Court drew a distinction between a consensual act varying the terms of a lease and a unilateral act arising out of and in accordance with the terms of a lease. Sellers LJ at page 670: Whilst the agreement for the option was consensual and in law effected a new lease, the exercise of the option...was unilateral...Here the notice had the effect of enlarging the demise, of its own force. It was in fulfilment of and in accordance with the agreement and not inconsistent with it or a variation of it. No new bargain was struck in 1952. That which had been agreed as permissible became effective. Baker v Merckel supports the view that a distinction can be drawn between a consensual act varying the terms of a lease which amounts to the surrender and regrant of a lease, and a unilateral act arising out of and in accordance with the terms of a lease which has the effect of extending the existing lease’s term. On this basis, if an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised unilaterally, section 29 is of potential application in assessing duty on any increase in rental. Until an option is exercised, it can only be said to offer a future possibility that the lease will be extended. If the parties to a lease decide to exercise the option, they are in effect agreeing to a consensual variation of the terms of the lease and accordingly a fresh demise is created. This situation is to be distinguished from that where a lease contains an option to extend the term of the lease by virtue of a party’s unilateral act without any element of bargain. As a result of the unilateral act there is an enlarging of the existing demise. Example 7 – option to extend the term of lease By deed dated 1 December 1993, K Ltd leases a commercial building from J Ltd for a term of two years at a rental of $100,000 per year. Lease duty of $400 is payable. Under a condition of the lease, the lessee may extend the term of the lease for a further year, before its expiry, by notifying the lessor of that intention. In that event the rent for that year will be increased to $150,000. 12 Before the expiry of the lease, the lessee exercises the option to extend the lease for a further year. The exercise of an option to extend the term of a lease implies the continuation of the existing lease, and accordingly duty is assessable under section 29. Duty of $200 is payable.
\[Interpretation statement IS2966 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in August 1999\] EXCLUSION FROM THE TERM “DIVIDENDS”—WHETHER DISTRIBUTION MADE IN LIEU OF DIVIDENDS’ PAYMENT Summary This interpretation statement considers the application of section CF 3(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to the factors to be taken into account in determining whether an acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares is made in lieu of the payment of dividends. Section CF 2 provides a wide definition of the term “dividends”. Prima facie, all distributions from a company to its shareholders are dividends. Under section CF 2(1)(g), a dividend includes any amount distributed in respect of the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares in a company or other reduction or return of share capital of a company. However, section CF 3 provides certain exclusions from the definition, including distributions made on the repurchase, redemption, or cancellation of shares in certain situations. Broadly speaking, the legislation provides a rebuttable presumption that a capital reduction of 15% or more is a return of capital, rather than a dividend, but the Commissioner can rebut this presumption if it appears that the company is returning capital in substitution for a dividend. Alternatively, upon application, the Commissioner can notify a company that a 10% or more reduction is not in substitution of a dividend on similar grounds. Included in the tests of whether an amount distributed to shareholders in the above circumstances is excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b) is whether the payment is “made in lieu of the payment of dividends”. If it is established that the payment is made in lieu of dividends, the exclusion does not apply and the amount will remain a dividend under section CF 2. The Commissioner takes into account a number of factors, set out in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii), in determining whether the “in lieu of dividend” test is met. This item provides some guidance as to how the Commissioner applies his discretion in determining whether these factors apply to a given situation. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Issues Section CF 3(1)(b)(iii) lists the factors to which the Commissioner must have regard in satisfying himself that a repurchase, redemption, or cancellation of shares is not made in lieu of the payment of dividends. These are: • The nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and • The issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and 1 2 • The expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation; and • Any other relevant factor. The issue is the nature of the factors and circumstances the Commissioner takes into account in exercising his discretion in situations involving the cancellation of shares. Background Law reform introduced by the Companies Act 1993 now makes it easier for a company to repurchase or redeem its own shares. The Act provides that the company must have the express power to do so under its constitution. In essence, the share repurchase provisions are a means of returning capital back to shareholders, which previously required an application to the High Court. Section 52 of that Act provides that the company must satisfy a solvency test before making any distribution to shareholders. The term “solvency test” is defined in section 4 of the Act, and its effect is to ensure that the company does not distribute amounts greater than its net assets and has sufficient funds available to meet its normal business outgoings. The company law reform has meant that income tax rules also had to be formulated to cover both share repurchases and share redemptions. A series of tests known as the “brightline” tests were introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994 which, prima facie, allow such repurchases or redemptions on a tax-free basis if specific criteria have been met. In summary, these tests treat the repurchases of small parcels of shares (generally where the repurchase is less than 10% of the market value of all shares) as dividends, and larger parcels as tax-free. This is necessary to prevent companies distributing their earnings to their shareholders by way of tax-free repurchases and not dividends. It is recognised that substantial repurchases should be treated for tax purposes as a partial liquidation of the company. Where the cancellation is part of a pro rata offer to all shareholders, the capital reduction must be either at least 10% or at least 15% of all shares in the company. For a reduction that falls between the 10% and 15% thresholds, the company must make application to the Commissioner. The ‘brightline’ test, which applies to shares that are not non-participating redeemable shares, was set at 15% - considered to be approximately three times the typical dividend yield - to provide reasonable scope for a company genuinely reducing the size of its operation to fund a one-off distribution to its shareholders from tax-free reserves. When taxpayer behaviour defeats the purpose of the new rules, the Commissioner has a residual discretion to treat a distribution on the repurchase of shares as being in lieu of the payment of dividends. Evidence of this would be if the repurchase were made under an arrangement to acquire, redeem, or otherwise cancel shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend. Factors that the Commissioner takes into account in deciding the matter are contained in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii) and include the nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior to, and subsequent to, the particular cancellation, and whether there is any subsequent issue of shares after the cancellation. In addition, the Commissioner has the discretion to take into account 3 any other relevant factors (section CF 3(1)(b)(iii)(D)). The “in lieu of dividend” test applies regardless of whether the shares are non-participating shares and regardless of whether the brightline tests are satisfied. Legislation Section CF 3(1)(b) provides an exclusion from the term “dividends” of any amount distributed on the acquisition, redemption, or cancellation of shares in a company under certain circumstances. It states: In this Act, and subject to the provisions of this section, the term "dividends", in relation to any company, does not include - (b) Any amount distributed upon the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation (in whole but not in part) by the company of any share in the company (referred to in this paragraph as the "relevant cancellation") where - (i) If the share is not a non-participating redeemable share, - (A) The relevant cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation where the company has a fifteen percent capital reduction; or (B) The relevant cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation where the company has a ten percent capital reduction and, upon application to the Commissioner by the company in such form as the Commissioner may specify, the Commissioner notifies the company in writing that the Commissioner has no reasonable grounds to conclude (having regard to the factors specified in subparagraph (iii)(A) to (D) that either the whole or any part of the relevant cancellation is made in lieu of the payment of dividends; or (C) The relevant cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation but the shareholder suffers a fifteen percent interest reduction; or (D) The company is an unlisted trust and the share was issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to subparagraph (iv)(A); or (E) The relevant cancellation is not part of a pro-rata cancellation and the company is an unlisted trust and the share was issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to subparagraph (iv)(B); and (ii) The relevant cancellation is not an on-market acquisition; and (iii) The Commissioner has given, in respect of the relevant cancellation, the notice referred to in subparagraph (i)(B) or otherwise is satisfied that neither the whole nor any part of the relevant cancellation was made in lieu of the payment of dividends, having regard to - (A) The nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and (B) The issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation; and (C) The expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation; and (D) Any other relevant factor; and (iv) To the extent that the amount distributed does not exceed - (A) In any case where the company is an unlisted trust and the share is issued on such terms that its redemption is subject to this subsubparagraph, the available subscribed capital per share; and (B) In any other case, the available subscribed capital per share cancelled: The definitions of “fifteen percent capital reduction” and “ten percent capital reduction” are contained in section CF 3(14): "Fifteen percent capital reduction" means, in respect of any company and any pro rata cancellation (referred to in this definition as the "relevant cancellation"), the circumstance where the aggregate amount paid by the company on account of the relevant cancellation (or paid by the company at the 4 same time on account of any other pro rata cancellation of shares other than non-participating redeemable shares) is equal to or greater than 15% of the market value of all shares (not being non- participating redeemable shares) in the company at the time the company first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation (or, in any case where no advance notice was given, the time of the relevant cancellation): "Ten percent capital reduction" means, in respect of any company and any pro rata cancellation (referred to in this definition as the "relevant cancellation"), the circumstance where the aggregate amount paid by the company on account of the relevant cancellation (or paid by the company at the same time on account of any other pro rata cancellation of shares other than non-participating redeemable shares) is equal to or greater than 10% of the market value of all shares (not being non- participating redeemable shares) in the company at the time the company first notified shareholders of the proposed relevant cancellation (or, in any case where no advance notice was given, the time of the relevant cancellation): Section FC 1(1) states: Where in any debenture issued by a company the rate of interest payable in respect of the debenture is not specifically determined, but is determinable from time to time - (a) By reference to the dividend payable by the company; or (b) By reference to the company's profits, however measured, for debentures issued after 8 pm New Zealand Standard Time on 23 October 1986 other than those issued under a binding contract entered into before that time; or (c) In any other manner, for debentures issued before the time specified in paragraph (b),- no deduction shall be made, in calculating the assessable income of the company, in respect of any interest payable under the debenture or of any expenditure or loss incurred in connection with the debenture or in borrowing the money secured by or owing under it. Section FC 2(1) deals with interest on debentures issued in substitution for shares: Where a company has issued debentures to its shareholders or to any class of its shareholders, and the amount of the debenture or debentures issued to each shareholder of the company or of that class has been determined by reference to the number or to the available subscribed capital per share of, or by reference or otherwise to, the shares in that company or in any other company (whether or not that other company is being or has been liquidated) that were held by or on behalf of the shareholder at the time the debentures were issued or at any earlier time, no deduction shall be allowed to the company, in respect of any interest payable under any debenture so issued or of any expenditure or loss incurred in connection with any such debenture or in borrowing the money secured by or owing under any such debenture. Section FC 2(2) provides a link to FC 1: Section FC 1 shall apply with respect to all debentures to which subsection (1) applies and to the interest payable under those debentures, in the same manner as if those debentures and that interest were debentures and interest of the kinds referred to in section FC 1. The definition of “share” or “shares” is contained in section OB 1 and includes: (a) Except in section DF 7, includes- (i) ... (ii) Any debenture to which section FC 1 or FC 2 applies: Application of the Legislation The Valabh Committee in its final report The Taxation of Distributions from Companies (July 1991) at page 31 discussed the need to distinguish between 5 transactions that used the share cancellation process as a substitute for paying shareholders a dividend, and genuine commercially motivated transactions: A difficulty in defining and applying an anti-avoidance provision aimed at reductions in capital (or share repurchases) made in substitution for assessable dividends is in drawing a line between genuine commercially motivated transactions and those intended to avoid tax. The extremes between these alternatives are known. For example, where a company normally pays two dividends a year and one of those dividends in terms of approximate date and quantum is not paid but a partial reduction is made, it is clear that the capital reduction is in substitution of a dividend. At the other extreme, if the company sold a substantial part of its business and paid a substantial amount in addition to the normal dividend, it would not be a dividend substitution. Under section CF 3(1)(b)(iii),the Commissioner has a residual discretion to deem the share cancellation to be a dividend if it appears that the company is returning capital in substitution for dividends. In exercising this discretion, the Commissioner must consider the factors outlined in that provision. A discussion of these factors follows. Nature and amount of dividends paid by the company prior or subsequent to the relevant cancellation Prima facie, the nature and amount of dividends paid prior to and after a share repurchase (or redemption) may indicate that amounts paid on repurchase are in lieu of a dividend. This may be the case if it appears that the company has not paid dividends, which would ordinarily be payable, prior to or after the acquisition, but has instead built-up its retained earnings and paid these out on a share acquisition. A low or no dividend policy, or an unexplained change in policy to reduce dividends, together with an increase in retained earnings, may indicate that the company is, or has been, taking such an approach. In instances where the Commissioner is asked to give a ruling on a proposed transaction, reliance would be given to knowledge gained before the cancellation in respect of dividends to be paid after the cancellation. That knowledge might include dividends declared but not paid, and knowledge of the directors’ intentions and expectations (including knowledge of the company’s dividend policy). The legislation refers to “dividends paid”. It does not refer to expectations, purpose, intentions, or policy. The test is not based on the company’s dividend policy but is stated explicitly in terms of its practice or history in paying dividends. However, the company’s dividend policy may help the Commissioner to determine the practice in issuing dividends. If there is no apparent pattern in the issue of dividends, but the company can show that it has adhered to an explicit policy that refers to objective criteria, the Commissioner may be able to draw conclusions that would not otherwise be available. Overall, this factor focuses on the company’s dividend policy or practice both before and after the share cancellation. Its purpose is to detect any changes or variations in the company’s dividend policy that indicate that the share cancellation is replacing a dividend the company would normally pay. Such inferences could be drawn from a combination of an increase in retained earnings and either a low dividend policy, or an unexplained change in policy or practice to reduce dividends. 6 Issue of shares in the company subsequent to the relevant cancellation A company may acquire sufficient shares to meet the brightline levels for capital reduction, i.e. the 10% or 15% of market value of shares, (and, by doing so, effect a tax free distribution) and subsequently may reissue shares so that the effective capital reduction is less than the brightlines. If the subsequent reissue is to replace cash which is necessary to meet the company’s current operational or capital expenditure, this suggests that the company did not really intend, and was not really in a position, to reduce its capital, and that the funds paid out on repurchase were in lieu of dividends. If, after a share redemption takes place, a reissue of shares is made to only some of the shareholders, there will be an uneven effect on the shareholders, being those that previously held shares but no longer do so, and those that now have more shares. This will not affect the potential application of section CF 3(1)(b) however, as that paragraph does not distinguish between situations according to which shareholders receive reissued shares. An example of a cancellation of shares and a subsequent reissue is where shortly after a share repurchase of 15% a company reissues 10% of its shares. The result of this reissue is that the initial capital reduction of 15%, minus the amount of newly issued shares (10%), results in total capital reduction of 5% which falls below the minimum brightline test of 10%. Such a transaction would indicate that the company has in reality effected a distribution that is more indicative of a dividend as opposed to a bona fide reduction in capital. The length of time between the cancellation and the issue of shares is relevant: the shorter this period is, the more likely the cancellation is made in lieu of the payment of dividends. If the Commissioner is asked to give a binding ruling on a proposed share repurchase transaction, he is placed in the difficult situation of having to consider the issue of shares by the company after the cancellation. The Commissioner then has to rely on knowledge available before the cancellation in respect of share issues planned for after the cancellation. That knowledge might include share issue offers made or received, and any information supplied by the directors and the shareholders regarding their intentions or expectations related to share issues. The Commissioner might also wish to make an assumption in the ruling about future share issues. Expressed purpose or purposes of the relevant cancellation This factor focuses on why the company is seeking to cancel shares. When the company can show a genuine commercial reason for cancelling the shares, this will indicate the cancellation is unlikely to be a dividend. The provision does not require the Commissioner to accept statements by or on behalf of the company that do not reflect the genuine intention of the company. The more intuitive and compelling the reason for the cancellation of the shares, the stronger this factor will be in reaching the overall decision. The existence of a genuine commercial motive for the transaction should assist in indicating that the distribution is not in lieu of dividends. For example the expressed purpose of a repurchase and cancellation may be a necessary step in the reorganisation of the ownership and corporate structure of a 7 group. It could be directed towards placing the overall strategic control of the group in the hands of its principals and certain senior employees, rather than outside shareholders. These are bona fide commercial reasons for a share cancellation. Another purpose of a cancellation may be that the company has surplus capital, notwithstanding a high dividend policy, and wishes to alter its debt:equity ratio to more closely align it with other companies in the same industry (in market value terms) and to increase its earnings per share. In such a case the company will borrow the cash to fund the share buyback, thereby helping it achieve its desired debt:equity ratio. This purpose provides sound commercial reasons for the cancellation and would support a view that the repurchase is not in lieu of a dividend. Other valid commercial reasons for reducing capital would include: • Reducing funding costs by replacing its equity funding with cheaper debt funding, and by reducing the administration costs associated with a large and diverse shareholding. • Reducing its cash balance to improve balance sheet performance and reduce its vulnerability to take-over. These reasons would of course need to be supported by evidence as to the company’s requirements, costs of funding, industry norms, market rates, and so on. Any other relevant factor The Valabh Committee Final Report “The Taxation of Distributions from Companies” (July 1991) and the discussion document “Tax Implications of Company Law Reform” (December 1993) indicated that the following factors may be relevant as to whether a return of capital is in lieu of dividends: • Is the capital reduction part of the down-sizing of the company? If so, this would be an indication the cancellation is not in lieu of dividends. • Has the company been retaining earnings and then distributing them without any accompanying reduction of the business? A distribution arising from a cancellation of shares in this case would more than likely be in lieu of dividends. • Has there been a sale of part of the business, accompanied by the return of a sizeable amount to the shareholders in addition to a dividend? If so, this would point to the cancellation not being in lieu of a dividend. • Is the capital return an unusual one-off event? If it is, this too would suggest that the cancellation is not a disguised dividend. Conversely, if there have been previous capital reductions, this may lead to the conclusion that the reductions are in lieu of dividends. • Will the cancellation leave the shareholders’ interests largely unchanged, or will the shareholders’ interests decline significantly with the capital reduction, i.e. the size of shareholder capital across the board will be significantly less? A 8 substantial change would be grounds for presuming that the cancellation has a purpose other than, or in addition to, a distribution of funds. A minimal change could indicate that the payment resulting from the cancellation was in lieu of a dividend. An example of one of these factors applying is where a company (likely to be a closely-held company) accumulates earnings until they represent 15 percent or more of the market value of the company. The company then makes a distribution, ostensibly as a result of a down-sizing operation, but without reducing any of its core business. Such a distribution would be in lieu of dividends. Similarly, successive disproportionate reductions that leave the respective interests of shareholders largely unchanged, would also potentially be in lieu of dividends. Another example is that of a company purchasing all of a shareholder’s shares thus resulting in the exit of that shareholder from the company. This could be the company’s first share repurchase, and, to that extent, would be an “unusual event”. This suggests that the payment is not made in lieu of any dividend, but rather to facilitate a shareholder’s exit. FC 1 and FC 2 debentures An issue arises as to whether the redemption of debentures that fall within the provisions of sections FC 1 and FC 2 should be subjected to the in lieu of dividend criteria in section CF 3(1)(b)(iii). Under section FC 1, if a debenture is issued where the rate of interest is not specified but is ordinarily based either on the dividend payable by the company or the profits of the company, no deduction is allowed for the interest. Under section FC 2(1), if a company issues debentures to its shareholders based on the number of shares the shareholders have in the company, again no deduction is allowed for the interest payable in respect of those debentures. These debentures (as do section FC 1 debentures) fall within the definition of “shares” under section OB 1. The debentures are, in effect, issued in substitution for shares. Where a company cancels or redeems these debentures either in whole or in part, the Act treats this as if it was cancelling or redeeming ordinary shares. The redemption or cancellation of these debentures is therefore subject to the provisions of section CF 3(1)(b). Whether or not the repayments in respect of these debentures are in lieu of dividends will be determined on the basis of all four factors noted in this paragraph. The terms and conditions of repayment are matters the Commissioner will take into account to the extent that they are relevant to the factors in CF 3(1)(b) in determining whether the redemption or cancellation is in lieu of dividends. Examples Example 1 As at 31 March 1997 Company A had share capital of $100,000, being 100,000 shares of $1, and accumulated profits of $20,000. Its shareholders planned to extract the $20,000 accumulated profits as dividends. However, because of a previous change of shareholding, Company A did not have sufficient imputation credits available to pay 9 fully imputed dividends. Accordingly, the shareholders returned $20,000 share capital tax free, by redeeming 20,000 shares. Is the subsequent amount paid to shareholders excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b)? The amount is not excluded. Under section CF 3(1)(b)(iii), the exemption will apply if the Commissioner “is satisfied that neither the whole nor any part of the relevant cancellation was made in lieu of the payment of dividends ...”. This provision is aimed at returns of capital which, in normal commercial terms, would have been paid as dividends. In the example the redemption of shares is made in lieu of dividends and the exemption does not therefore apply. Example 2 On 31 March 1997 Company B makes a capital distribution of $5M by cancelling 5,000,000 shares paid up to $1 each. Its total share capital is $30M. The company advises that its policy in respect of dividends is to pay 80% of profit after providing for interest, taxation, and the funding of asset replacement to maintain operating assets at an appropriate level. No definition of “appropriate” is given. This policy is not expected to alter. For the last two years, 1995 and 1996, it has paid dividends amounting to $1.5M and $3.5M respectively, representing 15% and 35% percent of profits in those two years. The company has not issued further shares since the cancellation. It advises that the purpose of the cancellation was to increase its debt:equity ratio to 30% debt and 70% equity. It has not down-sized its business. The retained earnings of the company amount to $10M. The question is whether the amount paid to shareholders will be excluded from the term “dividends” under section CF 3(1)(b). The first test as to the nature and amount of dividends the company issues is an objective one which looks to its practice in paying dividends. In the absence of a pattern in issuing dividends, the company would need to show that it has adhered to an explicit policy that refers to objective criteria. In the example there is no apparent pattern of dividend distribution. Under examination, the company’s dividend policy is apparently based on subjective criteria. It is not possible to draw any inference from the amount of past or future dividends paid where the amount of payment is determined after providing for inter alia “funding of asset replacement required to maintain the assets at an appropriate level”. Therefore, consideration of the nature and amount of dividends prior to and subsequent to the cancellation does not give any indication as to whether the cancellation will be made in lieu of dividends. The company has not issued further shares subsequent to the cancellation – a factor that assists the company’s case that the distribution to shareholders resulting from the cancellation is not in lieu of dividends. The company advises that the purpose of the cancellation was to increase its debt:equity ratio. However, other factors such as maintenance of its current level of business operations, and its retained earnings being in excess of the proposed amount to be distributed to shareholders, lead towards the conclusion that the cancellation is in lieu of dividends. 10 In this example, on the evidence produced it would be difficult to satisfy the Commissioner that the distribution resulting from the cancellation of shares is not in lieu of dividends. Example 3 Company C, a wool exporting company, has restructured its ownership to reflect a move away from having a mix of supplier and non-supplier shareholders. One of the company shareholders, Company D, a company that does not supply a product to Company C, purchased all the shares that the other non-supplier shareholders held in Company C. Company C then repurchased all of Company D’s shares. Company C’s shareholding then consisted solely of companies from which it purchased products. Company C has accumulated losses. In past years the company has paid out dividends when it has been able, and has a policy of paying dividends in the future. It advises that the share repurchase has not affected its ability to pay out dividends subsequently. The company also advises it has not been necessary to issue further shares to replace the capital returned to the shareholder in the repurchase, and evidence shows this to be true. The Commissioner now has to decide whether or not the repurchase of Company D’s shares is in lieu of a dividend under section CF 3(1)(b). From the information supplied it does not appear that the proposed redemption was made “in lieu of a dividend”, having regard to the company’s dividend policy. The company has paid dividends in the recent past (when it was able to do so). The company also has accumulated losses. Accordingly, there can be no suggestion that the company has been accumulating earnings that would normally be paid out as dividends. The company has not needed to issue further shares after the repurchase. This suggests that the company is in a position to pay out the shareholder on the repurchase of shares, thus helping to refute any suggestion that the repurchase is in lieu of dividends. The repurchase was part of a wider arrangement involving a change in ownership of the company, reflecting a desire to change the ownership from a mix of supplier and non-supplier shareholders to ownership by supplier shareholders. For this reason, the fact that the repurchase was to facilitate the exit of a major shareholder (which in itself is an unusual one-off event), leads to the conclusion that the repurchase was not in lieu of a dividend. Example 4 Company A decides to consolidate its business by selling assets surplus to requirements. The company distributes the capital profits to its shareholders by way of a pro-rata cancellation of more than 15% of its shares. Company B, which owns assets of the type used in the core business of company A, sells these assets to company A in exchange for an issue of shares. These actions would appear to amount to a straight cancellation of shares and a subsequent reissue to recoup capital – thus appearing to constitute a distribution to shareholders in lieu of dividends. The fact that the reissue of shares was not to all the shareholders is not a relevant consideration. The section does not require the 11 Commissioner to address the shareholders’ position directly. The Commissioner is concerned with the initial transaction, i.e., the cancellation of shares and the resulting distribution to shareholders. A later reissue of shares provides an indication that the company was not in a position to reduce its capital and that the funds paid out were in lieu of dividends. A cancellation of shares and subsequent reissue must be considered in light of all the facts. For example, the period of time between the cancellation and the reissue may be relevant – the shorter the time, the greater the chance of the reissue being known prior to the cancellation. If it is known that a later reissue was required soon after the date of cancellation, then this would be a strong indicator on its own that the distribution was in lieu of dividends. Essentially, whether a distribution is in lieu of dividends is the same in all cases – the Commissioner cannot look at just one factor in isolation – all four factors would have to be considered before a determination could be made that the distribution was or was not in lieu of dividends. One of the factors that could be relevant here is the expressed purpose or purposes of the cancellation. In this case, if the company has genuine commercial reasons for the share cancellation and the subsequent reissue of shares and none of the other section CF 3(1)(b) factors applied, then this would provide support for the conclusion that the distribution was not in lieu of dividends.
