GST Treatment for Management Services Supplied to Managed Funds Submitter: Implemented Investment Solutions Contact details: Please contact us if you would like to discuss this submission. Implemented Investment Solutions Limited (“IIS”) is a fund management company specialising in establishing and managing New Zealand-domiciled funds. In particular, we provide a “Fund Hosting” service which is similar to the third party responsible entity services that are available within the Australian market. Fund Hosting involves the issuing and managing of funds, under IIS’s MIS licence, on behalf of an investment manager who wants to provide NZ investors with access to their investment solutions in PIE funds. In our Fund Hosting business we see a variety of GST treatments. For example, offshore investment managers who provide services to NZ domiciled funds do not generally charge GST. Conversely NZ domiciled investment managers, providing the same services, generally charge GST at 1.5% (10% of the full 15% rate). We don’t have a strong preference for any of the options considered in Chapter 7 of the GST policy issues paper. We do, however, strongly believe in a consistent GST approach for managed funds. In particular, there should by consistency by: •Savings vehicle type, including managed funds, KiwiSaver schemes, and Australian unit trusts, and •Business model. Savings vehicle type The GST policy issues paper highlights the current GST exemption for management of a retirement scheme, and that non-retirement savings schemes do not have a similar exemption. In addition, we note that foreign funds offered in NZ, in particular Australian Unit Trusts offered under mutual recognition, are not subject to NZ GST. To ensure a level playing field, all genuine savings vehicles, regardless of the savings need being targeted and the jurisdiction of the vehicle, should have the same GST treatment. This extends to KiwiSaver schemes, which should have the same GST treatment as savings vehicles like managed funds. Business model The GST policy issues paper highlights the potential discrepancy in GST treatment depending on whether services are provided in-house or they are outsourced. In addition, as noted earlier, GST treatment can vary depending on if a service is being provided by a foreign or NZ entity. PUB-001 s 9(2)(a) All services provided to genuine savings vehicles, regardless of the services being provided in-house, outsourced or provided by a foreign entity, should have the same GST treatment. This will reduce bias towards a particular business model. GST policy issues Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 By e-mail:policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Submission on GST Policy Issues Paper The Police Superannuation Scheme (PSS) welcomes the opportunity to make a submission on this paper. The PSS is the Workplace Savings scheme providing retirement savings to sworn police and other police employees. It is compulsory for sworn police to join the scheme. As at 29 February 2020 it managed . It is the largest Workplace Savings scheme in New Zealand. The PSS is concerned with Chapter 7 of the paper (Managed Funds) which affects it directly. In particular, we would like to comment on one of the proposed options set out in paras 7.23 – 7.27: “Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund manages taxable supplies”. As stated in the paper in 7.26 this option would result in “higher fees and reduced after tax returns” for our members. Our funds have no structures whereby we can pass GST on – the additional tax burden on stops with members. In our view, this is entirely inappropriate in a time when the encouragement of retirement savings is very important and at a time, which would be during or soon after members had suffered significant losses because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore have a strong preference for one of the other options. I would be happy to discuss the points raised with officials, if required. Yours sincerely, PUB-002 s 9(2)(b)(ii) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) GST Treatment for Management Services Supplied to Managed Funds Submit ter: Russell Investment Group Limited Contact details: Please c ontact us if you would like to discuss this submission. Russell Investment Group Limited (“ RIGL”) is part of Russell Investments, a leading global investment manager offering multi-asset solutions to both institutional and retail clients in over 30 countries. RIGL provides investment management services to managers of New Zealand-domiciled funds and consulting services to New Zealand-domiciled clients who invest in both domestic and offshore products. As commented in the paper, there are currently varying practices in the industry and a consistent approach that is equitable across business models and savings vehicles is welcome. The policy options outlined each have their benefits and drawbacks as outlined in the paper. Our comments with respect to each option are noted below: 1)M akin g all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers taxable supplies In our view, this option reduces complexity and biases when compared to options 2 and 3 below, if it applies to all types of savings vehicles whether they be retirement schemes or other types of managed funds. Therefore, the exemption which is currently in place for retirement schemes should be removed. All managers and schemes would be on an even playing field. There will be less uncertainty on the GST treatment as essentially, all services provided by managers and investment managers would be subject to GST at the current rate of 15%. They will also be able to claim in full the GST on their inputs. For companies that provide both investment management and consulting or any other taxable services, it would reduce the complexity and administrative burden that currently exists in determining the recoverable and unrecoverable GST on costs which support both taxable and exempt activities. A significant drawback to the above, however, is that this will increase costs to t he investor. If the Government wants to encourage savings, then this policy option may be a significant deterrent to such an outcome. As noted in the paper, other jurisdictions allow funds to claim a portion of the GST via a reduced input tax credit mechanism. 2) Exempting all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers The advantage to this option is the elimination of the discrepancy that currently exists between services that are provided to retirement schemes vs other savings vehicles. In addition, it will further reduce GST cost for funds and underlying investors but at a cost to the manager /investment manager who will not be able to claim any input tax credits relating to those services. As a result, this option will likely create more biases against outsourcing as providing the services in-house incurs no GST whilst outsourcing to 3 rd party providers results in added costs due to unrecoverable GST. This is not an ideal outcome if outsourcing the services is beneficial for both the manager / investment manager and investors. In addition, as noted in the paper, it will likely create incentives to bundle services and characterise them as “management services” to reduce the GST costs for the funds. PUB-003 s 9(2)(a) From an administrative and compliance standpoint, unless the manager or investment manager only provides exempt management services, it will not reduce the complexity that current exists for companies that provide both taxable and exempt supplies. 3)Al l management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers hav e bot h a taxable and exempt component The difficulty with this option is determining the appropriate split between the taxable and exempt portions. There are likely to be varying opinions in the industry due to varying business models. If a decision is made to apply the 90% exempt / 10% taxable split that is currently being applied by some in the industry, it will lessen the burden of the transition, though it will be at the expense of those who currently treat fees as 100% taxable. From an administrative and complexity standpoint, we see no significant benefits from this option. 4) Z ero-rating or a reduced input tax mechanism W e view the zero-rating option as the most preferred. This will encourage savings by decreas ing f und fees for investors, allow NZ based savings products to compete more effectively wit h global c ounterparts which benefit from reduced input tax regimes or a wider array of services that ar e ex empt from GST, reduce bias against outsourcing and will likely have broader support from industry participants. However, we do acknowledge that management and investment management services would need to be carefully defined for this treatment. A reduced input tax mechanism would also be welcome, though to a lesser extent compared to zero-rating as determining an appropriate percentage of recoverable GST may prove to be dif ficult. In addition, this option will be more complex to administer as funds will now be able t o c laim input tax credits. I n terms of transition, we request Inland Revenue to allow for adequate time to comply with the chosen option. Fund management fees are complex and charged in a variety of ways and companies will need sufficient time to understand the impact of the changes, develop a transition plan, implement the plan and communicate to all relevant parties, including investors. 1 Public Trust Corporate Office Level 9, 34 Shortland Street, CBD PO Box 1598, Auckland 1140 P 0800 371 471 F 0800 371 001 W publictrust.co.nz 5 th May 2020 GST Policy Issues C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Dear Deputy Commissioner, Re: GST Policy Issues Paper, February 2020 Public Trust is pleased to provide a submission on the options and proposals outlined in the GST policy issues paper. Public Trust has provided comments on the chapters and topics that directly affect Public Trust’s existing and foreseeable operations. Specific Comments The following table provides a breakdown of Public Trust’s feedback. Chapter and topic Issue Comments PUB-004 Not in scope 2 Chapter 7 – Managed funds The GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and applies inconsistently. Public Trust agrees there is a need for more certainty in the GST treatment of fund manager and investment manager services. Public Trust places importance on the policy objectives of providing certainty of treatment and minimising biases that GST may create. Unfortunately there is no approach that perfectly meets these objectives, there are trade-offs for each option. Public Trust’s views on each option are as follows: Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers taxable supplies This option provides certainty of treatment and appears to be the option with the lowest compliance costs for investment and fund managers, both of which are perceived positively by Public Trust. The tax biases from inconsistencies between GST treatment of retirement schemes and investment managers and the higher fees and resulting reduced after-tax returns for retail investors are significant drawbacks. Due to the reduced returns for Public Trust clients and creating biases against investment managers this option is not favoured. Exempting all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers This option would provide improved certainty for service providers but compliance costs are greater than for the previous option. To aid certainty of treatment Public Trust agrees there’s a strong need to develop a robust definition of the services that qualify for the GST exemption. The GST costs for managers and the boundary issues are unfortunate by-products of this option but are issues that are currently experienced by financial services providers so Public Trust does not consider these to be significant as there is a consistency across Not in scope 3 the industry for the cost impact and a framework for dealing with the boundary issues.  Public Trust has a preference for this option. Legislate that managers and investment managers are deemed to have a certain percentage of taxable and exempt supplies  This option would introduce complexity and inconsistency into NZ’s GST regime by apportioning output tax on supplies.  However to legislate a percentage would improve certainty.  The GST costs on managers would be less than under the full exemption option above but introduces further opportunity for biases and complexity due to inconsistencies with the GST approach for financial services.  Public Trust is aware that 90% exempt, 10% taxable is followed in parts of the industry but cannot advise at this stage what may be a reasonable percentage if this option was adopted. Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism  While this option would be the most tax advantageous to investment managers such as Public Trust, we concur with the issues paper that such an option will be a fundamental change to the GST treatment of financial services and therefore would more appropriately be considered as part of a fundamental review of the financial services definition that considered the full range of financial services, not just manager and investment manager services.  Furthermore Public Trust foresees that the high fiscal cost to the government of the zero-rating option would make it the least favoured for Inland Revenue. Types of manager and investment manager services the proposed policy should apply to: Public Trust agrees with applying the existing definitions under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 for the terms manager, investment manager and managed investment scheme. Public Trust also considers it sensible to draw a distinction between providing management services and other services such as accounting, administrative and registry services. Public Trust is not in favour of legislative change to codify the GST treatment of accounting, administrative and registry services and is comfortable with continued reliance on the case law of Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987). 4 Transitional issues If the law was changed Public Trust agrees with the proposal for this change to have effect prospectively with grand-parenting of existing contracts for 3 years to allow for adjustments and new contracts to be negotiated. Conclusion Public Trust supports the review of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in response to changes in technology, business practices, and jurisprudence in the interests of maintaining the certainty, efficiency and fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Given the importance of these proposed changes, we are happy to provide any additional comment on the contents of this submission. Please do not hesitate to contact us.

We refer to “Chapter 7 – Managed Funds” of the “GST policy issues – an officials issues paper” dated February 2020. The fund managers are as follows: ►Mint Asset Management Limited; ►Castle Point Funds Management Limited; ►Devon Funds Management Limited; ►Elevation Capital Management Limited; ►Nikko Asset Management New Zealand Limited; and ►SALT Funds Management Limited. We appreciate the opportunity to make a submission on the above-mentioned GST issue and have set out our submission below in this regard. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the “Act”) unless otherwise stated, paragraph references are to the document unless otherwise stated. 1.General comments 1.1 The fund managers support the policy option to treat the management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers to managed funds as fully taxable for GST purposes. Please note that our discussions set out in this submission are consistent with our previous submission dated 5 July 2018 (as enclosed), although noting that the previous submission was structured as a hierarchy of preferences (considering the limited policy options available at the time) whereas we have indicated our preferred approach in the current submission. 1.2 We consider that the policy option to treat the management services as fully taxable would provide the much needed clarity on this area (i.e. any arbitrary boundary issues can be notably minimised) and this option is consistent with the primary policy objective of GST being a broad based tax policy. PUB-005 s 9(2)(a) A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Page 2 1.3 The fund managers also agree that the terms “manager”, “investment manager” and “managed investment scheme” could be defined under the Act by referencing the existing definitions of these terms in section 6(1) and section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. 1.4 The fund managers’ submission is set out in further detail below. 2.0 Management services performed by the fund managers and the GST treatment of these services 2.1 The fund managers are of the view that the majority of the activities undertaken by the fund managers should be taxable for GST purposes and we consider that the essential nature of the activities undertaken by the fund managers is managing the funds, being a management service. 2.2 We have listed below the activities undertaken by the fund managers (please note that this list is not exhaustive) and we are of the view that these activities should be treated as a single taxable supply for GST purposes as they are in the nature of “management services” and should not fall under the definition of “financial services” under the Act. ► research on securities and stock positoning; ► marketing and advertising of the fund; ► communication with investors through written communication and online portals for tailored investor information; ► provision of general market commentary and answering client queries on fund; ► maintaining legal compliance with securities law, including document preparation and anti- money laundering operations and arranging audit; ► preparation and distribution of audited accounts and arrangement of the audit; ► maintenance of a unit register; ► valuing assets and calculating unit prices; ► compliance with extensive reporting requirements to the funds supervisor and regulator; ► providing tax advice required by the fund; ► completing stress testing as required by the Financial Market Authority; ► reviewing offer materials and meeting with potential fund investors; ► preparation of a Compliance Assurance Programme. 2.3 The essential nature of the above services is a management service, and not merely the execution of trades. 3.0 Advantages of treating the management services as fully taxable 3.1 There are significant advantages by treating the management services as fully taxable for GST purposes. We have discussed the same in further detail below. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Page 3 Reduces compliance costs 3.2 Treating the management services as fully taxable would simplify the compliance processes and significantly reduce the associated compliance costs. 3.3 Compliance costs add up when there is a need to identify and determine the GST treatment of the different types of services and to quantify the consideration for each service. In addition, significant compliance costs arise in determining which input tax credits can be recovered based on the types of supplies made to the managed funds. As you would appreciate, some of the fund managers who have limited resource in-house would acquire external professional advices from time-to time to ensure that they are not over-claiming any input tax for GST purposes. These processes are often very time and cost consuming. 3.4 If management services are treated as fully taxable for GST purposes, any GST incurred on expenses in relation to the fund management services would be fully recoverable. This would eliminate the need of undertaking input tax apportionment calculation in-house or to engage external tax specialists to assist with this process, which further reduce the compliance burden and costs of the fund managers. Addresses the competitive disadvantage of outsourcing and the bias to insourcing 3.5 GST exemptions create an undesirable bias for fund managers (predominantly large offshore fund managers who have sufficient resources in-house) to perform all key services in-house for the purposes of removing irrecoverable GST incurred on services procured from third parties. GST exemptions lead to a competitive disadvantage for the fund managers many of whom are domestically owned who may have limited resources and are unable to perform the services in- house. This does not make for good tax policy and creates unfairness within the GST system. 3.6 Further, for commercial and regulatory requirement purposes, fund managers are required to outsourced certain activities regardless of the GST costs. Treating management services as fully taxable would allow fund managers to fully recover any GST costs incurred on a wide range of outsourced services, which promotes the advantages of outsourcing and minimises the bias to insourcing. In Australia, the GST law provides additional deductions for a wide range of specific outsourced acquisitions to mimic the effect of insourcing. This is also consistent with Australia and New Zealand financial regulators’ view that there is a preference for an outsourced model as it provides for segregation of duties and independent oversight. 3.7 By treating the management services as fully taxable, this would eliminate the above bias and promote fairness as well as higher efficiency in allocation of capital decisions. 4.0 Disadvantages of treating management services supplied to managed funds as fully taxable and how these can be addressed 4.1 If the fund management services are treated as fully taxable for GST purposes, there is a misconception that it would automatically lead to corresponding higher fees and reduced returns for investors. This view is on the basis that the services eventually provided by the managed funds to investors would still be treated as exempt for GST purposes and therefore GST incurred by the A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Page 4 managed funds (i.e. on services received from the fund managers) would not be recoverable and will be passed on to the investors. 4.2 We note that the above is not necessarily the case as the fund managers are operating and governed under a robust and transparent regulatory environment. As you would appreciate, the fund managers are required to produce and publish quarterly fund updates (covering the total costs and returns) for use by the public investors. Investors would use these fund updates in their investment decision making process. If 15% GST is charged on the fund management services, to the extent it is irrecoverable, it would form part of the total costs of the funds. Any increase in the costs is likely to reduce the attractiveness of the funds. Therefore, to remain competitive in the market, it is highly unlikely that the fund managers would be able to increase their costs by 15% (and pass this on to the investors). 5.0 How policy objectives can be achieved under the preferred approach Limits the GST exemption for financial services 5.1 GST is a broad-based tax with few exemptions, with the primary objective of raising tax revenue in a fair and efficient manner with minimal economic distortions. One of the ways in which this policy objective can be met is through limiting the GST exemptions (i.e. the scope of financial services) to highly complex areas with significant practical issues. This is consistent with the discussions in the document “GST & Financial Services – A government discussion document” dated October 2002 published by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department. 5.2 By treating the management services as fully taxable, it would mean that these services would not be included in the “financial services” net, and this would help in achieving the policy objective of GST. It is pertinent to note that the primary objective of having a GST exemption in place for financial services was due to valuation difficulties. As these issues do not arise for managers and investment managers on the basis that they charge a separate fee for their services (rather than a fee for a bundled mix of services and investment products), there should be no reason to not exclude the services provided by the fund managers from the “financial services” net. Provides certainty of GST treatment 5.3 The services undertaken by fund managers are extremely complex, resulting in adoption of inconsistent GST treatments within the industry (in respect of both supplies and purchases). Applying GST to fund management services not only addresses and eliminates the obvious shortcomings of the current rules (e.g. insourcing bias, increased tax and compliance costs, etc), but also provides much needed certainty on the GST treatment of the services. 5.4 Fundamental to the above proposition is that it would be important to amend (where required) and provide a clearer definition of the “financial services” under the GST Act. 5.5 It is important that the definition of the financial services are amended in such a way that it provides a more certain and consistent GST treatment for manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. This would also provide clearer guidance for the fund managers to A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Page 5 determine the GST treatment of their products as well as to minimise compliance costs and potential errors. Minimises any significant biases that GST may create 5.6 As discussed in the paragraphs above, by treating the management services as fully taxable would help to directly addresses the following issues: ►Competitive disadvantage of outsourcing; ►Biases in capital allocation decisions which promote inefficient investment arrangements. 5.7 We note that the above is consistent with the policy objectives of minimising any significant biases that GST may have created under the current arrangement. 6.0 GST / VAT treatment in other countries 6.1 We also note that the approach of treating the management services supplied to managed funds as fully taxable is consistent with the approach adopted by both Australia and Singapore. In Australia and Singapore, GST is applicable at standard rates to all services provided to managed funds. Both these countries however, allow the managed funds to claim back most of the GST costs through a reduced input tax credit mechanism. 7.0 Conclusion 7.1 In conclusion, we consider that the management services supplied to the managed funds by the fund managers should be treated as fully taxable considering the various advantages as discussed and that this approach would achieve the policy objectives as discussed in the “GST policy issues –an officials issues paper” dated February 2020. Thank you in advance for your assistance on this matter and we appreciate your support in considering our comments above. We would be happy to discuss our submission with you.

The fund managers are as follows: ►Devon Funds Management Limited; ►Pathfinder Asset Management Limited; ►New Zealand Assets Management Limited; and ►Mint Asset Management Limited. Our submission has been prepared to facilitate our meeting with Inland Revenue policy officials and the fund managers on 6 July 2018. General comments The fund managers disagree with certain positions taken in the QWBA’s. In particular, the fund managers note that: ►The GST treatment of investment management services as outlined in the Manager QBWA is incorrect, and should be viewed as a single taxable supply (rather than a supply of financial services); ►In the event that the management services are not treated as being subject to GST in full, the fund managers should be able to continue to apply the current GST treatment agreed with Inland Revenue (i.e., 10% of management fees should be treated as being subject to GST at the standard rate); ►In the event that the management services are not treated as being subject to GST in full, appropriate mechanisms should be introduced to provide relief for fund managers who are not vertically integrated, such as the introduction of a reduced input tax credit; and PUB-005a s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Page 2 Chris Gillion Inland Revenue ►The GST treatment proposed for outsourced management services is contrary to the position taken under the Manager QWBA. Inland Revenue’s reasoning fails to acknowledge that the Manager legally remains responsible for these management services, irrespective of whether performed by the Manager or a third party provider. We recommend in the absence of treating investment management services as taxable, that outsourced services should be viewed as the “arranging” of a financial service and follow the same GST treatment. Our comments are set out in further detail below. All statutory references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”). Detailed comments 1.GST treatment of investment management services 1.1. As outlined in the Manager QWBA, the Inland Revenue summarised a number of activities generally undertaken by managers of unit trusts (paragraph 6). We consider the list of activities listed by the Inland Revenue to be incomplete and that full consideration has not been given to the true nature of the fund managers’ services. 1.2. We consider the essential nature of the manager’s services is the management of the fund, being a management service. The services undertaken by fund managers is extremely complex, and should not be over-simplified. Careful consideration is required as over-simplification will result in an incorrect GST treatment being adopted. 1.3. While we agree that, considered in isolation, there are activities carried out by managers that would be financial services for the purposes of the GST Act (such as issuing, redeeming or re- purchasing units), we are of the view that the majority of activities of the fund managers are taxable when considered as a whole. 1.4. In particular, we are of the view that the following activities undertaken by fund managers should be viewed as taxable; research on securities and stock positon, marketing and advertising of the fund, communication with investors and clients, provision of general market commentary and answering client queries on fund, maintaining legal compliance with securities law, including document preparation and anti-money laundering operations, preparation and distribution of audited accounts and arrangement of the audit, maintenance of a unit register, valuing assets and calculating unit prices, compliance with extensive reporting requirements to the funds trustee and regulator, providing tax advice required by the fund, completing stress testing as required by the Financial Market Authority, reviewing offer materials and meeting with potential fund investors. We note that the above is not a complete list of services carried out by the fund managers. 1.5. The essential nature of the above services is a management service, not merely the execution of trades. 2.Treating the services as partially subject to GST 2.1 In the event that the fund managers’ services cannot be treated as being subject to GST in full, the fund managers consider that a portion of their services should continue to be treated as being subject to GST. The fund managers consider that the current GST treatment (i.e., 10% of the services being treated as being subject to GST) still has some merits. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Page 3 Chris Gillion Inland Revenue 2.2 However, such GST treatment does not fully address the imbalance between those fund managers that are vertically integrated (and do not suffer GST leakage) and those fund managers that are horizontally integrated (and suffer GST leakage). As discussed below, the fund managers consider that this anomaly needs to be remedied in the GST Act. 3. Vertical versus horizontal integration 3.1. As you will be aware, the current and proposed GST treatment of management fees creates a bias to vertical integration so that GST leakage is eliminated or substantially reduced. For example, by businesses bringing outsourced services in house to remove a GST impost that would otherwise arise. This does not make for good tax policy and creates unfairness within the GST system. 3.2. Changes to address the imbalance and unfairness between vertical and horizontal integration are long overdue. The fund manager’s consider that changes should be introduced and there are a variety of options to do this. For example: (a) The management services could be included in the scope of the zero-rating rules; (b) A system of reduced input tax credits, similar to the Australian GST approach 1 , could be introduced; (c) The apportionment rules could be amended to allow fund managers to recover a certain percentage of GST incurred on outsourced services; and (d) Outsourced services could be treated as exempt from GST (as discussed below). 3.3. Further to point 3.2(b) above, the effect of introducing reduced input tax credits directly addresses the competitive disadvantage of outsourcing and the competitive advantage of insourcing. Rather than imposing tax on an internal supply to mimic the effect of outsourcing, Australian GST law grants additional deductions for outsourced supplies to mimic the effect of insourcing. For a wide range of specified outsourced acquisitions, financial services providers can claim a reduced input tax credit (usually 75% of the input tax). 3.4. Failure to remove this competitive disadvantage using one of the methods outlined above at point 3.2 could ultimately result in a number of managers bringing such services in house. This exact issue was raised in Australia, and was met with strong opposition from financial regulators as there is a preference for an outsourced model as it provides for segregation of duties and independent oversight. Such a view is maintained by New Zealand financial regulators. 4. Outsourcing of services 4.1. In respect of the Outsourced Services QWBA, the fund managers’ are of the view that the Inland Revenue have taken a narrow position that certain outsourced services would be considered a taxable supply (that is, there is an assumption no financial services would be provided by the third party). 4.2. While such a position seems contrary to the Manager QWBA (i.e. the services are not considered as part of a broader supply), the proposed GST treatment would result in the GST cost in relation 1 See ATO ruling GSTR 2004/1. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Page 4 Chris Gillion Inland Revenue to the services being borne by the fund manager as they would not have the ability to pass on the increased costs to the clients. 4.3. Assuming that the fund managers are making taxable supplies (as outlined above at paragraph 1.5), the outsourcing of services would be recoverable by the fund managers to the extent they are used in making taxable supplies. 4.4. We consider that if the position under the Manager QWBA is maintained that management services is an exempt supply, the services that may be outsourced should also be regarded as supplies of financial services, being the arrangement of financial supplies falling under section 3(1)(l), analogous to the management of a retirement scheme (section 3(1)(j)). 4.5. We appreciate that this would require a broad interpretation of the “arranging” of financial supplies. For example, whereby services such as maintenance of a unit register or valuing assets and calculating unit prices should be allowed to be considered to be the arrangement of a financial service. 4.6. Fundamental to the above proposition that outsourced services should be viewed as the “arranging” of financial supplies is that the Managers’ remain legally liable for these management services, irrespective of the fact that such services have been outsourced. Adopting the position as outlined by Inland Revenue in the Outsourced Services QWBA fails to recognise the legal realties of such arrangements. 5.Conclusion 5.1. In conclusion, we consider that the manager of a fund is supplying management services that do not fit within the definition of a financial supply under the GST Act. The core investment activities carried out by these fund managers, being analysis and research are taxable supplies (i.e. not financial supplies). 5.2. The position adopted under the Outsourced Services QWBA is contrary to the Manager QWBA and we recommend that consideration is given as to mechanisms to address the imbalance between vertical and horizontal integration. 5.3. In the absence of adopting the position that management services are taxable, we are of the view outsourced services should be viewed as the arranging of a financial service. 5.4. We look forward to discussing this submission with you further on 6 July. Do let us know if you have any comments or queries in the interim. Yours sincerely Ernst & Young Limited s 9(2)(a) 1 | P a g e 7 May 2020 Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington Via email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Submission: GST treatment of management services for managed funds Pathfinder Asset Management Limited and Alvarium Wealth (NZ) Limited are making this joint submission in relation to potential changes to the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services for managed funds. We refer to “Chapter 7 – Managed Funds” of the “GST policy issues – an officials issues paper” from February 2020. Thank you for the wide-ranging discussion paper you have prepared on GST for managed funds. We note that the issues considered – including legal, fiscal and commercial – are much broader than previous consultations on this issue. We appreciate this wide-ranging and more commercially focused approach. We have submitted to you previously on this important and complex GST issue as follows: ►5 February 2015 (Pathfinder) ►21 December 2015 (Pathfinder) ►24 March 2017 (Pathfinder) ►5 July 2018 (EY submitted on behalf of Pathfinder and 3 other fund managers) We agree that the current GST treatment of management services for managed funds is complex and applied inconsistently across the industry. Below we start by summarizing what we see as 5 key policy principles relevant to settling this GST treatment. We then outline our preferred solution and (should that not be accepted) we outline our “fall back preference”. To be clear our fall back is a distant second to our preferred option. Part one – 5 key policy principles 1 - Consistent application: You note that different outcomes can occur for different types of managed fund schemes – for example – ‘standard’ managed funds, retirement schemes and KiwiSaver. We believe that any decision made on GST must be consistent across all of these to avoid unexpected distortions. A single answer should be adopted whether it is for KiwiSaver managed funds, ‘standard’ managed funds or other retirement funds. 2 – Reduce compliance costs: We agree that the current GST rules add to compliance costs for managers as you outline in your paragraph 7.8. We believe the outcome chosen should aim to minimize PUB-0 2 | P a g e compliance costs. Reducing compliance costs also highlights the importance of Principle 1 above – treatment must be consistent across ‘standard’ funds, KiwiSaver and other retirement funds. 3 – No distorted incentives between in-house or out-sourcing: We agree with your suggestion in para 7.14 that the current GST rules effectively incentivise managers to bring certain tasks in-house. This distortion is undesirable and inequitable – our taxation system should not be incentivizing or rewarding one structure over the other. This distortion has tended to benefit larger fund managers over smaller. Providing a competitive advantage through tax treatment is unfair and should be avoided. 4 – Neutral (or positive) fiscal effects: We believe any solution should, at worst, be ‘broadly’ fiscally neutral for tax revenue. Having said that, we should not tolerate an approach regarded as unfair and with high compliance costs simply because we are concerned about possible fiscal effects of the ‘right answer’. If work has been done on the fiscal implications of each option that should be shared with the managed funds industry so we can be mindful of this. 5 – Basic principle of GST – ‘end user’ should pay: An underlying principle of the GST legislation is that the end user should ultimately bear the tax. The end user is not the fund manager providing services to a fund – it is the managed fund and its investors. We wonder if there is general agreement that this ‘end user’ principle should apply but concern around passing of GST cost on to investors? If this is the case, then ‘zero-rating’ is by far the best option. (We note your concerns about the fiscal implications but cannot comment as we have not seen any numbers published on the cost this could involve – can you please share that?). Part one – ‘preferred’ and ‘fall back’ options Preferred solution(s): Our strong preference is essentially for one of two options - that all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers be: ►taxable supplies or ►(based on the discussion under principle 5 above) zero-rated. Both the ‘taxable supplies’ and ‘zero-rating’ options have the following benefits: Taxable supplies Zero-rating Distortions created (ie in- sourcing of services) Removes distortions that encourage in-sourcing Removes distortions that encourage in-sourcing Compliance costs Reduces compliance costs for managers Reduces compliance costs for managers Fiscal drag Does not create a fiscal drag No data to draw a conclusion Managed fund fees We do not agree with you that the ‘taxable supplies’ option will necessarily lead to higher costs. See our discussion on this below. Will lead to lower fees (because fund managers getting full recovery of GST on payments - rather than suffering leakage - then they can pass that benefit to investors). 3 | P a g e We do not agree that the ‘taxable supplies’ option will necessarily lead to higher costs. We say this because: 1) There is significant and long-term downward pressure on fees in the managed funds industry. It is easy for managers to reduce fees, however because of competitive tensions it is rare, if ever, you ever see a manager increase fees. 2) The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) oversees fees charged and has a strong stance concerning the need to reduce fees, particularly with KiwiSaver offerings. 3) Your suggested 3-year transition period allows managers to keep the status quo in terms of fee structures for a period and effectively “wait and see”. This means that regardless of points 1 and 2 above, there is unlikely to be a swift change in fees with an impact on investors. Fall back option: If our preferred approach (manager fees being ‘taxable supplies’ or ‘zero rated’) is not adopted then, our second preference (and it is in a distant second place) is for manager fees to be legislated 50% taxable and 50% exempt supplies. Currently, some managers charge GST on only 10% of the fee while others charge GST on all of the management fee. Our suggested 50/50 solution has no science behind it (in the same way the widely adopted ‘10% of the fee’ solution has absolutely no science behind it) but 50/50 is an arbitrary half-way house between both positions. 50/50 has the following benefits: 50% taxable / 50% exempt Distortions created (ie in-sourcing of services) Reduces insourcing biases (but not to the same extent as the taxable supplies / zero rating solutions) Compliance costs Reduces compliance costs by introducing a higher level of consistency (again, not as good as the taxable supplies / zero rating solutions) Fiscal drag Need data Managed fund fees Unclear – possible some increase, some have ability to reduce – depends on competitive pressures. Finally, we reiterate our ‘Principle 1’ above – any solution must be applied consistently across KiwiSaver, other retirement funds and ‘standard’ managed funds. We also refer to our ‘Principle 5’ which underpins the entire GST legislation – that ultimately GST is a ‘end user pays’ tax. Thanks for the opportunity to submit.

We would like to participate, specifically in relation to Chapter 7 – Managed Funds. The GST issues paper outlines four alternative options for new rules for GST on fund management and investment management services. Our response focuses on three questions that were posed at the conclusion of Chapter 7. Our response makes reference to our previous submissions made on 23 March 2017 to the Commissioner of the Inland Revenue, where we provided a response to the following draft Questions We’ve Been Asked (QWBA): What is the GST treatment of fees payable by investors to the manager of a unit trust? (QWBA PUB00277aa) What is the GST treatment of services for a unit trust that are provided by a third party to the manager of a unit trust? (QWBA PUB00277bb) Content of these previous submissions will be reiterated in part for this submission. Q1. What are the pros, cons or practical issues associated with each of the policy options? How well would they achieve the policy objectives? Option 1: Fund manager and investment manager services are fully taxable (15% GST): The most significant benefit is clarity and the removal of the complexity of the current GST rules. GST compliance is also simplified as fund managers are allowed to claim input credits for GST charged on external costs. The most significant disadvantage is that it would impose a higher unrecoverable GST cost on funds, increasing fees and reducing after-tax returns for retail investors. The FMA have been vocal about fund managers providing value for money for clients. An increase in fees with no increase in value provided to the client contradicts this objective. This option achieves the GST policy objectives of limiting the GST exemption for financial services and providing certainty of GST treatment. However, transitioning from current practice would result in additional fees to investors with the addition of GST. Our understanding is that a majority of the industry apply the existing FSC agreement with the Inland Revenue, treating 10% of fund management and investment services as taxable. This would therefore be a considerable change to the industry status quo. Furthermore, while this option reduces in-house bias, it would create biases towards investing through retirement funds rather other type of managed funds (assuming the GST exemption for managers of a retirement scheme is retained). PUB-0 Option 2: Fund manager and investment manager services are exempt financial services: This option is consistent with the Commissioners stance in the draft QWBA PUB00277aa. It was determined that fees payable to the manager of a unit trust are not subject to GST, as they are consideration for an exempt supply under s 14(1)(a) of the GST Act. This option would extend the financial services exemption to all fund manager services. Like option 1, option 2 provides clarity and removes the complexity of the GST rules by applying a blanket exemption. Option 2 reduces the unrecoverable GST cost on funds, reducing fees and increasing the after-tax return for retail investors. Furthermore, the bias of investing through retirement funds rather than other types of managed funds is removed. The most significant disadvantage is that it comes at a cost to the fund manager, as they would no longer be able to recover any input GST. However, as previously submitted in our response to QWBA PUB00277aa, the simplicity for investors, aligning the GST treatment between retirement funds and other types of managed funds, and reducing the cost to investors is important, and outweighs the cost to us. Although this option would increase in-house bias, as previously submitted in our response to QWBA PUB00277bb, we believe that administrative services such as fund accounting, unit pricing and record keeping should be exempt supplies, as they are reasonably incidental and necessary for the supply of financial services by the manager, irrespective of whether these services are performed in- house or outsourced by the fund manager. This would effectively remove the in-house bias. This options achieves the GST policy objectives of providing certainty of GST treatment, with low transition costs compared to current commercial practice, as the majority of the industry would only require a 10% adjustment in GST treatment. In-house bias would be minimal, provided that outsourced administrative services were also considered exempt. However, this option would broaden the GST exemption on financial services. Option 3: Deem a certain percentage of fund manager and investment manager services to be taxable (and the remainder exempt): The most significant benefit is that it aligns with the majority industry practice, being the existing FSC agreement with the Inland Revenue. The most significant disadvantage is that this does not address the complexity of the current GST rules. Each fund manager is unique, and there would be no general consensus from the industry as to what ratio to legislate going forward. Furthermore, this option would increase GST compliance costs. We expect that the Inland Revenue would require guidance from the industry to determine the appropriate ratio to legislate. Any proposal would require detailed analysis. This requires time and effort, and may result in an outcome which is quite different to current practice, notwithstanding a variety of answers from the industry that do not provide a definitive solution. As the industry continuously evolves, it is likely that this exercise would need to be revisited on a regular basis to ensure the legislated ratio remains appropriate. Provided that the legislated ratio is consistent with the 10:90 taxable to exempt arrangement between the FSC and Inland Revenue, this option would have the lowest transition cost compared to other options. However, the complexity of the GST rules still remains, and there is the potential for in-house bias depending on what ratio is legislated. In summary, a number of existing issues with the GST policy objectives still persist after this option is implemented. Option 4: Zero rated supply, or a reduced input tax credit (RITC) mechanism Zero rating has the greatest benefit of all the options. It provides clarity, removes the complexity of GST treatment, reduces the cost for retail investors and allows fund managers to recover 100% of input GST charged on external costs, thereby eliminating in-house bias. An RITC would address insource bias, however, as noted in the GST issues paper, there will be added complexity as to the calculation of the percentage of the RITC allowable. The main disadvantage for these options is that there would be some transition costs, as this option represents a considerable change to the status quo. Furthermore, the under-taxing of manager and investment manager services may result in the Government compensating through increased taxation on other fund manager activities. Q2. What types of manager and investment manager services should the proposed policy or law change apply to? What is the clearest way to define the relevant services? Our preference would be for the change in law to reflect either option 2 (exempt supplies) or option 4 (zero rated/ RITC mechanism). From a GST policy objective standpoint, these options address many of the issues associated with the current GST rules, as detailed in our answer to the previous question. Furthermore, they result in a reduction to fees and increased after tax returns for retail investors, aligning with the objectives of the FMA. With option 2, the financial service exemption would apply to all services provided by the fund manager directly, as well as administrative services outsourced by the fund manager to third parties which are reasonably incidental and necessary for the supply of financial services by the fund manager. Examples of these would be fund accounting, unit pricing and record keeping. For option 4, similar to above, all services offered by fund managers would be zero rated as well as administrative services outsourced by the fund manager to third parties, provided they were reasonable incidental and necessary to the supply of financial services by the fund manager. Q3. If the law was changed, what transitional issues could arise and what measures could be implemented to enable a smooth transition to the new law? If the law were changed, a transitional period should be introduced, allowing fund managers and their outsourced service providers to apply their existing GST arrangements, until their necessary processes, structures and contracts were updated to allow full compliance with the new law. During this time, the Inland Revenue should undertake workshops with the industry to answer frequently asked questions about the new law. In addition to this, personalised communication between the Inland Revenue, fund managers and outsourced service providers will address specific company and process issues with implementing the new law. We hope this feedback is valuable for your consideration of the GST issues relating to fund manager and investment manager services.

CT G 15 May 2020 GST issues paper C/- David Carrigan Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140 Dear David GST POLICY ISSUES: AN OFFICIALS’ ISSUES PAPER The Corporate Taxpayers Group (“the Group”) is writing to submit on the GST policy issues paper (“the paper”) as many of the topics raised impact members of the Group. The Group appreciates the opportunity to comment and to raise some wider issues with the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) regime in New Zealand. The Group appreciates the approach taken by Officials to allow all submitters an extended time to prepare submissions in light of the business disruption caused by COVID-19. The Group sets out below a table summarising the issues and options raised by the paper and our response to each. THE GST REGIME The Group supports continued policy development in response to changing business practices and it is pleasing to see a number of proposals in the paper seek to modernise the GST regime, simplify complex areas and remove unnecessary compliance costs. However, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) was written for a business setting unrecognisable to the one operating today. This has resulted in many areas of the Act that do not achieve the original policy intent or do not fit with normal business practice, well beyond those covered in this submission. The Group considers that the current Act consists of overly long and complex provisions with extensive cross-referencing which is difficult to understand and comply with. There are many areas where the current Act does not achieve the correct outcome, only some of which are covered in this paper. The Group considers a re-write of the Act using simple language, with today’s business environment in mind, would be more beneficial than continued re-working of the existing Act which is over 30 years old. ABOUT THE GROUP – INFORMED, PRINCIPLED, PRACTICAL About the Group The Corporate Taxpayers Group is an organisation of major New Zealand companies that works with key Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to achieve positive changes to tax in New Zealand. PUB-0 C o r p o r a t e T a x p a y e r s G r o u p s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) CTG – GST issues paper 15 May 2020 Page 2 of 17 CTGCTG The objective of the Group is to pursue the principled interests of its members in the tax sphere. The practical experience of Group members enables it to encapsulate general economic concepts into principles that guide and underpin its submissions. The Group believes that a good tax system for New Zealand should be built around the following principles: High certainty and low business risk: For the corporate sector, tax is not just a cost of doing business but is also a very significant risk. Funds are raised, staff hired, and investments made on the basis of expected returns to corporate shareholders / owners. If tax rules increase business risk by creating uncertain or unexpected tax outcomes then the rate of return on investment has to be higher to compensate for this. Higher required rates of return mean less investment and fewer jobs, to the detriment of the economy. To lower business risks caused by the tax system, tax rules need to be as certain as possible and they need to be administered and interpreted by the Inland Revenue consistently and speedily. Having a high level of certainty over the medium to long term is of high importance to the Group. Low compliance costs: Compliance costs imposed by the tax system are an economic cost. Those resources would be better employed creating jobs and raising the wealth of New Zealand. Positive contribution: The tax system plays a significant role in society and has the ability to contribute to the overall welfare and wellbeing of New Zealand and New Zealanders. Any changes to the tax system should focus on building and utilising the collective human, social, natural and financial capital of New Zealand, and should also make a positive contribution to New Zealand. International competitiveness, especially with Australia: Taxes are a significant cost of doing business. The higher those costs are in New Zealand relative to other countries, the higher the relative costs of doing business in New Zealand. That flows through to less investment, fewer jobs and lower wealth. New Zealand’s tax system plays a critical role in our competitive position with our major trading partners and competitors. In addition to attracting foreign investment, a competitive tax system is one that ensures that New Zealand is attractive as a base for outbound investment. While New Zealand businesses compete with the rest of the world for investment funding, markets and skilled workers, Australia is our nearest and most significant competitor. For that reason the Group considers that the New Zealand tax system should set as a minimum benchmark, a system that provides a business environment at least as good as that which exists in competing countries, especially Australia. The above principles are central to the way the Group judges tax policy issues. It is very important to the Group that Inland Revenue uses its resources appropriately and does not impose excessive compliance costs on business by over complicating parts of legislation that are unable to be interpreted or applied in practice. While the Group supports the majority of the proposals set out in the paper, it is noted that the Group advocates for simple and understandable law, and that where changes to formulas or application of the law as proposed it should be done so with the concept of simplicity in mind. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The position of the group can be summarised per the below: Not in scope CTG – GST issues paper 15 May 2020 Page 3 of 17 CTGCTG  The Group supports option number four for the GST treatment of managed funds.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MANAGED FUNDS ............................................................................. 12 Not in scope Not in scope CTG – GST issues paper 15 May 2020 Page 12 of 17 CTGCTG 6. CHAPTER SEVEN: MANAGED FUNDS Issue: The GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and applies inconsistently. Proposal CTG Comment Option 1: All management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers are taxable supplies. The Group supports New Zealand’s Broad Based Low Rate system and the fact that New Zealand’s GST system is effective through its broad rules with limited exceptions. The tax system should also be a neutral factor in investment decisions where possible and provide taxpayers with certainty and clarity. These principles should be applied to GST and managed funds. However, the Group notes that GST on managed funds is a particularly complex issue due to the various number of fund structures that will give different outcomes under the current GST on managed fund rules and under the proposed options. The Group submits that great care should be taken when imposing costs that would make their way to the fund (limiting input tax credits and charging GST on all managed fund services) as the New Zealand economy moves into a “post COVID-19” period where saving and investing more generally will become difficult. Overall the Group prefers Option Four, zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism. This would not be seen as an expansion to zero-rating, but reducing the compliance cost of managed fund providers. This would also have the effect to reduce the cost of the service provided to customers, which the Group considers an important matter given the current economic environment and the reduced capability New Zealanders will have to save and invest. As noted above given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty in finding the Option Two: All management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers are exempt. Option Three: Deem a percentage to be exempt (and the remainder taxable). Option Four: Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism. Not in scope CTG – GST issues paper 15 May 2020 Page 13 of 17 CTGCTG correct treatment across different fund structures, any changes should be carefully considered and there should be an appropriate transition period. In addition the Group notes the zero rated option should be progressed as it creates neutrality between GST on management fees for superannuation funds, retirement funds and other managed funds. This option also removes the bias between insourcing and outsourcing of services for fund managers as it would allow inputs to be claimed for outsourced services. Changes to apply prospectively but with grandparenting of existing contracts for a period (for example, three years) to ease adjustment costs and to enable new contracts to be negotiated. The Group supports this proposal. The application date of any changes needs to allow sufficient time for the industry to adjust / amend its processes and contracts for the new position (the paper suggests a three year grandparenting period). Defining the relevant management and investment management services. The Group agrees with this proposal as this definition will likely be required regardless of the option (as listed above) that is taken. The Group notes that the definitions should be broad based and simple, written in plain English. No change to the GST treatment of other services provided to managed funds such as accounting, administrative or registry services. The Group agrees with this proposal.

The issues paper contains a number of proposed amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to reflect changing business practices, advances in technology, and developments in GST case law. As a general comment, we support the continued maintenance and development of GST law and policy to keep pace with these changes. The proposals contained in the issues paper touch on many areas of current uncertainty in the law and address unintended gaps in the current law. We have summarised our submissions in Appendix A. We provide our more detailed comments in relation to the proposals contained in the issues paper below. PUB-009 Not in scope 8 6307399\_2 Chapter 7: Managed funds We support the proposal to provide a more certain and consistent GST treatment for manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. Ultimately the GST costs are borne by the retail investors and it is important that the rules do not create distortions between the fees charged by different managers as a result of their particular operating model. What are the pros, cons or practical issues associated with each of the policy options? How well would they achieve the policy objectives? Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers taxable supplies This option is fundamentally inconsistent with the GST exclusion for financial services and would result in increased fees for retail investors, which is undesirable. Exempting all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund managers This option addresses the current bias between retirement savings schemes and other non-retirement funds. However, it creates a bias against funds that outsource significant parts of their management services. One solution could be to exempt all management services but allow managers that outsource the majority of their services (over a set threshold) to elect to zero rate their management fees, mitigating the additional GST cost suffered by those predominantly outsourced managers. Legislate that managers and investment managers are deemed to have a certain percentage of taxable (subject to GST at 15%) and exempt supplies This is closest to the current practice applied by a significant portion of the industry which applies the existing agreement between the Financial Services Council (FSC) and Inland Revenue. The principal difficulty is determining the correct proportion of taxable and non-taxable supplies. Given operating model differences within the sector this percentage will then seldom result in the correct apportionment for individual fund managers. Not in scope 9 6307399\_2 Zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit mechanism Zero rating of all fund management services (including retirement schemes) would achieve two important policy objectives, namely minimising costs to retain investors and creating a level playing field within the funds management sector. It also provides certainty and the lowest compliance burden of all of the options proposed. A reduced input tax credit mechanism is likely to add significant additional compliance costs and as noted in the issues paper it is difficult to determine the appropriate percentage of recoverable GST (similar to the partial exemption option). What types of manager and investment manager services should the proposed policy or law change apply to? What is the clearest way to define the relevant services? Whether services are investment management services or some other class of administration service is a factual question and will vary depending on the legal agreements and nature of the services provided. If the law was changed, what transitional issues could arise and what measures could be implemented to enable a smooth transition to the new law? We agree with the proposal to allow grandparenting for existing contracts to ease adjustment costs and enable new contracts to be negotiated. The grandparenting arrangement should be broad enough to take into account the foreseen delays in negotiating new contracts (i.e. some existing contracts may need to be extended under the old rules to allow time for commercial negotiations).

Not in scope Not in scope 11 th May 2020 Mr David Carrigan Deputy Commissioner, Policy & Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Dear David Submission on GST policy issues paper On behalf of UniSaver Limited I welcome the opportunity to make a submission on the recently released GST policy issues paper. This submission focusses on the options set out in Chapter 7 (Managed Funds) with respect to the GST treatment of services provided to managed funds by fund and investment managers. UniSaver is an employer-sponsored registered superannuation scheme established in 1993. Membership of the scheme is available to all permanent and eligible fixed-term employees of participating New Zealand universities and stands at as at 31 March 2020. Members’ balances stood at at that date. The scheme is the second largest restricted workplace scheme in New Zealand. UniSaver is of the view that a change to the GST regime resulting in fund and investment managers’ services provided to managed funds being taxable supplies would be undesirable and, given the impact on net investment returns, would run contrary to the government’s ongoing drive to encourage saving for retirement at the level of the individual level. Mercer (N.Z.) Limited PO Box 2897 Wellington 6140 Level 2 20 Customhouse Quay Wellington 6011 PUB-010 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(b)(ii) s 9(2)(b)(ii) s 9(2)(a) Specifically, concern arises from the proposed option set out in paragraphs 7.23 to 7.27: “Making all management services supplied by investment managers and other fund manages taxable supplies” and paragraph 7.26 expresses the concern explicitly. Applying GST to all management services supplied by fund and investment managers would indeed result in “higher fees and reduced after tax returns” for the scheme’s members as the UniSaver board, on the basis of good governance and sound practice, outsources management of the investment of the scheme to a professional funds manager. Put simply and directly, the scheme has no structures whereby UniSaver can pass GST on – the additional tax burden on would stop with scheme members. UniSaver submits that a zero-rating approach would be the most appropriate GST treatment of services provided to managed funds by fund and investment managers, such that investors do not bear a related GST cost. Although UniSaver prefers to see the zero-rating option implemented, UniSaver submits that the alternative outcome should be that fund and investment managers’ services are exempted from GST. That said, given that a GST-exempt approach is likely to see an increase in fees (and, therefore, a reduction in investment returns), this is not considered an ideal outcome.

Our submission focusses on the options set out in Chapter 7 (Managed Funds) with respect to the GST treatment of services provided to managed funds (such as the MISS Scheme) by fund and investment managers. The MISS Scheme is an employer-sponsored, restricted workplace savings scheme established on 31 July 1991. The MISS Scheme’s membership consists of employees who are engaged to work for companies which are members of the Meat Industry Association of New Zealand and other employers within the meat industry of New Zealand. There were about members in the MISS Scheme as at 31 March 2020, with aggregate balances of around . The MISS Scheme submits that the preferred outcome is that services provided to managed funds such as the MISS Scheme by fund and investment managers be zero-rated for GST purposes. In that way, an investor saving for their retirement does not bear a related GST cost. We consider that this is particularly important given the current, and likely long-term, impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on retirement savings. Zero-rating the fund and investment managers’ services would also be align with the government’s continuing initiatives for encouraging individuals to save for their retirement. While zero-rating the services in question is the preferred outcome, the MISS Scheme’s preferred alternative would be to exempt fund and investment managers’ services from GST. However, on the basis that that approach is likely to mean that fund and investment managers will increase their fees, which adversely affects investors’ retirement savings, the MISS Scheme does not consider a GST- exempt outcome to be ideal. Of particular concern to the Trustees is the option of making the management services provided by fund and investment managers taxable supplies for GST purposes. In particular, given the nature of the MISS Scheme, it is unable to register for GST. Further, for governance purposes, the MISS Scheme outsources the management services that would be subject to GST if a fully taxable approach were adopted. As such, and as set out in paragraph 7.26 of the paper, members will in effect be impacted with “higher fees and reduced after-tax returns”. On that basis, we submit that treating its services as taxable supplies is clearly inconsistent with encouraging individuals to save for their retirement and is undesirable given the adverse impact that it would have on investment returns and members’ retirement savings.

Overview The GST Issues Paper, Chapter 7, discusses policy options for changing the GST treatment of manger and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. It outlines the differing GST treatments currently adopted throughout the industry and seeks submissions on four possible GST treatments from industry participants. The Issues Paper also highlights the policy objectives to be taken into consideration when determining the most appropriate GST treatment for services supplied to managed funds, being: — Limiting the GST exemption for financial services; — Minimising any significant biases that GST may create; — Providing certainty of GST treatment; and — Minimising adjustment costs compared to current commercial practices. As noted above, TCA members welcome the initiative to undertake the review of the GST treatment of services provided to managed funds. However, in our view, there is a key element of this area of the industry that is not included in the GST Issues Paper and we now submit that it be considered and properly addressed. While the Issues Paper focuses on the GST treatment of services provided by investment managers and other fund managers, in practice, such services are often outsourced to a third party. The GST treatment for services provided to a managed fund (in particular a retirement scheme) by a third party must also be addressed if the policy objectives of the review are to be met. Specifically, the issue of the GST treatment of registry services (which includes unit pricing services, being a management requirement of a unitised scheme) provided to retirement schemes should be addressed at an industry level and included in the current review of GST treatment for managed funds. Registry services provided to retirement schemes have largely been interpreted by the industry as being exempt under s3(1)(j) of the GST Act, but to date this has not been able to be agreed with Inland Revenue. TCA Members have been corresponding on this matter with Inland Revenue for the past decade. Inland Revenue’s view regarding the GST treatment of these services is that it is exempt when performed inhouse but taxable when outsourced to a third party. The Inland Revenue’s interpretation of joining the definition of “manager” to that of “management” is inappropriate in an environment where outsourced services are becoming more prevalent. The GST treatment of a service should be determined by the nature of that service, not by the entity structure for delivery of that service. Further to the policy objectives noted in the Issues Paper, the financial impact on investors, retirement savings for New Zealanders and consistency of application of GST rules should also be taken into account when determining the most appropriate GST treatment of services provided to managed funds. There is no denying the immediate and ongoing impacts faced by investors as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of an additional GST impost on savings cannot be ignored. 4 9. GST treatment of registry services provided to a retirement s cheme T CA submits that the phrase “management of a retirement scheme” contained in section 3(1)(j) of the Goods and Services Act 1985 (“GST Act”) be applied consistently whether “management of a retirement scheme” is provided “in-house” or outsourced to an external provider. We note and emphasise that, in practice, there is no material difference in the management function provided depending on whether it is an “in-house” or outsourced management provider. In practice, registry services, such as unit pricing services (which is required for the management of a unitised scheme), is often outsourced to a third party rather than provided by the manager of a retirement scheme. Industry participants have largely interpreted and treated these services as being GST exempt under secti on 3(1)(j) of the GST Act. 9.1 Meaning of the term “financial services” As part of the review undertaken for the items noted in the GST Issues Paper, Chapter 7, we submit that the interpretation of the term “ financial services” be considered, with particular emphasis on whether it is the policy intent that the application of this definition differs based on whether that service is insourced or outsourced. In particular, we note that unit pricing services (which is required for the management of a unitised scheme) could well qualify for exemption under certain paragraphs of section 3. We provide our comments below: Meaning of the term “financial services” TCA comment 1 For the purposes of this Act, the term financial services means any 1 or more of t he following activities: a)the exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debit ing accounts, or otherwise): Inland Revenue has implied this section is only applicable to banks. d)The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or participatory security: There is a custodial element of registry which encompasses the transfer of ownership of an equity and could fall within the requirement of this paragraph. g)the renewal or variation of a debt security, equity security, participatory security, or credit contract: Unit pricing could be interpreted to fall as a variation to equity security. j)the provision, or transfer of ownership, of an interest in a retirement scheme, or the The current reliance for treating registry services as exempt is based on this paragraph. 5 management of a retirement scheme: ka) the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, retirement scheme, financial option, or futures contract: There is a custodial element of registry which encompasses the requirements of this paragraph. l)Agreeing to do , or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka), other than advising thereon: In our view, this subparagraph could serve to extend the application of subsection 3(1) of the Act to outsourced third party providers of the services covered by paragraphs (a) to (ka) of section 3(1). 9. 2 Meaning of “management of a retirement scheme” Based on our correspondences with Inland Revenue over the past decade, we understand that Inland Revenue interprets “management” as the ability to “control, supervise and oversee the retirement scheme”. Thus, it is only the Trustee (Statutory Supervisor) and fund manager that can “manage” a retirement scheme. On this basis, the management services provided by these entities (as well as other incidental “non-management” tasks performed by the Trustee and fund manager) would be exempt from GST under section 3(1)(j) of the GST Act. However, where these other tasks are performed by a person other than the Trustee and/or the fund manager, the services are not considered to be “management o f a retirement scheme” and, accordingly as considered by the IR, fully taxable. TCA considers that “management” should be determined by reference to the nature of the activities that are fundamental to the o peration of a retirement scheme rather than by the provider of those services. An activity is fundamental where the retirement scheme cannot function without that activity or its output. While TCA acknowledges that not all activities carried out in respect of a retirement scheme can constitute “management”, we consider that the position taken by Inland Revenue is too narrowly focussed in light of current industry practice. The full catalogue of discussions to date between TCA and Inland Revenue in respect of this matter is available upon request. 10 . Co nsistency in interpretation Inland Revenue has previously advised that the activities of a third party who supplies registry or fund accounting and unit pricing services are not management of a retirement scheme and, therefore, do not fall within the ambit of section 3(1)(j) of the GST Act. However, we counter this as section 3(1)(j) of the GST Act also encompasses “the provision, or transfer of ownership, of an interest in a retirement scheme” which is a fundamental element of a registry service and unit pricing activity. Additional registry services also include the elements of sections 3(1)(b) and 3(1)(ka) of the GST Act. 6 We note that Inland Revenue’s view to date has been that the supply of custodial services by a third party is a financial service under section 3(1)(c), (d), (ka) of the GST Act and, therefore, exempt from GST. In our view, this creates a mismatch in interpretation of the “management” of a retirement scheme as various functions that are fundamental to the operation of the retirement scheme have differing treatment for GST purposes. Further, this creates an “in-source bias” as the GST treatment differs where these services are provided by third parties. Uncertainty regarding the GST treatment a nd biases created by GST are two of the key policy objectives driving the GST review of this area of industry. 11 . Poli cy intent TCA understands the policy intent of section 3(1)(j) of the GST Act was to align the treatment of savings through life insurance and retirement vehicles. At the outset of the GST regime in New Zealand, industry practice meant that it was highly likely a single party would perform all activities necessary for the management of a retirement scheme. In our view, this does not mean that the policy intent was to necessarily exclude activities, but rather to treat these fundamental activities as included in “management of a retirement scheme” because it would not matter who performs the activity. However, as time has passed and the way savings vehicles are regulated, in practice, not all services necessary for the management of a retirement scheme are performed by the scheme’s manager or Trustee. Instead, for example, services such as registry are outsourced to third parties. Through our correspondence with Inland Revenue, they have advised that in this instance, the services do not constitute “management of a retirement scheme” and, therefore, must be treated as taxable. This is inconsistent with the policy intent of removing an in-source bias. We consider that it is illogical that management services provided by parties other than the Trustee and fund manager do not constitute “management of a retirement scheme” simply because these tasks are no longer performed by a single party (i .e. the manager of that scheme). Further, it is incorrect to conclude that it is only the manager of a scheme who can perform activities that constitute “management of a retirement scheme” . We submit that i t is preferable to have a consistent interpretation of “management” where it is irrelevant who performs the activity for the retirement scheme. 12 .Adverse impact on retirement savings Government policy is to encourage national savings, and this has been supported through the introduction of savings vehicles like KiwiSaver and reduction of compliance costs associated with long term investments. TCA notes that the inconsistent GST treatment of “management of a superannuation scheme” when in- sourced vs outsourced to a third party currently has, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the retirement savings sector. Based on Inland Revenue’s current interpretation of the term “management of a retirement scheme” under section 3(1)(j) of the GST Act, the GST treatment is not consistent for all service providers. TCA Members note that from a service provider perspective, the GST treatment is irrelevant (i.e. whether it be exempt or taxable), but rather it is the inconsistency amongst industry participants that: — creates a bias in the market; and 7 — results in an increase cost of savings for investors on the basis that the GST impost is passed on to investors. Through the differing application of GST on services provided to retirement schemes (i.e. in-house or via an external provider), the additional GST costs would be passed on to investors. At a time when investors are facing extreme financial pressure due to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the effects it has had on all global markets and economies, an increase in the cost of savings as a result of GST will adversely affect retirement savings for New Zealand investors. For this reason, we submit that the inconsistent GST treatment of “management of a retirement scheme” be included in the issues being reviewed as part of the GST Issues Paper and, in line with the policy objectives of reducing GST bias and providing certainty of GST treatment, be addressed for all retirement savings industry participants. 13 .

Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand Inc 22 May 2020 s 9(2)(a) 1 Milford Asset Management Limited Date May 2020 Subject GST policy issues - GST on manager and investment manager services To GST Policy (policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz) Milford Asset Management Limited Submission: GST policy issues paper, dated February 2020. Milford is a NZ owned specialist investment firm which offers an extensive range of investment services and products, including KiwiSaver and other managed investment funds. This submission relates specifically to ‘Chapter 7 – Managed funds’ on policy options for changing the GST treatment of manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. A/ Our recommendation Chapter 7 of the GST policy paper sets out several options for how GST could apply to manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds. Inevitably, selecting the best option will require a trade-off between different policy objectives. As a general starting point, we recommend that Officials’ base their decision on the following key principles. Key Principles 1.Growing the long-term savings of New Zealanders Milford is a strong supporter and advocate for the continued promotion and growth of New Zealanders longer-term savings. This is a fundamental policy that needs continued support. Since its introduction, KiwiSaver has been hugely successful in fostering a savings culture and mindset for New Zealanders (a metaphorical shot in the arm), with c. $60bn in savings (and almost 3 million investors), which will grow exponentially over the coming decades. For a variety of reasons, many New Zealanders also choose to save in non-retirement managed funds, for example, because they wish to access a product type which is not available within KiwiSaver or because they require more flexibility to draw on their savings. We are concerned that any policy changes that have the effect of directly or indirectly increasing the cost to investors on their savings (whereby all or some of the additional GST impost is passed onto investors) will ultimately impact investor returns through higher fees and could therefore undo some of the progress made to date in promoting New Zealand’s savings culture. In addition, it has the potential to lead to the unintended promotion of poor investor behaviour and outcomes. We acknowledge that there is likely to be a trade-off between the policy objective of having a broad-based GST system with very few exemptions versus the objective of encouraging a savings and investment culture in New Zealand. For example, while making all investment management services fully taxable supplies (Option 1 in the Issues Paper) is consistent with a broad-based GST system, we believe this is the worst outcome for growing investment and savings in New Zealand. This could have the effect of distorting investment decisions where New Zealanders either choose not to save, or they choose to save through direct investment and forgo the benefits of investing collectively through a managed fund. In contrast, it is typically tax incentives (not disincentives) that other jurisdictions across the globe have implemented to help further promote their superannuation and savings policy objectives. PUB-01 2 Finally, it is important to consider fairness and “vertical equity” by ensuring any change does not impact lower income earners more severely. KiwiSaver has been a huge success in increasing the savings culture among New Zealander in the lower- and middle-income brackets. Since GST is a regressive tax, any introduction of GST on services to retirement schemes would be particularly unwelcome. 2.Consistency of GST treatment among different providers, operating models and investment products The Issues Paper acknowledges the existing distortions between the GST treatment adopted by different investment managers depending on their product type, operating model or interpretation of the law. Ideally, there should be consistency in the GST rules applicable to different providers of discretionary investment management services irrespective of: (a)Their product type (e.g., KiwiSaver funds, non-KiwiSaver unit trust funds or discretionary investment management services (DIMs)); or (b)Their operating model (i.e., whether they insource or outsource services). The status quo where investment managers can effectively choose which GST rules to apply (provided they are consistent in their chosen method) creates inefficient and inequitable outcomes in our view. 3.Certainty and simplicity Certainty for the industry is key to enabling sustainable planning and more informed decision making. Milford would welcome a swift resolution to Government’s position in relation to the ongoing GST treatment of managed funds as this has been a long-standing industry issue. The zero-rating option (Option 4 in the Issues Paper) is attractive to the industry on the basis that investment fund managers could recover a larger portion of GST on their outsourced costs without passing on GST to managed funds and their investors. However, we are very mindful of the fiscal cost of this option, particularly given the current environment and the scale of Government spending in relation to New Zealand’s response to Covid-19. We are also concerned that it may not be possible to legislate without a more comprehensive review of New Zealand’s GST treatment of all financial services. Ideally, the chosen option would be simple and cost effective for the industry to apply and for investors to understand. Recommendation: Treat all discretionary investment management services as GST exempt supplies Based on the first key principle above, our strong recommendation is that the Government should not make investment management services 100% taxable supplies. Milford’s preference is one of the remaining options. On balance, we think treating all discretionary management services as GST exempt supplies is the best option, irrespective of whether those services are provided to a retirement fund, a non-retirement fund or directly to an investor via a DIMs mandate. This is on the basis that: •Treating all discretionary investment management services as GST exempt is consistent with the promotion of a long-terms savings culture in New Zealand. •This option ensures consistency across different providers and products and therefore removes the risk of poor investor behaviour where investment decisions are based on taxation as opposed to suitability. •This option is simple and cost effective. In particular, GST related administration time and costs should be reduced as investment managers will not be required to apportion their costs between taxable and exempt supplies, and some providers may be able to deregister for GST entirely. •The fiscal cost for New Zealand should be lower than zero-rating or a reduced input credit approach and therefore we would expect this option could be legislated sooner, thereby removing the existing uncertainty within the industry. It is worth noting the GST inconsistency for outsourced functions such as registry, unit pricing and fund administration and the potential bias towards “insourcing”. These functions are currently outsourced by 3 many providers and this is an operating model that is endorsed by the FMA. We would support any changes to investment manager services being consistently applied to these functions also. B/ Milford’s preferred options with pros and cons In the table below, we have summarised Milford’s preferred options in descending order together with the pros and cons of each option. Policy options Pros Cons Exempt •Promotes NZ’s saving culture •Aligns non-retirement schemes and DIMs with retirement schemes •Removes bias and potential for poor customer outcomes •No additional cost for investors •Lower fiscal impact •Certainty •Fund managers ability to claim GST on outsourced fund services Zero-rated / Reduced input credit •Promotes NZ’s saving culture •Fund managers can claim full or partial GST •No additional cost for investors •The potential for alignment across products •Certainty •Fiscal cost •Inconsistency with other financial services provided to retail investors •Likelihood of prolonged consultation and ongoing uncertainty 10% taxable supplies •Savings culture unlikely to be harmed •Less bias if retirement schemes remain exempt compared to 100% taxable supplies •No industry change for some providers already using this option •Would need to be legislated and better enforced to ensure consistency across different providers •Degree of certainty •Unlikely to be material cost to investors •Less certainty than the options above •Inconsistent application of the rules by different providers •Small cost to investors if passed on •Potential misalignment with retirement schemes Taxable supplies •Fund managers can claim full GST on outsourced services •Likely shift the tax/cost burden to investors via increased fees which does not align with the promotion of New Zealand’s savings culture. •Non-alignment between products if retirement schemes remain exempt •Potential to create bias in investment decisions leading to poor customer outcomes •Government taxing its own KiwiSaver contributions if fund manager services to retirement schemes are fully taxable C/ Other questions for submitters While we haven’t specifically addressed the second and third questions in the Issues paper, we would expect additional consultation on the definitions of key terms and an appropriate length of time for providers to work through transitional issues should any new laws be enacted.

How well would they achieve the policy objectives? We consider the key items as follows: • There should be a common GST position for all participants providing management and investment management services in the managed funds industry • GST is a cost to the ultimate investors, for example KiwiSaver investors, as GST cannot be recovered by a managed fund • GST incurred by a fund manager may, in whole or in part, be passed on through manager fees if the manager is unable to recover GST it pays. Ultimate investors will bear any GST cost passed on in this way as well as GST charged to the fund • Regulations require a manager and a supervisor for each managed fund to ensure a separation of functions and duties to protect investor interests • Managers can and do engage other suppliers to provide services for the funds they manage. These existing contractual relationships differ depending on the manager and the services which are contracted and will vary from manager to manager • There is an inherent bias in the current New Zealand GST system to insourcing for financial services. However, managed funds do not typically have employees, it is the manager and others who have employees. This is for efficiency and regulatory reasons. The key concerns with GST and managed funds are the ultimate cost to investors and how to best deal with the insource bias inherent in the New Zealand GST system for financial services. There needs to be a level playing field across the industry and a tax position taken should not drive different commercial outcomes. Not in scope 5 Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz This submission supports the policy option of zero-rating however it also addresses some of the other options to give clarity on how they may achieve some of the policy objectives but are not preferred as they may also present problems. Zero-rating overcomes some of the issues that arise with the other proposed options, particularly in relation to apportionment. Funds management, investment management and supervision services are financial services for funds which invest in securities. The core function of these services is to arrange the buying and selling of securities in respect of a managed fund’s investments, namely an inherently GST exempt supply that could qualify for zero-rating for policy reasons. Zero -rating The FSC submits that the most appropriate GST treatment of fund management and investment management services provided to managed funds is to zero-rate them so that investors do not bear an increased cost resulting from a change in GST treatment (and the current commercial arrangements that have been implemented in the context of the current GST position). An increased cost is almost certain to arise from a move to fully taxable treatment (or an increase from the agreed 10% taxable component) in the form of GST borne directly by funds. A move to exempt treatment would result in an increased cost to fund managers in the form of irrecoverable GST, which may be passed on to investors. This is clearly not a good outcome for investors, particularly at the current time when Covid-19 has both had materially adverse impacts on investors’ savings and increased nervousness around the financial future for many. Zero rating also allows for existing structures and arrangements to continue with minimal disruption and it is a position that the whole of the industry can support. We note that the Inland Revenue considered the option of zero-rating financial services generally in some detail in the early 2000s. It was accepted the work justified the anti-cascading rules in section 11A(1)(q) (effective 1 January 2005), enabling a business to elect supplies to a registered person making taxable supplies to be zero-rated, rather than be GST exempt. Zero-rating also addresses the insource bias. This bias can normally be addressed by “in housing” services. However, it is not practical for managed funds to employ staff. Employees would need to have multiple employment contracts (one for each fund). Funds would need to be aggregated to be of a sufficient size to justify employing staff rather than an investment manager. However, this would remove the operational and economic benefits of the multiple funds (which the FSC anticipates could result in higher fees for investors). Further, some specialised skills and expertise are not available in New Zealand. Legislative alternatives to addressing the insource bias, for example a reduced input tax credit, have their own difficulties. Refer to our comment on reduced input tax credit mechanisms in this submission. Zero-rating would also align the position with investors carrying out these services themselves. A self-supply is not a supply and removing the GST on equivalent services deals with the self-supply bias. In addition, zero-rating of fund management/investment management services would also remove the tension that currently exists relating to services provided by specialist New Zealand based 6 Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz investment managers regarding whether their investment services involve “arranging” of financial services in respect of investment portfolio’s or provision of “advice” and identifying the portion subject to GST. There are fiscal implications from zero-rating, namely fund managers will be able to increase input GST. That should be offset in part by an increase in income tax paid by fund managers and the funds (whose GST cost will reduce) and any reduction in GST costs for fund managers will be factored into the future setting of manager fees and a reduction passed on where possible. While we have not quantified the impact, we expect that the total fiscal impact is not material, particularly in the context of support being provided currently to other industries in response to Covid-19. We submit that the benefits of zero-rating far outweighs the fiscal cost. Exempt financial services Whilst zero-rating is the preferred option of our members, treating these services as exempt supplies is a possible workable solution. However, it should also be noted that a possible outcome of exempt treatment is an increase in fees charged to investors as fund managers seek to recover the additional GST cost. This is not a desirable outcome for investors. Reduced input tax credit mechanism Fund managers will have their own insource problems and their ability to insource services will depend on their size. A reduced input tax credit (RITC) would go some ways to assist in addressing the insource bias and, if it applied for fund managers rather than the funds, reducing the compliance costs of a RITC. We note that in Australia, RITC requires the funds to register and claim the RITC. If the same was applied in New Zealand, a considerable amount of funds would need to register which is not a desired outcome for the industry nor the Inland Revenue. This compares to at least ten times less if licensed managers and financial service providers were required to register. A RITC does have design questions, namely the difficulty in ascertaining what is the correct level of cascading input tax that should be allowed for particular services. Accordingly, a proxy would need to be agreed which would not be “correct”, but it is a compromise that would need to be accepted. Deem a percentage to be exempt (and the remainder taxable) The FSC’s existing agreement with Inland Revenue treats part of the services as taxable. At the time of the agreement, fund managers were taking different positions and competing on the GST position. Inland Revenue was uncertain on the appropriate characterisation as the services include elements which might be considered taxable. The agreement was struck to reduce uncertainty and “GST competition”. The difficulty with a partly exempt, partly taxable solution is determining the “correct” apportionment. A fund by fund apportionment, which would likely be retrospective, would be compliance costly and uncertain. An agreed apportionment would provide certainty but would operate as a “toll” for those where the rate struck was too high. To operate as a viable solution the taxable proportion should be low but this option remains problematic. 7 Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz Services should not be fully taxable Maintaining the customer as the primary consideration, services should not be a fully taxable supply as investors will ultimately bear an increased GST cost for financial services. Funds, and services to funds, may need to undergo restructuring. If direct management of investment portfolios in New Zealand was reduced and funds were forced to invest in foreign collective investment vehicles this would also negatively impact economic activity in New Zealand. Defining the relevant management and investment management services The Paper proposes that the terms “manager”, “investment manager” and “managed investment scheme” could be defined by referencing the existing definitions of these terms in section 6(1) and section 9 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) and these definitions could be applied to confirm which services are subject to the future policy. Our members support linking definitions with the FMCA as this would enable definitions to be targeted to the types of taxpayers that Inland Revenue and industry intended to be captured by the proposal. Fund Managers will need to apply the definitions to the services that they and others provide to managed funds. They will need to determine which services are within the scope of the definition and which are not and which are provided to them and which to the fund (i.e. the manager pays for the service as agent for the fund). Depending on which model they apply, they may need to unbundle fees to ensure that only the manager and investment manager services are zero-rated. This is factored into our submission on the transition. It is recommended that any changes apply from 1 April 2022, being the start of financial year for most retail managed fund products. This would also seek to minimise the impact of other regulatory reporting obligations such as fund updates, enabling all fund managers to adopt the same GST status on the same date subsequently aiding fund comparisons. What types of manger and investment manager services should the proposed policy or law change apply to? What is the clearest way to define the relevant services? There are essentially two structures or models, the first being where the fund manager has a flat fee for all services and the other is where there is a management fee and direct charges are made to the fund. It would need to be made clear that zero-rating only applies to management fees and not bundled fees and the legislation would need to state precisely what is able to be zero rated. An apportionment methodology for bundled fees is required. That needs to be legislated so that there are clear rules. If the law was changed, what transitional issues could arise and what measures could be implemented to enable a smooth transition to the new law? We recommend that a grandfathering provision be put in place to ensure a smooth transition from existing arrangements to zero-rating and to ensure consistency across fund managers over time. A phased approach over the next three years would also ensure that compliance costs are manageable when the industry is experiencing significant change and strain as a result of Covid-19. Other than renegotiation of commercial contracts, the other transitional issue will be the updating of disclosure documents to clarify GST positions regarding fee and expense disclosures. 10 Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz Appendix One: Content of letter to IR, 23 May 2018 The FSC supports either the 10% or exempt options as viable options. However, we consider that legislating the status quo of GST on 10% of unit trust manager’s fees for management services to unit trusts and 10% of investment management fees for direct and indirect services provided by investment managers is likely to be the better option. This would have the least impact on the industry’s current practices and the tax revenue (GST, income tax and employment-related taxes) collected by Inland Revenue. This should also apply to out of fund fees. Out of fund fees refer to the scenario where a fund invests into another wholesale fund that is managed by another manager, but the management fee of that other manager is invoiced directly to the manager of the fund (rather than charged to the wholesale fund). This occurs to ensure that there is no duplication of investment management fees. We consider that GST should not incentivise any change to this approach. We have accordingly, referred to the indirect provision of the services to cover this. In considering a possible definition of investment management services to which the GST on 10% of investment management fees should apply, we looked at the legislative definition of services that would qualify for exemption could be based on the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) requirements and associated guidelines for licensing and regulation of outsourcing of investment management services by fund managers. There is precedent for using the FMCA in the Goods and Services Act 1985 (GST Act), for example, “retirement scheme” in section 3 is defined by reference to section 6(1) of the FMCA. It should align the tax policy with regulatory treatment so that any use of the amendment is “controlled”. In other words, if a taxpayer takes a position that the service is within the new definition, the service can be expected to be regulated either directly (as regulation applies to the provider) or indirectly (as regulation applies through the regulation of outsourcing by a regulated provider). We note that some managers outsource certain services (excluding investment management services) on behalf of a fund. The GST is therefore incurred by the fund and not the manager. It is not intended that the proposed definitions would change that result. We appreciate that it is likely that this initial suggestion will need to be modified as the policy process develops. 25 May 2020 Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department by email FROM: DIRECT: MOBILE: EMAIL: REF: SUBMISSIONS ON GST POLICY ISSUES — AN OFFICIALS’ ISSUES PAPER 1 Thank you for the opportunity to provide submissions on the Inland Revenue (IR) Officials¶ Issues Paper on GST polic\\ issues (the Paper).

PUB-016 Not in scope s 9(2)(a) 092675749/7780675.6 3 Managed Funds Proposed changes to GST for manager and investment manager services supplied to managed funds 15 We agree that the current position is complex and is applied in an inconsistent way across the industry. A change that simplifies the position and is able to be applied consistently would be welcome. We consider that the guiding principles when determining the preferred approach should be as follows: a. To minimise adverse impact on investors that could arise from either an increase in GST directly borne by funds or an increase in management fees reflecting increased GST burden on fund managers. We see this as particularly important in the current environment with recent reduction in savings balances and increased uncertainty in respect of future economic conditions. b. Provide a level playing field for fund managers, so that those more able to pass on increased costs (or better able to in-source) are not in a favoured commercial position as a result of a tax law change. 16 Having regard to the above principles, we consider the preferred option for addressing management services provided to managed funds should be to treat those services as zero-rated supplies. 17 At paragraph 7.46 officials note that compared to the other policy options either zero-rating or a reduced input tax credit would mean investment manager services would be substantially undertaxed. We question Zhether the level of ³underta\[ing ́ would in fact be material. In any event, in a time where many other industries are receiving material support from the Government, a strong case can be made that the benefits of zero-rating exceed the costs.

This report seeks final policy decisions on a suitable transition period before the agreed policy changes to the GST treatment of manager fees charged to managed funds (including KiwiSaver schemes) takes effect. Attached to this report is a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement for the policy changes. 2. This report follows on from your decision in April to impose GST on fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds (IR 2022/152, T2022/848 refers). The policy changes will apply a consistent GST treatment of 15% GST on fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds. 3. The key outstanding decision is regarding when the policy changes should take effect (the application date). This report provides advice on either a 1 April 2025 (24-month) or 1 April 2026 (36-month) application date after enactment, likely to be before 1 April 2023. 4. As noted in the earlier report, for many fund managers and investment managers, adopting the new rules will impose significant transition costs on them, at a time where they are already facing transition costs for other high priority regulatory changes. 5. The fiscal impacts of the decision on application date depends on the chosen transitional period. Assuming a two-year transition period, the likely increase in revenue from this change would be approximately $34 million in 2024/25 and $225 million in 2025/26, with the revenue impact growing by approximately 10% per annum going forward. With a three-ye ar implementation period, the revenue impact has a similar size and profile, but is delayed by a year. Rather than immediately recognising the impact on Budget allowances, we recommend providing further advice on this as part of the development of the Budget Policy Statement later this year. 6. If you agree with the recommended option of 1 April 2026 following enactment, we recommend you approve the attached Cabinet paper and lodge it with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 16 June 2022 for consideration at the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV Committee) meeting on Wednesday 22 June 2022. If you agree to an application date of 1 April 2025, we will provide your office with a revised draft Cabinet paper as soon as possible. 7. Once Cabinet approval has been obtained, the legislative amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation bill currently scheduled for introduction in August 2022. Background 8. On 12 April 2022, we reported to you on the issue of how GST should apply to fund manager and investment manager services provided to KiwiSaver schemes and other managed funds (IR2022/152, T2022/848 refers). IR2022/240; T2022/1190: Cabinet paper – GST on fees charged to managed funds Page 1 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. The report outlined the problem that the current GST treatment of these manager services can vary, with some being inconsistent with current GST laws and potentially distorting market competition. 10. The report provided advice on two different policy options: 10.1 Retain the status quo and legislate to allow for the current practices to continue (100% exempt, 90% exempt/10% taxable, or 100% taxable treatment). The Financial Services Council (who represents large fund managers) preferred this option. 10.2 Making these services subject to 15% GST. A group of boutique fund managers preferred this option. 11. We recommended the option to subject the fees to 15% GST, as it would reduce compliance costs, improve integrity, and ensure consistency across the industry. However, the option would lead to higher fees for savers, such as KiwiSaver members, and would impose significant transitional costs. 12. You agreed to subject these fees to 15% GST and agreed in principle to an adequate transitional period (such as 24-36 months after enactment) to mitigate the transitional costs. Key concerns raised by stakeholders 13. As explained in the earlier report, the decision to impose 15% GST on fund manager and investment manager fees charged to managed funds will have several adverse impacts. 14. We expect that charging more GST to managed funds will increase the fees charged to retail investors, including KiwiSaver members. To the extent the fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and, ultimately, future retirement balances 1 . 15. Alongside this, stakeholders have recently suggested the proposed changes may encourage an unintended behavioural change in some managed funds, in that they may relocate their funds offshore to avoid incurring GST on the manager fees charged to the fund. This is because GST is not collected on services supplied to offshore domiciled funds, which a New Zealand based fund can then invest into. 16. While it is difficult to measure the behavioural impact, the effect of this would be less GST collected over time. Given the likely transition costs of establishing and domiciling an existing New Zealand managed fund in another country, or to reinvest a managed fund into an overseas fund, we believe it is unlikely a significant number of managed funds will relocate outside New Zealand in the short-to -medium term. Application date 17. As noted in the earlier report (IR2022/152, T2022/848 refers), the decision to impose 15% GST would impose significant transition costs for affected 2 fund managers and investment managers. For many of these financial institutions, they are already being required to implement many other regulatory changes, such as the climate reporting disclosures, introduction of the Conduct of Financial Institutions regime, and proposed changes to anti-money laundering rules. 1 Management fees are set as a percentage of the fund member’s total balance. 2 Those fund managers and investment managers that are required to transition from a 100% exempt or 90% exempt/10% taxable, to 100% taxable and applying 15% GST to all fees. IR2022/240; T2022/1190: Cabinet paper – GST on fees charged to managed funds Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. Of the transitional costs incurred 3 , the changes to the IT systems (often involving multiple layers of legacy IT systems) are likely to require the most time to prepare and implement the changes, especially for funds owned by banks. This issue is compounded because these financial institutions already have several new high priority regulatory programmes and regimes to implement in the short term 4 . 19. To ensure it is viable for funds and service providers to implement the new GST rules, while minimising the transition costs (as these costs will likely be passed onto fund members, including KiwiSaver members), a reasonable transition period is required. Stakeholder views 20. Stakeholders have mixed views on the time required to implement the new GST rules. The Financial Services Council have previously told us that impacted service providers and managed funds would require a three-to-five-year transition period, whereas other service providers and funds, who are largely unaffected by the changes, have told us they would expect it would require less time for the industry to implement the new rules. 21. Officials from both the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) have recommended a minimum 3- year transition period. They’ve told us the scope and pace of regulatory change is already being raised as a significant issue by the NZ financial service industry. We are unable to accurately determine whether the industry has excess capacity to absorb additional regulatory change, in the short-to -medium term. 22. MBIE and FMA note that for larger fund managers, they are facing a significant number of regulatory changes in several areas over the next few years, including banking and insurance regulations, financial advice and cash system changes. The nature of any regulatory change means their business-as -usual operations are disrupted, including their ability to invest and deliver their own product and service innovations that usually benefit their consumers. 23. Previous tax policy changes involving the banking and financial industries have generally had an implementation period of up to two years after enactment, however some projects have grandparented existing rules for up to five years. Each change and the transition period required have been considered on its merits. 24. Given both MBIE and FMA recommendations align with the industry’s view that the new rules change would require minimum three years to implement, it does suggest that a shorter time period would place additional risk, pressure and cost on affected managers and funds to deliver the required changes. Fiscal impact of transitional period options 25. Other than transition costs, the main trade-off between a two-year transition period and a three-year transition period is that a two-year transition period would start collecting additional GST revenue one year earlier. This results in more revenue falling within the forecast period if a shorter transition period is agreed. 26. The fiscal impact of these options should be considered in light of your wider fiscal and policy objectives. 3 These transition costs include IT systems, appoint new service providers or renegotiate commercial contracts, update investor disclosure statements, prepare public communications, and responding to increased contacts from customers. 4 Including climate reporting disclosures, changes to the anti-money laundering rules, and the introduction of the conduct of financial institutions regime (CoFI). IR2022/240; T2022/1190: Cabinet paper – GST on fees charged to managed funds Page 3 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendation 27. In light of this combination of factors, Inland Revenue recommends you approve an application date of 1 April 2026, providing an approximately three-year transition period after enactment (likely to before 1 April 2023). 28. Treasury also agrees that a three-year transition period is likely to minimise transition costs for industry on the basis of advice from MBIE and the FMA, but notes that doing so would reduce the revenue gained in the forecast period by around $220 million. It therefore considers it a more balanced judgement based on whether you weight minimising those transition costs or realising a near-term fiscal benefit more highly. 29. While a three-year transition period is longer than many other tax policy changes that impose implementation costs on affected stakeholders, there are precedents for transition costs involving the banking and financial sector to be considered on their individual merits. These include the 2021 unclaimed monies changes providing a two-year transition period (subject to Inland Revenue approval), 2018 BT investment income changes providing a two-year transition period and the 2010 life insurance reforms were subject to various transitional rules for up to five years. Financial implications 30. Since our earlier report, we have further developed our fiscal forecast, including incorporating updated managed fund data and revised assumptions. Further advice is also provided on managing the fiscal impacts against forecasts and allowances. 31. Assuming a two-year transition period, the likely increase in revenue from this change is now $34 million in 2024/25 and $225 million in 2025/26, with the revenue impact growing by approximately 10% per annum going forward. With a three-year implementation period, the revenue impact has a similar size and profile, but is delayed by a year. 32. We will immediately recognise the impact on tax forecasts if Cabinet agrees to the policy change. However, we propose to advise on whether to recognise any allowance impacts as part of the process of setting Budget allowances through the Budget Policy Statement. That would allow the allowance impacts of this and other tax policy changes to be consider in aggregate, alongside other economic and fiscal considerations. New data 33. We have updated our forecast model using recently published Financial Markets Authority managed fund data, for the quarter ending 31 December 2021. Revised assumptions 34. Currently, some fund managers and investment managers can only claim a certain proportion of the GST incurred on their expenses because most of the fees charged are GST exempt. We believe the remaining unclaimed GST is instead being incurred as a business cost to the manager and consequently charged as higher fees to the managed fu nd. 35. Under the new rules, managers will be able to claim back all of their GST incurred on their expenses. These additional GST deductions will offset against the GST charged on the fees, resulting in less GST paid to the Crown. The forecast now includes an assumption that managers incur taxable inputs of 20% of the value of the fees they provide to the funds. This assumption was informed by financial IR2022/240; T2022/1190: Cabinet paper – GST on fees charged to managed funds Page 4 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] information contained in the 2021 annual report of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation. 36. In addition, the original forecasts assumed a 10% per annum growth rate in the value of the affected management fees, which is conservative compared to the 20 % per annum growth rate observed between 2018 and 2021. However, the new forecast now assumes a lower 5% growth rate for 2022 to reflect the fact that managed funds have generally experienced strongly negative investment returns for the first four months of 2022. 5 After 2022, a 10% per annum growth rate for fees is assumed. 37. The result of these new assumptions is the additional GST revenues that the proposal would collect have been revised downward, compared to our earlier advice. Application date 38. As explained above, we are recommending an application date of 1 April 2026 (36- month transition period). If you agree to this application date, the additional GST will be collected from 1 April 2026 (2025/26). However, if you decide to proceed with an application date of 1 April 2025 (24-month transition period), then the additional GST collected will begin from 1 April 2025 (2024/25). 39. With a 1 April 2026 application date (Inland Revenue, Financial Markets Authority and MBIE recommendation), o ur current best estimate of the fiscal impact of the changes are the revenue gains shown in the following table: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 Tax Revenue ---37.0 247.0 Total operating ---(37.0) (247.0) 40. As noted above, the revenue impact in outyears would likely grow by approximately $30 million each year. 41. However, if you decide to proceed with a 1 April 2025 application date, our current best estimate of the fiscal impact of the changes are the revenue gains shown in the following table: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 Tax Revenue --34.0 225.0 247.0 Total operating --(34.0) (225.0) (247.0) 42. The same assumptions about the likely growth in the revenue impact would apply regardless of the application date. Projected over ten years, the additional GST collected in the 2031/32 fiscal year is approximately $400 million, with the revenue impact of the change growing beyond this period. 5 The total value of funds under management is still expected grow during 2022 and future years because of regular contributions to the managed funds exceed withdrawals. IR2022/240; T2022/1190: Cabinet paper – GST on fees charged to managed funds Page 5 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Managing against forecasts and allowances 43. There are various options for managing the fiscal impact of these changes, regardless of the application date chosen. 44. Officials recommend not immediately recognising any impact on Budget allowances as a result of this change. Additional tax revenue could allow Ministers to increase spending, pay down debt, or reduce taxes in other areas. We propose to advise on these broader choices as part of development of the Budget Policy Statement later this year, and will incorporate the fiscal impacts of this and other tax policy changes into that advice. This approach is consistent with how fiscally significant tax policy changes have been treated previously. 45. 46. s 9(2)(f)(iv) Consultation 47. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Financial Markets Authority were consulted on the Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement, including the impacts on investors and the proposed transitional period. Next steps 48. We have attached a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement that reflects the recommendations in this and the April 2022 reports. 49. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, we recommend you approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 16 June 2022, for consideration at Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s meeting on Wednesday 22 June 2022. If you agree to an application date of 1 April 2025, we will provide your office with a revised draft Cabinet paper as soon as possible. 50. If Cabinet agree to the policy changes, amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 could be included in the upcoming omnibus tax bill which is scheduled for introduction in August 2022.

This report seeks your direction on both the timing of consultation and the timeline for making final policy decisions (and for the resulting legislation). This report also seeks your agreement on which options to include in the consultation document in respect of a small number of design issues. Clarifying the scope of the consultation early on would allow officials to concentrate their efforts on second-order decisions and help focus submissions on areas where consultation is likely to be most helpful. The key decisions covered in this report are: • Treatment of denied interest deductions when property is sold. Cabinet has already agreed that officials will consult on whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred if the taxpayer is not a property developer but is taxed on the disposal of their property under the bright-line test or another land sale rule. Officials seek guidance on the range of options to be included in the discussion document. • Interest allocation approach. This is the method by which taxpayers work out which interest deductions are impacted. Officials recommend that tracing be the approach generally used for all taxpayers (whether a company or not). This approach means that the limitation of interest deductions depends on whether the borrowed funds are used for residential property purposes. It also means that businesses borrowing for non-residential property purposes are unaffected by the rules, even if the borrowing is secured over a residential property. However, there are integrity and fairness issues with the tracing approach. There are other possible options set out in the Appendix. Officials seek agreement as to what methods should be included in the consultation. • Application to widely held companies. Officials recommend applying the rules to all close companies and only “residential land-rich” widely held companies. This would ensure that companies holding small amounts of residential land incidental to their primary business are unaffected by the rules. This approach means interest deductions of retirement village operators could be denied, depending on how broadly a “residential land-rich” company is defined, unless there is an exception for them. 1 Officials seek clarification on what should be included in the consultation. Recommended action We recommend that you: 1 Retirement villages are already carved-out from application of the bright-line rule under the definition of “residential land” and this approach could be replicated for the interest denial rule.

Felicity Barker Chris Gillion Team Leader Policy Lead The Treasury Inland Revenue Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 s 9(2)(a) IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 1. This report seeks joint Ministers’ agreement on a proposed approach for consulting with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal that was announced on 23 March, as well as seeking direction on the timeframe for making final policy design decisions and legislative options. 2. This report also seeks your agreement on which options officials will consult on for the interest limitation proposal regarding: 2.1 the treatment of interest deductions when the property is sold, 2.2 the interest allocation approach, and 2.3 the application of the rules to widely held companies. 3. Officials intend to put forward “proposed” approaches on the above topics in a consultation document and invite submissions on the details of how those approaches will be applied. 4. Officials will report to you subsequently on a possible policy framework to help guide other important design decisions for the interest limitation proposal. Background 5. On 8 March 2021, Cabinet agreed in-principle to limit deductions for interest incurred to earn income from residential property (CAB-21-Min-0045 refers). Cabinet also directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. 6. Officials propose that the public consultation document on the interest limitation proposal is released in late May 2021, or shortly thereafter. Given the timeframes involved and the fact that some key design decisions will impact many second-order design decisions, it would be useful to get some key design decisions agreed and thereby reduce the number of issues out for consultation. 7. Limiting the scope of the consultation document in this way would allow officials to concentrate their efforts on second-order decisions and can help focus submissions on areas where consultation is likely to be most helpful. Consultation and Timing Timing of consultation 8. Officials are currently drafting a consultation document and propose providing you this consultation document in late May for release soon after. Cabinet directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. We propose to allow six weeks for submissions on the consultation document. 9. Officials also propose beginning consultation now. There are a wide range of interested and affected stakeholders that we are interested in engaging with. We will be leveraging off the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development’s industry and interest group networks to ensure we reach those stakeholders. 10. We propose to adopt a similar approach to consulting on the design of the rules for interest deductibility as we did when designing the temporary loss carry back rules last year (in response to Covid-19). Under this approach we established a group of tax experts to assist in the technical design of the rules. The benefit of this approach is that we involve practitioners in promptly designing rules that are effective and IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] simple to implement. This expert group will be formed and consulted prior to the consultation document to help inform its contents. Timing for decision making 11. After considering submissions on the consultation document, we will report to you with final policy recommendations. The amount of time allowed for consultation will determine when we can report back to you and when final policy decisions will need to be made. If officials’ proposed timing is adopted (with six weeks of consultation), we will be able to report back to you in early September 2021 and expect that final policy decisions will be made by Cabinet on 4 October 2021. 12. This proposed timeline for making final decisions would mean that the design of the measure to limit interest deductions for residential property will not be public until after the date from which the measure begins denying deductions (1 October 2021). While tax returns that deny interest deductions will not be filed until after 31 March 2022, this uncertainty around the policy at 1 October 2021 may cause concern for some residential property investors. 13. Officials can discuss alternative timeframes for consultation and decision making with you if you wish. However, in order to have decisions on design details be made public by 1 October, there will likely need to be a reduction in time for consultation, which could harm the design of the policy. Legislative vehicle 14. Officials’ preferred timeframe for making final decisions is later than the originally planned introduction of the annual rates omnibus tax Bill (AR Bill) that also must be enacted by 31 March 2022. There are three options to have the contents of the AR Bill and the housing proposals enacted by 31 March 2022. 15. Option 1 is to introduce the AR Bill, as originally planned, on 31 August 2021 and include the housing proposals via a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) on 14 October 2021. This is officials’ preference for the following reasons: 15.1 It maintains a full 6-week FEC submission period for both the AR Bill content and the housing proposals. 15.2 It allows the bulk of the AR Bill FEC submissions to be considered in advance of the housing FEC submissions closing – this frees up resources to consider housing submissions in a shortened timeframe. 15.3 Within the shortened timeframes of all three options, it provides the lowest risk of significant errors in the FEC process. 15.4 It minimises the resource commitment of the FEC and Parliament who will only need to consider a single bill. 16. Option 2 is to introduce the AR Bill, as originally planned, on 31 August 2021 with a separate bill for the housing proposals introduced on 19 October. This follows similar timelines to option 1 but has three main differences which, on balance, make it officials’ second preference: 16.1 It removes a perception risk that the housing proposals are being introduced by SOP which could (incorrectly) be viewed as reducing the opportunity for consultation. 16.2 Due to the longer process for the Government to approve the introduction of a bill compared with Ministers releasing an SOP under delegated authority, there will be more decisions to be made by Ministers and less time to consider those decisions. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16.3 It will require FEC to consider two tax bills, rather than one, during February 2022 and Parliament to consider two tax bills, rather than one, to pass through all remaining stages during March 2022. 17. Option 3 is to delay the introduction of the AR Bill so that the housing proposals can be included before it is introduced on 19 October. This avoids any negative perception issues with using an SOP and minimises FEC and house time. However, it has a number of significant risks and drawbacks so is not recommended. These include: 17.1 Even if officials provide you with the Bill the day after the housing policy is agreed by Cabinet, there will only be 12 days for you to consider the Bill, consult with Caucus, lodge the Bill with the Cabinet office and have it agreed by Cabinet. This is the same timeline for approval of a housing Bill under option 2 but the content of the Bill will be much larger. 17.2 This timeline assumes the Bill can complete its first reading on the first possible date of 26 October. If this is not completed, FEC submissions will not close until 22 December. This will make points 17.3 and 17.4 below worse. 17.3 FEC submissions are planned to close on 8 December. This only provides officials with approximately 8 weeks, including Christmas, to consider all submissions (including late submissions), reach agreement with the Independent Advisor to FEC, finalise the officials’ report and prepare near- final revision tracked legislation. This is significantly shorter than previous omnibus tax bills and, despite officials’ best efforts, is likely to result in a number of errors, particularly as we expect there will be a large number of submissions on the housing measures in the Bill. 17.4 This significantly shorter consultation period is likely to create a perception that the Government and officials are not taking the FEC consultation period seriously as the short timeframe is likely to result in insufficient time to consider and respond to submissions resulting in the reported back version being more similar to the introduction version than would occur under normal timeframes. 18. The relevant dates for each option are shown in Table 1 on the following page. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Table 1. Timeframes under three legislative options Option 1 Aug intro/Oct SOP (1 st preference) Option 3 Two Bills (2 nd preference) Option 2 Oct intro (not recommended) AR Bill provided to Minister 5 August 2021 5 August 2021 6 October 2021 AR Bill approved by CAB (intro next day) 30 August 2021 30 August 2021 18 October 2021 Housing Bill provided to Minister 6 October 2021 Housing SOP released 14 October 2021 Housing Bill approved by CAB (intro next day) 18 October 2021 AR Bill submissions close 20 October 2021 20 October 2021 8 December 2021 Housing submissions close 1 December 2021 8 December 2021 FEC report back 3 March 2022 3 March 2022 (x2) 3 March 2022 Bill(s) enacted 31 March 2022 31 March 2022 (x2) 31 March 2022 Treatment of interest deductions when a property is sold 19. One of the questions for consultation agreed by Cabinet is how interest deductions that have been denied should be treated when the disposal of the property is taxed. One option that officials intend to consult on is allowing those deductions to offset any gain on sale that is taxable. 20. The case considered by Cabinet considers one situation where there are no untaxed gains but does not explicitly consider all such cases. Whenever income is fully taxed, there are grounds for considering allowing interest deductions on sale. The decision by Cabinet does not discuss situations where there are net losses on sale or where there are tax-free capital gains but these are smaller than the interest deductions that have been denied. A question for you is whether you want the consultation document to consider the treatment of interest deductions when there are net losses arising on sale or tax-free capital gains which are smaller than disallowed interest deductions. 21. Officials recommend extending consultation to cover situations where the disposal of a property either produces a loss, or a gain that is smaller than the amount of interest expense. This would mean putting multiple options in the consultation document for how to treat interest deductions that have been denied when the disposal of a property is taxed. These options could include the following, although other options, or variations on these, are also possible: 21.1 Permanently denying interest deductions. 21.2 Allowing interest deductions on a deferred basis if the taxpayer is taxed on the disposal of their property. 21.3 Allowing interest deductions when a property is sold, if the sale is not taxable, to the extent that interest deductions exceed any untaxed gains. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] This would mean interest deductions may be fully allowed where a property is sold for a capital loss. Proposed interest allocation approach: tracing 22. In tax law, a deduction is generally allowed for expenditure or loss that is incurred in deriving assessable (taxable) income. This can be described as a ‘nexus’ approach, as the availability of a deduction depends on what the expenditure was used for. It is the default approach applied in the absence of any other specific rule. 23. Establishing nexus for interest expense can be difficult. Generally, a tracing approach is applied. If borrowed money is used to acquire an income producing asset or pay a deductible expense, the money can be directly traced to the production of taxable income, and the interest is deductible. If the borrowed money is used to acquire a family home or personal vehicle, or to fund a holiday, the interest is not deductible. In other cases, loan funding is used for purposes which do not relate directly to earning taxable income, such as repaying another loan, funding a dividend or payment of drawings to a business partner, or funding payment of a tax obligation. In these cases, tracing is more problematic. Tracing is also subject to manipulation. For example, an individual can use equity to fund private assets and borrowing to fund taxable assets. For these reasons, tracing is not generally applicable to interest expense incurred by companies. 24. There are already some specific tax rules that apply to interest allocated to residential property, namely the mixed-use asset (MUA) rules and the residential loss ring-fencing (RLR) rules. For taxpayers other than companies, the tracing approach is used under both the MUA and RLR rules. For companies, the RLR rules also use tracing but the MUA rules apply a different ‘stacking’ approach. An explanation of stacking and other possible approaches is outlined in the Appendix. 25. You have stated that your intention is for the interest limitation proposal not to affect non-housing loans (for example, loans for a small business operated by a sole trader and secured by residential property). Officials consider that the tracing approach is the most viable approach that is consistent with that intention. 26. However, because money is fungible, the tracing approach can cause fairness and integrity issues. This is shown in Example 1 below. There may also be practical difficulties in applying tracing, particularly retrospectively (for example, it may be hard to trace how much of a loan was used for residential rental property purposes versus other business purposes, if the borrowed funds were used before application date). Example 1 – Issues with tracing Assume that the interest limitation proposal applies a tracing approach, such that interest deductions are denied for money borrowed to acquire a residential rental property. Staffa Trust is a family trust, which owns a share portfolio worth $1M and no other assets or debt. Staffa Trust borrows $1M to acquire a residential rental property. Under the interest limitation proposal, Staffa Trust would not be allowed deductions for any of its interest expense. Rota Trust is another family trust, which owns a residential rental property worth $1M and no other assets or debt. Rota Trust borrows $1M to acquire a share portfolio worth $1M. Rota Trust’s interest deductions are not affected by the interest limitation proposal. Interest paid by Rota Trust on the $1M loan would remain fully deductible, as the borrowed funds were used in deriving assessable income. This outcome raises issues of horizontal equity, as Rota Trust has exactly the same assets and liabilities as Staffa Trust. However, because Rota Trust used its existing equity to buy the residential rental property and it used debt to buy its share portfolio, it was able to retain its interest deductions. This example also illustrates the integrity problems caused by tracing, as taxpayers who own IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] significant taxable assets (other than residential rental properties) will be able to limit the impact of the interest limitation proposal by equity-funding their rental properties and debt-funding their other taxable assets. 27. Alternative approaches could be used to avoid these issues, but such approaches are either overly generous or would deny (at least partially) interest deductions on loans incurred for the purpose of funding a small business. This is discussed further in the Appendix. 28. The interest allocation approach to be used is a key design decision that will impact many other second-order decisions that officials intend to consult on. For example, rules for taxpayers borrowing to acquire shares in a company that owns residential rental property may be designed very differently if a tracing approach is used than if a stacking approach is used. 29. Officials consider that getting early clarity on the interest allocation approach to be used will help to focus issues and allow more meaningful consultation on second- order design decisions. Officials recommend that tracing be the approach generally used for all taxpayers (whether a company or not) under the interest limitation proposal, noting that there may possibly be some limited instances where a different approach might be needed. Application of the rules to widely held companies 30. Residential properties can be held by companies in many different situations. Some companies hold residential properties as part of their primary business. A landlord may use a company to hold all of their rental properties, for tax or non-tax reasons. Companies operating retirement villages own residential properties and sell licences to occupy to the village’s residents. 31. A company may also have small holdings of residential property that are incidental to its core business. For example, an agricultural company may own residential properties near its farms or orchards and use them to provide accommodation to its workers. A large company may also own residential properties near its offices for employees to use when they have to travel from out of town, or for short secondments. A company may also own holiday homes that it allows employees to use as a perk. 32. To be effective, the interest limitation proposal must apply to residential properties held in “close companies” (companies where 5 or fewer individuals 2 hold more than 50% of the company). Otherwise, taxpayers could avoid the rules by simply transferring their residential properties to a company. 33. However, it is an open question whether the proposal should apply to more widely held companies and, if so, to what extent. On one hand, currently the vast majority of rental properties are owned by individuals, trusts, or family (close) companies 3 so a proposal that only applied to close companies could capture the majority of residential rental properties and avoid complexity for widely held companies. It would be very difficult for a taxpayer to set up a widely held company to hold their own residential properties without significantly changing the nature of their investment. For this reason, the RLR and MUA rules both apply only to residential property held by close companies. 34. On the other hand, the principle that interest deductions should be denied for borrowing relating to residential property should arguably apply equally to all taxpayers, regardless of their legal form. Moreover, limiting the rules to close 2 Associates are treated as a single individual. 3 Based on 2019 income tax returns, less than 0.1% of entities returning any rental income were widely held companies. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] companies may encourage groups of taxpayers to form widely held companies to debt-fund residential rental investment. There are recent reports in the media of this kind of activity. 35. Extending the proposal to widely held companies could increase the after-tax costs of retirement villages if they come under the broadened scope. This may be inappropriate given the objective is concerned with dampening investor demand for existing housing stock (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers), especially when other potential buyers of the housing stock are first-home buyers. This is unlikely to apply for the residential housing stock of retirement village operators. On the other hand, retirement village operators may compete for development sites with other property developers and reducing the after-tax return to the former group may be necessary to ensure a level playing field. However, allowing interest deductions for developers and purchasers of new builds will mitigate this in most cases. We note that even if the proposal were extended to widely held companies (whether only land-rich ones or all widely held companies), it would still be possible to exclude retirement villages, which are currently excluded from the definition of “residential land” that applies for purposes of the bright-line test. 36. Issues around employer-provided accommodation can also arise with the bright- line test, though it is possible that these could be resolved by changing the definition of “residential land”, rather than through narrowing the scope of persons affected by the interest limitation proposal. 37. There are three options for applying the interest limitation proposal to companies: 37.1 Option A. Apply it to close companies only. 37.2 Option B. Apply it to close companies and any “residential land-rich” company where residential property makes up more than a certain percentage (say, 25 per cent) of its total assets. 37.3 Option C. Apply it to all companies. 38. Table 2 below summarises the advantages and disadvantages of these options. Table 2. Application of rules to widely held companies Option Advantages Disadvantages Other impacts A. Close companies only • Simplest and lowest compliance cost • Consistent with the mixed- use asset and residential loss ring-fencing rules • Different tax treatment for close companies and widely held companies could be viewed as unfair B. Close companies and widely held companies that are “residential land-rich” • Reduces compliance costs for widely held companies that are not “residential land-rich” • Consistent tax treatment for all residential land-rich companies • Increases compliance costs for companies close to and over the “residential land- rich” threshold • May increase costs for residents of retirement village C. All companies • Consistent, principled, approach for all taxpayers • May increase complexity and impose compliance costs on companies that hold residential property • May increase costs for residents of retirement villages IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] incidental to their main business 39. Officials recommend Option B (close and residential land-rich companies). However, we consider all options are viable and you may wish to consult on all three. Next steps 40. Officials are available to discuss the contents of this report with you at the next Joint Ministers’ meeting. 41. We intend to report to you after that meeting on a possible policy framework to help guide other important design decisions for the interest limitation proposal. 42. Officials will continue to discuss key design issues with you over the coming weeks as work progresses on the interest limitation proposal. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix – Other interest allocation approaches 1. The other interest allocation approaches that officials have considered include: 1.1 Stacking approach. 1.2 Apportionment approach. 1.3 Security approach. 2. However, we do not consider any of these approaches to be viable, given your desire to ensure that interest deductions on loans to fund small businesses remain unaffected. Stacking approach 3. The stacking approach looks at all of a taxpayer’s debt (and also sometimes their associates’ debt) and allocates it to assets according to a prescribed order at the end of each income year. 4 The prescribed order would depend on how strongly you wish to incentive or disincentivise certain purchases. This is shown in Example 2. Example 2 – Stacking approach Property Ltd has debt of $700,000 and owns the following assets, with a total value of $1.8m: - residential rental property acquired before application date, valued at $300,000 - residential rental property acquired after application date, valued at $500,000 - assets used in a small restaurant business, valued at $1m. Harsh stacking Assume the prescribed stacking order is: (1) post-application date rental property; (2) pre- application date rental property; (3) non-residential business assets. Property Ltd’s debt would first be allocated to the post-application date property so $500,000 would be subject to full interest denial. The remaining $200,000 of debt would be allocated to the pre- application date rental property, so would be subject to phasing. Even if Property Ltd takes out a further loan to buy more equipment for the restaurant business, interest on the first $100,000 of that loan will be allocated to the pre-application date rental property and subject to phasing. Any part of the loan beyond $100,000 will be allocated to the restaurant assets and interest will be deductible on that part. Generous stacking Assume now that the prescribed stacking order is: (1) non-residential business assets; (2) pre- application date rental property; (3) post-application date rental property. Property Ltd’s debt would be allocated entirely to the restaurant assets so interest would be fully deductible. If Property Ltd took out more debt to buy a third residential rental property, interest deductions would be fully allowed on a further $300,000 of debt (as that debt would still be allocated to the restaurant assets). Beyond $300,00 of debt, interest deductions will be subject to phasing or full denial. 4. As Example 2 illustrates, a harsh stacking approach would have the effect of denying interest deductions on some loans used for small business purposes. The principle of stacking is that money is fungible, and debt in reality funds all of the borrower’s assets. This is the approach used in the existing mixed-use asset rules. On the 4 Where loans have different interest rates, a blended/average interest rate is used. IR2021/133; T2021/847: Interest limitation proposal – consultation, timing, and scope of consultation document \[IN CONFIDENCE\] other hand, a generous stacking approach would allow taxpayers to easily borrow to acquire residential rental properties without losing any interest deductions. Apportionment approach 5. An apportionment approach looks at a taxpayer’s balance sheet and allocates the debt in proportion to their assets. Example 3 – Apportionment approach Assume Property Ltd has the same debt and assets as in Example 2. Applying an apportionment approach: - 27.8% (500k/1.8m) of the debt would be allocated to the pre-application date rental property, - 16.7% (300k/1.8m) of the debt would be allocated to the post-application date rental property, and - 55.6% (1m/1.8m) of the debt would be allocated to the restaurant assets. 6. As Example 3 illustrates, an apportionment approach would have the effect of partially denying interest deductions on loans used for small business purposes (for taxpayers that own both business and residential property assets). Apportionment also involves high compliance costs as it depends heavily on asset valuations. It is the approach that applies, for example, to New Zealand subsidiaries of multinational groups, to prevent them over-allocating interest expense to their New Zealand activities. Security approach 7. A security approach would deny interest deductions on any debt secured against a residential rental property. 8. Officials do not consider a security approach is viable. Mortgage agreements often provide that any security given by the borrower secures any loans the borrower has with the particular bank, as well as any future loans the borrower may have with the same bank. It will not therefore be possible to link a loan with any particular property. Furthermore, the fact that an asset is given as security for a loan often has little to do with the purpose for which the loan is used.

Early decisions on these issues will reduce complexity and increase certainty for taxpayers. The decisions sought in this report will inform the drafting of the consultation document which officials will provide to you on 19 May. Recommended action We recommend that you: Rest homes and retirement villages 1. indicate how the interest limitation proposal should apply to rest homes and/or retirement villages: 1.1 Rest homes and retirement villages should be specifically excluded from the scope of the interest limitation proposal (the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development’s preference); OR Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 1.2 Only rest homes should be specifically excluded from the scope of the interest limitation proposal; OR Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 2 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1.3 Rest homes and retirement villages should be subject to the interest limitation proposal; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 2. refer this report to the Minister of Housing and the Associate Minister of Housing (Public Housing); Referred/Not referred Referred/Not referred 3. if you want the interest limitation proposal to apply to retirement villages, discuss this with the Minister of Housing and the Associate Minister of Housing (Public Housing); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 4. if you want the interest limitation proposal to apply to rest homes, discuss this with the Minister of Health and the Associate Minister of Health; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Income-earning use of a main home 5. agree to a main home exemption from the interest limitation proposal that would cover the following situations: 5.1 Owner -occupiers with flatmates; 5.2 Owner-occupiers with boarders; 5.3 Owner-occupiers providing short-stay accommodation in their main home; 5.4 Any other income-earning use of a main home (for example, a home office); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed New builds purchased off the plans prior to 27 March 6. indicate which proposal regarding the application of the new build exemption to investors who purchase properties off the plans before 27 March 2021 you would like to include in the consultation document: 6.1 The new build exemption applies in respect of properties purchased off the plans before 27 March 2021 if a code compliance certificate is issued for the property on or after 27 March 2021 (recommended); OR Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 6.2 The new build exemption does not apply in respect of properties purchased off the plans before 27 March 2021; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Application to non-close companies 7. indicate which of the following scope options for application to companies you would like included in the consultation document (you may select more than one): 7.1 Option A: Close companies only; IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 3 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 7.2 Option B: Close companies and “residential land-rich” companies (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 7.3 Option C: All companies; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 8. agree to include in the discussion document a proposal to amend the definition of a “close company” by treating all trustees of trusts settled by the same person (or their associates) as a single trustee; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Treatment of denied interest when property is sold 9. note that Cabinet decided that officials should consult on whether interest should be deferred rather than denied permanently if the taxpayer is not a property developer but is taxed on the disposal of their property under the bright-line test or another land sale rule (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers); 10. note that the discussion document will include the following broad options for the treatment of interest expense in relation to property that will be taxable when sold: 10.1 Do not ever allow a deduction for interest with respect to the property; and 10.2 Allow all of the interest related to the property to be deductible in the year of the sale if the sale is taxable (possibly subject to anti-arbitrage and the residential loss ring-fencing rules); 11. agree that officials consult on the option to allow a deduction for interest in excess of non-taxable gain in the case of a capital account sale; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Interaction with residential loss ring-fencing rules 12. agree that officials consult on and consider amending some of the settings of the residential loss ring-fencing rules in order to align with the exemptions under the interest limitation proposal (for example, the new build exemption); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 4 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Foreign property loans 13. indicate how the interest limitation proposal should apply to foreign currency denominated loans for foreign residential rental property: 13.1 The proposals should not apply; OR Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 13.2 The proposals should apply only to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Chris Gillion Policy Lead Inland Revenue Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 s 9(2)(a) IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 5 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 1. This report sets out options for public consultation on how to treat denied interest when a property is sold. It also seeks decisions from Ministers on certain scope and design issues. 2. Where applicable, officials intend to put forward proposed approaches on the topics covered below in a consultation document and invite submissions on the details of how those approaches will be applied. Background 3. On 8 March 2021, Cabinet agreed in principle to limit deductions for interest incurred on residential investment property (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). Cabinet also directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. 4. Given the timeframes involved, it would be useful to get some further design decisions agreed and thereby reduce the number of issues being publicly consulted on. Refining the scope of the consultation document in this way would allow officials to concentrate their efforts on relevant second-order decisions and can help focus submissions on areas where consultation is likely to be most helpful. Early decisions on these issues will also reduce complexity and increase certainty for taxpayers. Rest homes and retirement villages 5. This section seeks Ministerial direction on the treatment of rest homes and retirement villages. There are arguments both for and against including them in the scope of the proposed interest limitation rules and we seek your direction on how this topic should be broached in the upcoming discussion document. 6. Officials’ starting position is that the definition of residential land used for the bright- line test would form the basis for property subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. At its simplest, residential land is defined as land with a dwelling on it. For the purposes of the bright-line test, a dwelling is a place that is configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is used as such. Certain commercial structures are specifically excluded from the definition of dwelling, including hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, hotels, and motels. 7. Under the bright-line test, rest homes and retirement villages are also specifically excluded. The rationale is that these properties are not “flipped” in the same way that regular houses and apartments can be, even though in many cases they do resemble standard residential properties and are intended to be used as long-term accommodation. They are regulated and there are rules regarding who may occupy a unit. The occupant has little or no opportunity to assign rights to someone else, which minimises the risk of shorter-term speculative investment. 8. If rest homes and retirement villages were not explicitly excluded from the bright- line test, we anticipate that most residents would qualify for the main home exclusion anyway. The specific carveout therefore removes any potential uncertainty, reduces compliance costs, and provides peace of mind. 9. The relevant considerations for the proposed interest limitation rules may be slightly different. The Government’s purpose for introducing the new interest limitation rule is to support more sustainable house prices and improve affordability for first home buyers by dampening investor demand for existing property. 10. Given this intention, it may be unnecessary to apply the proposed interest limitation rules to retirement villages and rest homes. While dwellings in retirement villages IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 6 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] may at times look physically identical to standard residential properties, demand for retirement villages is separate from demand for standard residential properties. As such, application of the interest limitation rules to retirement villages is unlikely to increase the effectiveness of the rules in supporting more sustainable house prices and improving affordability for first home buyers. 11. In addition, if retirement villages and rest homes are subject to the interest limitation rules, the operators of rest homes and retirement villages may pass the increased tax burden onto individual residents. Increasing costs for rest home and retirement village residents may be contrary to Cabinet’s objective of ensuring that every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry, and affordable home. While the interest limitation proposal may increase costs for renters generally, this is less justified for retirement village residents as doing so is unlikely to meet the objective of supporting more sustainable house prices and improving affordability for first home buyers. 12. If the increased costs from applying the interest limitation rules are passed on to individual residents, this could also reduce the effectiveness of the measure for supporting more sustainable house prices and improving affordability for first home buyers. Currently there may be an under-utilisation of existing housing by retirees, pa rticularly in urban centres. This could occur because a property has been the family home for several years and the owner may be reluctant to move out even once their children have moved out. If the cost of a unit in a retirement village were to increase, this could add another barrier to downsizing. It may also increase the minimum price the owner would be willing to accept. This is an important consideration as it could impact the ability of first home buyers to enter the housing market. 13. While applying the new interest deductibility rules to retirement villages and rest homes is unlikely to directly support the Government’s housing objectives, there may be other reasons why you would want to apply the new interest limitation rules to retirement villages and rest homes. 14. An exemption could be seen as providing a tax advantage to operators of retirement villages and rest homes versus providers of rental accommodation. This may be perceived as unfair, given media attention regarding the profitability and tax-paying profile of certain retirement village operators (for example, in the context of the wage subsidy). 15. If they would otherwise pass the increased tax burden onto individual residents if no specific carveout were provided, an exemption for retirement villages could also be seen as a subsidy specifically for retirees who have the financial resources to move into a retirement village. This could raise equity concerns as it disadvantages older people who do not have the financial means to move into a retirement village and must remain in private rental accommodation. This equity concern about access is not as relevant for rest homes, as the residential care subsidy is available. 16. If Ministers decide to apply the new interest limitation rules to retirement villages, you may also wish to consider treating rest homes differently from retirement villages. We consider that a distinction could be drawn between rest homes and retirement villages. Rest homes may be more akin to a nursing home, in that additional medical and assisted-living services are provided as residents are less independent than those in retirement villages more generally. Retirement villages are more like residential rental accommodation exclusively for older people (although often requiring a lump sum payment at the outset for a license to occupy, rather than ongoing rental payments). 17. Some providers will operate a combination of the two services on one site, with residents moving between a village setting and a hospital care situation more akin to a rest home as their situation dictates. Treating the two types of accommodation differently may thus lead to boundary issues or increased compliance costs. IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 7 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] However, we expect that these boundary issues within mixed complexes would be manageable as rest homes and retirement villages are subject to different regulatory frameworks, with rest homes requiring certification. 18. We seek your direction on whether rest homes and/or retirement villages should be outside the scope of the proposed interest limitation rules, or specifically included. 19. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development recommends that rest homes and retirement villages be outside the scope of the proposed interest limitation rules. This is because applying these rules to retirement villages and rest homes would not support the Government’s housing market objectives. Income-earning use of the main home 20. We also seek your direction on whether income-earning use of a main home should be exempt from the interest limitation proposal. In the absence of such an exemption, the rules would apply to owner-occupiers who have flatmates or boarders, provide short-stay accommodation in their main home or who use their home for some other income-earning use (for example, a home office). Currently these owner-occupiers can deduct a portion of their interest for the loan used to acquire their home. 21. The Government’s press release stated that the interest deductibility rules would not affect the family home. This statement could be interpreted as saying the rules would not affect the family home as interest on the family home is generally not deductible currently (as there is no nexus with income). Alternatively, it could be interpreted as saying that any currently deductible interest on the family home will remain deductible under the new rules. 22. Not exempting main homes used for income-earning purposes could disincentivise homeowners from providing accommodation in their main home, which could place further pressure on the rental housing market. Applying the interest limitation rules to these scenarios may also have a negative effect on some first home buyers, as it is not uncommon for first home buyers to get flatmates in to help with repaying their mortgages. Providing a main home exemption would also avoid potentially worsening the existing under-utilisation of owner-occupied housing. 23. Owner-occupiers that derive rental income from having flatmates are presently required to apportion their expenses such as mortgage interest, rates and insurance between private and income-earning use based on a floor area calculation. There is tax to pay if the rental income from flatmates exceeds the total expenses attributed to income-earning use. 24. Boarders are different to flatmates. When boarders rent rooms in a house, part of the rent they pay is for services provided such as meals and laundry. A common example of a boarding situation is a home-stay student staying with a host family in their private home. 25. Officials note that not providing a main home exemption from the interest limitation proposal could be especially problematic for some owner-occupiers who have boarders. 26. An Inland Revenue determination sets out the standard cost of providing private boarding services which may be used by taxpayers instead of their actual expenses if they have four or fewer boarders. If their boarding income is equal to or less than the standard cost, the taxpayer is not required to pay tax on their boarding income. 27. If interest deductions will no longer be available to those providing private boarding services, the determination will need to be significantly revised and may need to be removed entirely, as mortgage interest is likely to make up the largest part of the IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 8 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] annual housing standard cost set out in the determination. This would require taxpayers to use their actual expenses (as owner-occupiers with flatmates are presently required to), thus increasing compliance costs. This would be exacerbated further by the fact that (since they would no longer be able to claim interest deductions) they would be required to pay tax on their boarding income where many of these taxpayers were not previously required to. 28. Limiting interest deductions for owner-occupiers with boarders may also affect those on low incomes. Anecdotally, Work and Income sometimes advises beneficiaries to get boarders as a means of helping to cover living costs. 29. All or part of a residential property that is a person’s main home may sometimes be rented out as short-stay accommodation. While the use of a main home to provide accommodation to a flatmate or boarder would have the most beneficial impact on the housing market, the same arguments regarding supporting first home buyers to meet their mortgage repayments are also applicable other income- earning uses (such as short-stay accommodation or home offices). Exempting short-stay accommodation provided in a taxpayer’s main home from the scope of the proposal would also avoid creating a boundary between flatmates and short- stay accommodation guests. 30. Officials recommend that there be a main home exemption from the interest limitation rules for all income-earning uses of a main home. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development agrees with this recommendation. Transitional issue with new builds purchased off the plans prior to 27 March 31. Cabinet agreed in-principle that the new build exemption would apply to property purchased in New Zealand on or after 27 March 2021, and within 12 months of receiving its code compliance certificate (CCC) (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). For a property purchased off the plans, the new build exemption would not apply where the property receives its CCC in (for example) January 2022 if the agreement to purchase the property was entered into before 27 March 2021. Interest deductions for the property would be phased out at a rate of 25% over four years. On the other hand, interest would be deductible if the same property was purchased on or after 27 March 2021, and within 12 months of CCC being issued. 32. Officials seek your agreement to consult on a proposal that a property purchased off the plans would qualify for the new build exemption provided the property receives its CCC on or after 27 March, even if the property is purchased before this date. This is a transitional issue that only affects new builds purchased off the plans before 27 March that receive their CCCs after this date. There are a number of reasons why officials consider this the preferred option for inclusion in the consultation document. 33. First, applying the exemption to these properties may help prevent a reduction in new housing supply. While the exemption may not necessarily be required to increase housing supply because investors will have decided to purchase these properties before 27 March, in the absence of allowing the exemption to apply some investors may decide to cancel agreements to purchase these properties where they are able to. 34. Second, it would simplify the rules by making the date an interest in these properties is first acquired irrelevant to whether the new build exemption applies. Instead, the relevant question would generally be whether a CCC for a property IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 9 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] purchased off the plans was issued on or after 27 March, with properties that had CCCs issued on or after 27 March within the scope of the exemption. 1 35. Third, it would reduce the need for anti-avoidance rules aimed at preventing taxpayers from entering into tax-driven arrangements to obtain the benefit of the new build exemption for properties purchased off the plans before 27 March that receive their CCCs on or after this date. For example, a taxpayer could attempt to circumvent the application date of the new build exemption by selling property to a related party on or after 27 March. Alternatively, the taxpayer could nominate a new purchaser on or after this date, because the nominee would be treated as having purchased the property when they are nominated. Such anti-avoidance rules are likely to be complex, and could be difficult for Inland Revenue to enforce. 36. Officials therefore recommend the consultation document propose that the new build exemption should apply to properties purchased off the plans that are completed and receive their CCCs on or after 27 March, regardless of when agreements to purchase such properties are entered into. Application to non-close companies 37. In IR2021/133, T2021/847, officials considered the extent to which the interest limitation proposal should apply to companies. The report set out three scope options for companies: 37.1 Option A. Apply it to close companies only. 37.2 Option B. Apply it to close companies and any “residential land-rich” company where residential property makes up more than a certain percentage (say, 25 per cent) of its total assets. 37.3 Option C. Apply it to all companies. 38. The Minister of Revenue has requested more advice on whether Option B would sufficiently limit opportunities to avoid the interest limitation rules by putting residential properties in non-close companies. Officials consider that Option B would be sufficient. Definition of “close company” 39. A “close company” is a company where five or fewer natural persons or trustees directly or indirectly hold more than 50% of the company. 2 As the “close company” definition looks through interposed corporate shareholders to natural persons and trustees, 3 a person cannot avoid having a “close company” by splitting the share ownership among other companies that they control. 40. The “close company” definition also treats natural persons who are associated as a single person. Relatives are treated as associated if they are within two degrees of blood relationship, or in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, or within two degrees of blood relationship to the person’s spouse, civil union or de facto partner. A person could not, therefore, get around the “close company” definition 1 Note that as announced by Ministers, the exemption would also apply to properties purchased on or after 27 March and within 12 months of receiving their CCCs. This could include properties that received their CCCs before 27 March but are purchased on or after this date, and within 12 months of the CCC being issued. Officials are not asking Ministers to reconsider the eligibility of these properties for the new build exemption, because investors will have made decisions in reliance on the Government’s announcement. 2 Measured by voting interest or market value. 3 Note that a “close company” is different from a “closely-held company”. The key difference is that the “close company” definition looks through interposed corporate shareholders while the “closely-held company” definition does not. IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 10 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] by assigning shares to their spouse, children or other close relatives. There are also other associated persons rules applying to natural persons, which can be complex. 41. Because the “close company” definition effectively looks through entities to natural persons and trustees, and treats natural person associates as a single person, it is very difficult for an individual to avoid the definition of a “close company” while maintaining control over the company. One way in which the “close company” definition could be made more robust is by treating all trustees of trusts settled by the same person (or their associates) as a single trustee. Officials recommend including this proposed change in the discussion document. With this proposed change, officials consider that even if the interest limitation proposal applied only to close companies (Option A), it should be sufficient to prevent people transferring their individually- or family-controlled properties into a debt-funded company to avoid the proposal. Reasons for applying the rules beyond close companies 42. The reason officials recommended going further and applying the interest limitation proposal to residential land-rich companies (Option B) is that otherwise, groups of (unrelated) taxpayers may be incentivised to form widely-held companies to debt- fund residential rental investment. This may give rise to fairness issues as well as limit the impact of the proposal on house prices. 43. Officials did not recommend applying the proposal to all companies (Option C) because tracing is difficult for businesses that have many sources of funds and a variety of different assets. If businesses hold relatively small amounts of residential land, they would be able to obtain full deductibility of interest under the tracing approach anyway by ensuring all borrowing is used to fund non-residential assets. Option C could therefore impose large compliance costs for companies while raising minimal revenue (compared to Option B). This is the reason the current tax law generally does not require companies to trace interest expenses; interest is deductible to companies unless an exclusion applies. Moreover, the additional companies Option C would capture (compared to Option B) are unlikely to contribute significantly to high house prices as their core business would not involve owning residential land. 44. For the reasons above, officials recommended Option B (close companies and residential land-rich companies, with the land-rich threshold determined after consultation). Treatment of denied interest when property is sold 45. Under the interest limitation proposal, the general treatment will be that no deduction will be allowed for interest on debt that funds investment in residential investment property. This will not apply to interest on debt that funds property development and the purchase of new builds. The discussion document will discuss details of how to implement these policies. 46. Cabinet decided that “officials consult on whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred if the taxpayer is not a property developer but is taxed on the disposal of their property under the bright-line test or another land sale rule” (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). 47. This section sets out a set of options that officials propose to include in the discussion document to discuss the deductibility of interest in situations where property will only be taxed if sold within the bright-line period and is not covered by the new build (or any other) exemption from interest limitation. IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 11 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 48. All of these options involve trade-offs between housing market objectives (changing housing market incentives in the interests of first home buyers) and reducing over- taxation that could result for property investors if interest is never taken into account in determining their tax liability. Option 1 has the greatest impact on the housing market, but also the most potential for overtaxing property investors. Option 3 has the least impact on the housing market (although it still shifts the market in favour of first home buyers) but more closely aligns with taxing property investors on their economic income. Option 1: Permanent non-deductibility 49. Under the first option, interest related to residential investment property is never deductible. This would be the most effective approach in terms of tilting the playing field in favour of first home buyers, since investors would never be entitled to an interest deduction. However, it would mean that the investor is taxed on all returns from the property (including any gain on sale) with no deductions for interest. Option 2: Deductibility if sale of property is taxable 50. If the proceeds of selling a property are fully taxed you may wish to allow a deduction for all expenses related to the property, including interest. This option is the one Cabinet requested officials consult on. Option 2 timing of deduction 51. If this option is adopted, it would not be appropriate to allow the deduction for interest to be taken in the year when the interest is paid. Because the taxation of sale proceeds under the bright-line test is uncertain until either the property is sold or the bright-line period expires, it makes sense to: 51.1 deny a deduction for interest when it is paid; and 51.2 then allow it only if the sale is in fact taxable. 52. Also arguing in favour of deferring interest deductions is the fact that the income from the increase in the property’s value is only taxable when the property is sold – not as the property changes in value. Option 2 loss limitation 53. If the interest expense relating to a property is greater than the gain on sale (or there is no gain), this approach would mean that the interest expense deduction either creates or increases a loss on sale. Under the current law, a loss arising on a sale of bright-line property may only be deducted against income from the sale of land. This restriction would continue to apply (consultation may include a proposal to extend it to sales taxable under the “intention of resale” test). Option 3: Same as option 2, plus deduction for interest in excess of untaxed gain on sale 54. Officials have considered whether there is merit in allowing some interest to be deducted in capital (non-taxable) sales if there is no net under-taxation of the investment. This would be the case to the extent that interest expenses exceed the amount of untaxed gain on sale. IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 12 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. In IR2021/133, T2021/847, officials put forward this option as one to potentially include in the consultation document. This report is seeking clarification on whether Ministers are comfortable with consulting on this as an option. Example A residential rental property is sold for an untaxed gain of $100, but $150 of interest has been disallowed during the period the property was rented. The amount of interest up to the untaxed gain ($100) would be permanently disallowed. At issue is the treatment of the $50 of excess interest. Under options 1 and 2, this excess would also be permanently disallowed. Under option 3 it would be deductible. The principle is that the non-taxation of the $100 gain on sale has been adequately addressed by non-deduction of the $100 of interest, and the remaining $50 of interest should be deductible. 56. Another way of thinking about this option is to treat it as apportioning the interest expense. Interest is first allocated to the sale of property, up to the amount of any gain on sale, and deductible to that extent only if the sale is taxable. Any remaining interest expense is allocated to the cost of renting the property out and is therefore deductible. 57. A possible objection to this approach is that it is somewhat one-sided. Interest is deductible if it exceeds a tax-free gain, but the exemption from tax for capital gains means gains are not taxable if they exceed interest. If the gain on sale in the example above were $200, a deduction would be denied for the $150 of interest expense, which would leave $50 of tax-free gain which is not “countered” by non- deductible interest. Option 3 loss limitation 58. As with option 2, if option 3 means the sale of a property results in a net loss in the year of sale ($50 in the example above) the deductibility of this loss would be limited by current law (most likely under the residential loss ring-fencing rule, which provides that residential property expenses are generally deductible only against residential property income). This limitation would continue to apply, though modifications may be consulted on. 59. Cabinet did not consider or decide the question of whether consultation should include allowing a deduction for interest in some cases when residential investment pr operty is sold on capital account (non-taxable). Recommendation 11 authorises officials to consult on this option for non-taxable sales. Interaction with residential loss ring-fencing rules 60. Residential rental loss ring-fencing rules were introduced in 2018 to reduce tax benefits for property investors compared to owner-occupiers. The interest limitation proposal would shift this setting further in favour of owner-occupiers by imposing higher levels of tax on leveraged property investors. The interest limitation proposal includes some exemptions to favour new supply that were not considered for residential loss ring-fencing. 61. There will be significant interplay between the interest limitation rules and the residential loss ring-fencing rules. We think the most logical approach is to have the interest limitation rules determine if interest is potentially deductible in an income year. If it is deductible under the interest rules, the timing of the deduction may be deferred under the residential loss ring-fencing rules (if the taxpayer has IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 13 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] an overall resident ial rental loss for the year). There are likely to be many related technical issues that come up during consultation. 62. We seek guidance on whether officials may consider more significant changes to the resident ial loss ring-fencing rules to align with some of the exemptions being proposed for the interest limitation provisions. For example, the resident ial loss ring-fencing rules have no equivalent to a new build exemption. If interest is deductible under the interest limitation proposal, a portion of it could potentially be denied or deferred under the resident ial loss ring-fencing rules (if the interest deduction results in a net loss for the year). A way of addressing this is to say the resident ial loss ring-fencing rules do not apply if one of the major exemptions for interest limitation (new build and development exemptions) 4 applies. Note that this would be liberalising the taxation of rental property investment in some cases. Foreign property purchased using foreign currency loans 63. One area where officials have received a number of queries, and where we seek your direction, is how, if at all, these proposals might apply to foreign currency loans. 64. For the purpose of this report, we are seeking your guidance on loans denominated in a foreign currency used to fund a residential rental property that is situated outside New Zealand. 5 65. Foreign currency loans will most commonly arise in two situations: 65.1 Migrants to New Zealand who hold and rent out foreign properties acquired before migrating to New Zealand; and 65.2 New Zealand residents who own a foreign property as a holiday home but rent it out while they are not using it to cover part of the cost. These will be taxed under the mixed-use asset rules. 66. Some New Zealand residents may also own foreign rental properties as an investment but we expect there will be less of these than the other two situations as an equivalent investment in New Zealand rental property will be logistically easier for most New Zealanders to manage. 67. Currently, if these properties are owned by a New Zealand tax resident, expenditure on these loans will be deductible and calculated under the financial arrangements rules. This calculation will include both the New Zealand dollar equivalent of interest expenditure as well as any foreign exchange gains or losses on the principal. 68. There is more complexity in calculating interest deductions on a foreign currency loan than an equivalent New Zealand dollar loan and this would be magnified if the interest limitation proposal applies to foreign currency loans. Limiting interest deductions on foreign currency loans is likely to raise a number of issues, unintended consequences, and — depending on the method chosen — the potential for relatively large assessable income or deductions on unrealised gains and losses. Officials do not consider there is sufficient time to develop transitional proposals in time for inclusion in the discussion document to be provided to you in May, and that any transitional proposals would need to be subject to consultation due to the risks outlined above. 4 The residenti al loss ring-fencing provisions have a development exemption that applies to most developments, but it is possible the development exemption designed for the interest limitation provisions may be somewhat broader. 5 There are likely to be a small but unknown number of New Zealand residential rental properties financed by foreign currency loans and potentially foreign rental properties financed by New Zealand dollar loans. These are not within the scope of the guidance sought in this report. IR2021/181: Interest limitation proposal – further scope and design issues Page 14 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 69. One of the Government’s overarching policy objectives is to “support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first home buyers”. While not explicit, we assume this objective is to dampen investor demand for New Zealand housing stock to improve affordability for first home buyers of New Zealand houses. Limiting interest deductions on foreign properties will have no direct effect on the price of New Zealand houses. 70. Officials’ preference is to exclude foreign currency denominated loans for foreign residential rental properties from the interest limitation proposal for the following reasons: 70.1 This would be consistent with the intent of the interest limitation proposal to reduce investor demand for New Zealand housing. 70.2 This would prevent discouraging skilled migrants that meet all relevant immigration criteria but own property in their home jurisdiction. 70.3 This would reduce the complexity of the interest limitation rules and free up resources towards developing other aspects of the proposal. 70.4 To the extent excluding these loans encourages investment in foreign rental properties, it may further reduce investor demand for existing New Zealand housing stock. However, due to the simpler logistics, officials consider most investors are likely to prefer a New Zealand new build over a foreign property despite similar tax treatment. 71. Alternatively, if you want to limit interest deductions for foreign currency denominated loans for foreign residential rental properties, we recommend this limitation applies only to properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. This would more closely align the treatment of foreign loans with loans for New Zealand properties. As no transitional adjustments would be required it is only slightly more complex than a complete exclusion. Consultation 72. The Treasury and Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development were consulted on this report and agree with its recommendations. Next steps 73. Officials will report to you on 19 May with a draft consultation document for your consideration.

It also provides a summary of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including issues that Ministers ought to be aware of, and sets out next steps. Context and background On 8 March 2021, Cabinet agreed in principle to limit deductions for interest incurred on residential investment property and to exempt new builds from both the proposed interest limitation rules and the extended bright-line test (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). Cabinet also directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. The proposals in the attached draft discussion document are the product of consultation with private sector stakeholders via an External Reference Group (ERG) and collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Although no further substantive changes to the document are being made, it continues to be fine-tuned and edited. Decisions with major impacts on the Government’s goal Design of the interest limitation rules is complex. While the discussion document covers a lot of complexity, some key features of the proposal will impact on the extent to which the proposals impact on the Government’s goal to reduce investor demand and support first home buyers, and to support housing supply in the long term. Some of the key design features and their impacts are: • The treatment of interest on disposal: The discussion document presents various options as to how interest would be treated on disposal of the property. This ranges from interest always being denied, to interest being fully allowed if gains on sale are taxable. Full denial of interest, whether or not gains are taxable on sale, would increase the expected effective tax rate on leveraged investment properties the most and therefore discourage debt-financed investor activity the most. Allowing interest to be deducted on disposal where capital gains are taxable would seek to align the system more with income tax principles, by allowing expenses to be recognised when income is fully taxed. • The length of the new build exemption and whether it can be passed on: A longer new build exemption, and more generous rules in regards to passing on the exemption, will result in the policy having less impact on house prices than a shorter IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 2 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption. However, since longer exemptions have less impact on house prices, it follows that longer exemptions and allowing the exemption to be passed on to subsequent buyers could have less negative impact on housing supply than shorter exemptions. • Earning income from a main home: This allows owner-occupiers who rent out part of their home to deduct interest against that income. This will support first home buyers by making entering the housing market more affordable for them. Next steps The discussion document is planned for release in early June after consideration by Cabinet on Tuesday 8 June. Cabinet will consider the final policy design on 27 September, and the legislation in the form of a Supplementary Order Paper is planned to be released before 1 October.

This report attaches the draft discussion document and Cabinet paper on the proposed interest limitation rules and on additional changes to the bright-line rules for your consideration. It also provides a summary of the proposals contained in the discussion document, including issues that Ministers ought to be aware of, and sets out next steps. Context and background 2. On 8 March 2021, Cabinet agreed in principle to limit deductions for interest incurred on residential investment property and to exempt new builds from both the proposed interest limitation rules and the extended bright-line test (CAB-21- MIN-0045 refers). Cabinet also directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. 3. The proposals in the attached draft discussion document are the product of consultation with private sector stakeholders via an External Reference Group (ERG) and collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Consultation with the ERG has been especially valuable in refining the proposals included in the discussion document. 4. The aim is to release the discussion document in early June after consideration by Cabinet on Tuesday 8 June. Cabinet will consider the final policy design on 27 September. The legislation in the form of a Supplementary Order Paper is planned to be released before 1 October. 5. There is significant complexity in the proposals in the discussion document, which is largely unavoidable. The discussion document contains a lot of detail about how the proposed rules could apply. This should provide more certainty to those affected by the proposals. Some aspects of the rules are complex but this is necessary given the exemptions for property development and new build properties, and the need to ensure that taxpayers cannot get around the rules by holding residential property in entities. 6. Officials are in the process of finalising the discussion document, so the document is still subject to minor ed itorial changes. 7. The proposals in the discussion document are summarised below. The following section also notes aspects of the proposals that Ministers should be aware of, including some potentially contentious aspects. Proposals in the discussion document Scope and general application of the rules Residential property subject to the rules (chapter 2) 8. Chapter 2 outlines the intended scope of the proposed interest limitation rules. In general, the intent is that the scope of property affected by interest limitation should align as much as possible with the pre-existing definitions of “residential land” and “dwelling” in the Income Tax Act 2007 used for the purposes of the bright-line test and the residential ring-fencing rules. 9. This broadly means the proposed rules would apply to property in use as long-term residential accommodation (such as residential rental property covered by the IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 4 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Residential Tenancies Act 1986) or property that is easily substitutable for long- term residential accommodation (such as homes converted into short-stay accommodation advertised predominantly on digital platforms). At the simplest level, this should include a house or apartment, regardless of whether it is used to provide long-term or short-term accommodation. 10. The chapter suggests specific exclusions from the interest limitation proposal for the following property types: 10.1 Employee accommodation: Businesses provide employee accommodation for a number of reasons, including where the employment location is remote or working hours are highly variable (for example, shift work). Employee accommodation is not generally substitutable for owner-occupied housing and would not compete with regular residential property, placing it outside the scope of the Government’s objectives. On this basis the draft discussion document proposes a carveout for all employee accommodation (with satisfactory integrity measures to minimise the potential for abuse). 10.2 Land outside New Zealand: In accordance with a decision taken by Ministers, the draft discussion document proposes to exclude foreign properties from the interest limitation rules, regardless of whether the mortgage is denominated in New Zealand dollars or a foreign currency (IR2021/181 refers). 10.3 Farmland: The definition of “residential land” used in the bright-line test specifically excludes farmland. The draft discussion document proposes adopting this exclusion for the interest limitation rules. This would mean that farmland would not be subject to the rules, even if there is a dwelling on the land that is used to provide accommodation (whether to employees or a third party). 10.4 Care facilities: For instance, hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, and hospices, where accommodation is incidental to the provision of care services, and is easy to distinguish from housing typically available as a private residence for owner occupiers. 10.5 Commercial accommodation: There are specific types of short-term commercial accommodation that are generally relatively easy to distinguish from properties that are suitable for owner-occupation: for instance, hotels, motels, inns, hostels, boarding houses and camping grounds. Some of these facilities can be used to provide long-term accommodation (for example, emergency accommodation), but they do not generally compete with owner- occupied housing. 10.6 Retirement villages and rest homes: Ministers previously decided that rest homes and retirement villages should be specifically excluded from the scope of the interest limitation proposal (IR2021/181 refers). 10.7 Main home: Ministers previously decided that the interest limitation proposal would not apply to interest related to any income-earning use of an owner-occupier’s main home (IR2021/181 refers). This will support housing affordability for first home buyers as well as encourage greater utilisation of housing. 11. The chapter also considers possible exclusions for certain student accommodation, serviced apartments, and Māori land, and raises how the rules might apply to dual- purpose buildings as another issue for further discussion. These issues are outlined below. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 5 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Student accommodation 12. Student accommodation (for example, halls of residence) does not compete with owner-occupied accommodation and would not typically be set up in a way that would be conducive to private owner occupation. In many situations, a specific carveout for student accommodation may not be required. However, further certainty could be provided by carving out specific types of student accommodation, such as that covered by either section 5(1)(h) or section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. Serviced apartments 13. Serviced apartments are apartments provided for long or short-term accommodation, with amenities provided for use. In some situations, a serviced apartment may be more akin to a hotel, but in others, the physical structure may mean that it is more like a standard residential apartment building. Unlike hotels, it is not straightforward to distinguish them from properties typically suitable for owner occupation. 14. A carveout allowing owners of serviced apartments to claim interest deductions may lead to the conversion of regular apartments into serviced apartments, which would reduce effective housing supply. However, the chapter acknowledges that a carveout for serviced apartments that more closely resemble hotels might be warranted and seeks submissions on how such a carveout might be designed to prevent standard residential apartments from being converted into serviced apartments. Māori land and housing 15. Papakāinga and kaumātua housing have different features that may distinguish them from properties easily substitutable for owner-occupation. These may provide reasons to exclude them from the scope of the interest limitation rules. However, there are definitional issues around papakāinga and kaumātua housing, as these are not defined in legislation and some differences exist between the way in which Te Puni Kōkiri (TPK) thinks of papakāinga housing and the way in which it is more widely understood in tikanga Māori. Note that Māori entities also provide rental housing on general title land to the general public and in this case they could be treated like any other landlord on the general rental market. 16. Additionally, there are numerous permutations of how such housing is provided, including the type of legal title, ownership structures, and purposes, which create significant complexity. We are working with TPK to develop a clearer picture of the landscape of Māori housing and the most common ownership scenarios. Given the complexities, the discussion document is intended to facilitate a discussion of the relevant issues being faced, rather than to provide a concrete proposal. Business premises and dual-purpose buildings 17. The bright-line test definition of residential land contains a carve-out for land that is predominantly used as business premises, which operates on an all-or -nothing basis: if more than 50 percent of a given property is used as business premises, it is fully excluded; if 50 percent or less is used as business premises, it is fully included. This test is deliberately simple to reduce complexity for the bright-line test, but in the context of interest limitation it may lead to harsh outcomes where interest deductions on a given property are wholly denied or wholly allowed on the basis of a few square metres or a few days. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 6 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. The discussion document seeks feedback on whether an apportionment approach could be used for interest limitation. This proposal was of significant interest to the ERG, and it is likely to be addressed in a number of submissions. Short-stay accommodation 19. Another potentially contentious issue is the proposed application of the interest limitation rules to short-stay accommodation. As mentioned above, the discussion document proposes (in line with the treatment under the bright-line test) to include short-stay accommodation in what would otherwise be residential houses in the scope of interest limitation, while excluding commercial accommodation like hotels (again in line with the existing rules). While this is not a departure from the present rules, it might be controversial to draw a distinction between these two different forms of short-term accommodation. However, it is important to include short-stay accommodation provided in a dwelling as it ensures there is no income tax advantage for providing short-stay accommodation versus long-term rental accommodation. Entities affected by interest limitation (chapter 3) Companies 20. Companies are generally allowed deductions for interest incurred, without needing to trace the use of their borrowed funds. This chapter proposes to override that general rule for close companies and residential property-rich companies so that taxpayers cannot get around the interest limitation proposal by using companies to borrow to acquire residential properties. The chapter proposes that residential property-rich companies would be those for which residential property makes up more than 50 per cent of the value of their total assets. Kāinga Ora and other organisations 21. Kāinga Ora provides social housing but, unlike some other social housing providers, is not a charity or registered community housing provider. It therefore cannot use existing tax exemptions that are available to charities and registered community housing providers. The discussion document proposes to exclude Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries from the application of the interest limitation rules. 22. It is not proposed that any other organisations will be excluded from the interest limitation rules but submissions are sought on this. Interest subject to limitation (chapter 4) 23. Chapter 4 proposes that a tracing approach will generally be followed for the purposes of the interest limitation rules. This was previously agreed by Ministers (IR2021/133, T2021/847 refers). To work out if interest on a loan is subject to limitation, the taxpayer must trace the use of the borrowed funds. Under the proposed rules, if a taxpayer uses a loan for purposes relating to residential property (for example, to acquire the property or pay rates and insurance for the property), interest on that loan would be subject to limitation. Pre-effective date loans 24. In our earlier joint report (IR2021/133, T2021/847 refer), we noted there may be some instances where an approach other than tracing may be needed. One such case is for pre-effective date loans (pre-ED loans), that were drawn down and used IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 7 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] for more than one purpose before 27 March 2021. For example, a taxpayer may have a pre-ED loan that has been used for both residential rental and other business purposes in the past, and the taxpayer may not have the records to trace retrospectively because they previously did not need to distinguish between the two purposes (all interest was deductible). 25. The discussion document suggests two possible approaches for these situations. The first approach is apportionment, where taxpayers may apportion their pre-ED loans across their assets based on their original cost. The second approach is stacking, where pre-ED loans are “stacked” against non-residential business assets first. The stacking approach would mean that if the market value of taxpayers’ non- residential business assets exceeds the value of their pre-ED loans, the taxpayer gets full interest deductibility on the pre-ED loans. While this may appear quite generous, well-advised taxpayers would usually be able to achieve the same result by restructuring their affairs under tracing anyway (and it is likely to be very difficult and costly to challenge this as tax avoidance). The stacking approach has been proposed as it would avoid restructuring costs and allow less well-advised taxpayers to achieve the same tax outcomes as well-advised ones. This is also only a transitional issue. High water mark proposal 26. Another in-principle decision taken by Cabinet was that further borrowing on or after 27 March 2021 that relates to residential properties acquired (or treated as acquired) before that date will not result in deductible interest (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). 27. If a borrower has a variable balance loan, such as a revolving credit facility, technically each withdrawal is new borrowing even though, over time, the balance may remain relatively constant or decline. Tracing each transaction from such an account would incur high compliance costs relative to the amount of each transaction and could incentivise inefficient behaviour. For example, taxpayers may defer principal repayments that would have otherwise been made so that money is available to spend at a later date without being new borrowing. 28. The discussion document proposes a concession to allow a borrower to make withdrawals that were traced to a pre-ED residential property without interest on that borrowing becoming immediately non-deductible, but only up to the loan balance set on 26 March 2021 (or a later date when the property is treated as acquired by that date). This is referred to in the document as the high water mark proposal. This concession will reduce compliance costs, prevent tax influencing financing decisions and will have no impact on tax deductions after the expiry of the transitional phasing period. Disposals of property subject to interest limitation (chapter 5) 29. A qu estion that arises concerns whether interest expense that was previously disallowed under the interest limitation rules should be deductible at the time of sale of the property. This area is the one that is most open for major policy decisions that could have a large impact on the final tax position of a rental property investor, so it is likely to attract many submissions. 30. There are a number of dimensions to this: 30.1 Taxable (revenue account) sales: As all income is taxed, there is an argument that all expenses should be deductible. Cabinet recommended that officials consult on the treatment of denied interest deductions in the case of residential investment property that was held on revenue account (that is, taxable on sale) (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 8 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 30.2 Non-taxable (capital account) sales: The capital gain on sale is not taxed, so arguably interest expense should not be deductible. However, there is an argument for deducting interest to the extent it exceeds any non- taxable capital gain. Ministers have indicated that officials may consult on whether some portion of interest may be deducted on capital account sales where appropriate. 30.3 Gaming opportunities: Having different rules for allowing deductions on revenue account and capital account may create opportunities to choose different treatments for different tax results. 31. The greater the extent to which an interest deduction is allowed on sale, the more an initial disallowance of the deduction is converted to a deferral of the deduction, thus reducing the overall impact on the housing market but potentially increasing fairness and tax efficiency. 32. Chapter 5 discusses these issues and options to address them. Exemptions Property development and related activities (chapter 6) 33. Cabinet has agreed in principle that property developers should be provided an exemption from the interest limitation rules (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). This will allow developers to continue deducting their interest expenses related to the development as they are incurred. 34. It would be desirable for the exemption to be wide in scope to encompass development activity which may result in the construction of a new build (as defined in chapter 7). Chapter 6 outlines that the exemption is intended to cover: 34.1 land being developed by persons in the business of developing or dealing land, or erecting buildings (captured under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007); and 34.2 other developments which may not be covered under section CB 7, for example, persons undertaking a one-off development or developing properties to rent themselves (if not already in the business of developing or dealing in land or erecting buildings). Remediation 35. The chapter proposes that some remediation qualify for the development exemption. 36. Remediation work can take many forms and is therefore an area where it may be difficult to create clear boundaries on whether it should qualify for the development exemption. Remediation work may extend the life of older buildings or simply make a building habitable. On the other hand, those who engage in one-off renovations which do not extend the life of the building (for example, improving a kitchen or bathroom) should not be able to claim the development exemption. Excluding remediation entirely may adversely affect heritage buildings, disincentivising their restoration. This may give rise to boundary issues between what is and what is not qualifying remediation work. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 9 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] New builds (chapters 7 to 9) What is a new build? (chapter 7) 37. Cabinet has agreed in principle that a new build is exempt from the proposed interest limitation rules and that a five-year bright-line test will apply instead of the extended 10-year bright-line test (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). 38. Chapter 7 sets out the proposed definition of a “new build”. It proposes that a property should only qualify as a new build where a self-contained dwelling (with its own kitchen and bathroom) has been added to residential land and the dwelling has received a code compliance certificate (CCC). The chapter refers to three categories of new builds: simple new builds (where a dwelling is added to bare residential land), complex new builds (where a dwelling is added to land shared with one of more existing dwellings), and commercial to residential conversions (where a commercial building is converted into one or more dwellings). 39. It is proposed that a new build would include new dwellings as well as existing dwellings that are modified so that the number of dwellings on the land has increased. This could include where an existing dwelling is converted into multiple dwellings (for example, a six-bedroom house that is converted into three townhouses), adding a relocated house to land, and converting a commercial office block into apartments. Using existing building materials is more environmentally friendly and may increase housing stock more quickly than building completely new dwellings. 40. Where an existing dwelling is replaced with one or more new dwellings it is proposed this would qualify as a new build, even if there is no increase to the number of dwellings on the land. While one-for -one replacements may not clearly increase housing stock, it would be administratively difficult to ascertain what was on the land prior to the construction of the new build, and it could be hard to enforce a rule that excludes one-for -one replacements. 41. It is proposed that existing dwellings that are renovated would not be eligible for the new build exemption, because renovations alone do not clearly increase housing supply. The chapter consults on whether there might be a way to verify that a dwelling that was previously uninhabitable has been substantially renovated so that it is of a similar standard to a new build. Exemption from interest limitation (chapter 8) 42. Cabinet has agreed in principle to consult on how to exempt property purchased on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of receiving its CCC from the proposed interest limitation rules (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). 43. Chapter 8 sets out the proposed design of the new build exemption from the interest limitation rules (the new build exemption). It proposes that early owners (those who acquire a new build no later than 12 months after its CCC is issued, or add a new build to their land) would be eligible for the new build exemption. This differs slightly from what Cabinet agreed, because the chapter proposes the date of acquisition be irrelevant to whether a property is considered a new build – instead what is important is whether a CCC for a new build was issued on or after 27 March 2021, and (for early owners) whether the property was acquired no later than 12 months after CCC was issued. 44. This is consistent with what Ministers agreed for new builds acquired off the plans before 27 March that receive their CCCs on or after that date (IR2021/181 refers). It means that a person who already owns land as at 27 March 2021 who decides to IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 10 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] add a new dwelling to the land after that date would be eligible for the new build exemption, which is consistent with the objective of increasing new housing supply. 45. The impact of the new build exemption on house prices and on the supply of new builds will depend on both the length of the exemption and whether it can be passed on to subsequent investors: Impact on house prices 45.1 Length of the exemption: A longer exemption allows for more interest deductions by investors. Therefore, a longer exemption will dampen house prices by less than a shorter exemption. 45.2 Ability to pass on the exemption: The ability to pass on the exemption to subsequent purchasers supports resale value and will dampen house prices by less than if the exemption cannot be passed on. Impact on supply of new builds 45.3 Supply response: The removal of interest deductibility could reduce the incentive to build in the short run, by reducing house prices. Since longer exemptions have less impact on house prices, it follows that longer exemptions and allowing the exemption to be passed on to subsequent buyers could have less negative impact on housing supply than shorter exemptions. However, the extent to which interest limitation will reduce housing supply remains unclear. 46. The chapter consults on how long the exemption should apply to early owners for. Options mentioned include applying the exemption in perpetuity or for a fixed period such as 10 or 20 years. 47. The chapter consults on whether subsequent purchasers (those who acquire a new build more than 12 months after the new build’s CCC is issued and within a fixed period such as 10 or 20 years from the date that CCC is issued) should qualify for the exemption. It also consults on what fixed period the exemption should apply to subsequent purchasers, should they be eligible for the exemption. 48. If the Government decides that the exemption applies to subsequent purchasers, the chapter proposes that subsequent purchasers would only be able to apply the exemption to new builds that receive their CCC on or after 27 March 2021. This differs from early owners. The Government has already announced the exemption would apply to early owners of new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that received their CCCs before 27 March, provided the new build is acquired no later than 12 months after its CCC is issued. The reason for only allowing subsequent purchasers to access the exemption for new builds that receive their CCCs on or after 27 March 2021 is to make the rules simpler, so the only information a subsequent purchaser has to refer to when determining whether the exemption applies is the date a new build’s CCC was issued. 49. The chapter consults on whether a new build should cease to qualify for the exemption once it has been used as a main home, regardless of whether it is rented out in the future. It also consults on whether special rules should be put in place to ensure large-scale purpose-built rental developments continue to be feasible in New Zealand. Five-year new build bright-line test (chapter 9) 50. Cabinet has agreed that new builds will be exempt from the 10-year bright-line test and instead the existing five-year bright-line test will apply. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 11 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 51. Chapter 9 sets out the proposed design of the five-year new build bright-line test. It proposes that the new build bright-line test would apply the settings of the 10- year bright-line test (such as the new time-based apportionment rule for the main home exclusion), but with a five-year bright-line period. In line with the standard bright-line test rules, the new build bright-line period would begin on the date the person receives title to the land regardless of when a new build is added. The new build must receive its CCC by the time it is sold for the new build bright-line test to apply. Rollover relief (chapter 10) 52. Chapter 10 proposes that rollover relief would apply to transfers of residential property in certain situations for the purposes of the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rules. What is rollover? 53. Rollover relief is not an exemption from income tax. Generally speaking, rollover simply defers the taxing point until there is a subsequent disposal of the property that does not qualify for rollover relief. Rollover relief essentially disregards an intervening disposal by treating the transfer as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. For the purposes of the bright-line test, this also involves deeming the recipient to take on the transferor’s original date of acquisition. 54. Limited rollover relief is currently available under the bright-line test. Rollover relief is currently only provided for residential land transferred under a relationship property agreement and for amalgamations. However, full relief is provided in relation to inherited property and it is effectively exempted from the bright-line test. Proposals 55. In the context of the interest limitation proposal, rollover relief is being proposed to ensure that an existing property owner can still benefit from the full four-year phase-out period even if they change how they hold a property, provided there is no change in economic ownership. Rollover relief is also proposed for the interest limitation if the new build exemption is to apply to early or initial purchasers of new builds in perpetuity. 56. For the bright-line test, the proposals in this chapter would ensure that taxpayers are not brought into the bright-line test simply because they would like to settle a property on trust, for example. 57. For interest limitation, the discussion document proposes that rollover relief would be provided regardless of whether there is no consideration, partial consideration, or full consideration for the transfer of the land. However, for the bright-line test, rollover relief would be limited to situations where there is no consideration due to complexities with apportionment that would need to be accounted for. 58. As a starting point, the discussion document proposes to extend the existing relief provided for the bright-line test to the interest limitation rules (that is, for transfers under relationship property settlements, on death, and as part of a company amalgamation). It also proposes that rollover relief would be available in the following situations: 58.1 Natural persons disposing of land to themselves, for example, transferring land from sole ownership to joint tenancy or from joint tenancy to tenants in common; IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 12 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 58.2 Settling land on trust, provided that: every settlor of the land is also a beneficiary of the trust; at least one of the settlors of the land is a principal settlor of the trust; and every beneficiary (excluding the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors) is associated with a principal settlor; 58.3 Transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) where the persons disposing of the land to the LTC (or acquiring it from the LTC) are all shareholders in the LTC in proportion to their individual interests in the land and in proportion to their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land; 58.4 Transfers to or from partnerships where the persons disposing of the land (or acquiring it from the partnership) are all partners in the partnership and their respective partnership interests are in proportion to their individual interests in the land and in proportion to their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land. 59. The chapter does not seek to address all possible structures used to hold residential property, merely the most common scenarios where integrity risk is limited and focusses on structures that are likely to be used by unsophisticated investors. Officials consider that family trusts, look-through companies, and partnerships would cover a major segment of the population. 60. Stakeholders are likely to request rollover relief or a full exemption for other transactions that can result in an income tax liability arising under the bright-line test, often in the context of family arrangements where the taxpayer is not aware of the potential tax consequences of their actions. 61. For example, parents may help their children onto the property ladder by gifting them residential land or selling it to them below market value (for example, at cost). Under the Income Tax Act 2007, these transactions are deemed to occur at market value. This is an important feature of New Zealand’s tax system to ensure integrity and fairness, as it provides a backstop against abuse and tax avoidance behaviour. However, it can create cash-flow difficulties when an income tax liability arises under the bright-line test. 62. These transactions are not dealt with in the discussion document due to the primary focus on the proposed interest limitation rules, and the complexity and numerous iterations of these arrangements. Any proposals would need to be carefully considered within the broader context of the tax system and ensure that the risk of abuse is minimised. Technical issues Interposed entities (chapter 11) 63. Chapter 11 proposes interposed entity rules to support the integrity of the interest limitation rules. Under current law, taxpayers are normally allowed interest deductions on loans used to acquires shares in a company. Without interposed entity rules, a taxpayer could claim an interest deduction for borrowings used to acquire shares in a company that owns residential property (the company is “interposed” between the shareholder’s borrowing and the residential property). 64. The discussion document therefore proposes to deny interest deductions on loans used to acquire ownership interests in an entity (the “interposed entity”), if the entity holds a certain amount of residential property subject to interest limitation (“affected assets”). 1 For interposed close companies and trusts, the amount of 1 “Affected assets” would not include new builds or properties that qualify for the development exemption. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 13 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] interest denied is proportionate to the amount of affected assets held, by value. For widely held interposed entities, all interest is proposed to be denied if more than 50 percent of the entity’s total assets are affected assets. 65. The tax treatment under the proposed interposed entity rules is harsher in three respects than if the residential property were held directly by the borrower: 65.1 Full interest denial for interests in widely held interposed entities: As noted above, it is proposed that full denial will apply for widely-held interposed entities. This may deny interest on loans partly used, indirectly, for non-residential purposes. For example, a taxpayer who borrows to acquire shares in a widely held company owning 70 percent residential rentals (old builds) and 30 percent new builds by value will be denied 100 percent of their interest expenditure, rather than 70 percent. 65.2 No phasing: For all existing interposed entity structures, interest incurred by the borrower on or after 1 October 2021 will be subject to full denial. 65.3 Treatment on sale: Chapter 5 outlines options for the treatment of interest expenditure when a taxpayer who directly holds residential land sells the land. Most options allow previously denied interest deductions in some circumstances (for example, if the sale is taxed). The proposed interposed entity rules do not allow previously denied interest deductions in any circumstances (for example, if the entity sells its residential land for a taxable gain). This may be perceived as inconsistent with the options suggested in Chapter 5. 66. Officials have suggested the proposed tax treatment due to simplicity. It is expected that existing interposed entity structures are not widespread. The proposed rules would create a further disincentive to use such structures. Implications for rental loss ring-fencing (chapter 12) 67. The existing resident ial loss ring-fencing (RLR) rules restrict the tax benefits of residential property investments. The interest limitation rules will further reduce tax benefits from such investments. There will likely be significant interplay between the proposed interest limitation rules and the existing RLR rules. 68. Chapter 12 discusses the overlap of the RLR rules and the proposed interest limitation rules and the proposed exemptions, and the technical issues that are likely to arise. The chapter also raises the question of whether the new build exemption should be an exemption for RLR as well as interest limitation. Doing this would give greater effect to the new build exemption and simplify the interaction of the rules, but it would also reduce the tax impost on some (new build) residential property compared with the current rules. Interaction with mixed-use asset (MUA) rules (chapter 13) 69. The focus of the proposed interest limitation rules is on debt relating to residential investment property, but they will also apply to baches and other second homes if they are used to earn income. Chapter 13 considers how the proposal will be coordinated with the existing mixed-use asset (MUA) rules, recognising that: 69.1 the MUA rules have their own allocation rule and interposed entity rules that apply when a MUA is owned by a close company; and 69.2 the interest limitation rule means that not all MUAs will be treated the same way in terms of interest deductibility. IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 14 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Administrative impacts 70. Limiting interest deductions will involve increased administration costs for Inland Revenue over an extended period while different rules based on the acquisition date and nature of properties continue to be in place. These costs will arise from managing an increased number of customer contacts and supporting the integrity of the rules. This means a mixture of providing people with information to increase awareness and making sure that Inland Revenue uses its full range of interventions to support customers in meeting their obligations right from the start, through to enforcement action, where there is clear evidence of deliberate non-compliance. This will involve: 70.1 ongoing proactive marketing and targeted education campaigns, followed by one-on -one interventions such as community compliance visits and integrity checks; 70.2 developing appropriate tools to assist customers to determine eligibility; 70.3 improving our data and analytical capability; and 70.4 taking audit action to address deliberate non-compliance. 71. Inland Revenue will work with The Treasury to consider the costs to support the administration of the rules and options to fund these changes, and will confirm this in the September Cabinet paper. Fiscal implications 72. Limiting interest deductions will raise revenue within the forecast period and officials will provide an estimate of this revenue in the report on submissions due in early September. The report will seek final policy approval for design and include the draft Cabinet paper. Communications 73. A communications plan is being developed between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. The focus is on gaining detailed feedback from professional bodies in the tax and property communities. Each agency will be contacting key stakeholders to encourage them to make a submission. The discussion document will be hosted on Inland Revenue's tax policy website, and submissions will be made by email. 74. We also expect there to be interest in what is being consulted on from owners of multiple residential properties and their tax agents. We are not planning to proactively communicate with or solicit submissions from the public. However, to help them understand the scope of the consultation we will be producing five or six summary sheets covering the main issues and pointing them to the discussion document for technical detail. We do not intend to distribute these widely, but for them to be available on the tax policy website. 75. Media queries will be directed to Inland Revenue's Policy communications staff, who will work with the relevant Ministers' Offices to coordinate responses. Next steps 76. The discussion document will be released for public consultation in early June, with public consultation on the proposals open for five weeks. The next steps following the closing date for submissions are as follows: IR2021/231; T2021/1377: Discussion document – Design of the interest limitation rules and additional bright line rules Page 15 of 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • 2 September – Report on submissions and final policy approval for design with draft Cabinet paper. • 16 September – Lodgement of Cabinet paper. • 22 September – Consideration by the Economic Development Committee (DEV). • 27 September – Consideration by Cabinet. • Late September – Release of Supplementary Order Paper.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Minister of Finance Minister of Housing Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet RELEASE OF DISCUSSION DOCUMENT – DESIGN OF THE INTEREST LIMITATION A ND ADDITIONAL BRIGHT-LINE RULES Proposal 1. Cabinet previously agreed in principle to limit deductions for interest incurred on re sidential investment property and to exempt new builds from both the proposed interest limitation rules and the extended bright-line test. Cabinet also directed officials to consult with stakeholders on the design details before seeking final decisions from Cabinet (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). Attached to this paper is a draft Discussion Document on the detailed design of the rules. Minor changes may be made to the Discussion Document before it is released. 2. We intend to release the Discussion Document Design of the interest limitation and additional bright-line rules in June, followed by 5 weeks for consultation. The aim is for Cabinet consideration of the final policy design to occur on 27 September, and for the legislation implementing these changes to be released in late September 2021. 3. The Discussion Document consults on: 4. Residential property affected by the interest limitation rules (chapter 2). T he chapter proposes that the rules would cover residential property located in New Zealand (excluding the family home). It outlines the issues in defining the types of property that would be impacted by the rules. The chapter proposes that a main home used to earn income would not be subject to the rules. In other words, an owner-occupier who rents out part of their home can continue to deduct interest against that rental income. 5. Entities affected by the interest limitation rules (chapter 3). T he chapter proposes, as a starting point, that all taxpayers would be subject to the interest limitation rules. However, companies are generally allowed deductions for interest without needing to trace the use of their borrowed funds. It is proposed that the interest limitation rules would override this general rule for closely-held companies and residential investment property-rich companies, so that taxpayers cannot get around the rules by using such companies to borrow to acquire residential investment property. The chapter also proposes that the rules would not apply to Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 10:54:17 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Interest subject to limitation (chapter 4). Where a loan is used for a mixture of taxable and non-taxable purposes it is already necessary to trace what the loan is used for to determine deductibility (unless the borrower is a company). This chapter proposes the same approach be applied for loans used to fund residential investment property. It also covers refinancing an existing loan and transitional issues relating to debt drawn down on properties acquired before 27 March 2021. Disposals of property subject to interest limitation (chapter 5). This chapter considers whether interest deductions should be allowed in some cases when capital gains are taxed upon the disposal of a property. Allowing interest to be deducted on disposal where capital gains are taxable would better align the rules with income tax principles, by allowing expenses to be recognised when income is fully taxed. Exemption for property development (chapter 6). T he Government has decided in-principle that property development should be exempt from the proposed interest limitation rules. This is consistent with the policy objective of increasing housing supply through the construction of new builds. This chapter considers the definition of “development” and the scope of the development exemption. It also considers options for applying the exemption to one-off developments and to land dealers. Exemption for new builds (chapters 7, 8 and 9). T he Government has decided that newly-built residential properties should be exempt from the proposed interest limitation rules, and that a 5-year bright-line test will apply to new builds instead of the extended 10-year bright-line test. Chapter 7 proposes a definition of a “new build” for these purposes. Chapter 8 considers the design of the new build exemption from the proposed interest limitation rule, including the period for which the new build exemption would apply and whether it should apply to the initial (or early) purchaser or to the property for a fixed period (such as 20 years). Chapter 9 considers the design of the five-year new build bright-line test. Rollover relief (chapter 10). T his chapter proposes some limited rollover relief to deal with transfers to trusts, as well as transfers where there is no significant change in ownership. Rollovers are disposals that are disregarded for the purposes of applying some provisions. The chapter is relevant to both the proposed interest limitation rules and the bright-line test. Technical design issues (chapters 11, 12 and 13). C hapter 11 proposes interposed entity rules. These rules would ensure that taxpayers cannot claim interest deductions for borrowings used to acquire residential investment property indirectly through an interposed entity. Chapters 12 and 13 cover how the interest limitation rules would interact with other tax rules such as the rental loss ring-fencing rules (which restrict the tax benefits of residential investment property) and the mixed-use asset rules (which is where a property is used partly to derive income, partly for private use, and is not in use for a period of time – for example, a bach). Compliance and administration (chapter 14). T his chapter considers the administrative aspects of the proposed interest limitation rules and the changes to the bright-line test. It outlines the Government’s proposed approach to administering these changes so that the rules work, taxpayers comply with them, and the Government has sufficient information to assess their effectiveness. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 10:54:17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial Implications 13. Releasing the Discussion Document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Legislative Implications 14. The release of the Discussion Document will not give rise to any immediate l egislative implications. Legislative changes will be necessary to implement the proposals. It is proposed that the changes are included in a Supplementary Order Paper to an omnibus taxation bill in late September 2021. Impact Analysis 15. A RIA panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed and confirmed, the Discussion D ocument substitutes for an interim Regulatory Impact Statement. The Discussion Document is likely to lead to effective consultation and support the delivery of quality Regulatory Impact Analysis to inform subsequent decisions. Population Implications 16. Releasing the Discussion Document will not have any population implications. Any p opulation implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Human Rights 17. The proposals contained in the Discussion Document are not inconsistent with the N ew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Communications 18. Communications will be undertaken by Inland Revenue, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and Te Puni Kōkiri. The goal is to gain d etailed feedback from the tax, property and Māori communities. Each Department will contact key stakeholders to encourage them to make a submission. The Discussion Document will be hosted on Inland Revenue's tax policy website, and submissions will be made by email. 19. There is expected to be interest from owners of multiple residential properties and t heir tax agents. Officials will not proactively communicate with or solicit submissions from the public. However, to help the public understand the scope of the consultation, six summary sheets (drafts attached) will be produced covering the main issues.

Early decisions on these issues are sought because they will be key to the design of the final policy, proposed for our report in late August. This report also seeks decisions on two matters that are more technical in nature ahead of the August report. Key policy design decisions Design of the new build exemption The design of the new build exemption will have the most impact on meeting your housing objectives, and will impact the other key policy design decisions. The discussion document consulted on whether to: •only allow interest deductions on new builds for the initial purchasers of those new builds; or •al low interest deductions on new builds to be claimed for a fixed period starting whe n t he code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued . I f there is a new build exemption, officials recommend that a fixed-period new build exemption for both initial and subsequent purchasers is adopted. This would support resale value for new builds, reduce economic inefficiencies, and minimise compliance and administrative costs. The discussion document included the following options for the length of the new build exemption: •10 years; or •20 years. A new build exemption will shift investor demand to new builds. The effect of this will be to reduce the impact that removing the deductibility of interest has on moderating house price growth. This is because the new build exemption will lead investors to value new IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 3 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] builds closer to how they were valued prior to the tax change. A longer new build exemption would further reduce the impact that the policy has on moderating house price growth. The new build exemption will not just affect demand for new builds. In response to leveraged investors moving into the new build market, owner-occupiers and equity investors will purchase fewer new builds and more existing homes. That means that the length of the new build exemption determines the impact that interest limitation has on the demand for, and growth in prices of, both new and existing homes. The Treasury expects relative prices between new builds and existing homes to remain unchanged over time. Where house price inflation is less than it otherwise would have been as a result of removing interest deducibility, the supply of housing may be impacted. The degree to which supply is impacted is determined by the competitiveness of urban land markets. Where the supply of land is not flexible, a shorter new build exemption that leads to lower house price growth will have only a minor negative impact on housing supply and rents even in the medium term. Where land that can be used for housing is in abundant supply, we would expect that slower house price growth would reduce incentives to build relative to a longer exemption. There is therefore a trade-off between a shorter new build exemption that would maximise the effect that interest limitation has on house price inflation, and, if land markets are relatively competitive, a longer exemption that would minimise any impact on housing supply. Agencies take different views on this trade-off. The Treasury is of the view that there should be no new build exemption, and that if there is one it should be as short as possible. The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that urban land markets are relatively uncompetitive. Therefore, the impact that limitation of interest deductions has on rents and housing supply in the medium term will be small, and a longer exemption for new builds will simply reduce the impact of the measure on house price inflation and undermine the Government’s housing market objectives. The Treasury’s analysis suggests that a 20-year new build exemption would have only a marginal, if any, impact on house price growth. I nland Revenue recommends a longer new build exemption to minimise impacts on supply. While the markets for new builds and existing housing are clearly very closely rel ated, Inland Revenue does not consider them perfect substitutes given the location, typology, and quality of new builds will often be materially different than existing houses. Inland Revenue agrees that there is likely to be some trade-off when setting the length of s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 4 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] any new build exemption. A longer exemption is likely to mean less downward pressure on house prices. But it considers that in the long run affordability is unlikely to be promoted by measures which reduce the supply of housing and for this reason supports a longer new build exemption. The discussion document also consulted on the idea of a “continued investment” rule, which would prevent deductions from being claimed under the new build exemption after a new build is owned by an owner-occupier. Almost all submissions were opposed to the continued investment rule and officials do not recommend it. Treatment of interest deductions when a property is sold Whether to permanently deny interest deductions for residential property investors, or to merely defer them until a property is sold, is a key design decision. The discussion document consulted on the following options: •Permanently denying all interest deductions subject to the interest limitation rule. •Allowing interest deductions when a property is subject to tax on sale (for example, because it is caught by the bright-line rule). •Allowing all interest deductions, except to the extent there is an untaxed increase in value of the property. Permanently denying all interest deductions will maximise the impact that the policy has on reducing investor demand for housing and moderating house price growth. This is because deferral will reduce the likelihood of an investor being “over-taxed” on their investment. Officials consider however that the impact of this design decision on investor demand will be significantly smaller than your decision on the length of the new build exemption. Officials also note that, even if interest deductions are deferred rather than permanently denied, investors will be worse of compared to the status quo. Allowing interest deductions to offset the tax paid on the gain of property sales will reduce the tax collected on those sales. Officials do not yet have an estimate of this fiscal impact, but it will be incorporated into the fiscal estimate for the final advice report in August. Officials recommend that interest deductions be allowed to offset the tax paid by investors on the sale of their properties. When all of the income from owning a property is taxed, officials consider there is a strong fairness argument for allowing all of the deductions. Officials consider that these deductions should be limited so that they can only be used to offset tax on the gains on sale of property. This would reduce the integrity risks that could arise if taxpayers could offset deductions against their other income. Purpose-built rentals Some submitters have proposed allowing a specific exemption for “purpose-built rentals” (PBR) from the interest limitation rules. These are properties that are owned and operated by a single entity w ith the intention of holding them as long-term rentals, rather than selling them in the short term for capital gains. While PBR will be eligible for the developer exemption while they are being built, as well as the new build exemption for the length of that exemption, some submitters in the PBR IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 5 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] industry believed there was a case for carving PBR out of the interest limitation rule altogether. Their argument was that any prospect of their interest deductions being denied in the future would reduce the likelihood of any PBR being constructed now. Transitional, emergency and public housing Most properties owned by community housing providers (CHPs) will be exempt from the interest limitation rule, due to their status as charities or because of other specific tax exemptions in the Income Tax Act. Kāinga Ora and its wholly owned subsidiaries will also be exempt from the interest limitation rules. As such, the public housing owned by Kāinga Ora will also be unaffected by the interest limitation rules. However, public housing properties that CHPs or Kāinga Ora manage but lease from private landlords will not be exempt. In addition, public housing provided by council- controlled organisations (which, unlike councils, are subject to income tax) will also not be exempt. HUD considers that transitional, emergency and public housing, regardless of the ownership of the property it is provided in, merits an exemption from interest limitation. Without an exemption, landlords leasing their properties to CHPs or to g overnment for public housing will face a higher tax cost, and we would expect to see a reduction in the amount of transitional, emergency and public housing provided, or a higher cost to CHPs or the Government in procuring these places. There are currently over 24,000 applicants on the public housing register and HUD does not want to exacerbate this issue. The Treasury and Inland Revenue recommend that you do not provide an explicit exclusion for public housing. An exemption is likely to add further complexity. All for-profit landlords should be subject to the same tax rules, whether they lease their property to a CHP, to government or to other tenants. An exemption could discourage landlords from renting directly to tenants if it is possible that a CHP or g overnment agency would be interested in the property. If the Government wanted to mitigate the effects of the interest limitation policy on the supply of public housing it could do this directly by providing more funding to public housing. This would give it greater control over the amount of subsidy given and would ensure that for-profit landlords are taxed equally, whether the landlord leases their property to a CHP, to government or to other tenants. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 6 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Other issues Ministerial direction is also sought on the following matters: •Whether the transitional rule proposed in the discussion document should be modified so that any new build receiving its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 would qualify for the new build exemption, regardless of when it was acquired. •Whether the interest limitation rules should apply to ground lessors. Next steps Officials will report to you on our final policy recommendations in late August. Once Ministers have made decisions on the final policy design, we will provide Ministers with a draft Cabinet paper and Supplementary Analysis Report on 9 September.

Early decisions on these issues are sought because they will be key to the design of the final policy, proposed for our report in late August. This report also seeks decisions on two matters that are more technical in nature ahead of the August report. Background 2.The discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright- line rules was publicly released on 10 June 2021. Submissions closed on 12 July 2021 and 484 submissions were received. The majority of the submissions were from private landlords, although some were from tax advisors, property investors’ representative groups, real estate agents, iwi groups, property developers and engineers. 3.The discussion document outlined that deductibility of interest expenses incurred by residential property investors will be restricted from 1 October 2021. I nterest on non-new build residential investment properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 will be denied in full. For properties purchased before 27 March 2021, interest deductions will be gradually phased out. 4.Nearly all submitters were opposed to the interest limitation proposal. Other tha n ex pressing opposition to the proposal, the main themes from submissions were as follows: 4.1 A number of submitters considered that the proposed exclusions from the scope of the rules are not sufficient and other categories of residential property ought to be excluded. Common suggestions were explicit exclusions for all public housing and multi-unit properties where the units are all on the same title. 4.2 The subject of new builds came up frequently in the submissions, in particular, how long the new build exemption should apply for and to whom. Most submitters wanted the exemption to apply to subsequent purchasers as well as initial owners. Several submitters requested that properties purchased as new builds before 27 March 2021 also be covered by the exemption. 4.3 Nearly all submitters supported the proposal to use tracing as the general interest allocation approach, even though several noted that tracing can be complex and difficult. 5.Further detail on the points raised in submissions is contained in Appendix 1 to this report. 6.The key policy design decisions arising from the consultation process mainly relate to the scope of property covered by the proposed interest limitation rules, the design of the new build exemption, and disposals of property subject to interest limitation. These issues and officials’ recommendations are outlined below. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 11 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Extent of the new build exemption 7.The discussion document consulted on who should qualify for the new build exemption and how long the exemption should apply for. Options we consulted on included applying the exemption : 7.1 in perpetuity for initial owners; 7.2 for a fixed period from the date a new build receives its code compliance certificate ( CCC) for all owners of a new build; 7.3 in perpetuity for initial owners and for a fixed period from the date a new build receives its CCC for subsequent purchasers. 8.Most submissions received on the new build exemption concerned its length and application. Some submitters favoured an exemption that applies to all owners of a new build for a period of time, ranging from a shorter exemption (for example, 10 years) to one that applies in perpetuity. Others preferred an exemption that only applies to initial owners of a new build, with a range of views on how long it should apply for. 9.The Treasury, Inland Revenue and Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housin g a nd Urban Development (HUD) recommend the exemption apply to all owners of a new build for a fixed period from the date a new build’s CCC is issued, for the reasons set out in the analysis below. If you agree with the recommendation, then you will need to decide how long that fixed period should be. The options are a limited exemption (for example, 10 years) or an extensive exemption (for example, 20 years). The factors you will need to take into account are set out below. 10.The discussion document also consulted on whether there should be an additional requirement for new builds, so that a property can only qualify for the new build exemption if it has always been used as a rental property (this is referred to as the “continued investment” rule). The continued investment rule is considered after the analysis on the length and application of the exemption below. Analysis 11.The length of the new build exemption will have the largest impact on the Government’s housing market objectives. 12.These impacts are uncertain, and depend on judgements about how competitive or uncompetitive urban land markets are and therefore how much and how quickly housing supply responds to economic signals such as price. Where the supply of land is constrained, the impact of the policy will mainly be felt as a reduction in the price of land and there will be little effect on housing supply. Where the supply of land is flexible, and therefore fixed in price, this policy may reduce incentives to build because the price of homes may fall relative to the price of land. In that case, we would expect slower house price growth to reduce incentives to build. 13.The Treasury and HUD have different views on these judgements and therefore the impacts of the different options, and how they affect the Government’s housing market objectives. In summary: 13.1 House prices: The Treasury and HUD agree that a longer new build exemption would reduce the impact that interest limitation would have on moderating the rate of growth in house prices, although they take different views on the extent of this. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 12 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13.2 The Treasury’s analysis suggests that a 20-year (or longer) exemption would have only a marginal, if any, impact on house price growth for either new or existing homes. HUD considers that the interest limitation rules could still have an impact on house price growth even with a 20-year (or longer) new build exemption. 13.3 Housing supply and rents: The Treasury’s analysis suggests that interest limitation is unlikely to be any significant impact on the supply of housing (and rents) in the medium to long term, because urban land markets are relatively uncompetitive particularly in large urban centres. Therefore, a shorter new build exemption would not significantly affect housing supply (or rents) relative to a longer exemption. 13.4 14.The rest of this section sets out more detailed analysis of the housing market impacts on which the agencies differ. The new build exemption will lead leveraged investors to prefer new builds over existing homes 15.The new build exemption will increase the return for a leveraged investor that takes out a loan to purchase a newly built residential property, relative to the return from that investor purchasing an existing residential property. This means that a new leveraged investor will be willing to pay less for an existing property compared to an equivalent newly built property. This is consistent with Cabinet’s objective to dampen investor demand for existing housing stock. 16.However, the returns from newly built residential property may still be lower than what might have been expected by leveraged investors prior to the announcement of the interest limitation policy. This is because the exemption would eventually expire under all the options currently on the table. In addition, if investors expect some moderation of house price inflation and, therefore, a lower capital gain on their investment, they may be willing to pay less now than before the change. 17.A longer new build exemption will increase the value that leveraged investors place on new builds, as they can deduct more interest related to the property, and are likely to have a larger resale market, meaning they will be more inclined to buy in the first instance. At the extreme, a perpetual new build exemption that could be passed on to subsequent investors would result in investors valuing new builds the same as before the interest limitation policy. 18.In principle, because of the higher return that they can realise on new builds, w e w ould expect that a significant proportion of the investors currently purchasing existing homes would instead look to purchase new builds. However, some of these investors may switch to non-residential property investments instead. 19.As the change is phased in for existing owners, those that remain highly leveraged may look to sell their property and purchase a new home. These investors could either exit the residential property market entirely or invest in new builds. That shift in demand could, unchecked, lead to an increase in the price of new builds relative to existing homes. However, in response to increased leveraged investor s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 13 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] activity we would expect some equity investors and owner-occupiers looking to purchase property, who are unaffected by the tax changes themselves, to move to purchase existing homes rather than new build homes. 20.The new build market is probably large enough to accommodate the movement of some highly-leveraged investors into it. While there is no data on exactly how many properties are purchased or owned by highly-leveraged investors, The Treasury estimates that they purchased between 12,000 and 20,000 homes last year. 1 This is less than the 43,000 consents for new dwellings issued in the year to May 2021. It would likely take longer for highly-leveraged investors currently owning property to be accommodated in the new build market, but not all of those would necessarily seek to re-enter the residential property market. The impact on house prices depends on whether buyers can switch from buying new builds to buying existing houses and vice versa 21.If new and existing homes on the market are largely substitutable, then we would expect that buyer mobility would be sufficient to ensure that the relative price of new builds compared with existing homes changes little. 2 22.That would mean that the ultimate impact of a new build exemption will be to moderate the impact that the tax change has on overall demand and house prices across the housing market. A longer exemption would then have a smaller overall impact on the growth of house prices. 23.However, some properties will not be substitutable owing to differences in location, typology and quality of new and existing housing. There will also be transaction costs associated with selling and purchasing homes. Less substitutability between existing and new build homes would mean that, at least temporarily, a new build exemption would support the level of demand for new builds while depressing it for existing homes. 24.The Treasury’s judgement is that most homes are likely to be substitutable (for example, a three bedroom home built five years ago will be substitutable for a newly built three bedroom home), or at the very least sufficient homes will be substitutable to achieve this effect. As such, The Treasury considers a longer new build exemption would lead to the interest limitation rules as a whole having only a marginal impact on prices for both new and existing properties. To the extent that homes are not substitutable, The Treasury would expect purchasers and developers would respond to the different type of demand and build homes that are substitutable, and therefore any non-substitutability effects will be transitory. 25. 1 Based on investors purchasing median-priced or below lower quartile-priced homes. 2 This does not mean that new build properties will sell for the same price as an existing build, but that the relative price would remain the same as it is now. Under current tax settings, there is still a premium paid for new builds if they are of higher quality than the existing housing stock. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 14 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] How these price impacts affect supply depends on how competitive urban land markets are 26.As set out above, t he extent of that impact on housing supply and rents in the medium to long term is uncertain and depends on how competitive urban lan d m arkets are, and therefore how well they respond to typical economic signals. Table: medium-term impact of interest limitation without a new build exemption under different assumptions about competitiveness of urban land markets Urbanland market House prices Housing supply Rents Competitive No change Moderately competitive Uncompetitive No change No change 2 7.In a completely uncompetitive urban land market the changed tax rules would manifest entirely as a reduction in the price of land. Incentives to build new houses would be unaffected, as the margin between land prices and the price of a house- plus-land package would not change. Therefore, a new build exemption would have no effect on housing supply. In a totally uncompetitive land market the only effec t o f a new build exemption would be to reduce the impact of the rules on house prices. 28.Conversely, in a perfectly competitive urban land market, land prices are fixed. As the tax rules reduce house prices relative to (fixed) land prices, the incentive to build new houses falls. In a perfectly competitive urban land market tax deductibility has no effect on house prices (which are set by the fixed cost of land and the cost of construction). In this scenario, a new build exemption would reduce the impact of the policy on housing supply. This distinction is analogous to th e e ffect of interest rate changes on the housing market. In a perfectly competitive land market, falling interest rates would reduce rents and leave house prices unchanged. In a perfectly uncompetitive land market, falling interest rates would boost house prices and leave rents unchanged. 29.The Treasury’s assessment of the available evidence is that urban land markets are relatively uncompetitive. There is extensive economic evidence that this is the case. This includes recent experience in New Zealand, whereby falling interest rates have led to significant house price inflation and no adjustment in rents despite consistently high supply and lower demand. 30. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 15 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 31.Furthermore, HUD is aware of some large developments that have been either deferred or cancelled since the announcement of the interest limitation rules. While uncertainty over the final design of the new build exemption is a likely key reason for these developments being cancelled or deferred, they do illustrate a risk to new supply if the exemption period is too short. 32.The Treasury’s assessment is that any risk to new build supply, arising from uncertainty around the exemption, is not evident in new build consents data. New build consents have continued to demonstrate strength for the two months following the announcement of the interest limitation policy. Stats NZ has reported in May 2021, 1,380 new townhouses, flats, and units were consented, the highest monthly number since records began in 1990. Administrative and compliance considerations 33.If the exemption were to apply for a fixed period, whether the exemption applies for 10 or 20 years from the date a new build’s CCC is issued is unlikely to make a material difference to administrative or compliance costs. Territorial authorities are required to retain records for the lifetime of a building, which is generally at least 50 years unless a house ceases to exist (for example, it is demolished following an earthquake). 34.Just applying the exemption to initial owners may minimise administrative and compliance costs, as the exemption would only apply once for each new build. However, only applying the exemption to initial owners would likely incentivise some taxpayers to enter into arrangements that ensure the legal ownership of new builds does not change, even when their ownership changes in substance (for example, by putting a house into a company and then selling the shares in the company, rather than selling the house itself). Rollover relief would also likely be required in certain circumstances (for example, when property is transferred upon the death of a taxpayer, or as part of a relationship property agreement). Rules providing rollover relief would need to be designed and then applied by both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Tax planning issues and the need for rollover relief would be amplified with an exemption that applies in perpetuity for initial owners. However, applying the exemption to both initial owners and subsequent purchasers for a fixed period would eliminate these issues. Officials’ recommendations on the extent of the new build exemption 35.The Treasury recognises the need to balance the goals of moderating house prices and limiting any negative impact on housing supply and rents. The Treasury’s judgement is that urban land markets are relatively uncompetitive, and so the impact on housing supply and rents from interest limitation will be relatively low in the long term. Therefore, its view is that a longer new build exemption would significantly reduce the impact that this policy has on moderating house prices, potentially close to zero, without any material positive impact on supply relative to a short exemption or no exemption. 36.Furthermore, in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax, interest deductibility is a means to tax more economic income from residential property investment. Therefore, on balance, The Treasury continues to recommend agains t s 9(2)(b)(ii) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 16 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] new build properties being exempt from the tax changes, but if there is an exemption recommends that Ministers adopt the shortest possible new build exemption (at most, the 10-year fixed option in the discussion document which allows owners to pass on the exemption to subsequent owners). 37.Inland Revenue recommends a longer new build exemption to minimise impacts on supply. While the market for new builds and existing housing are clearly very closely related, Inland Revenue does not consider them perfect substitutes given the location, typology, and quality of new builds will often be materially different than existing houses. Inland Revenue agrees that there is likely to be some trade- off when setting the length of any new build exemption. A longer exemption is likely to mean less downward pressure on house prices. But it considers that in the long run affordability is unlikely to be promoted by measures which reduce the supply of housing and for this reason supports a longer new build exemption. 38. Continued investment rule for new builds 39.The discussion document consulted on whether, in addition to having to meet the definition of a “new build”, a property should also have to satisfy the continued investment rule to qualify for the new build exemption. Under the continued investment rule, a property would only qualify for the exemption if it has always been used as a rental property. Any other use of a new build would permanently prevent it from qualifying for the exemption. 40.The continued investment rule could potentially encourage investment in new builds, since more new builds would cease to qualify for the exemption sooner. However, almost all submissions on the continued investment rule opposed it. The concerns were that the rule would be difficult to administer and comply with, as both Inland Revenue and taxpayers would have to find a way to keep track of how a new build property has been used, especially if a new build changes hands a number of times during the period the exemption applies for. It would likely result in litigation where new builds are acquired on the understanding that they qualify for the exemption but are later discovered to have been owner-occupied for a period by a previous owner. The rule would also result in inequitable outcomes, because two otherwise identical new builds that are rented out could have different tax treatment, depending on whether they have always been used as rentals. 41.Officials consider the difficulties associated with having a continued investment rul e o utweigh any potential benefits of the rule, and therefore recommend against introducing such a rule. If Ministers agree not to introduce the continued investment rule, then the use of a new build would not impact whether it qualifies for the new build exemption. Obviously, for interest to be deductible there would still have to be a nexus with income, so no interest would be deductible for periods a new build is used for private purposes (for example, if a property is used as the owner’s main home or second home). s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 17 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Disposal of property subject to interest limitation 42.The discussion document canvassed some options for allowing some interest to be deducted on sale for taxable sales and non-taxable sales in accordance with Cabinet and Ministerial decisions (CAB-21-MIN-0045 amended and T2021/487, IR2021/133 refer). 43.Denying interest deductions for investors is intended to dampen demand for property from them, which could put downward pressure on prices and improve affordability for owner-occupiers, particularly first home buyers. This policy is most justified when the taxation of investors is low compared to their actual income and how they would be taxed on alternative investments. The premise of allowing the interest deduction on sale is to target the interest expense denial to cases where taxes are low relative to actual income, and also to minimise overreach cases where taxes are high relative to actual income. 44.Permanently denying all interest deductions will maximise the impact that the policy has on reducing investor demand for housing and moderating house pric e g rowth. This is because deferral will reduce the likelihood of an investor being “over-taxed” on their investment. Officials consider however that the impact of this design decision on investor demand will be significantly smaller than your decision on the length of the new build exemption. Officials also note that, even if interest deductions are deferred rather than permanently denied, investors will be worse off compared with the status quo. Revenue account (taxable) sales 45.The clearest case to see where it might be preferable to allow interest expense to be deducted on sale is if the sale is taxable. In this case, all of the income from owning the property has been taxed, so all deductions should be allowed. It is necessary to defer the deduction until the time of sale because with the bright-line rule, it may not be clear whether the sale is taxable until the year of sale. Deferring the interest deduction until sale also operates to offset the timing advantage tha t the capital gain is not taxed until sale even though the capital gain accrues over the entire holding period. Capital account (non-taxable) sales 46.The situation for capital account sales is more complicated, because in that case the investor is getting a benefit of a non-taxable capital gain, so it would not be right to always allow an interest deduction. However, there can still be some cases where if an interest deduction is not allowed, an investor may be overtaxed. This would be the case where the disallowed interest deduction exceeds the non-taxable capital gain. However, allowing a deduction for interest in excess of the untaxe d c apital gain would introduce greater complexity. E xample 47.Suppose property is sold for a gain of $100,000 and disallowed interest was $150,000. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 18 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Revenue account (taxable) sales ●Capital gain (taxed) $100,000 ●I nterest expense $150,000 ●I nterest deducted $150,000 Ne t result: net deduction of $50,000 T ax loss equals economic loss on property Capital account (non-taxable) sales ●Capital gain (not taxed) $100,000 ●I nterest expense $150,000 ●D eduction for interest in excess of untaxed capital gain $50,000 Net result: net deduction of $50,000 Tax loss equals economic loss on property 4 8.If no deduction were allowed in the capital account example, the taxpayer would be taxed on more than their actual (economic) income, even though the capital gain was not taxed. This situation only arises when interest expense is greater than the gain on sale of the property, which is less likely to be the case. Arbitrage 49.If interest may be deducted in the case of a revenue account sale, but not for a capital account sale, a taxpayer who wants to sell a property for a price that is less than its cost plus interest expense could benefit by treating the sale as on revenue account (taxable) instead of on capital account (not taxable). This could be done most readily by selling property subject to the bright-line rule before the expiry of the bright-line period, so it is sold on revenue account instead of capital account. This issue already exists for a taxpayer who wants to sell a property for a price that is less than its cost. 50.This benefit could be addressed by allowing the deduction (interest combined with gain/loss on sale, if the sum nets to a loss) to use only against other revenu e a ccount gains (that is, allowing losses to be deducted if the taxpayer also recognises taxable gains on other property sales). This should reduce abuse of tax- motivated property sales. A rule like this already applies for bright-line revenue account losses, and the rule could be adapted to incorporate the freed-up interest deduction. Officials’ recommendation on the disposal of property subject to interest limitation 51.On balance, The Treasury and Inland Revenue officials recommend that a deduction for interest be allowed in the year of sale for taxable (revenue account) sales, but not for non-taxable (capital account) sales. The reasons for this are: 51.1 For revenue account sales, all income is taxable, so all expenses should be deductible (this is still an increase in tax on investors compared to the status quo, because currently investors can deduct interest each year as incurred). 51.2 For capital account sales, even if we were to allow a deduction for interest in excess of non-taxable gain, it is likely to apply in relatively few cases (since very often the gain will exceed the interest expense). It would also add complexity. I nteraction with the loss ring-fencing regime may prohibit the deduction for interest anyway, unless a complex amendment were to be made to that regime. 3 3 The rental loss ring-fencing regime restricts deductions from residential property to the extent they exceed income. If interest were deductible on sale for capital account properties, the large amount of interest IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 19 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose-built rentals 52.The discussion document consulted on whether there were any specific issues regarding the purpose-built rental (PBR) sector that need to be considered in relation to the interest limitation proposals. 4 There are only a small number of PBR in New Zealand currently, and the sector is not yet widely established. Submitters and HUD’s PBR reference group have raised concerns that the interest limitation rule would harm the feasibility of commercially delivered PBR in New Zealand, make it more difficult to secure finance for new developments, and stagnate the development of the sector. Almost all submissions on PBR were in favour of excluding PBR altogether as an asset class from the interest limitation rule. 53.It is unclear whether excluding PBR is necessary given the new build exemption would apply to new PBR developments. Of course, the longer the exemption applies, the less need there is to exclude them entirely. Also, while investment in new PBR would increase the number of dwellings available for rent, providing a PBR exclusion incentivises the continued use of dwellings in PBR developments as rentals instead of being sold to owner-occupiers. 54.Importantly, there are no obvious material differences between PBR and other types of residential investment property, other than perhaps the scale at which PBR are constructed. There are no existing specific regulatory frameworks for PBR in New Zealand, so the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 applies to PBR in the same way it currently applies to other residential rental properties. The similarities between PBR and other residential rental property make it likely that other investors in residential investment property will consider an exclusion for PBR to be inequitable. Officials’ recommendations on excluding PBR from interest limitation 55. 56. accumulated over a number of years that becomes deductible in the year of sale may exceed income for that year, resulting in a restriction on deductions. 4 PBR is not defined in New Zealand legislation. Submitters have suggested a number of possible definitions, including requiring a development to satisfy the following criteria to qualify as a PBR: •have a minimum number of dwellings (such as fifty dwellings) ; •u se the dwellings in the development as rental accommodation; and •have a single entity that manages and owns the dwellings. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 20 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Transitional, emergency and public housing 57.The discussion document proposed exempting Kāinga Ora and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules, largely because if it were a private company rather than a Crown agency, all of its activities could be exempt from the interest limitation rules. 5 Many community housing providers (CHPs) are charities, and therefore are already exempt from income tax. Some CHPs are also exempt from income tax under section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). The discussion document asked whether other entities should also not be subject to the interest limitation rules. 5 8.Some submitters expressed the view that all public housing should be excluded from the scope of the proposals, regardless of who the property owner is. In particular, they considered it unfair that Kāinga Ora is proposed to be excluded from the application of the rules but private sector landlords owning properties used for public housing are not. 59.The current income tax exemptions that apply to charities and CHPs apply on an entity basis, rather than on a property basis. However, not all property used for public housing is directly owned by the charity or CHP. The property might be leased to them by a private sector landlord. There are currently 60 registered CHPs, with 14,558 properties. The latest available data shows that over 9,000 of these properties (approximately 62 percent) are not owned by the CHPs themselves, bu t a re leased. As such, relying on the pre-existing exemptions for charities and CHPs will not ensure most of the properties managed by CHPs are unaffected by the interest limitation rules. These 9,000 properties would be subject to interest limitation as per the discussion document (unless they are owned by a charity or other CHP). 60.Similarly, HUD and Kāinga Ora both contract a number of private properties for use for transitional, emergency and public housing. For example, of the 1, 647 transitional housing places contracted by HUD since October 2019, 960 are not Crown-owned. 6 61.Councils and council-controlled organisations (CCOs) may also provide public housing. While councils are exempt from income tax, CCOs are not. The public housing properties provided by CCOs would therefore be subject to the interest limitation rules without a specific exemption. Approximately 9,000 public housin g p roperties are managed by councils, but we do not know how many are held by CCOs. Im pact of interest limitation on supply of public housing 62.For properties that are owned by private landlords (not owned by Kāinga Ora, councils, charities or registered CHPs), officials consider that without an exemption the interest limitation rules are likely to have the following impacts: 62.1 Tilt the balance towards owner-occupiers. This is likely to reduce the supply of public housing. 5 In the absence of an entity-wide exemption, the urban development functions of Kāinga Ora would still be exempt from the interest limitation rules because of the development exemption. If Kāinga Ora were not a Crown agency, the public housing arm of Kāinga Ora could likely become a charity or a registered CHP, and be exempt from income tax altogether. 6 Some of these 960 properties are owned by CHPs or charities but some are owned by private landlords. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 21 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 62.2 Maintain the existing balance with other private landlords (that is, landlords who do not lease to a public housing provider). This is unlikely to affect the supply of public housing. Officials’ recommendations on treatment of transitional, emergency and public housing 63.Inland Revenue and The Treasury do not recommend a general exemption from the interest limitation rules for properties used for transitional, emergency and public housing: 63.1 An exemption is likely to add further complexity. All for -profit landlords should be subject to the same tax rules, whether they lease their property to a CHP, to government or to other tenants. An exemption could discourage landlords from renting directly to tenants if it is possible that a CHP or government agency would be interested in the property. 63.2 To the extent the rules reduce the supply of public housing, it is most likely to do so by moving properties used for public housing to owner-occupiers (where such properties are suitable for owner occupation) or to other investors less willing to lease their properties for public housing. Whether this is desirable depends on which housing objective the Government chooses to prioritise – for instance increasing public housing versus increasing owner-occupied housing. 63.3 If the Government wanted to mitigate the impacts of the interest limitation rules on the supply of public housing it could instead achieve this through providing more funding for public housing. This would provide the Government greater control over the amount of support given to public housing than an exemption from the interest limitation rules and ensure that all for-profit landlords are subject to the same tax rules. 64.HUD considers that transitional, emergency and public housing, regardless of who owns the underlying property, merits an exemption from interest limitation. Without an exemption, private landlords leasing their properties to CHPs or to government for public housing will face a higher tax cost, and HUD would expect to see a reduction in the amount of transitional, emergency and public housing provided, or a higher cost to CHPs or the Government in procuring these places. There are approximately 24,000 applicants on the public housing register, and HUD does not want to exacerbate that issue. Minor technical matters Eligibility of completed new builds acquired before 27 March 2021 65.The discussion document proposed that the new build exemption would generally only apply to properties that receive their CCCs on or after 27 March 2021 (this is referred to as the “general rule”). 66.The now publicly-released Cabinet paper and minute regarding the housing tax changes (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers), along with factsheets published at the time Ministers announced the changes in March, indicated that the Government intended for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of CCC to qualify for the new build exemption. To give effect to this and in addition to the general rule mentioned above, the discussion document proposed a transitional rule. The transitional rule would allow properties that received their CCCs before IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 22 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27 March 2021 to qualify for the exemption if they are acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of receiving their CCCs. 67.Most submissions regarding the new build exemption raised concerns with the transitional rule, with many submitters considering it inequitable that taxpayers who invested in new builds recently, but before the announcement in March, would not qualify for the exemption. The rule could result in two otherwise identical properties that received their CCCs at the same time being treated differently for tax purposes under the exemption, just because one property was acquired before 27 March 2021 and the other after this date. Members of Inland Revenue’s Housing External Reference Group have indicated the rule would incentivise tax planning, with taxpayers who acquired new builds before 27 March 2021 deliberately entering into arrangements to enable those new builds to qualify for the exemption (for example, by nominating another person as the owner of the new build, or disposing of their new build to a related party, on or after 27 March 2021). 68.The transitional rule adds complexity to the new build exemption. It increases the compliance burden for taxpayers, and makes it more difficult for Inland Revenue to administer the exemption. Instead of the transitional rule, officials recommend the general rule be modified to allow any new build that receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 to qualify for the exemption. While this is slightly more generous than the transitional rule, modifying the general rule in this way would simplify the rules considerably, remove the unintended outcomes that could arise with the transitional rule, and eliminate the need for additional rules to prevent tax planning. Ground leases and long-term leases 69.A ground lease is a long-term lease of land, which may be either bare land or it may contain an existing building, that permits (and often requires) the lessee to construct a new building on the land. The rent payable (ground rent) is for the land, excluding any buildings. During the term of the lease, the lessee owns any buildings on the land, which could be new or existing. At the end of the lease, ownership of these buildings reverts to the lessor. The duration of ground leases varies, but terms of 99 or more years (even 150 years) are common. Should the interest limitation rules apply to ground lessors? 70.In a residential land context, a ground lease permits the lessee to construct (o r c onvert) a building and subdivide it into principal units (apartments) and accompanying accessory units (for example, carparks). Anecdotally, official s u nderstand that up to 15–20 percent of residential apartments in central Aucklan d migh t involve this ground lease/unit title structure. 71.Under the proposals in the discussion document, a ground lease of land that has a residential property on it 7 would be “residential land” and subject to the interest limitation rules. If the ground lessor has borrowed money to fund the acquisition or holding of the land, the ground lessor’s interest expenditure will be denied. 72.The arguments that the interest limitation rules should not apply to ground lessors of residential land are: 7 Or the owner has an arrangement to build a residential property, or it is bare land that could be used for constructing a residential property under the relevant district plan. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 23 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 72.1 Including ground leases in the interest limitation rules may limit the ground lessor’s ability to sell the land. The negative impact on the ability to sell may be particularly acute where ground leases are for very long terms. 72.2 Limiting interest deductions for ground lessors is unlikely to dampen investor demand for residential leasehold interests (for example, apartments) or make these more affordable. This is because ground lessors do not own the residential leasehold interests, which are bought and sold in the residential property market. 73.Officials do not support an exclusion for ground lessors on any of these bases. A n e xclusion or partial exclusion for long-term ground leases would raise complex issues and concerns around fairness for other owners of residential land. Accordingly, officials consider that the simplest approach is for the interest limitation rules to apply to all owners of residential land. 74.If the interest limitation rules are to apply to ground lessors, officials consider the developer exemption and the new build exemption should be available to ground lessors even if the ground lessor is not directly involved in the development or construction process. In the ground lease context, development and new build activity would generally be undertaken by the lessee and not by the lessor, bu t s ince the lessor will need to consent to these activities, the developer and new build exemptions should apply to both the ground lessor and to the lessee. 75.Note that separate consideration needs to be given to the use of ground leases by Māori authorities or entities eligible to be Māori authorities. This issue will be dealt with in the August report. Fiscal implications 76.Officials are currently working on an estimate of the fiscal implications of the proposed changes. The impacts will be provided with the final Cabinet paper. Nonetheless, the decisions could have large fiscal consequences during the forecast period. 77.The design choices that Cabinet makes will influence the fiscal impacts of the proposals. In particular, the longer the new build exemption, the less revenue that will likely be collected as a result of the decision to limit interest deductibility (CAB- 21-MIN-0045 refers). 78.The option to defer or deny interest deductions on the sale of a property will also have a fiscal impact. Choosing to defer, rather than deny, interest deductions would further reduce the revenue that would otherwise be raised. The impact of this decision is likely to be smaller than the impact of the length of the new bu ild e xemption. 79.The other options in this report are likely to have more minor fiscal impacts.

Submissions closed on 12 July 2021 and 484 submissions were received. The majority of the submissions were from private landlords, although some were from tax advisors, property investors’ representative groups, real estate agents, iwi groups, property developers and engineers. 2.The following summary outlines the main submission points that were made on all the discussion document chapters, not just those specific issues on which decisions are sought from Ministers in this report. Officials will make final policy recommendations in relation to submissions received on other aspects of the proposals in the August report. Overview 3.Almost all submitters were opposed to the interest limitation proposal. As an alternative to denying or deferring interest deductions, some submitters suggested capping the amount of interest expense that can be deducted (for example, at 50 percent of interest expense). Several submitters requested an exclusion for small taxpayers with rental income below a certain threshold (for example, $25,000 per year) if the proposal is to proceed. 4.Several submitters commented on the proposed 1 October 2021 application date. Some were concerned that the changes would take effect in the middle of the 2021– 22 tax year and stated that application of the new rules should coincide with the start of a tax year to make the transition of pre-27 March properties into the regime less complicated for taxpayers. Several submitters requested that application of the new rules be deferred to the start of the 2022–23 income year for this reason, and also to enable all taxpayers and advisors to fully understand their obligations and the implications for them. 5.One submitter noted the possibility that the details of the rules may change during the Select Committee process and the potential for drafting errors given the short timeframe. It was considered that it would be better for the rules to have a prospective application date to provide certainty and the best chance of getting the legislation right before taxpayers have to apply it. As an alternative option it was suggested that the application date be split, so that for property acquired before 27 March 2021 the rules would apply from 1 April 2022 instead of 1 October 2021. Residential property subject to interest limitation 6.Submissions received on the scope of property affected by interest limitation mainly focussed on a few topics: student accommodation, properties with multiple dwellings on one title, buildings used for both commercial and residential purposes (dual purpose buildings), short-stay accommodation, and the proposal to exclude papakāinga housing from interest limitation. 7.Almost all submitters who discussed the proposal to exclude studen t a ccommodation as defined in the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 (which mostly covers halls of residence) were in favour. However, many submitters also suggested private student accommodation should be exempt as well. Various proposals to achieve this were suggested, mostly based on proximity to universities. One submitter opposed an exclusion for student accommodation as IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 26 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] opening loopholes incentivising conversion of regular rental properties to student accommodation to escape interest limitation. 8.Although it was not covered by the discussion document, many submitters recommended that properties with multiple dwellings on a single title should be excluded from interest limitation, as they are not likely to be purchased by owner- occupiers. This issue crosses over with the issue of purpose-built rentals (PBR), and is discussed in more detail below under the Purpose-built rentals heading. 9.The discussion document called for submissions on whether the all-or -nothing approach used in the bright-line test for dual purpose buildings would be appropriate in the context of interest limitation, or whether an apportionment approach would better reflect the purpose of interest limitation. All submitters who commented on this issue were in favour of an apportionment approach. Submitters suggested a variety of apportionment methods, including approaches based on floor area, rental return, or GST apportionment. 10.Submitters who commented on whether short-stay accommodation should be subject to interest limitation generally favoured a partial exception to allow for a sense of commercial purpose. Most were in favour of an exclusion, but many suggested the exclusion should only apply if the owner is GST-registered. Others suggested other limiting factors, such as a test based on turnover or the number of nights in a year that the property was used for short-stay accommodation. These factors are largely intended to separate short-stay accommodation on a commercial scale (which submitters generally thought should be excluded) from short-stay accommodation too small to reflect a commercial purpose (which submitters generally felt should be subject to interest limitation). 11.Submitters who responded to the proposal to exempt Māori communal housing, such as papakāinga housing, were mostly in favour. Some suggested further exemptions for Māori land and general title land that is residential property owned by a Māori authority. A few submitters were opposed to the proposal on the grounds that it differentiates between Māori and other ethnic groups. Purpose-built rentals 12.Nearly all submitters on PBR were in favour of excluding them altogether from the interest limitation rules, because: 12.1 New PBR developments would increase new housing supply so should be encouraged. 12.2 These properties are not on the market for first home buyers, so there was no need to dampen investor demand for them. 12.3 If PBR were not excluded from the interest limitation rules, there was a risk that developers would take their investment elsewhere. Allowing interest deductions for PBR would make their treatment in New Zealand more comparable with their treatment in other countries. 12.4 The new build exemption would not suffice for PBR, because any time limit imposed on interest deductions could impact on the establishment and growth of PBR in New Zealand. 13.Various definitions of PBR were suggested by submitters. Most generally referred to the number of dwellings that make up a PBR development (for example, requiring at least fifty self-contained dwellings); required the dwellings to be held in unified ownership and to be managed by a single entity; and required the IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 27 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] dwellings to be used as rentals continuously or for a specific period in order to qualify. 14.Some submitters called for the exclusion to apply to existing PBR completed before 27 March 2021, as well as to new developments. 15.If PBR was not excluded, then some submitters suggested the new build exemption would have to be sufficiently long enough to not disincentivise investment in PBR. One submitter was expressly against an exclusion for PBR, on the grounds that the new build exemption would suffice for new PBR. Another submitter suggested tha t similar to the transitional rule proposed for new builds more generally, a rule could apply to allow PBR completed within four years of 27 March 2021 to qualify for the new build exemption. Entities affected by interest limitation Companies 16.Submitters generally favoured some form of exclusion for non-close companies. A number of submitters pushed for greater exclusions for widely held or listed companies, either by carving them out of the interest limitation rules entirely or by explicitly carving them out of the definition of a “close company” (since a “close company” is defined as a company controlled by 5 or fewer natural persons, it is currently possible for some widely held or listed companies to be close companies if control is highly concentrated). 17.Submitters opposed the proposal to amend the definition of “close company” by treating all trustees of trusts settled by the same person as a single trustee. They cited the possibility of wider flow-on implications and argued that more consultation was needed. 18.Several submitters considered that close companies that are Māori authorities, or eligible to be Māori authorities, should be allowed to apply the 50 percent residential investment property-rich threshold, on the basis that Māori authorities are generally widely held, even though they may technically be “close companies” because they are held by a single trust. 19.Submitters considered that groups of companies should be able to calculate the 50 percent residential investment property-rich threshold on a 66 percent-owned group or wholly-owned group basis, instead of on an entity or tax consolidated group basis. Submissions also covered other more detailed aspects of the residential investment property-r ich threshold ( how it is calculated, valuations, when it is tested, etc). Kāinga Ora and public housing 20.Submitters were mixed as to whether Kāinga Ora and its subsidiaries should be excluded from the rules. Submitters opposed to an exclusion were concerned about an “uneven playing field”. 21.The majority of submitters wanted an exclusion for public or community housing. Some wanted an exclusion to apply on a property basis (as opposed to an entity basis), while others wanted an exemption for registered community housing providers or council-controlled organisations that provide community housing. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 28 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Other entities 22.Some submitters wanted exclusions for certain types of Māori entities (for example, Māori authorities or mandated iwi organisations). Interest allocation 23.Nearly all submitters supported the proposal to use tracing as the general interest allocation approach, even though several noted that tracing can be complex and difficult. 24.For loans drawn down before 27 March that could not be traced, the majority of submitters preferred the “stacking” option, where loans would be stacked towards non-residential assets first, based on the current market values of those assets. A few submitters were concerned that obtaining market values could be costly for some taxpayers and argued that taxpayers should also be given the option of apportioning loans based on cost. 25.Submitters were generally supportive of the hi gh water mark proposal. Some submitters suggested the level should be set at a higher amount such as an available, but unused borrowing limit, or an earlier higher number. 26.Submitters were supportive of the proposal for all refinancing of existing loans to maintain their deductible character. Submitters were not supportive of proposals to deny deductibility of foreign currency loans from 1 October 2021 instead of phased deductions like on New Zealand dollar loans. Disposal of property subject to interest limitation 27.Most submitters that commented on the treatment of interest expense when residential investment property is sold considered that interest should be fully deductible when property held on revenue account is sold (that is, the sale is taxable). Many were a lso of the view that at least some interest should be deductible when capital account (non-taxable) property is sold. A small number of submitters thought that there should be no deduction for deferred interest on sale in order to maximise the housing market impact. Development and related activities 28.Submitters were supportive of the development exemption. Submitters were also largely supportive of the proposed design of the exemption of including development from taxpayers in the business of development and taxpayers who engage in one-off development. Some submitters proposed to widen the exemption to land which is held on revenue account. Submitters had mixed views as to whether land dealers should be able to obtain the development exemption. 29.The majority of submitters agreed with the proposal in the chapter to apply the exemption to the acquisition cost and development costs (in the case of land bought with the intention of development) and, where the intention to develop was formed later, additional costs incurred for the development activity. Most submitters agreed that the development exemption should apply from when the intention to develop is formed. However, the submitters differed on how this intention would be measured. 30.There was strong support from submitters to include remediation work within the development exemption. Submitters differed as to what types of remediation IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 29 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] should be included. Many proposed a wide definition of remediation to encompass all work which adds to housing stock, makes a house habitable or extends the life of building. However, some submitters were supportive to limiting remediation to structural improvements (earthquake strengthening and weathertightness issues) or major remediation work. Some submitters proposed that remediation to heritage buildings should be included, especially where these buildings cannot be demolished. Definition of new build 31.Submissions generally support the definition of a new build as a self-contained dwelling requiring CCC. Submitters favour the definition being tied to a clear increase to housing supply, with some expressing a need for a general statement of principle rather than strict categories. It was noted that adding a room to a dwelling should qualify for the exemption, while one-for -one replacements should not, as only the former provides an increase to housing supply. O ther submitters recognised that one-for -one replacements could still increase the quality and longevity of rental stock, and it would be administratively difficult to prove the number of dwellings that previously existed on a property. 32.There was strong support for the inclusion of commercial to residential conversions in the new build exemption. The issue was raised that some conversions, namely hotels and motels, may not involve work that requires a CCC and would subsequently not qualify for the new build exemption. This is particularly concerning, as some hotels/motels are likely to be converted into long-stay accommodation due to low levels of occupation following the COVID-19 pandemic. 33.Submitters suggested that CCCs, certificates of acceptance, building consents, and sale and purchase agreements could be used to prove that a property is a new build. 34.Further detail on submissions relating to heritage buildings, uninhabitable buildings, and the use of CCCs will be provided in the final policy report. New build exemption from the interest limitation rules 35.Overall, there was support for the new build exemption. General critique focussed on how the exemption could increase the price of new builds, negatively impacting owner-occupiers. There were submissions on the complexity of the rules and the difficulty mum and dad investors may have in applying them. The concern was also raised that the new build exemption may undermine the interest limitation policy. 36.Submissions on the general rule claim the 27 March 2021 date is unfair. The most common submission was to date the exemption back five years to properties that received their CCC from 2016 onwards. An alternative option mentioned was that the exemption could apply to a property for a fixed period regardless of when the property’s CCC was issued. So, if a 20-year fixed period applied, a 16 year-old build would still have four years of interest deductions left. 37.The transitional rule received a large number of submissions that claim it is inequitable as it could result in two identical builds receiving different treatment. There was concern that the rule could distort taxpayer behaviour, for example a taxpayer may dispose of land to an associated entity in order to fall under the transitional rule. Most submitters want the transitional rule to apply to IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 30 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] all new builds that received their CCC on or after 27 March 2020 regardless of when the property was acquired. 38.Submissions were largely in favour of the exemption applying to both initial owners and subsequent purchasers. Allowing deductions to pass to a subsequent purchaser can increase the resale value, providing a greater incentive for the initial investor to purchase a new build. However, many submitters did not think the exemption should be passed on to a subsequent purchaser, either because it was unfair to advantage someone who had not invested in a “new” new build, or because it would drive up the price of new builds and therefore price owner-occupiers out of the new build market. 39.The most popular option was for a fixed period to apply to both the initial owners and subsequent purchasers of a new build. The option of an in-perpetuity exemption for initial owners was also popular. Those who favoured a shorter fixed period believe investors would be incentivised to invest in further new builds sooner. Those who wanted a longer exemption believe it will provide a stronger incentive for the initial investor to purchase a new build, and allow for greater cashflow to invest in more new builds. 40.The continued investment rule was extremely unpopular among submitters, with only one submission in favour of the rule. Having to ascertain the previous use of a property was considered impractical, complex, and could create uncertainty for subsequent purchasers. 41.Submitters were generally happy for existing apportionment principles to apply in cases of complex builds. Although some thought it should not apply at all, and the whole property should become a new build, or thought a predominance test could apply. New build bright-line test 42.Submitters generally accepted a five-year bright-line test for new builds, however some thought new builds should have a two-year test or no test at all, to further incentivise investment in them. 43.Views on applying the new build bright-line only to initial owners were mixed. Some submitters suggested that the new build bright-line test should apply to subsequent purchasers as well, because this might better encourage new housing supply. 44.Most submissions on the new build bright-line test supported a reasonable apportionment approach where a new dwelling is added to land with an existing dwelling on the same title. A few submitters suggested alternatives to apportionment. One suggestion was that an entire section of land with a new build on it should qualify for the new build bright-line test, regardless of whether there were existing dwellings on the same section. Another suggestion was to provide taxpayers with a choice between applying a predominant test or apportioning the gain on sale. 45.A number of out-of -scope submissions were also received regarding the bright-line tests that apply to residential property generally, particularly the extended 10-year bright-line test. Rollover relief 46.Submitters were supportive of the proposal to provide rollover relief for interest limitation in certain circumstances, including for transfers of property upon the IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 31 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] death of the owner. They were also supportive of the proposal to extend the situations in which bright-line rollover will apply. However, most submitters that commented on the rollover proposals in the discussion document considered that they did not go far enough. Many suggested that rollover (especially for the purposes of the bright-line test) should apply more generally to various transactions between associated persons. Many were also opposed to the proposal that a transfer would have to be for nil consideration in order to qualify for bright- line rollover relief. They stated that the instances where no consideration would be provided would be extremely rare. 47.Some considered the proposed conditions for rollover relief for settlements of land on family trusts were also too restrictive, especially the requirement that all the beneficiaries of the trust should be associated with a principal settlor. Some also commented that the rollover relief proposed for family trusts would be too narrow for Māori authorities and their subsidiaries. It was suggested that full relief should be provided for transfers of land to an entity that is eligible to be a Māori authority, including where such an entity is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 or is established on behalf of claimants. 48.Some submitters commented on the fact that bright-line rollover for family arrangements whereby a first home buyer is helped onto the property ladder by their parents was not addressed by the proposals in the discussion document. They considered that this ought to be addressed as a matter of priority, rather than being considered at a later date as proposed in the discussion document. 49.Several submitters were concerned that some taxpayers may have been “unintentionally” caught by the previous five-year bright-line test. They suggested that any extensions to bright-line rollover should be retrospective to 29 March 2018, being the date that the five-year bright-line test first applied from. Interposed entities 50.Not many submissions discussed interposed entities. Most submitters acknowledged the rules were needed for integrity reasons but expressed concerns over the complexity of the rules. 51.A few submitters suggested interposed entities were common, but it is not clea r th at all those submitters understood when the proposed rules would apply. One reason given for why taxpayers may have an interposed entity (by borrowing at the shareholder level instead of at the entity level) was that banks often prefer to lend to individuals, especially if the company is new and has limited assets. In contrast, individuals may have other sources of income and assets. 52.Several submitters argued that the interposed entity rules should not apply to widely held companies at all, as taxpayers were unlikely to borrow to acquire shares in widely held residential investment property companies as a substitute for acquiring residential investment property directly. A few submitters also disagreed with the proposal that phasing would not apply to existing interests in interposed entities. 53.For the proposed apportionment rule for close companies, most submitters preferred an annual calculation frequency though some submitters preferred a quarterly calculation. IR2021/325; T2021/1935: Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues Page 32 of 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Implications for the rental loss ring-fencing rules 54.Submitters agreed that there will be overlap between the interest limitation rules and the rental loss ring-fencing (RLR) rules. Submitters generally agreed that the interest limitation rules should apply first, then the RLR rules should follow. Submitters agreed that to obtain the full benefit of a new build exemption, the RLR rules should be amended to add a new build exemption. 55.The majority of submitters recommended that the RLR rules be repealed. They expressed the view that the rules would be redundant in combination with the interest limitation rules. They also emphasised the high compliance costs with these rules. Interest limitation and mixed-use property 56.Submitters noted that the mixed-use assets rules will be further complicated by the proposed interest limitation rules and a number expressed support for simplifying the rules, with some providing specific suggestions on how to do that. Submitters generally agreed that in the case of mixed-use property that is subject to the interest limitation rules, the interest limitation rules should take priority over the mixed-use assets rules. Views were mixed on whether the existing “stacking” approach under the mixed-use assets rules should apply when mixed-use property is held by a close company or whether tracing should apply to determine the deductibility of interest in such cases. Administration 57.Around 20 submitters commented on the administration of the proposal. Submitters were largely concerned about increased compliance costs, in particular increased time and cost for tax agents. Some submitters agreed there may be some need for taxpayers to provide additional information to Inland Revenue. Other submitters were against additional information requirements as self-assessment and existing record-keeping rules would already require taxpayers to retain relevant information. 58.Several submitters recommended that, to increase certainty, Inland Revenue should publish guidance on the records the Commissioner of Inland Revenu e e xpects the taxpayer to retain, particularly in relation to the new build exemption.

Context and background The most recent report to you on the interest limitation project sought some early decisions on the design of the interest limitation proposal and attached a summary of the submissions received on the discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). Ministerial decisions on the general design and approach of the proposal have also been made on the basis of earlier reports (IR2021/133; T2021/847; and IR2021/181 refer). This report seeks your decisions on the remaining policy design issues and highlights the specific issues that are less straightforward in nature and/or are likely to be contentious. Key policy decisions In particular, the remaining decisions about what should and should not be included in the scope of the interest limitation proposal are not necessarily clear-cut, and the creation of various boundaries will unavoidably add to the complexity of the proposed rules. There are arguments both for and against various exclusions for types of residential property, or for types of entities that may hold residential property which need to be considered and weighed. Another area for consideration is if and how the rules are to apply to Māori collectively-owned land. It has become apparent to officials following consultation that the proposed rules as they were outlined in the discussion document may not provide the appropriate policy outcome in relation to Māor i land. Therefore, some special rules or exclusions may be needed to address these specific issues. The main issues requiring your consideration include the following: Residential property subject to interest limitation • Whether there will be exclusions from the interest limitation rules covering the following categories of residential property: – Multiple dwellings on a single title, for example, a block of flats that are all on the same legal title. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 2 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] – Short-stay accommodation that is not suitable for long-term habitation by an owner-occupier or tenant (for example, a purpose-built unit that does not include standard amenities). – Boardinghouses. Māori collectively-owned land • Whether the interest limitation rules should apply to Māori customary land, Māori freehold land, Crown land reserved for Māori, or land set apart as a Māori reservation, including for example papakāinga housing as well as kaumātua housing near or on a marae. • Whether the interest limitation rules should apply to housing provided on general title land held by a Māori authority (or an entity eligible to be one) to a shareholder or beneficiary, for instance, papakāinga and kaumātua housing provided to iwi/hapū. This could include old kaumātua flats transferred to iwi and hapū by the Government. • Whether land acquired by a Māori authority (or an entity eligible to be one) under a Te Tiriti o Waitangi – The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti) settlement or a post-Treaty settlement mechanism (for example, through a right of first refusal) should be excluded from the interest limitation rules. • Whether different requirements for rollover relief should be provided for disposals to a trust that is a Māori authority or is eligible to be a Māori authority, or where land received as settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti by a representative is disposed of to trustees who will then manage the land for Māori claimants. Entities specifically excluded from interest limitation • Whether Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be excluded from the interest limitation rules. New build issues • Whether the definition of “new build” for the new build exemption should also apply for the purposes of the new build bright line test. Officials recommend that “new build” be defined to mean a self-contained dwelling that is added to residential land and receives its code compliance certificate (CCC) on or after 27 March 2020. • Whether the new build exemption will apply to existing dwellings that have been significantly remediated. • Whether a five-year bright-line test will apply to new builds located in New Zealand that are acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and no later than 12 months after receiving their CCCs. • Where interest expense relates to both an existing dwelling and a new build on the same title, whether an apportionment rule should apply based on existing tax principles. • If a main home makes up more than half of a pa rcel of land, whether the main home ex emption should apply for the purposes of both the new build bright-line and 10-year bright-line tests. • If the main home makes up less than half of the land, whether a time-based apportionment rule should apply instead. Under such a rule, the main home portion of the land would not be taxed under the bright-line test, but the non-main home IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 3 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] portion of the land would be taxed if it is disposed of within the applicable bright- line period. Fiscal implications Officials estimate limiting interest deductions (with a 20-year new build exemption) will generate around $1.12 billion in revenue over the forecast period, although this estimate is highly uncertain. As investors are likely to increasingly reallocate to new builds, officials expect that revenues from this policy will decline from 2026. As a result, this is unlikely to provide a sustainable revenue source to fund permanent expenditure, which you should consider in the process of setting your fiscal strategy. Next steps Officials propose to discuss the design decisions outlined in this report with you at the regular joint Ministers’ meeting on 30 August. On the basis of your decisions on these matters, we will provide you with a draft Cabinet paper on 9 September for consideration at the Economic Development Committee on 22 September. It is intended that the amendments implementing these decisions will be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the 2021 omnibus tax bill at the Select Committee stage. Officials are seeking your agreement in this report to consult on specific aspects of the draft legislative wording with a limited group of trusted private sector experts.

and 26.2 if residential land is not predominantly used as a main home, then space- based apportionment rules will apply so that the portion of the land attributable to the main home is not taxed under the new build or 10-year bright-line tests (subject to the time apportionment rules referred to in recommendation 27 below); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 7 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27. agree that the time apportionment rules that were introduced alongside the 10- year bright-line test, which ensure that tax is paid on a property if it has not been used as a main home for more than 12 consecutive months, will continue to apply to the 10-year bright-line test and will also apply to the five-year new-build bright- line test; Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Interposed entities 28. agree that the rule for closely-held interposed entities (close companies and trusts) will apply an apportionment approach (that is, interest limited will be proportionate to the amount of affected residential property held); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 29. agree that the rule for interposed entities that are non-close companies will apply an all-or -nothing approach (that is, interest is fully limited if the amount of affected residential property held is more than 50 percent of total assets);

This report seeks your decisions on the final policy design of the interest limitation proposal. Background 2. The most recent report to you on the interest limitation project sought some early decisions on the design of the interest limitation proposal and attached a summary of the submissions received on the discussion document Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). Ministerial decisions and in-principle decisions by Cabinet on the general design and approach of the proposal have also been made on the basis of earlier reports. You have already made decisions on some of the key policy design features, including the following: 2.1 Deductions for previously denied interest expense will be allowed in the year of sale of the property but only if the sale is taxable, subject to any losses being ring-fenced to taxable gains from property sales. 2.2 Transitional, emergency and public housing will be explicitly excluded from the interest limitation rules but with a sunset clause on the exclusion. 2.3 Qualifying new build properties will be exempt from the interest limitation rules up until 20 years from the date a new build’s code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued. 3. A decision on whether purpose-built rentals (PBR) will be subject to the interest limitation rules will be sought at Cabinet. 4. This report seeks your decisions on the remaining policy design issues that have yet to be decided. The following sections set out the outstanding issues on which decisions are sought. The appendix outlines officials’ recommendations in relation to the more minor, technical or straightforward aspects of the detailed design of the rules. 5. It is intended that the amendments implementing these decisions will be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the 2021 omnibus tax bill at the Select Committee stage. Officials are seeking your agreement in this report to consult on specific aspects of the draft legislative wording with a limited group of trusted private sector experts. Residential property subject to interest limitation 6. The interest limitation rules should apply to property that is commonly and foreseeably used to provide residential accommodation on a long-term basis, and in particular, could be used as a private owner-occupied residence. That is, the rules should apply where the physical structure is suitable for long-term residential habitation. This underlying principle is relevant to determining all properties within the scope of the rules – regardless of whether they are actually being used at any given time as owner-occupied residential property. It is their capacity to be used as such that matters. 7. The discussion document proposed using existing definitions and concepts in the Income Tax Act 2007 as a starting point. The problem is that these may lead to outcomes that do not fit with the underlying principle set out above. This inevitably leads to line calls on whether marginal cases should be inside or outside the rules. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 10 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. The following discussion examines these issues in light of the underlying principle in relation to: 8.1 mul tiple dwellings on a single title; 8.2 short-stay accommodation; 8.3 boardinghouses; and 8.4 dual-purpose buildings on a single title. Multiple dwellings on a single title 9. Submissions raised the question of multiple dwellings on a single title. This issue has some similarities with the purpose-built rentals (PBR) issue. Given broader interest in PBR, we wanted to bring these submissions to your attention. While there are some differences, in particular one of scale, both asset classes operate on similar principles. 10. A common example raised by submitters was a small block of flats with between four and 12 units. Physically, they share the same characteristics as a standard block of flats where a single flat can be purchased. The only difference is the way in which the flats are titled – legally all the flats are on a single title and must be purchased at the same time. 11. Submitters argued that these buildings should not be in scope because the dwellings are not separately unit titled. A potential buyer would have to purchase the entire building rather than a single dwelling which makes them an unlikely choice for owner-occupiers looking for an affordable home. As an asset class, submitters argued that these properties are only attractive to investors and should not be considered substitutable for owner-occupied housing. Recommendation 12. Officials do not recommend an exclusion for these types of buildings. This is because the underlying principle is for the rules to apply to properties suitable for long-term occupation regardless of the legal structure. 13. The reference in the discussion document to the ability to use the property (or part of the property) as a private owner-occupied residence relates to whether the property could function as an owner-occupied property, not whether it is likely an owner-occupier would purchase the property. Relevant factors include whether it is self-contained or reliant on shared facilities. A conventional hotel room, for example, which is not self-contained, would not satisfy this test. Short-stay accommodation issues 14. The discussion document sought submissions on whether certain types of short- stay accommodation should be excluded from the rules, and how an exclusion could be designed without creating an incentive for investors to convert their long-term residential rental properties into short-stay accommodation in order to circumvent the interest limitation rules. Submissions on this were mixed. Some submitted that all short-stay accommodation should be excluded from the rules regardless of suitability for long-term habitation. 1 They favoured tying this category to GST 1 Note that by “short-stay accommodation”, we mean accommodation generally advertised on digital platforms rented out as part of the so-called sharing economy. This term was misinterpreted by some submitters who suggested an exclusion for short-stay accommodation should also cover purpose-built emergency accommodation and temporary housing. This issue has been dealt with separately. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 11 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] registration on the basis that an accommodation provider above the registration threshold should be regarded as a commercial business. Providers below the registration threshold would not be excluded. 15. This is unsatisfactory because the supply of accommodation is generally exempt from GST if the premises are occupied by the person as their principal place of residence (that is, long-term rental accommodation). At $300 per night, for example, a property would satisfy the GST registration threshold with an occupancy rate of only 200 nights of accommodation per year. This means that linking into the GST rules would not resolve our concerns about conversion risk as there are no structural barriers that would prevent an investor from converting a long-term rental property into short-stay accommodation. 16. Other submitters thought that properties would need to be suitable only for short- stay accommodation and that guidance would need to be developed to identify such properties. Recommendation 17. Again, the issue comes down to the functional nature of the property itself and whether it is suitable for long term residential accommodation. Drawing a distinction based on features such as a minimum number of bedrooms in a property or units on a piece of land would be possible, but any such distinction would be arbitrary and would create boundary issues for other types of properties where submitters consider an exclusion should be available based on scale. Therefore, officials do not recommend an exclusion for short-stay accommodation at this time. Boardinghouses 18. The discussion document proposed an exclusion for commercial accommodation predominantly designed for short-term use on a commercial basis, often at scale, on the grounds that these are straightforward to distinguish from properties that could be a private owner-occupied residence. Boardinghouses were included in this list, along with hotels, motels, and hostels. However, following submissions and further consideration, officials recommend that boardinghouses should not be specifically excluded from interest limitation. 19. In reality, boardinghouses are not straightforward to identify. Several submitters requested clarity on what is meant by the term, which is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA). A similar term (“boarding house”) is used in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (the RTA); some submitters believed that this definition would apply, and several opposed an exclusion on this basis as boardinghouses do not greatly differ from regular residential properties. It is uncertain whether the RTA definition would apply (although it is not intended to), but Inland Revenue has struggled to define “boardinghouse” for other areas of tax or clearly indicate what constitutes one. While some services need to be provided, it is unclear what the required level of servicing is, and it would ultimately depend on the specific facts and circumstances. 20. An exclusion could create an incentive to convert existing long-term rental properties into boardinghouses to circumvent interest limitation. There are few structural barriers preventing this: larger boardinghouses may be structurally similar to hostels and thus not suitable for owner-occupation, but smaller boardinghouses tend to resemble standard residential properties. Distinguishing between them is not straightforward. A distinction based on features such as a minimum number of bedrooms may be possible, but any such distinction would be arbitrary and create boundary issues for other areas where submitters consider an exclusion should be available based on scale. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 12 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21. Exclusions should provide certainty and be objectively clear for taxpayers to determine whether the rules apply to them. Officials consider that an exclusion for boardinghouses would have the opposite effect. Uncertainty could lead to non- compliance or deliberate restructuring to get around the interest limitation rules. Inland Revenue may not be able to identify these cases, particularly as New Zealand’s tax system is based on self-assessment and voluntary compliance. Recommendation 22. As there is insufficient certainty around the definition of a boardinghouse to sustain an exclusion without undermining the integrity of the rules, officials recommend that boardinghouses should not be excluded from the rules. Officials consider that many true commercial and larger-scale boardinghouses would also be covered by the term “hostel”, which would be excluded. While hostel is also undefined in the ITA, officials consider there to be less risk and ambiguity. Dual-purpose buildings on a single title – apportionment issues 23. The interest limitation rules would apply to land that has an in-scope residential property on it. It is not intended that the interest limitation rules would apply to commercial properties such as office buildings or shops. In some cases, it is possible that a commercial property and a residential property may be on the same title. 24. The bright-line test contains an exclusion for residential land that is predominantly used as business premises. This exclusion operates on an all-or -nothing basis based on predominant use (effectively a “more than 50 percent” test). If the business premises are more than 50 percent of the total residential land, they are fully excluded; if not, they are fully included. This is a simple test meant to provide certainty and reduce compliance costs for the bright-line rules. However, in the context of the proposed interest limitation rules, this could lead to harsh or arbitrary outcomes for dual-purpose buildings on a single title compared with a building where the commercial aspect is on one title and the residential accommodation on another. 25. The discussion document asked for feedback on whether the predominant use approach used for the bright-line test could be appropriate for interest limitation, or whether an apportionment approach would better achieve the intended purpose. All submitters on this issue favoured an apportionment approach and most favoured using existing tax principles. Recommendation 26. Officials recommend an apportionment approach based on existing tax principles. Māori collectively-owned land Papakāinga, kaumātua and other community housing 27. The discussion document considered issues relating to housing on Māori collectively- owned land. It considered potential impacts of interest limitation on Māori and sought feedback from the public on whether papakāinga housing, kaumātua housing, or other forms of Māori community housing should be excluded from the interest limitation rules. 28. Public submissions on this issue were generally in favour of an exemption. Submitters agreed that papakāinga housing does not generally compete with housing on the regular market, making it a good candidate for an exemption. Only IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 13 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] one submitter specifically commented on kaumātua housing. The submitter noted kaumātua housing serves a similar purpose to retirement homes and other care facilities, and an exemption on this basis would be consistent. Some also noted that Māori are disproportionately affected by housing unaffordability and special consideration should be given to their needs. A few submitters disagreed with the proposal on the grounds that it would give preferential treatment to a particular ethnic group and may create division among New Zealanders. 29. Officials consider that certain Māori housing should be excluded from the interest limitation rules and that an exclusion can be designed without undermining the integrity of the rules. 30. There is no set definition of papakāinga housing. However, officials met with interested parties to better understand how housing is provided to whānau and whether there are any trends or certain models that are followed that might assist in developing an appropriate exclusion based on existing frameworks or tax concepts. 31. Papakāinga housing is a mix of owner-occupied housing and rental housing. Housing provided to whānau is found on both Māori land and general title land. Where the housing is on Māori land, bank lending is difficult to obtain due to the legal nature of the land. In addition, permission to reside on the land will be granted by an occupation order or a licence to occupy. Some entities are charities or community housing providers; some have elected to be Māori authorities while others have not. They can range from iwi-provided papakāinga to a few properties managed by a smaller Ahu Whenua Trust. Not all will seek expert tax advice when setting up their papakāinga and some may sit at the periphery of the tax system. 32. This means that an exclusion needs to be broad to ensure that it is not just available to those who are well advised or structure a papakāinga development in a certain way. An exclusion also needs to be robust. There needs to be minimal risk that it could be inappropriately accessed by residential property investors (for example through conversion or substitution) while also being straightforward for taxpayers to apply and for Inland Revenue to administer. Conversion and substitution of investments are less likely to occur where there is a strong regulatory framework in place and where there are limits regarding who may occupy or purchase the property. Recommendation 33. In the first instance, officials recommend that the interest limitation rules should not apply to Māori customary land, Māori freehold land, Crown land reserved for Māori, or land set aside as a Māori reservation. 2 This would cover both papakāinga housing, as well as kaumātua housing near or on a marae. The use of and ability to reside on Māori land is subject to the provisions of the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and the jurisdiction of the Māori Land Court. Due to the strong regulatory framework in place, property investors would not be able to convert general title land to Māori land simply to avoid the application of the interest limitation rules. Māori land is not substitutable for a residential investment property on general title land as it is not straightforward to purchase or invest in Māori land and it is difficult to secure bank lending against Māori land. 34. Due to limitations regarding use, officials also understand that it is uncommon for housing on Māori land to be rented to the general population in a commercial rental arrangement. Officials are therefore satisfied that the risk of this limb of the exclusion applying too broadly is low. 2 Not all of this land will have residential property on it and so would be outside the scope of the rules regardless, but an exclusion would provide certainty. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 14 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 35. Given that papakāinga housing can be on general title land, officials also recommend that the interest limitation rules should not apply to housing provided by a Māori authority (or an entity eligible to be one but which has not made the relevant election) to a shareholder or beneficiary of that Māori authority (or eligible entity). This limb of the exclusion is more complex because a Māori organisation may hold rental properties as a property investor. In this situation, the interest limitation rules should apply. It is for this reason that officials recommend an additional requirement that the housing must be provided to a beneficiary or shareholder for that residential property to be excluded from the scope of the interest limitation rules. This should limit the scope of the exclusion to members of an iwi, hapū or whānau, but would cover both papakāinga and kaumātua housing. Treaty settlements 36. Property investors are generally able to sell their investments when an investment is no longer financially viable. It is expected that some property owners will sell their existing residential properties because of the interest limitation rules. This is not necessarily undesirable as it is a natural consequence of the Government’s objective to tilt the playing field towards owner-occupiers and first home buyers. 37. However, this may not be an appropriate outcome in the context of a Te Tiriti o Waitangi – The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti) settlement, given the role of Treaty settlements in acknowledging and addressing Crown breaches of Te Tiriti. It may not be appropriate to expect Treaty settlement land to be sold if it is no longer economically viable because of the interest limitation rules. 38. A related issue is the use of ground leases by Māori authorities and entities eligible to be Māori authorities. You agreed that ground lessors should not be excluded from the scope of the interest limitation rules (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). That report noted that special consideration should be given to the use of ground leases by Māori authorities or entities eligible to be Māori authorities. This is particularly relevant in the Treaty settlement context where ground leases are not uncommon due to the nature of the land. The land may not be able to be sold, or due to the cultural significance it may not be appropriate to sell it. However, it may not be economic or within the landowner’s broader strategy to become an active residential landlord. Therefore, to ensure productive use of the land, a ground lease structure with a term of 99 or more years, for example, may be one of the few options available. Particularly in the case of existing ground leases, it would not be possible for the ground lessor to exit/cancel the ground lease. Recommendation 39. Officials therefore recommend that land acquired by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) under a Treaty settlement or a post-Treaty settlement mechanism (for example, through a right of first refusal) should also be excluded from the interest limitation rules. This should include land that is subsequently transferred by the post-settlement governance entity to members of the claimant group. If land is then sold commercially to a third party, the new owner should be subject to the rules. 40. In the context of ground leases, this exclusion should apply to the ground lessor (being the Māori authority or eligible entity that owns the Treaty settlement land) but not to the lessee. That is, where a property investor holds a leasehold interest in a residential property on Treaty settlement land, they should still be subject to the interest limitation rules as this investment would be substitutable for other residential investment property. 41. The proposal addresses an additional equity concern that may arise between iwi groups – those that have already settled would otherwise be impacted by the IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 15 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] interest limitation rules, whereas iwi groups that are still in negotiations could either seek additional redress for the tax impact or seek other remedies via tax indemnities from the Crown. For the latter, both remedies are complex and could have downstream implications. It may therefore be simpler to exclude Treaty settlement property from the scope of the rules. 42. Officials have consulted with a number of interested parties, including some iwi and hapū, who have expressed support for these proposals. Rollover relief for disposals to Māori land trusts 43. The discussion document sought additional feedback on whether specific rollover relief provisions would need to be designed for collectively-owned Māori land to ensure that the interest limitation rules and bright-line test operate as intended. 44. Our consultation on the rollover relief proposal for land held collectively by Māori through trusts (both Māori land and general land owned by Māori subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993) indicated that a specific provision of rollover relief may be useful in the most likely types of restructuring scenarios. Recommendation 45. In addition to the proposal for general family trusts (which could apply for all types of trusts), officials recommend that rollover relief be provided where: 45.1 the land is disposed of to a trust that is a Māori authority, or is eligible to be a Māori authority; and 45.2 the person or persons disposing of the land and the beneficiaries of the receiving trust are all: 45.2.1 members of the same iwi or hapū; or 45.2.2 the descendants of any tipuna (living or dead). 46. The bright-line test may also be too broad in the context of settlements under Te Tiriti. Where land is received as settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti by a representative and is disposed of within the relevant bright-line period to a trust for Māori claimants (for example, where it is transferred from the post-settlement governance entity to hapū), the disposal may be subject to the bright-line test. Therefore, officials also recommend that rollover relief be provided for any disposal of land to the trustees of a trust who, on behalf of Māori claimants, receive and manage land that is transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under Te Tiriti. Entities specifically excluded from interest limitation 47. In general, when determining who and what should be subject to the interest limitation rules, officials have preferred exclusions on a property basis over an entity basis. This is because entities may hold different assets for different purposes. For example, a taxpayer that operates a retirement village could also hold many residential rental properties. Excluding retirement village operators on an entity basis would therefore also exclude those ordinary rental properties from the interest limitation rules, contrary to the policy intent. 48. Officials have only recommended two entity-based exclusions, both of which are largely for compliance cost reasons. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 16 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries 49. The discussion document proposed to exclude Kāinga Ora and its subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules. Some submitters argued that this exclusion would give Kāinga Ora a tax advantage, which officials disagree with. Instead, the exclusion would ensure the tax treatment of Kāinga Ora under the interest limitation rules is the same as for other taxpayers. Registered community housing providers and registered charities are usually exempt from income tax and will therefore be unaffected by interest limitation. Kāinga Ora also provides public housing, but under law it cannot be a registered community housing provider 3 and it is unlikely 4 that Kāinga Ora, as a Crown agency can be registered as a charity, notwithstanding that it carries out the same activities as many charities that provide community housing. 50. Recommendation 51. Officials recommend excluding Kāinga Ora and its subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules on the basis that all their current activities involve either public housing or property development (which would be covered by the development exemption in any case). 52. Non-close companies that are not residential property-rich 53. You have previously agreed that the discussion document would include the option of not applying the interest limitation rules to companies that are not close companies nor residential property-rich (IR2021/133; T2021/847 refers). The purpose of this proposed exclusion is to minimise compliance costs for companies whose core business does not involve residential property but who may still hold some residential property. An example is a company that buys bare land intending to use it as business premises. Until that land is used as business premises it could still be considered “residential property” if zoning rules allow a dwelling to be built on it. Such companies would usually be able to achieve the same tax outcome by allocating debt to their other business asset, but this can have high compliance costs. Officials therefore recommend excluding companies whose residential property is less than 50 percent of the value of their total assets. 54. A 50 percent threshold is consistent with the existing “residential land-rich” threshold in the loss ring-fencing rules. Companies will only be excluded if they stay below this threshold at all times in the income year. However, most companies 3 The definition of “community housing provider” in section 2 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 explicitly excludes Kāinga Ora. 4 The law is not entirely clear on this and a Crown Law opinion would be required to confirm it. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 17 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] whose core business does not involve residential property will be well below the threshold, so will not have to constantly monitor their residential property percentages. Recommendation 55. Officials also recommend extending this exclusion to close companies that are Māori authorities (or eligible to be a Māori authority) or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities (or of entities eligible to be Māori authorities), provided the close company is not residential property-rich. The reason officials initially suggested applying the rules to all close companies was because close companies are controlled by one or a small number of individuals so the potential for avoidance is higher. However, a company that is a Māori authority or owned by a Māori authority will often technically be a “close company” because it is owned by a single trust, even though the trust itself may have many (sometimes thousands of) beneficial owners. 5 In substance, most Māori authorities are more akin to widely-held companies than to close companies. The potential for avoidance is also low, as an individual cannot easily set up a Māori authority to hold their ordinary rental property. Interest allocation (transitional issue) 56. Taxpayers may not be able to retrospectively trace some loans that were drawn down before 27 March 2021. This may occur even if a taxpayer has complied with all their legal record-keeping obligations, because previously they did not need to trace whether their borrowings were applied to residential property or to other business purposes. Taxpayers have always needed to trace borrowings applied to private purposes (such as buying a family home) so the options listed below would not apply to these “private” loans. 57. The discussion document consulted on two options for bringing these pre-27 March loans into the interest limitation rules: 57.1 Stacking. Under this option, the pre-27 March loans are allocated first to the market value of the taxpayer’s other business assets before being allocated to residential property. 57.2 Apportionment. Under this option, pre-27 March loans are apportioned across the taxpayer’s residential and other business assets based on the assets’ costs. 58. The vast majority of submitters preferred stacking, with several submitters wanting the option of being able to choose between the two. Officials consider that allowing taxpayers to choose between stacking and apportionment would create undue complexity and recommend against it. Recommendation 59. Officials recommend stacking on the basis that it is fairest for taxpayers and would significantly lower compliance costs. Well-advised taxpayers would be able to restructure to achieve the same tax outcome as would be achieved using stacking anyway, and most of these restructures would be very difficult to detect and challenge. Moreover, this transitional rule would only affect pre-27 March loans so 5 There are restrictions on Māori Authorities to ensure they are representative of, and accountable to, their members. Similar restrictions do not apply to ordinary discretionary trusts. An ordinary discretionary trust could therefore have thousands of beneficiaries, but only ever make distributions to a small number of its beneficiaries. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 18 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] its impact will be limited. Stacking is also more consistent with Ministers’ desire not to affect loans for other business purposes when compared with apportionment. Loss ring-fencing 60. Many submitters have asked that loss ring-fencing be repealed in light of interest limitation. Loss ring-fencing prevents residential property investors from offsetting losses from property investments against their other income. Given the proposed limitation of interest deductions, loss ring-fencing could be considered much less relevant and repealing it would simplify the taxation of property. However, because interest will remain deductible for investments in new builds, retaining loss ring- fencing for new builds may have some merit. To retain or repeal the loss ring- fencing rules is a fundamental issue and officials have not been in a position to properly consider the issue. Recommendation 61. Officials recommend retaining loss ring-fencing at this stage. The issue may be raised again by submitters when the legislation is considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and officials will report to you as part of that process. Development exemption 62. As decided by Cabinet, officials have consulted on an exemption for interest incurred by an owner of residential land used for development. We recommend that: 62.1 interest incurred with respect to land acquired for use in a land-owning business of development, subdivision, dealing or erecting buildings be covered by the development exemption; and 62.2 the exemption also be available for interest incurred in relation to other land used for development, subdivision or erecting buildings for the purpose of creating one or more new builds (as defined below). 63. Issues regarding remediated property are discussed at paragraphs 68 to 72 below. Definition of new build 64. You have agreed that new builds which receive their CCCs on or after 27 March 2020 would qualify for the new build exemption until 20 years from the date of the CCC (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). The exemption would generally apply from the date a CCC is issued for a person who adds a new build to their land, or from the date of acquisition where a person acquires a new build that already has its CCC. 65. For the five-year new build bright-line test, a new build would have to be acquired on or after 27 March 2021, and would need to have its CCC by the time it is disposed of. It would also need to be acquired no later than 12 months after the new build receives its CCC because, unlike the exemption from interest limitation, the bright- line test only applies to the initial owner of a new build. 66. To ensure the rules for new builds are as simple as possible, officials recommend the same definition of new build apply for both the new build exemption from interest limitation (new build exemption) and the new build bright-line test. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 19 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendation 67. A property should generally only qualify as a new build where there is an increase in residential housing supply. Officials recommend that “new build” be defined to mean a self-contained dwelling that is added to residential land and receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020. 68. It would not matter whether a dwelling is made from brand new materials, or whether the dwelling is constructed on-site. It would therefore include modular homes and relocated dwellings. The definition would include the types of new builds set out in the discussion document, which submitters generally supported. These include: 68.1 Simple new builds, which is where a new build is added to bare land. It includes where an existing dwelling on the land is replaced with one or more new dwellings. 68.2 Complex new builds, which is where a new build is added to land but shares the same title with an existing dwelling. The dwellings do not have to be on separate titles. The new build can be standalone, or attached to the existing dwelling (added above, below or beside the existing dwelling). 68.3 Multi-dwelling conversions, which is where an existing dwelling is converted into multiple self-contained dwellings. For example, a two-story single unit dwelling is converted so the two floors become two separate self- contained dwellings. Both of these units would be considered new builds. 68.4 Commercial to residential conversions, which is where a commercial building is converted into dwellings. Remediation and uninhabitable dwellings 69. The discussion document asked submitters whether remediation work (including significant renovations of uninhabitable dwellings) should make an existing dwelling eligible for the new build exemption. Many submissions on this issue were in favour of providing an exemption for existing dwellings that have been remediated. 70. Properties that are owned and remediated by a professional developer or dealer will generally qualify for the development exemption for the period they are owned by the developer or dealer. However, the development exemption would not apply for remediation work performed if the owner of the land is not a professional developer or dealer. For example, if a taxpayer is not in the business of development or dealing and they contract another party to remediate a property that they own, then that remediated property would not qualify for the development exemption. 71. If remediated dwellings were to qualify, what qualifies would have to be clearly defined given the rules would impact many New Zealanders. “Remediation” could encompass anything from a simple renovation, such as adding a new room to a dwelling, to extensive renovations undertaken to remediate a leaky or earthquake- prone building. Alternatively, any house that was previously “uninhabitable” could qualify once it has undergone remediation and become habitable again. Depending on which remediated dwellings qualify, the rules could create perverse incentives. For example, if an uninhabitable dwelling qualifies after remediation, this could incentivise property investors to leave existing dwellings to deteriorate so that they qualify as “uninhabitable” before then remediating them. 72. Just as the definition of new build is tied to CCCs, it is important that whether a remediated dwelling qualifies is objectively verifiable. If not, there is a risk that allowing remediated dwellings to qualify could undermine the objective of the interest limitation rules, by providing property investors with a way to bring IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 20 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] additional existing dwellings within the scope of the new build exemption without necessarily creating new housing stock. Recommendation 73. Officials recommend that neither exemption applies to existing dwellings that are remediated at this stage (except to the extent remediation by a dealer or developer would qualify under the development exemption). We will continue to undertake policy work on how best to include some remediated existing dwellings within the scope of the development and new build exemptions without undermining broader policy objectives. New build and existing dwelling on same title 74. The new build exemption and the five-year new build bright-line test would apply to residential land that has a new build on it: 74.1 The exemption would allow any interest that relates to a new build to be deducted. This includes interest on borrowings to acquire residential land that a new build is on; to construct a new build; or to fund other expenses such as maintenance, rates, or insurance. 74.2 Under the five-year new build bright-line test, the new build would only be taxed on sale under the bright-line test if it is disposed of within five years of acquisition. 75. Where a new build and an existing dwelling are on the same title, there is a need for some rules to ensure that only the new build benefits from both the new build exemption from interest limitation and the five-year new build bright-line test. Recommendation 76. Where interest relates to both an existing dwelling and a new build (such as where a loan covers the cost of acquiring land that has both an existing dwelling and a new build on it) then officials recommend applying an apportionment rule based on existing tax principles. The interest attributable to the new build would be deductible provided there is sufficient nexus with an income earning activity. The interest attributable to the existing dwelling would not be deductible because the interest limitation rules would apply. 77. Where a new build and an existing dwelling on residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 are on the same title, officials recommend that only the portion of the land with the new build on it would be subject to the five-year new build bright- line test. The 10-year bright-line test would apply to the portion of the land with the existing dwelling on it. This means that if land with a new build and an existing dwelling on it is sold seven years after acquisition, the new build portion would not be taxed under the new build bright-line test but the old build portion would be taxed under the 10-year bright-line test. Existing tax principles for apportionment would apply. Changes to the main home exemption from the bright-line test 78. The main home ex emption currently applies where more than half the land is used as a main home (this is referred to as a space-based predominance test). This means that under current law, the main home exemption can result in the main home being subject to tax where less than half of the land is used as a main home. For example, if two rental properties were built on the same title as a main home IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 21 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and those rental properties took up more than half the land, then the main home exemption would not apply. Gains on the rental properties and the main home would be taxed if the land was sold within the applicable bright-line period. 79. A 10-year bright-line test is significantly longer than five years. Extending the test in this way makes it more likely that main homes will be taxed on sale where they make up less than half of the land (because the main home exemption, in its current form, would not apply). Recommendation 80. Officials recommend the following rules apply under the new build and 10-year bright-line tests in relation to a main home on residential land: 80.1 If a main home makes up more than half of the land, then the main home exemption would apply in accordance with the current law. Any gain on sale would not be taxed under the new build bright-line or 10-year bright-line tests. 80.2 If the main home exemption does not apply because the main home makes up less than half of the land, an apportionment test would apply instead. Under the apportionment test, the main home portion of the land would not be taxed under the bright-line test, but the non-main home portion of the land would be taxed if it is disposed of within the applicable bright-line period. 81. Overall, these changes would ensure that a main home is never taxed under the new build or 10-year bright-line tests while it is being used as a main home. A person who builds a granny flat on the same section as their main home would continue to benefit from the main home exemption. The main home would also not be taxed even where the portion of the land used as a main home is smaller than the non-main home portion. Interposed entities 82. Interposed entity rules ensure that taxpayers who borrow to acquire residential property indirectly are still subject to interest limitation. The rules are inevitably complex, but submitters generally agreed that there is a need for such rules. 83. An interposed entity may or may not be closely held. Close companies and trusts would be considered closely-held entities. Taxpayers who have an ownership interest in a closely-held entity will usually be able to access information about that entity’s assets without much difficulty. Moreover, closely-held interposed entities usually have fewer assets, and their assets are less likely to change significantly over the course of an income year. It is also more likely that taxpayers will try to use closely-held interposed entities for tax avoidance (in the absence of interposed entity rules). Recommendation 84. Officials therefore recommend having a different rule for closely-held interposed entities (that is, close companies and trusts) than for other interposed entities. In broad terms, the two rules would work as follows: 84.1 For closely-held interposed entities, the rule would be more accurate in that it would apply an apportionment approach. The amount of interest limited under the rule would be proportionate to the amount of residential property (excluding new builds and development property) held by the interposed entity. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 22 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 84.2 For other interposed entities, the rule would be simpler and apply an “all-or - nothing” approach. If more than 50 percent of the value of an interposed entity’s assets are residential property (excluding new builds and development property), 100 percent of the taxpayer’s interest deductions traced to the interposed entity would be denied. Rollover relief 85. The discussion document proposed limited rollover relief for both the proposed new interest limitation rules and the bright-line test. 86. Rollover simply ignores a transaction for tax purposes. In the context of the bright- line rules, this means that the transaction does not trigger the bright-line test. Currently, only limited rollover relief is available under the bright-line test for relationship property and company amalgamations. The discussion document proposed limited extensions to bright-line rollover (which were also proposed to apply for interest limitation purposes) for settlements of land on family trusts or transfers between the owners of a look-through company (LTC) or partnership and the LTC or partnership. Submitters wanted the proposed relief to be extended much further to associated persons transactions more generally. This is a significant change which raises a number of integrity concerns that would need to be considered and which cannot be done in the limited time available. Recommendation 87. For the reasons outlined above, officials do not recommend extending rollover relief beyond the situations outlined in the discussion document, aside from the extensions recommended in relation to Māori land at paragraphs 42 to 45 and the changes described in the appendix. Fiscal implications 88. Officials estimate limiting interest deductions (with a 20-year new build exemption) will generate around $1.12 billion over the forecast period as indicated in Table 1 below. This updates the estimate The Treasury provided in T2021/967 and incorporates your design decisions for the policy, including providing a 20-year exemption for new builds. Table 1: Revenue from limiting interest deductions (20-year new build exemption) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Tax revenue ($m) 80.000 200.000 350.000 490.000 Total operating (80.000) (200.000) (350.000) (490.000) 89. This estimate is highly uncertain because: 89.1 It incorporates behavioural assumptions about how residential property investors will react to the policy. 89.2 It incorporates the interaction between the interest limitation policy, rental loss ring-fencing, and the rules which tax residential property on sale, such as the bright-line test (as interest deductions are allowed on the taxable sale of properties). These interactions are uncertain, as these policies are relatively recent and there is limited data to draw on. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 23 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 89.3 There are data limitations regarding the total amount of interest investors are currently deducting, and future interest rates and housing market conditions. 90. The most significant assumption officials have made is that residential property investors will increasingly reallocate their residential investments towards new builds. This significantly decreases the revenue from interest limitation, including reducing revenue by approximately $300 million in the 2024/25 year. 91. Officials expect that the revenue gained from limiting interest deductions will peak at approximately $650 million in 2026 and then decline as investors increasingly reallocate towards new builds. The declining revenue from limiting interest deductions means it is unlikely to provide a sustainable revenue source to fund permanent expenditure. The Treasury therefore recommends that you factor this likely decline into account when you set your wider fiscal strategy and do not look to fund additional permanent spending from additional short-term revenues. Administrative implications 92. Inland Revenue will be responsible for implementing and administering the changes and will require additional funding to do so. Officials are in the process of developing an estimate of the additional costs and considering funding options for discussion with The Treasury. These will be provided with the draft Cabinet paper in early September. Given the complexity of the new rules, the wide variety of taxpayers affected and the short timeframe for implementation, the main focus will initially be on communication of the changes, education and using our analytical capabilities to full effect. 93. Limiting interest deductions will involve increased administration costs for Inland Revenue over an extended period while different rules based on the acquisition date and nature of properties continue to be in place. These costs will arise from managing an increased number of customer contacts and supporting the integrity of the rules. This means a mixture of providing people with information to increase awareness and making sure that Inland Revenue uses its full range of interventions to support customers in meeting their obligations right from the start through to follow-up action, where there is clear evidence of deliberate non-compliance. This will involve: 93.1 ongoing proactive marketing and targeted education campaigns, followed by one-on -one interventions such as community compliance visits and integrity checks; 93.2 developing appropriate tools to assist customers to determine eligibility; 93.3 improving our data and analytical capability; and 93.4 taking audit action to address deliberate non-compliance.

Topic Recommendations Residential property subject to interest limitation • That employee accommodation should be exempted from interest limitation where it meets the definitions in the residential ring- fencing rules, as proposed in the discussion document. • That student accommodation should be exempted from interest limitation, based on the regulatory framework provided by the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. • That serviced apartments, as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, should not be specifically exempted from interest limitation. Entities affected by interest limitation • That, in applying the rules to close companies, the existing definition of close company should be used without amendment at this stage to minimise the potential impact on other areas of tax. • That a company would be considered residential property-rich for the income year if it exceeds the residential property-rich threshold at any time during the income year. • That, in determining whether a taxpayer is residential property-rich: – the value of property subject to the development exemption will be subtracted from the value of residential property to ensure that developer companies are not affected by the rules; – the value of property subject to the new build exemption will not be subtracted from the value of residential property; – shares in a residential property-rich company will be treated as residential property to avoid the need to look through chains of company; and – the test will be applied on a wholly-owned group basis, with intra-group shares and loans (that is shares in, or loans to, another member of the wholly-owned group) disregarded in order to avoid double counting. • That, in determining whether a taxpayer is residential property-rich, asset values are determined using: – for residential property, including improvements to the land, but excluding property subject to the development exemption, the later of:  the property’s most recent capital value or annual value as set by a local authority; or  either the cost of the property on acquisition or, if the transaction involves an associated person, its market value; – for all other assets (including property subject to the development exemption):  the value in the taxpayer’s financial statements, if those statements are prepared in accordance with either generally accepted accounting principles, or minimum requirements prescribed by an Order in Council made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994;  in all other cases, the asset’s tax value. IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 26 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Interest allocation • That interest on loans that fund property situated outside New Zealand will not be covered by the rules. Disposals of property subject to interest limitation • If interest has been denied under interest limitation, and the property is sold in a taxable (revenue account) sale, that the denied interest is potentially deductible in the year of sale. • If the sale is on revenue account because it is a bright-line sale, that the interest is treated as if it were an additional cost of the property, deductible in the year of sale (and not subject to loss ring-fencing), but the net loss from sale (including the interest amount) is deductible only to the extent of gains from the sale of the property, and other property, in the same income year or a later income year. Development and related activities • That the development exemption will apply on a property-by- property basis and will apply to: – interest on property that is held on revenue account under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007, from the date of acquisition; and – interest on other property used for development, subdivision and/or erecting buildings with the aim of creating a new build (by non-CB 7 taxpayers), from the commencement of the development activity. • That the development exemption will apply until the earlier of the date a code of compliance certificate is issued or when the property is sold or disposed of. Definition of new build • That where a hotel/motel unit is converted to a dwelling but no CCC is required, the dwelling would qualify as a new build from the date council records show the change in use took place. New build exemption from interest limitation • That the new build exemption applies from the date of acquisition for new builds acquired off the plans, but the 20-year fixed period is still counted from the date a new build’s CCC is issued. • That the new build exemption ceases from the earlier of the date a new build ceases to be on the land it was added to or 20 years from the date the new build receives its CCC, to ensure the exemption only applies if there is a new build on the land. • That if a new build’s CCC is issued subject to a B2 modification (which generally occurs when a CCC is issued more than five years after building work is substantially completed, and means that a building’s durability is measured from the date of substantial completion instead of the date it receives its CCC), the 20-year fixed period the new build exemption applies for is not counted from the date the new build’s CCC is issued, but instead from the date the building work for the new build was substantially completed. New build bright- line test • That the settings that apply for the 10-year bright-line test also apply for the five-year new build bright-line test (noting that officials have recommended changes to how the main home exclusion works for both the 10-year and new build bright-line tests). Rollover relief • That rollover relief (for interest limitation and bright-line purposes) will apply to settlements of residential property on a family trust (or sales to a family trust), provided that: – every settlor (or seller) of the land is also a beneficiary of the trust; – at least one of the settlors (or sellers) of the land is also a principal settlor of the trust; and IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 27 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] – every beneficiary, except for the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors, has a family connection with a principal settlor (generally a person within 4 degrees of relationship of a principal settlor, or a company that person controls, or a trust of which they are a beneficiary) or is a charity. • That rollover relief (for interest limitation and for bright-line purposes) will apply to transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships where the persons disposing of the land to the LTC/partnership (or acquiring it from the LTC/partnership) have ownership/partnership interests in the LTC/partnership in proportion to: – their individual interests in the land; and – their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land. • That bright-line rollover for settlements on family trusts and for transfers to or from LTCs or partnerships will only apply provided that the amount of consideration is less than or equal to the vendor’s acquisition cost and the other conditions outlined above are met (as applicable). • That for a transfer of the type described directly above except the amount of consideration exceeds the vendor’s acquisition cost, the amount of taxable income to the vendor under the bright-line test will be the actual amount of consideration instead of the market value of the land. • That interest limitation rollover relief will also apply to transfers under relationship property agreements, transfers of inherited property upon the death of the owner, and transfers as part of company amalgamations. This mirrors the existing relief available for the bright-line test. • That transfers of land to effect a change in co-ownership do not reset the bright-line clock to the extent that they do not increase a person’s proportional or notional proportional interest in the land. Interposed entities • That, to minimise compliance costs, the interposed entity rule for close companies and trusts will only apply when the value of residential property subject to limitation comprises at least 10 percent of the interposed entity’s total assets. • That the interposed entity rule for non-close companies will only apply when the value of residential property subject to limitation comprises at least 50 percent of its total assets. • That the apportionment calculation required under the interposed entity rule for close companies and trusts is to be calculated on a quarterly basis. • That, for the purposes of the interposed entity rules, asset values are determined using: – for residential property, including any improvements to the land, the later of:  the property’s recent capital value or annual value as set by a local authority; or  either the cost of the property on acquisition or, if the transaction involves an associated person, its market value; – for all other assets:  the value in the interposed entity’s financial statements, if those statements are prepared in accordance with either generally accepted accounting principles, or minimum IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 28 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] requirements prescribed by an Order in Council made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994; – in all other cases, the asset’s tax value. • That the mixed-use asset rules are to apply in priority to the interest limitation rules for a mixed-use asset that is also residential property. • That, if interest has been allocated to a mixed-use asset that is also residential property, the asset will be excluded from the calculations required under the interposed entity rules. • That there will be a specific anti-avoidance rule to address arrangements where asset values are deliberately increased or decreased to defeat the intent and application of the interposed entities rules. • That there will be a specific anti-avoidance rule to address arrangements involving persons (and their associates) borrowing and on-lending to their interposed entities at a lower interest rate. • That look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships should not be treated as interposed entities as they are transparent for tax purposes. • That when a person uses borrowed money to acquire an ownership interest in an LTC or partnership, the person is treated as borrowing the money to acquire an interest in any residential property owned by the LTC or partnership (in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest or partnership share). • That when a person has used borrowed money to acquire an ownership interest in an interposed company, and the company later becomes an LTC, the person is to continue applying the close company and trusts interposed entity rule to the interest expenditure on the pre-election loan even after the company becomes an LTC. • That, for simplicity, interest expenditure incurred after 1 October 2021 on money borrowed to acquire an ownership interest in an interposed entity before 27 March 2021 will be subject to full limitation instead of the four-year phasing period. • That, for simplicity, a person who uses borrowed money to acquire an ownership interest in an interposed entity will not be allowed a deduction for their interest expenditure when the person no longer holds an interest in the interposed entity, even if the ownership interest was sold for a taxable gain. Implications for the rental loss ring- fencing rules • That interest limitation applies before loss ring-fencing. • That interest limitation applies on a property-by-property basis only, notwithstanding that loss ring-fencing can apply on either (or both) a property-by-property or a portfolio basis. Interest limitation and mixed-use property • That when a loan is traced to a residential investment property, or to shares in a close company/qualifying company that owns a residential investment property, and the property is used to derive income and partly for private use: – the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG are to apply to apportion the interest incurred in the income year between the income earning use and the private use; – the amount apportioned to private use is not allowed as a deduction; and IR2021/341; T2021/2180: Interest limitation on residential investment property and associated bright-line changes – final policy recommendations Page 29 of 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] – the amount apportioned to the income earning use is not allowed as a deduction under the interest limitation rule (and may be allowed as a deduction on a taxable sale of the property in the income year of sale). • That rules be enacted to achieve the above policy, including technical rules relating to the interaction of the mixed-use asset rules and the interest limitation rules.

Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) does not recommend a sunset clause. If Ministers wish to proceed with a sunset clause, HUD recommends at least a 10-year period (i.e. until 1 October 2031). 2.Registered community housing providers (CHPs) manage nearly 15,000 properties, of which over 9,000 are leased. Similarly, HUD and Kāinga Ora collectively lease a large number of properties for use as emergency, transitional and public housing, with lease terms up to 25 years. The CHP sector is capital-constrained, so in the absence of additional government funding, will not be able to quickly replace these properties with new-build properties. While focusing on increasing supply of new builds, Kāinga Ora will continue to leas e properties from time to time to temporarily relocate tenants during major redevelopments. Background 3.On 29 July 2021, Inland Revenue and the Treasury provided a report to the Ministers of Housing, Finance, and Revenue on key policy issues for the design of the new interest limitation rules (IR2021/325 and T2021/1935). This report included discussion on how t he r ules should apply to emergency, transitional, public and council housing. 4.The report noted that the interest limitation rules would generally not affect emergency, transitional or public housing properties owned by Kāinga Ora or registered community housing providers (CHPs). This is because Kāinga Ora, which is subject to income tax, is proposed to be exempt from the interest limitation rules, and CHPs will often be charities (and therefore exempt from income tax), or subject to another income tax exemption. 1 5.However, in the absence of a specific carve-out, properties used for emergency, transitional or public housing that are leased by private landlords to CHPs, Kāinga Ora, or the Crown would be subject to the interest limitation rules. T his would lead to a higher tax cost for t he ow ners of these properties, and subsequently could lead to a reduction in the number of properties available for public housing, or an increase in the cost to CHPs or the government in procuring these properties. In addition, some council housing is provided by council- 1 Some CHPs are not charities or eligible for another income tax exemption. Properties owned by these CHPs would be affected by the interest limitation rules in the absence of a specific carve-out for social housing properties. \[In confidence – BRF21/22081081\] 2 controlled organisations (CCOs), which are not exempt from income tax and would be subject to the interest limitation rules. 6. On 4 August 2021, the Ministers of Housing, Finance, and Revenue met to discuss the report and agreed to exempt from the interest limitation rules all properties used for emergency, transitional, public and council housing (“the social housing exemption”). Owing to the Government’s desire to move away from the leasing model for the provision of public housing, the prospect of a sunset clause for the exemption was raised in the meeting. We understand the Ministers of Finance and Revenue’s agreement to the social housing exemption was based on the inclusion of this sunset clause for leased properties. 7. The sunset clause that has been proposed would only be for leased social housing properties. Other types of social housing would still require a permanent exemption from interest limitation (for example, properties owned by a CCO or a CHP not eligible for an income tax exemption). Sunset clause to the social housing exemption, for leased properties only 8. The purpose of the sunset clause would be to support the Government’s intention of moving away from the leasing model for the provision of public housing. As stated in the Public Housing Plan 2021-2024, the Government wants to see “an increase in the number of new build public housing and a progressive decrease in the proportion of private market homes leased for public housing”. However, it is acknowledged that leasing arrangements may remain necessary in particular circumstances, particularly in priority areas where the need for social housing is most acute. HUD does not consider that a sunset clause is necessary to support the Government’s intention of moving away from leasing arrangements 9. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) does not recommend a sunset clause for the social housing exemption from interest limitation for leased properties. Continuing to provide these properties with an exemption from the interest limitation rules will not get in the way of efforts to progressively decrease the proportion of public housing properties leased from the private market. Even without a sunset clause, as the number of leasing arrangements progressively decreases, there will be fewer private market rentals eligible for the exemption. 10. As noted above, despite the intention to move away from leasing arrangements, there will be circumstances in which leased properties are still necessary to supplement the supply of social housing. This applies particularly in areas where the need for social housing is most acute, or where Kāinga Ora needs to temporarily relocate tenants to undertake major redevelopment. A sunset clause could increase the difficulty of meeting demand for social housing in these areas upon expiration of the exemption. This would be especially true if the exemption expired before the sector has been able to make significant progress in increasing the amount of non-leased social housing properties. 11. Currently CHPs manage almost 15,000 public housing properties of which over 9,000 are leased. Increasing the number of new build public housing properties and progressively decreasing the proportion of leased properties is going to take time, particularly given the capital constraints most CHPs face. A sunset clause should not apply until at least 2031 to give sufficient time for social housing providers to move away from leasing arrangements 12. If Ministers decide a sunset clause for leased properties is necessary, HUD recommends it not apply until at least 1 October 2031 (i.e. a 10 year period) to give social housing providers enough time to make significant progress towards increasing the amount of non-leased properties. In addition, HUD recommends that any properties leased for social housing before 1 October 2031 should remain exempt from the interest limitation rules for the entirety of the leasing arrangement that has been entered into. The terms of these leasing agreements can last up to 25 years and there is a risk that the agreements could be \[In confidence – BRF21/22081081\] 3 cancelled if the sunset clause causes the owner to become subject to the interest limitation rules. A sunset clause should not apply to leasing arrangements between associated parties 13. There may also be some circumstances where a provider of social housing does not have legal ownership of its properties, despite having effective economic ownership. For example, a CHP may set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to construct and hold its properties, with the SPV leasing these properties back to the CHP. HUD recommends that any sunset clause should not apply to these sorts of leasing arrangements between associated parties. This would ensure CHPs are not required to re-structure their property holdings to avoid being impacted by the interest limitation rules upon expiration of the social housing exemption for leased properties. Consultation 14. The Treasury and Inland Revenue were consulted on this briefing. 15. Inland Revenue would prefer that the social housing exemption not contain a sunset clause for leased properties. Inland Revenue is still working through the practical implications of administering an exemption for all housing used for emergency, transitional, public and council housing, including monitoring and verification requirements to support the integrity of the interest limitation rule. Given the inherent complexities associated with an exemption for such housing, a sunset clause for leased properties would likely be more complex due to proposed exceptions and requirements surrounding the tracking of contract dates. Next steps 16. We recommend you discuss this briefing with your colleagues, the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue, and indicate to officials by 2 September whether a sunset clause for leased properties is necessary for the social housing exemption and if so, the design of the sunset clause. Recommended actions 17. It is recommended that you: 1. Note that the Ministers of Housing, Finance, and Revenue agreed to an exemption from the interest limitation rules for properties used as emergency, transitional public or council housing, regardless of who owns the property. Noted 2. Note that the agreement to the exemption was based on it being subject to a sunset clause for leased properties. Noted 3.

The attached paper is for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee to consider at its meeting on Wednesday 22 September 2021. The paper needs to be referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 16 September 2021. 2. In March 2021, Cabinet agreed to extend the bright-line test from 5 years to 10 years (CAB-21-MIN-0070 refers). Cabinet also agreed in-principle to limit interest deductions for residential property and to some of its key features (CAB-21-Min- 0045 refers). Cabinet directed officials to consult on the detail of the proposal, with decisions to be confirmed by Cabinet following consultation. 3. The attached paper seeks Cabinet’s: 3.1 confirmation of its earlier in-principle decisions; 3.2 agreement to key aspects of the interest limitation proposal; 3.3 agreement to some changes relating to the bright-line test extension; 3.4 approval of changes to appropriations to give effect to the tax reforms; 3.5 agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising in consultation with the Minister of Housing or Minister for Land Information as appropriate; 3.6 agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) containing the interest limitation and bright-line measures at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021– 22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Key points in Cabinet Paper 4. The attached paper provides an overview of the interest limitation proposal and changes associated with the bright-line test extension. It outlines, at a high level, what the interest limitation proposal is and what it will and will not apply to. 5. The main areas to be aware of in advance of the Cabinet meeting are: 5.1 Purpose-built rentals (also known as “build-to-rent”); 5.2 Public, council, emergency and transitional housing; and 5.3 New build exemption.

There is likely to be discussion over whether purpose-built rentals (PBRs) should be excluded from the interest limitation proposal. 7. 8. Public, council, emergency and transitional housing 9. The Cabinet paper proposes an exclusion for this type of housing to eliminate the risk of a reduction in supply. Previously, the Minister of Finance, Minister of Housing and Minister of Revenue had agreed to exclude this housing (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). However, we understand that the Minister of Finance’s and Minister of Revenue’s support for the exclusion was based on the inclusion of a sunset provision for public housing properties leased from the private market. 10. On 26 August HUD provided a briefing to the Minister of Housing on whether to have a sunset provision for leased properties, and if so, how to design it (BRF21/22081081). This briefing recommended against having a sunset provision for leased properties. Continuing to provide the exclusion to leased properties would not hinder efforts by the Government to progressively decrease the proportion of public housing properties leased from the private market. A sunset provision for leased properties would also increase the complexity for Inland Revenue in administering the rules. 11. The Cabinet paper does not currently propose a sunset provision for leased properties. However, a sunset provision for leased properties can be added into the Cabinet paper at Ministers’ direction. New build exemption 12. In March 2021, Cabinet directed officials to consult on three options for the design and duration of the new build exemption. The new build exemption balances trade- offs between maximising the impact of interest limitation on house prices (suggesting a shorter exemption) and minimising impacts on housing supply (suggesting a longer exemption). 13. Following consultation, you agreed that the new build exemption should apply to both initial and subsequent purchasers for 20 years after a code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/382; T2021/2316; BRF21/22091096: Cabinet Paper – Taxation of Housing: Limiting Interest Deductions for Residential Property and Changes Related to the Bright-Line Extension Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications 14. The estimated revenue gain from the interest limitation proposal is $1.12 billion over the forecast period. $ millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Tax revenue: Income tax 80.000 200.000 350.000 490.000 15. The revenue will decline from 2026 as investment is increasingly reallocated towards new builds. 16. This estimate is highly uncertain due to the assumptions and projections involved. 17. Implementation and administration of the reforms will increase the outreach, assistance, compliance and policy work expected of Inland Revenue over an extended period of time, especially while different rules apply during the phase-out period. 18. The complexity of the new rules, added to others for taxing property, means the resulting work items are not simple or quick to manage. The likely enactment date and the application dates also add pressure in what is a very busy period for Inland Revenue. There is a compressed impact in the final 2021/22 quarter peak for supporting customers and delivery partners to understand the immediate impact on their return filing and provisional tax payment obligations, particularly for customers without tax agents. While 82% of rental property owners have tax agents, only 52% of the customers who have interest expenses have tax agents. 19. Given the immediate effect of the rules from 1 October 2021, Inland Revenue will initially focus on providing customers and third parties with clear information and assistance to support accurate self-assessments and payments return filing. Automated analytic and intervention capabilities will be deployed, with follow-up activity for cases of obvious deliberate non-compliance. Inland Revenue expects increased customer contacts in particular following the introduction of the SOP and enactment and estimates an expected response rate of the affected customer base of 15% initially, reducing to 2% over 10 years. Additional Inland Revenue services include outbound letter campaign, marketing campaign to support customers and increase voluntary compliance, seminars and 1:1 advisory visits to present the legislative changes, proactive (compliance) actions, audit activities, technical and legal support to Inland Revenue staff, technical publications to provide certainty to customers, and delivering analytics and reporting capability to monitor and support the intelligence lead compliance approach. 20. Inland Revenue is seeking funding totalling $19.38 million over the forecast period to help meet additional administration and implementation costs of the reforms. Inland Revenue considers this amount sufficient to support the forecast revenue gain. A one-off amount is also sought in the 2022-23 fiscal year for policy work on new boundaries, definitions within the legislation and areas identified for further policy development. Some remedial legislation is expected to be required. 21. Inland Revenue will report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue annually on the effect of this funding on taxpayers’ compliance with the interest limitation rules and the changes to the bright-line rules. 22. While funding is sought in the draft Cabinet paper over the forecast period only, Inland Revenue thinks there is significant compliance work required beyond the forecast period. This is particularly because the phase-out period over four years IR2021/382; T2021/2316; BRF21/22091096: Cabinet Paper – Taxation of Housing: Limiting Interest Deductions for Residential Property and Changes Related to the Bright-Line Extension Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] means the first “standard” year when the ability to deduct interest is completely phased-out is the 2025–26 income year. 23.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Housing Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee Taxation of Housing: Limiting Interest Deductions for Residential Property and Changes Related to the Bright-Line Extension Proposal This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to a package of tax reforms that would: 1.1 limit interest deductions for investors in residential property; and 1.2 address issues arising out of the extension of the bright-line test from five years to ten years. The reforms follow Cabinet’s in-principle decisions on 8 March 2021 (CAB-21-MIN- 0045 refers) and the Government’s public consultation on a discussion document (Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules). Relation to Government Priorities The Government is committed to laying the foundations for a better future through addressing housing affordability. This includes making changes to tax settings to improve affordability for first home buyers by dampening investor demand for existing properties. On 15 February 2021 (CAB-21-MIN-0018 refers), Cabinet agreed on the following policy objectives for the housing market: 4.1 Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry, and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. 4.2 Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first- home buyers. 4.3 Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well-regulated. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The reforms outlined in this paper seek primarily to address the second objective above by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, thereby creating more opportunities for first home buyers. However, the proposals have also been considered against the other two housing market objectives above. Executive Summary In March 2021, Cabinet agreed to two tax proposals that would reduce investor demand for existing housing and improve housing affordability for first home buyers (CAB-21-MIN-0045 refers). The first proposal was an extension of the bright-line test, which taxes gains from residential land sold within a specified period. Cabinet agreed to extend the bright-line period from five years to ten years, except for new builds, and the change was included in a Bill enacted on 30 March 2021. 1 The second proposal was to limit investors’ interest deductions relating to residential property with effect from 1 October 2021, again with an exemption for new builds. As limiting interest deductions can be complex, Cabinet agreed in-principle to the proposal and some of its key features in order to provide sufficient certainty in an announcement. Cabinet directed officials to consult on the detail of the proposal, with decisions to be confirmed following consultation. Consultation on the interest limitation proposal has now been completed. This paper asks Cabinet to confirm its earlier in-principle decisions and seeks agreement on key features of the reforms. These include: 8.1 property that should be subject to interest limitation; 8.2 exclusions and exemptions from interest limitation; 8.3 the design and length of the new build exemption; and 8.4 treatment of previously limited interest deductions when a property is taxed on sale. The estimated revenue gain from the interest limitation proposal is $1.12 billion over the forecast period. The revenue will decline from 2026 as investment is increasingly reallocated towards new builds, for which interest deductions will continue to be allowed. It should be noted that the estimate is highly uncertain due to the assumptions and projections involved. Implementation and administration of the reforms will increase the outreach, assistance, compliance and policy work expected of Inland Revenue over an extended period of time. Additional funding of $19.38 million over the forecast period is sought to help meet additional administration and implementation costs. This paper also seeks Cabinet’s agreement to delegate authority to: 10.1 the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) containing these reforms at the Finance 1 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 (2021 No 8). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and Expenditure Committee stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 10.2 the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising from the interest limitation proposal or additional bright-line changes in consultation with the Minister of Housing and Minister for Land Information as appropriate. Background Housing costs compared to income are high in New Zealand compared to other OECD countries. 2 Housing affordability is an important factor in determining people’s wellbeing, particularly for low-income families where housing costs represent a higher proportion of total income. Nationally, house prices have been rising at a rate faster than wages over the past five years. 3 This trend has accelerated over the past year. House prices have increased 25.2% percent year-on-year to July 2021, with the median price at that time being $826,000. 4 There are many different reasons for these increases. The Government views housing affordability as a priority and has a number of initiatives underway to address this. These tax reforms are part of these initiatives. The reforms tackle the issue of high house prices from the demand side, by reducing investor demand for residential property. The Government is also introducing a package of supply-side measures to address housing affordability in the long term. However, these measures will take some time to have an impact. Many landlords who invest in residential property do so expecting to earn a large capital gain when they sell their property. The current tax system allows landlords to deduct all interest expenditure relating to their residential rental properties, even if they do not pay any tax on the capital gain when they sell their property. This situation will not be allowed to continue and interest deductions related to residential rental properties will be limited. To ensure there is no adverse impact on housing supply, property development and new builds will be exempt from the interest limitation rules. On 10 June 2021, the Government released a discussion document on the design of the interest limitation rule and additional changes relating to the bright-line test. Over 450 submissions were received. This paper seeks to confirm the in-principle decisions previously made by Cabinet, and to get approval for other key design decisions that arose in the course of consultation. Overview of tax proposals As noted above, in March 2021 Cabinet made the in-principle decision to limit deductions for interest incurred to earn income from residential property (CAB-21-MIN- 2 OECD Better Life Index (2020). http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/housing/. 3 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, pp 48, Figure 35. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing-in-Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in- aotearoa-2020.pdf 4 REINZ Monthly Report July, pp 3 (Released 12 August 2021). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 0045 refers). In summary, the key in-principle decisions relating to the interest limitation proposal are: 15.1 the rules would apply to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021; 15.2 for pre-existing loans relating to property acquired before 27 March 2021, interest denial would be phased at 25 percent per year over four years; 15.3 loans drawn down after 27 March 2021 would be subject to full limitation from 1 October 2021 regardless of when the property was acquired; 15.4 property developers can continue deducting interest expenses as incurred; 15.5 new build properties would be exempt from the interest limitation rules, with officials consulting on the details of this; and 15.6 officials would consult on whether deductions should be denied or merely deferred if the taxpayer is ultimately taxed on the disposal of their property. In addition to the interest limitation decisions above, Cabinet agreed to extend the bright-line test from five years to ten years. The bright-line test taxes residential land that is bought and sold within the specified “bright-line” period. Cabinet noted that officials would consult on issues arising from the bright-line extension, including how new builds would be exempted from that extension. Since March, much work has been undertaken on the detail of the proposals. Rules have been developed so that the interest limitation reforms will apply to the types of property that people might buy to live in but will not over-reach. It is also important to ensure that the reforms do not unduly impede those who are building or buying newly constructed properties, so that the supply of housing is not disrupted. Following consultation, we have decided it would be appropriate to allow interest deductions to those who are taxed on the sale of their properties, either under the bright-line test or another tax provision. In such cases, all income earned has been taxed, so all expenses that relate to that taxed income should be deductible at the time of sale. The interest limitation rules will apply to the types of property that people might buy to live in... The proposed reforms are targeted at properties that can function as long-term residences, such as houses or apartments. To determine what should be in scope of the interest limitation rule, the key focus is whether a property is of a type that would be suitable for long-term owner-occupation. We consider the following factors are a helpful starting point: 19.1 Physical structure and configuration. Is the property configured in such a way that an owner-occupier could live in it for the long-term? If not, how difficult would it be to configure the property for owner-occupation? 19.2 Ease of conversion. If a property is already configured for long-term residential accommodation, would an exclusion lead to properties being converted to 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] qualify for this exclusion (conversion risk)? Are there many barriers to conversion? 19.3 Existing regulatory frameworks. Is the property subject to an existing regulatory framework with well-defined rules about who can live in it? For example, retirement villages and student hostels are subject to existing regulatory frameworks. If so, this may suggest that it would be difficult to convert the property to gain an exemption and that it is not suitable for owner-occupation. We propose that the interest limitation proposal should apply to houses and apartments suitable for long-term accommodation, even if they are not currently used as such. Income tax should not play a role in determining whether a given property is used to provide long-term rental accommodation or short-stay accommodation. We do not want landlords converting their rental properties to short-stay accommodation to avoid being impacted by the reforms. ... but should not over-reach We do not want interest limitation to apply to those who do not contribute to high house prices. Decisions about what should and should not be subject to interest limitation are not necessarily clear-cut and lines have had to be drawn. In doing so, we have tried to minimise boundary issues. To that end, we propose the following exclusions: 21.1 Main home. The reforms will not affect interest related to taxable income derived from a person’s main home. People who rent out an extra bedroom in their main home or conduct work from a home office will not be affected by the reforms. 21.2 Public, council, emergency and transitional housing. To eliminate the risk of interest limitation reducing the supply of public, council, emergency or transitional housing, we propose that such housing will not be subject to interest limitation. 21.3 Property not suitable for long-term owner-occupation. We propose to exclude property that is not structurally suitable for long-term owner-occupation from the reforms, as they do not contribute to high house prices. These include property types used by businesses to provide commercial accommodation at scale (such as hotels, motels, hostels, and inns), rest homes, retirement villages and student accommodation (school hostels and accommodation provided by, or in conjunction with, a tertiary institution). 21.4 Other businesses and organisations not primarily involved in accommodation. The reforms should not get in the way of ordinary businesses and organisations not involved in residential property investment, as they do not contribute to high house prices. We propose that, generally, business premises, employee accommodation, farmland and care facilities (such as hospitals, convalescence homes, nursing homes, and hospices) will not be subject to interest limitation. 21.5 Compliance costs. Taxpayers can allocate debt to either residential or non- residential assets. Taxpayers that own small amounts of in-scope residential property incidental to their core business or function will usually be able to ensure they continue receiving interest deductions, but at a potentially high 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] compliance cost. We therefore propose to exclude companies from the reforms unless they are residential property-rich or are controlled by a small number of shareholders. For the same reason, we propose to exclude Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities and its wholly-owned subsidiaries from the reforms, as almost all of their assets would be excluded. 21.6 Māori collectively-owned land. We propose to exclude Māori collectively owned land and housing which is provided to iwi, hapū, and whānau members (for example papakāinga and kaumātua housing). These properties are not available on the ordinary housing market and their inclusion would not further the aims of interest limitation. The Government aims to improve housing outcomes for Māori, and an exclusion for housing provided by iwi and hapū to their members would further that objective. To that end, we propose exclusions for: 21.6.1 Māori customary land, Māori freehold land, Crown land reserved for Māori, and land set aside as a Māori reservation; 21.6.2 housing provided on land held by a Māori authority (or an entity eligible to be one) to a shareholder or beneficiary of that entity, meaning an iwi, hapū or whānau member; and 21.6.3 land held by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) that was acquired under a Treaty settlement or a post-Treaty settlement mechanism, including where a leasehold interest in that land is held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. Housing provided on these types of land is normally exclusively available to Māori who are part of the relevant iwi or hapū represented by the relevant Māori authority and does not affect the general housing supply. This exclusion also ensures that the process of Treaty settlements is not affected by the interest limitation rules. 21.7 Property outside New Zealand. The reforms should not apply to properties located outside New Zealand as it reduces complexity and because they do not impact New Zealand house prices. People building and buying newly built properties will be exempt To minimise the potential impacts of interest limitation on housing supply, there will be exemptions for people who add to the supply of housing. As noted above, Cabinet agreed in-principle that property developers would not be affected by the rules and could continue deducting their interest expenses. It also agreed that new builds would be exempt from the rules (with officials to consult on the details). Following consultation, we propose to expand those exemptions to further help supply and lower compliance costs. We propose that the exemption for developers include all property development which results in the construction of a new build, whether or not it is done by a property developer. We also propose that residential property acquired for the purposes of a 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] business involved in dealing in, subdividing, developing, or building on land should qualify for the development exemption. Cabinet directed officials to consult on three options for the duration of the new build exemption. Following consultation, we propose that the new build exemption will apply for both the initial and subsequent owners of a new build until 20 years after the date a code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued. A 20-year exemption reduces the impact interest limitation would have on new housing supply, while ensuring the exemption is not so broad that it undermines the objective of dampening house price inflation. We also propose a small change to Cabinet’s in-principle decision that only properties purchased on or after 27 March 2021 and which were first purchased within 12 months of receiving their CCCs could qualify for the new build exemption. This in-principle decision would have meant that any new build that received its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 could, depending on when it was acquired, potentially qualify for the exemption. To make the rules simpler, we propose that the new build exemption will apply to any new build that receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020, regardless of when the property was acquired. This is easier both for taxpayers to apply and for Inland Revenue to administer, and ensures that identical properties are not treated differently. An issue we have considered is whether an existing dwelling could qualify for the new build exemption if it has been remediated. This is a difficult question because of the boundary issues that arise. Some types of remediation clearly help prevent dwellings from dropping out of existing housing supply, such as required earthquake strengthening work or re-cladding a leaky building. However, a rule that is too broad, and allows existing dwellings that haven’t been significantly remediated to qualify for an exemption, could undermine the overall objective of the interest limitation rule. At this stage we do not propose to exempt existing dwellings that have been remediated but officials will do more work on options for how this might be achieved without undermining the broader policy. Purpose-built rentals Purpose-built rentals (PBRs), also known as build-to-rent, are large-scale property developments held in unified ownership with the intention of retaining the properties as long-term rentals. There are few existing PBRs as it is not yet a well-established sector in New Zealand. Like other newly built residential property, PBRs will be eligible for the development exemption while they are being built, and for the new build exemption for 20 years. However, the PBR industry believe that a carve-out is necessary, because the prospect of interest deductions being denied upon expiration of the new build exemption would reduce the likelihood of PBRs being constructed. There is no pre-existing statutory definition for PBRs in New Zealand. As such, a definition of PBR would need to be created for the purposes of an exclusion from the interest limitation rules. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 s 9(2)(f)(iv) 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development comment Inland Revenue comment 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Interest deductions should be allowed if a sale is taxed Cabinet had agreed that officials would consult on whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred if the property is taxed on sale under the bright-line test or another provision. Following consultation, we propose that in such a case, the interest deductions will be allowed in the year of sale. The reason is that all of the income from owning the property (including the gain on sale) will have been taxed. If a bright-line sale results in a loss, there is currently a rule that restricts deducting that loss against income other than taxable real property gains. We propose that the existing rule be extended to include losses arising from deferred interest deductions being allowed on sale. Bright-line issues The bright-line test imposes tax when residential land, other than the main home, is bought and sold within a specified period. On 30 March 2021, the bright-line period was extended from five years to ten years for property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. Cabinet noted that officials would consult on some bright-line issues that would benefit from stakeholder consultation. In summary, those issues are: 38.1 New build exemption from bright-line extension. Cabinet agreed to exempt new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 from the extended bright-line test and directed officials to consult on the exemption. Apart from its length, we consider 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] that the settings that apply for the ten-year bright-line test should also apply for the five-year new build bright-line test. 38.2 Main home exclusion. To ensure the main home is never taxed under the bright- line test, we will amend the main home exclusion for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. The exclusion currently applies only if a property is predominantly used as a main home. We will ensure that if a property is not predominantly used as a main home (for example, if there is a rental property that takes up a greater area on the same land), apportionment will apply so that the property used as the main home is not taxed. 38.3 Rollover relief. The bright-line test is triggered when there has been a legal change of ownership. Unfairness may arise if there has been a legal transfer but economic ownership remains unchanged. For example, a reorganisation for non-tax reasons can trigger the bright-line test and create a tax liability. We therefore propose to provide rollover relief for certain transfers (which, in effect, ignores the transfer for tax purposes). Relief would be provided for some transfers to family trusts, and to or from look-through companies and partnerships. Specific relief will also be provided for transfers to trusts constituted under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (given they typically have wider beneficiary classes as a result of succession and restrictions on alienating Māori land) and transfers to a trust of land as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti o Waitangi – the Treaty of Waitangi. Additional policy decisions The proposed reforms involve a lot of detail, largely because of their interaction with other parts of the tax system. In addition to the design decisions already mentioned, there are many other more technical decisions needed. In particular, decisions are needed to: 39.1 prevent people from engaging in tax avoidance to get around the rules; 39.2 ensure that the rules work with other parts of the tax system; and 39.3 deal with transition issues and other minor details. The key policy decisions for interest limitation and bright-line issues are covered in this paper. We propose that Cabinet authorise the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising from the interest limitation proposal or additional bright-line changes in consultation with the Minister of Housing and Minister for Land Information as appropriate. Implementation The table below sets out the upcoming milestones for the reforms set out in this paper. Milestone Timeframe Cabinet approval of policy and delegation to release SOP 27 September 2021 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Milestone Timeframe Public release of SOP to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 28 September 2021 Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) calls for submissions on the SOP 29 September 2021 Application date for the interest limitation changes 1 October 2021 FEC submissions close 10 November 2021 Bill reported back from FEC early March 2022 Third reading and Royal Assent before 31 March 2022 Although the application date will be retrospective, taxpayers will not have to file their tax returns until after the end of their income year. For almost all taxpayers, the reforms will affect their income year ended 31 March 2022, for which returns and payments are not due until May 2022 at the earliest. 5 Moreover, the key features of the proposed reforms were announced in March 2021 and have been widely publicised since then, so most taxpayers should be aware of the changes. Financial Implications The estimated revenue gain from the interest limitation reforms is $1.12 billion between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2025, with more revenue generated in the later years. This is largely due to the phased implementation of the reforms for existing rental properties. $ millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Tax revenue: Income tax 80.000 200.000 350.000 490.000 The revenue will then decline from 2026 as investment is increasingly reallocated towards new builds. The revenue estimate is uncertain due to the assumptions and projections involved, as well as the interaction with other parts of the tax system. The actual revenue gain will depend on broader macroeconomic factors such as the trend of future interest rates and house prices. Behavioural impacts, including how the reforms may impact investors’ preferences for existing rental properties compared to new builds or other investments, will also affect the estimate. If rents increase, the tax reforms may also lead to an increase in spending on the accommodation supplement and temporary additional support. However, it is difficult to quantify this impact at this stage. 5 Returns for taxpayers with a standard 31 March 2022 balance date will be due in July 2022. However, the new interest limitation rules could affect the amount of their third provisional tax payment, due in May 2022. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Administrative implications Implementation and administration of the reforms will increase workloads for Inland Revenue over an extended period of time. Apart from capital costs required to design and implement the solutions, further costs will arise from managing an increased number of customer contacts, investing in good data and analytics to assist in monitoring the policy, and supporting the integrity of the rules. Inland Revenue will initially focus on providing customers and third parties with clear information and assistance to support accurate self-assessments and return filing. Automated analytic and intervention capabilities will be deployed, with follow-up activity for cases of obvious deliberate non-compliance. A summary of the estimated incremental administrative costs over four years are provided in the table below: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Capital 1.400 - - - Operating 3.580 5.920 5.260 4.620 Depreciation & Capital Charge 0.050 0.200 0.200 0.200 Total operating 3.630 6.120 5.460 4.820 Inland Revenue is seeking funding totalling $19.380 million to cover the operating cost (excluding depreciation and capital charge) for the period 2021/22 to 2024/25. The department considers this amount sufficient to support the forecast revenue gain. Modelling for 2025/26 and subsequent periods indicates there will be further costs in the out-years. Inland Revenue intends to raise these as part of future budget discussions, by which time more certainty will exist. Inland Revenue will use its accumulated depreciation reserves to fund the capital costs required to develop and integrate the solution. The use of $1.400 million of these reserves will not materially affect Inland Revenue’s ability to fund the replacement of existing assets in the future. Since Inland Revenue is self-funding the capital costs, it is not seeking funding for the associated depreciation and capital charge. Inland Revenue will report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue annually on the effect of this funding on taxpayers’ compliance with the interest limitation rules and changes to the bright-line rules. Legislative Implications Implementing these reforms will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. We propose to include the legislative changes for these reforms in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Matters) Bill. This paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to release an SOP containing these reforms at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the Bill. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill holds a category 4 priority on the 2021 Legislation Programme (to be referred to a select committee in 2021). Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment The Quality Assurance Panel with representatives from Inland Revenue and the Treasury has reviewed the Limiting interest deductibility on residential investment property regulatory impact statement (RIS) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Assessing the impact of each option depends on judgements about how much and how quickly housing supply responds to economic signals such as price. Further, the timeframe for policy development has been constrained. Given this, the panel considers that the information in the RIS is as complete as could reasonably be expected and identifies the main judgements, risks and uncertainties within the policy. However, the RIS does not analyse the impacts of the interest limitation policy in conjunction with other measures that have been recently implemented or are being considered. Further, while public consultation was carried out on the design of the proposal to limit interest deductibility, the public have not specifically been consulted on the problem definition and the broader range of options (although where stakeholders provided general comments on the proposal and suggested alternatives through the public consultation process, these comments have been incorporated into the RIS). Consequently, the panel cannot be confident that the full range of impacts have been identified or that the preferred options are the best options to address the problem and achieve the desired objectives. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to any of the proposals in this paper as the threshold for significance has not been met. Population Implications The number of taxpayers likely to be directly affected by the interest limitation proposal is estimated to be around 250,000. We also expect the proposal to have indirect impacts on other parts of the population. The proposal is likely to put downward pressure on house prices and upward pressure on rents. The size of these impacts is unclear. In particular, there are differing views on the likely impact of the interest limitation proposal on rents, which is complex and uncertain. Rents can be affected by a number of factors including the costs to property 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] investors, renters’ ability to pay, and the responsiveness of housing supply to changes in the price of housing. The size of the proposal’s impacts on house prices and rents will determine how the following population groups are likely to be affected: 61.1 Children. The potential for increased affordability for first home buyers is likely to benefit the children of first home buyers who are parents. However, in 2013, around 43% of children were living in rental accommodation. 6 Upward pressure on rents could have negative effects on children in rental accommodation, thereby impacting child wellbeing and child poverty. 61.2 Māori and Pacific people. Māori and Pacific people are less likely to own their home (or hold it in a trust) than other ethnic groups. In 2018, the proportion of Māori and Pacific people living in owner-occupied homes were 47.2% and 35.1% respectively, compared to the total population figure of 64.3%. To the extent that the proposal places upward pressure on rents, it appears likely to disproportionately impact Māori and Pacific people. However, some Māori people who do not live in owner-occupied homes instead live in papakāinga and kaumātua housing. As explained above, we propose to exclude those types of properties from the reforms. In addition, the Government is taking other measures to improve housing for Māori and Pacific, including through Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga, Progressive Home Ownership, Māori and Iwi Housing Innovation (MAIHI) partnerships and our Public Housing build programme. As noted above, the magnitude of the effect of the interest limitation proposal on house prices and rents is uncertain, so the size of the impact on population groups described above is also uncertain. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development monitors market impacts, including on the rental market, closely and will continue to do so after the reforms. This monitoring can help assess whether further interventions may be necessary. Furthermore, officials will report to the Ministers for Child Poverty Reduction, Finance, Housing, Social Development and Employment, and Revenue on options for changes to family and housing support as part of the welfare overhaul, particularly as part of the Working for Families and Accommodation Supplement review. Human Rights The proposals comply with the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development worked closely together in the development of the proposed reforms. Officials have also consulted with Land Information New Zealand, Te Puni Kōkiri, Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Kāinga Ora. 6 Johnson, Howden-Chapman and Eaqub A Stocktake of New Zealand’s Housing (February 2018) <www.beehive.govt.nz> at 40. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:41 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The Government released a public discussion document on the proposed reforms in June. Consultation was open for more than four weeks and 484 submissions were received. The majority of submitters were private landlords, although some were from tax advisors, property investor representative groups, real estate agents, iwi groups, and property developers. Submissions were generally opposed to the reforms. Officials also undertook targeted consultation with a smaller number of interested stakeholders both before and after the release of the discussion document. Communications The in-principle decisions made by Cabinet were announced in March 2021. We will make an announcement on the contents of the SOP containing the proposed reforms when the SOP is released on 28 September 2021. Fact sheets and questions and answers will be provided to help those affected understand the legislation. Bill commentary for the SOP will also be released shortly after. Inland Revenue will also include details of the new legislation in guidance as soon as practicable after the Bill is enacted.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1. POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Use of money interest rates review Date: 5 July 2022 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2022/347 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to adjust the use of money interest rates as set out in the report. 18 July 2022 Sign and refer the attached paper to the Cabinet Office for consideration at the LEG meeting on 4 August 2022. Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) Bradd Forster Policy Advisor \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 5 July 2022 Minister of Revenue Use of money interest rates review Purpose 1. This report brings to your attention the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. It seeks your agreement to increasing the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates . 3. The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4. There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5. The underpayment rate is currently 7.28%, based on RBNZ figures from December 2021, while the overpayment rate is capped so that it cannot go below zero, where it currently is. Principles for updating the rates 6. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-da y bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. IR2022/347: Use of money interest rates review Page 1 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 7. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the day after the next standard provisional tax payment date – which is 28 August 2022. However, 28 August falls on a Sunday which makes 29 August 2022 the date that tax payable is due. Therefore, the increased UOMI rates start applying from the next day which is 30 August 2022. 8. The next Executive Council meeting is scheduled on 8 August 2022. To minimise compliance costs the new rates should apply from 30 August 2022. To meet this deadline, a waiver of the 28-day rule is required. This is recommended due to the possibility for the UOMI rates to become seriously misaligned with market interest rates if the change is delayed until the next possible date to update the UOMI rates. 9. The formula for setting the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 as follows: 9.1 Section 2 of the Regulations provides that the taxpayer’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (or 2.5%); 9.2 Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point). However, if this calculation would produce a figure lower than 0%, the rate is instead set at 0%, to ensure overpayments do not accrue negative interest. 10. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue like a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e., the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 11. The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent a payment of tax to Inland Revenue being used as an investment. Results of latest RBNZ figure review 12. According to RBNZ figures from May 2022, the 90-day bank bill rate has risen more than 100 basis points from its position at December 2021, which triggers the UOMI rates to be reset. 13. The UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 7.96%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 1.22%. 14. The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 68 basis points since December 2021 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should be increased by 68 basis points, from 7.28% to 7.96%. 15. The overpayment rate should be increased by 122 basis points, from 0% to 1.22%, due to the 90-d ay bank bill rate rising 131 basis points between December 2021 and May 2022. This discrepancy is due to the overpayment rate previously being set at the lower limit of 0%.

Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. 21. This increase will in turn have a very small financial impact on Vote Customs. Customs collected $342,397.82 compensatory interest in the 12 months to 30 June 2022. They advise us that an additional 68 basis point increase in the UOMI would collect an additional $31,982.221 compensatory interest. Next steps 22.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2022 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2 It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 7.96%, while the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 1.22%. Policy 3 The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5 The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7 The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 7.28% and 0% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 10 May 2022 and were based on the interest rates for December 2021. 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 2. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8 The RBNZ interest rates for May 2022 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 131 basis points, to 2.22%, since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long- term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 1.22%. 9 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 68 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 7.96%. Timing and 28-day rule 10 I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 8 August 2022. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 30 August 2022, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. 11 To meet this deadline, a waiver of the 28-day rule is required. I recommend that this waiver be granted. The next possible date for updating the use of money interest rates is the day after 15 January 2023, the next available standard provisional tax payment date. As interest rates are climbing rapidly and will likely continue to rise, delaying the update until January is likely to result in serious misalignment of the use of money interest rates and the relevant market interest rates, which poses potential fiscal risks. Compliance 12 The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 12.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 12.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 12.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 12.5 relevant international standards and obligations 12.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee 13 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 15 A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Financial Implications 16 The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 30 August 2022, is estimated to result in net negative revenue of approximately $119 million over the forecast period. While the change to the underpayment rate will increase revenue over the forecast period, the increased overpayment rate will reduce revenue over the forecast period at a greater rate. This is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 and outyears Tax Revenue impact of change to Underpayment rate - 17.000 21.000 21.000 21.000 Tax Revenue impact of change to Overpayment rate - (29.000) (35.000) (35.000) (35.000) Net Tax Revenue Impact - (12.000) (14.000) (14.000) (14.000) 17 Additionally, a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, meaning the cost to revenue is larger than the net revenue impact reported above. To represent this, underpayments are impaired by 78.7% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 18 The total fiscal impact and operating expenditure for the forecast period taking this impairment into account are presented in the table below 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: - (12.000) (14.000) (14.000) (14.000) Tax Revenue Non-Departmental Other Expense: - 14.000 17.000 17.000 17.000 Impairment of debt and debt write-offs Total operating - 26.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 Publicity 19 Inland Revenue will publish an item about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin.

This report brings to your attention the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates. It seeks your agreement to increasing the rates in line with the latest increases in market interest rates. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates, along with other rates used in the tax system, 1 are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates . 3. The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. UOMI rates 4. There are two UOMI rates: 4.1 the taxpayer’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI underpayment rate), which is charged on underpayments of tax to Inland Revenue; 4.2 the Commissioner’s paying rate (also known as the UOMI overpayment rate), which is paid by the Commissioner on money paid to Inland Revenue above a taxpayer’s tax liability. 5. The underpayment rate is currently 7.28%, based on RBNZ figures from December 2021, while the overpayment rate is capped so that it cannot go below zero, where it currently is. Principles for updating the rates 6. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 6.1 the RBNZ 90-da y bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 100 basis points or more from the figures used to calculate the last rate change; or 6.2 one of these indexes moves by 20 basis points or more and the UOMI rates ha ve n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 1 The other rates are the FBT interest rate on employment-related loans and the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. IR2022/347: Use of money interest rates review Page 1 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 7. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the day after the next standard provisional tax payment date – which is 28 August 2022. However, 28 August falls on a Sunday which makes 29 August 2022 the date that tax payable is due. Therefore, the increased UOMI rates start applying from the next day which is 30 August 2022. 8. The next Executive Council meeting is scheduled on 8 August 2022. To minimise compliance costs the new rates should apply from 30 August 2022. To meet this deadline, a waiver of the 28-day rule is required. This is recommended due to the possibility for the UOMI rates to become seriously misaligned with market interest rates if the change is delayed until the next possible date to update the UOMI rates. 9. The formula for setting the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 as follows: 9.1 Section 2 of the Regulations provides that the taxpayer’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points (or 2.5%); 9.2 Section 3 of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner’s paying rate is set at the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point). However, if this calculation would produce a figure lower than 0%, the rate is instead set at 0%, to ensure overpayments do not accrue negative interest. 10. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue like a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e., the taxpayer’s creditworthiness). 11. The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent a payment of tax to Inland Revenue being used as an investment. Results of latest RBNZ figure review 12. According to RBNZ figures from May 2022, the 90-day bank bill rate has risen more than 100 basis points from its position at December 2021, which triggers the UOMI rates to be reset. 13. The UOMI underpayment rate should be increased to 7.96%, while the UOMI overpayment rate should be increased to 1.22%. 14. The RBNZ floating first mortgage new customer rate has risen by 68 basis points since December 2021 (the last time the UOMI rates were set). Accordingly, the underpayment rate should be increased by 68 basis points, from 7.28% to 7.96%. 15. The overpayment rate should be increased by 122 basis points, from 0% to 1.22%, due to the 90-d ay bank bill rate rising 131 basis points between December 2021 and May 2022. This discrepancy is due to the overpayment rate previously being set at the lower limit of 0%.

This increase will in turn have a very small financial impact on Vote Customs. Customs collected $342,397.82 compensatory interest in the 12 months to 30 June 2022.

The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6 The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points, or, if this would produce a negative figure, at 0%. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7 The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 7.28% and 0% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 10 May 2022 and were based on the interest rates for December 2021. 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 . 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8 The RBNZ interest rates for May 2022 indicate that the 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 131 basis points, to 2.22%, since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long- term misalignment. I therefore recommend the overpayment rate be increased to 1.22%. 9 The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has also changed by 68 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. Therefore, I also recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 7.96%. Timing and 28-day rule 10 I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 8 August 2022. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 30 August 2022, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. 11 To meet this deadline, a waiver of the 28-day rule is required. I recommend that this waiver be granted. The next possible date for updating the use of money interest rates is the day after 15 January 2023, the next available standard provisional tax payment date. As interest rates are climbing rapidly and will likely continue to rise, delaying the update until January is likely to result in serious misalignment of the use of money interest rates and the relevant market interest rates, which poses potential fiscal risks. Compliance 12 The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 12.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 12.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 12.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 12.5 relevant international standards and obligations 12.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee 13 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 15 A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Financial Implications 16 The proposal to increase the UOMI rates, with the effective date of 30 August 2022, is estimated to result in net negative revenue of approximately $119 million over the forecast period. While the change to the underpayment rate will increase revenue over the forecast period, the increased overpayment rate will reduce revenue over the forecast period at a greater rate. This is shown in the table below. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 and outyears Tax Revenue impact of change to Underpayment rate - 17.000 21.000 21.000 21.000 Tax Revenue impact of change to Overpayment rate - (29.000) (35.000) (35.000) (35.000) Net Tax Revenue Impact - (12.000) (14.000) (14.000) (14.000) 17 Additionally, a large part of underpayment debt is typically written off, meaning the cost to revenue is larger than the net revenue impact reported above. To represent this, underpayments are impaired by 78.7% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 18 The total fiscal impact and operating expenditure for the forecast period taking this impairment into account are presented in the table below 2qddsziq5 2022-08-17 11:27:32 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: - (12.000) (14.000) (14.000) (14.000) Tax Revenue Non-Departmental Other Expense: - 14.000 17.000 17.000 17.000 Impairment of debt and debt write-offs Total operating - 26.000 31.000 31.000 31.000 Publicity 19 Inland Revenue will publish an item about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin.

To whom it may concern, I wanted to make a brief submission on your consultation. Because of limited capacity (other work), I will not be able to engage in too much further correspondence. I have carried out work on economic policy as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme between 2014 and 2016, and as a political advisor in the UK Parliament in 2019‐2020. In brief: (1) The relationship between tax and productivity is an important question. (2) I am not persuaded by the briefing that within that line of inquiry, the question of whether company tax rates should be cut is the most pressing tax issue relevant to NZ's productivity problems. (3) I am surprised that the IRD does not seem to be paying more attention to a different question about tax and productivity: namely, whether the under‐taxation of finance and real estate stifles long‐term productive investment by encouraging investment in finance and real estate rather than elsewhere in the economy. (Financial services are exempt from GST, and it is widely acknowledged that property is lightly taxed, for example because of the absence of a capital gains tax.) (4) I would like to see the IRD consider other ways of taxing property, for example the "fair economic return" method proposed by Terry Baucher and Susan St John, as well as whether finance should be taxed more fairly (including through a financial transaction tax, as exists in the UK via stamp duty, or through the removal of the GST exemption for finance). (5) If the IRD does focus on taxing capital or company tax rates, I suggest a much more critical approach needs to be taken to the question of foreign direct investment (FDI). In recent years commentators and economists alike have highlighted that FDI can be associated with tax avoidance, is not necessarily linked to the creation of jobs, and may not support productivity. A far more nuanced, disaggregated approach should be taken to the question of the merits of FDI. (6) I would also like to see the IRD take a more serious look at the question of whether distributions from trusts are fairly taxed at present. This may have links to productivity. (7) I agree with the point in the consultation document that the shifts in company tax rates in the UK and US suggest that NZ would be bucking company tax rate trends in relevant jurisdictions if it were to proceed with cutting its company tax rates. Thank you for your ongoing work. I admire the work you do but I think it is important that the topics for Long‐Term Insights Briefings are carefully selected. I'm not convinced the lowering of company tax rates is the issue of most pressing concern from the perspective of the public or the long‐term interests of the economy. 1 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 001         Ngā mihi, 2 s 9(2)(a)
1 21 February 2022 LTIB topics c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Dear Sir/Madam Re: Tax, investment and productivity: consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing I am writing to you regarding the consultation document entitled ‘Tax, investment and productivity’ (referred to as “the Document”). The Document outlines IRD’s proposal to focus its 2022 Long Term Insights Briefing (LTIB) on tax and its impact on investment and productivity. Overall, BusinessNZ agrees on this focus given investment and productivity are important factors affecting long-term living standards in New Zealand. We also believe it is useful to get a better understanding of how taxes are likely to be affecting costs of capital and the likely implications for inbound investment, productivity, and economic performance. Such assessment will be critical if evidence shows New Zealand may not be maximising its tax policy settings compared with other countries that also seek to improve their economic performance and well- being. 1. Background BusinessNZ believes that following the major reforms of the 1980s, N ew Zealand’s tax system has generally worked well in meeting the overall needs of the economy. In no small part this has been due to ongoing collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors to ensure the system remains internationally competit ive. However, this does not mean improvements cannot be made. Also, future technology changes, offshore developments and the changing face of New Zealand life may dictate the use of different levers to ensure the continuing competence of the New Zealand tax system. JacksonStone House 3-11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz 002 2 The most obvious risk is of a sudden decrease in key tax takings placing pressure on areas of government expenditure. Equally, however, BusinessNZ would be concerned if new taxes, popular with some members of the public, were introduced but were poorly thought through from a public policy perspective. As history shows, it is relatively easy to tax something, but whether it should be taxed in the first place and what unintended consequences will stem from taxing it need to be taken into account. Also, we would not want to see taxes collected for specific purposes, become ‘general taxation,’ morphing into a general slush fund for projects unrelated to what was originally intended. We believe the main challenge for New Zealand will be to ensure that as a small country, it is sufficiently internationally competitive and that the full suite of taxes, on both individuals and business, is not onerous, curtailing growth and/or risk taking. While we obviously have an interest in taxes affecting the business community, we are also very cognisant of New Zealand’s tax system in general, taking into account that taxes fall on both individuals and entities. A tax system that works well as a total system, with minimal distortions, has the best chance of improving economic growth. The main aim is for New Zealand to continue its journey towards achieving a broad- based, low-rate tax system, collecting taxes in the most optimal way possible, and creating minimal disruption for the general population. 2. Trends and scope of the LTIB The Document outlines some sobering statistics in terms of New Zealand’s current investment and economic path. This highlights to us the need for a deeper examination of the country’s investment and productivity challenge. Figure 3 in the Document that shows Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a percentage of GDP underlines the increasing importance New Zealand needs to place on policies that look to increase FDI in this country. At worst, it shows New Zealand’s flat to declining pattern is in stark contrast to other OECD countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom. Figure 4 that outlines Outbound Direct Investment (ODI) is equally damning, with no increase whatsoever going back to 2009. Last, the Document rightly points out that our relative levels of GDP per capita examined in figure 5 look better than they would otherwise look because of hours of work increasing in New Zealand relative to the United States. Considering the relatively poor trends New Zealand is showing with key international metrics, to that end paragraph 33 of the Document states that the aim of the briefing is to open up the question of whether or not New Zealand’s business tax settings have been part of the reason for New Zeala nd’s relatively poor productivity performance . Therefore, in terms of the proposed scope of the LTIB, BusinessNZ 3 wishes to pick up on a few points that we believe are relevant to what the LTIB should examine. The Company Tax Rate Paragraph 36 of the Document points out that the briefing will be seeking feedback on the pros and cons of various approaches which might lower costs of capital and whether these are likely to be improvements on the status quo. Among the seven likely areas outlined, the first seeks to examine lowering of the company tax rate (CTR). Within that context, paragraph 23 of the Document notes that there may be some movement back towards higher CTRs internationally, as countries consider how best to repair their fiscal posit ions after having responded to COVID-19. At the very least, this may reduce the downward pressure on the CTR. There will undoubtedly be pressure in some countries to increase taxes, including their CTR. However, we believe New Zealand needs to be nimble in its tax policy decisions to ensure it covers every competitive position possible. Alignment is an important factor to consider, but this does not automatically mean increases and decreases in the CTR should be viewed equally. Therefore, if some countries that New Zealand typically compares itself with raise their CTR, there is an argument to be had that we could look to lower ours for competitive purposes. Analysis could determine if the loss in revenue from the decrease would be outweighed by the overall increase in new business investment. Paragraph 24 of the Document also points out that the CTR is only one of a much broader set of tax considerations that can influence incentives to invest, with the six other possible measures which might lower costs of capital mentioned in paragraph 36. Overall, BusinessNZ agrees. Other measures such as tax depreciation provisions, other tax incentives such as New Zealand’s R&D Tax Incentive and thin capitalisation rules can all impact on hurdle rates of return and affect investment. However, the only additional point we would make here is that the CTR is still considered a ‘headline’ rate when initial comparisons across countries are made. Obviously, we would expect any company that is looking to run operations in another country to do their due diligence, which would include examining the wider tax system of a country. Nevertheless, the setting of the CTR can often provide the first ‘look in the room’ regarding competition for foreign investment, with a favourable rate warranting further examination by the company. The document also points out that that IRD is also interested in the impacts on other New Zealand firms including companies listed on the NZX and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which may have little or no foreign shareholding . BusinessNZ supports a wider examination of such areas, especially since for many SMEs it is not the CTR, but the top personal tax rate that has the greatest relevance. 4 Connection with Personal Taxes We believe any further examination through the LTIB also requires personal tax rates to be taken into consideration. Until 2000, the CTR was aligned to the top personal tax rate (PTR), but an increase of the top PTR in 2000 to 39% brought a 6- percentage point gap between the two rates. While this gap was closed to 5- percentage points by 2010 with a revised PTR set at 33% and CTR at 28%, the current Government’s decision to again increase the top personal tax rate to 39% now means New Zealand has the largest percentage point differential for some decades. Historically, a gap between the company and the top personal rate can cause distortions and encourage avoidance. The above point is recognised in paragraph 35 of the Document which states there are many ways of lowering costs of capital which can have different distributional effects. For example, lowering the company tax rate by itself could make it harder for the Government to levy as progressive an income tax on individuals (because high income earners may be able to shelter their income in companies and have this taxed at the company rate rather than at higher personal tax rates). With the top personal tax rate at 39%, and the current company tax rate at 28%, we would argue that some of this may already be occurring given the significant differential. Therefore, we believe it is important that the LTIB also considers New Zealand’s recently increased top PTR, especially since New Zealand’s tax policy settings have centred around a broad-based low-rate structure. Overall, we believe that tax and its impact on investment and productivity is a worthwhile subject to investigate further through an LTIB, and we look forward to further developments.

Specifically, it will consider: How taxes are likely to be affecting the cost of capital and the likely implications for inbound investment; Whether New Zealand is out of line with the tax treatments in other countries; and Views on the merits of reducing (tax) costs of capital and making these more uniform as well as the pros and cons of different ways of achieving this. Is this a worthwhile topic? We make some observations before answering this specific question. The universe of possible topics of interest for the tax system is vast. For example, the Treas Long Term Fiscal Position raise two questions: The role of the tax system. Is it to raise revenue commitments, influence behaviour, or some combination thereof? If the former, one approach which the Draft LTFP raises as an alternative is to control (i.e. limit or reduce) the Government spending track. We note that the Tax Working Group considered and ultimately rejected a role for the tax system in influencing behaviour (other than in specific areas relating to environmental outcomes). However, we note that neither of these are an iples for the tax system. The applicable rates of taxation on capital income. The Draft LTFP uses, as a starting point, an average tax rate on capital income of 30%. We assume this is the rate on capital income that is subject to tax. As you will be aware not all capital income is presently taxable. You will also be aware the Tax Working Group lamented the lack of data on tax rates applicable to different types of capital income. Inland Revenue has on its work programme the taxation of high net worth individuals, but this is only one data point. It will not provide a general determination of the average tax rate on capital income. This particular topic has apparently been chosen because investment and productivity are important factors affecting long-term living standards in New Zealand (paragraph 17).

All rights reserved. Document classification: KPMG Confidential 003 Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue Long Term Insights Briefing 6 September 2021 New Zealand, which includes productivity issues. ongoing focus on understand Productivity is a measure of how efficiently to produce output input. At an economy-wide level, however, an increase in national output could also be achieved by: Selling the same product (however efficiently produced) at a higher price; or Reducing the cost of labour or capital (either fixed assets or funding costs) for producing the same product. This does not necessarily require those inputs to be more efficiently used. Of course, a combination of all of the above may be possible, and preferred, for any particular product. Although tax policy settings may influence productivity, of equal, if not greater importance, are likely to be factors such as: What comparative advantage does New Zealand have in terms of its economy? Tourism and primary production are two sectors which are highlighted as areas we excel at. International tourism was a large part of our pre-COVID economy. We have location capacity constraints and also price constraints. In relation to the latter, we are still a price taker in the global market. As a simple example, producing a cup of coffee for tourists has both price and capacity constraints. There is a market price limit and, although we may have not reached the maximum production level, there is a physical limit to how many a barista can make in any given hour. Primary production is similar, in that while a significant export contributor, there are both capacity and price constraints (again, NZ is a price taker). This can be contrasted to economies which have comparative advantages in sectors where, given the size of the global market (demand) and/or limited supply, mean they are price makers . The point here is that New Zealand inability to affect price and/or capacity constraints in the economy (due to our small size) may have as much a bearing on our long run economic performance as productivity gains. Conversely, this suggests that New Zealand cannot be a laggard, from a productivity perspective, lest we fall further behind. Managing the domestic and export economy through non-fiscal policy settings (e.g. monetary policy). If we recall correctly, an analysis we saw a few years ago showed that New Zealand had produced and sold more dairy product in a period but had received less in NZD. Higher interest rates, because of domestic pressures on the housing market and inflation, led to a higher exchange rate and therefore a lower return for exports. Despite productivity increases, more was being physically produced, the sales price in NZD did not hold up. This illustrates to us that productivity gains may be limited by the impact of other policies, which may reduce the overall return to New Zealand. Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of output, which is a financial metric. The Living Standards Framework takes a more holistic view of wellbeing. While greater productivity will boost livings standards, the source of productivity gains needs to be carefully evaluated. For example, to see if it is detrimental to the natural and social capitals that is, is the productivity gain made at the cost of environmental degradation or mass unemployment? Although the topic is a worthwhile one, given other topics are available and other agencies are also considering productivity, it is not clear that it is a topic which should take priority. To us, it to these other studies. LTIB September 2021 Document classification: KPMG Confidential 2 Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue Long Term Insights Briefing 6 September 2021 However, we assume that Inland Revenue will proceed with its chosen topic and therefore provide further comments. Comments on the key trends and issues section - the 2016 draft New investment (https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound-investment and which does not appear to have been finalised.). In brief, we describe this framework as New Zealand, you are The LTIB needs to describe the policy and its implications for New Zealand tax policy. We agree that the headline rate is important for New Zealand. In our experience, if there is a choice of location, the headline rate can act as a gateway, or barrier, for further analysis. Generally However, the effective marginal tax rate is what actually applies. The overseas company rate reductions have generally been accompanied by tax base changes (for example, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting changes). The overall result may not be an actual tax reduction. This widened the base while retaining the rate. We note the OECD calculations of effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) are limited. This is surprising. The OECD has access to member states revenue authorities (and with the Inclusive Framework, many more countries). It could, for example, have each country determine the EMTRs for a number of standardised company examples. (We are mindful that the BEPS project may make this type of analysis sensitive however.) The risk for New Zealand is that it does this work in isolation. If this produces a high EMTR, along with a high headline rate, this may make New Zealand less attractive. Any EMTR work should be done with an encouragement to the OECD to do this work more broadly. Specific items We note there are stated to be high EMTRs for non-residential buildings and inventory. We have not reviewed the OECD work but note, for buildings, the high EMTR may not take into account the likely nil EMTR on sale. For FDI, we note that disinvestment, as a result of the global financial crisis (as multi-nationals , and potentially tighter overseas investment rules, particularly with relation to land, may have had an in impact. Controlling for these factors, so the effect of tax can be isolated, may be difficult. effectively a final tax for non-residents. In contrast, cost of capital arguments have typically justified lower rates on debt (e.g. the Approved Issuer Levy).

An equivalent analysis for New Zealand is likely to suggest that taxation is less instructive as an With some hesitation, we also suggest that the performance of the housing market may have an impact. It has an effect on interest rates and therefore on the exchange rate. However, tax settings for residential housing are part of another stream of work and so, we assume, can be excluded from the LTIB. We suggest that global trends, per se, are likely to have more impact than global tax trends. However, we consider an important determinant that should be taken into account is the prevalence of classical corporate tax systems globally. In New Zealand, we tend to think of company taxation as a withholding tax for shareholders because of the imputation system. This is true for domestic investors. It is also true for non-resident investors from a New Zealand tax perspective. However, it is not true from New Zealand tax is an expense for them (assuming the shareholders receive no underlying foreign tax credit). If the home country provides no foreign tax credit for New Zealand company tax paid, there is a potential for at least double taxation of New Zealand profits for non-residents. In a New Zealand context, we see imputation as producing a home country investment bias (which may be of interest for the analysis of outbound investment). In a classical tax system, the bias is to have tax apply at the shareholder level as that is a single tax. (Even better if the Accordingly, the global tax trend that we consider is important is the general absence of imputation systems. Suggested outline and possible response The outline seems reasonable. We consider that it is best for comments on the work to be done, apart from comments already made above, to wait for the draft briefing. We would of course be happy to discuss. We consider the possible responses identified appear appropriate issues. This does not mean we support any particular response at this point. In our view, it is important to know why a particular path has not been chosen as well as why another has been. Considering the available options will help with this. We make two specific comments: The present value of capital write offs has another aspect. If it encourages greater capital investment this will generally be at the cost of labour. That obviously has revenue and societal impacts that need to be considered. LTIB September 2021 Document classification: KPMG Confidential 4 Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue Long Term Insights Briefing 6 September 2021 A present value approach would also consider the tax effects of termination values of FDI for a New Zealand business. Generally, tax on the sale of capital equipment is limited to taxing depreciation recovered. A wider focus would also consider the tax effect of goodwill and other capital assets sold. It may also include consideration of exit taxes. The lack of such taxes may explain reductions in FDI (as there is limited tax penalty for extracting assets from New Zealand). As with some of our other comments, this is not support of such taxes but consideration of them may: Confirm why they should not apply; and/or Provide information to investors when they compare EMTRs for New Zealand with other countries.

We are available to discuss our comments below if that is helpful. Key question to consider: Is tax and its impact on investment and productivity a worthwhile subject to investigate further through an LTIB? We believe that tax and the impact on investment and productivity is a worthwhile subject to investigate further through an LTIB. Key question to consider: Are there other global tax trends that are critical to this study which should be considered? We believe that there are other global tax trends that are critical to this study that should be considered. One global trend is the increasing role that environmental taxes play in other OECD nations. A long-term study of the impact of taxation on investment and productivity should consider the increasing use in the OECD of environmental taxes to change behaviour, raise targeted revenues to offset environmental harm and to raise general revenues to fund Government. New Zealand makes limited use of environmental taxes compared to most of the OECD, officially around 6% of total tax revenue could be considered environmental taxes. 1 However, these taxes are mainly transport charges and fuel taxes, and they are raised not for environmental purposes but as a revenue source to fund transport and the operation of Government. The use, design and introduction of environmental taxes is particularly important in terms of the impact of taxation on investment and productivity. It is no longer sufficient to examine investment and productivity solely from a cost of capital perspective. Key questions to consider: Are these sensible policy options to consider? We agree that the topics set out in the paragraph 36 of the LTIP scoping document are sensible policy options to consider, being: reductions in the company tax rate measures which increase the present value of capital write offs for capital expenditure measures to take account of inflation to reduce overstatements or understatements of capital income 1 Interim Report of the Tax Working Group, 2018, Chp 9, para 18. PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC Tower, 15 Customs Street West, Private Bag 92162, Auckland 1142 New Zealand T: +64 9 355 8000, www.pwc.co.nz 7787181\_1 004 changes to thin-capitalisation rules which might allow multinational firms to claim greater deductions for interest expense changes to allow multinational firms or other firms with foreign shareholders a notional interest deduction on their equity specific incentives for particular types of investment or specific types of business, and more fundamental changes in the tax base such as the dual income tax structure adopted in Nordic countries with a relatively low flat marginal tax rate on capital income with higher progressive tax rates on labour income. However, in evaluating the measures above, in addition to other analytical frameworks, we submit that you should consider the following factors: 1. In general, New Zealand's broad base low rate (BBLR) philosophy has served us well in the design and maintenance of our tax system and has a broad consensus of support across stakeholders in our tax system. The BBLR philosophy was developed in response to an (e.g. 66% top marginal personal rate and 48% company tax rate) were mitigated with dozens of ad hoc incentives and exemptions. This resulted in a narrowly based, high-rate tax system that struggled to deliver efficiency, equity, and adequate revenue. Based on this historical experience, there remains a strong consensus in New Zealand that the BBLR approach is, in practice, more successful than a tax system that has large numbers of incentives or exemptions. 2. On that basis of that history and the BBLR consensus, we propose that the future consideration of tax incentives must be evaluated against a clear framework where there is specific market failure identified (e.g. under investment), the market failure is not driven by other regulatory settings, and a well-designed and administered tax incentive is considered the best policy tool to address the issue when compared to other possible policy interventions. 3. We do not see strong anecdotal evidence that New Zealand tax rates are reducing the interest of foreign direct investors (FDI) in New Zealand (although see our later point on coherence of the tax system). In our experience it is other regulatory settings such as Overseas Investment Office criteria that can have a more significant impact on FDI. 4. the company tax rate for domestic investors is largely a withholding tax while it acts as a final tax on non-resident investors, and therefore the case for a significant reduction in support of additional investment has a relatively high bar to cross. Notwithstanding that, our company tax rate needs to remain competitive with Australia. 5. The key tax distortion in New Zealand that remains is that certain types of economic income that arise in the form of capital gains are, in certain circumstances, not taxed leading to the loss of economic efficiency and a lack of horizontal and vertical equity that puts pressure on the social capital that underpins our successful tax system. 6. Looking further forward into the future it is valuable to test more fundamental tax base changes and evaluate their suitability for New Zealand. But in doing so, the risks and costs of transition from the current system need to be carefully evaluated against the potential benefits of a new system. Key questions to consider: Are there other reforms which should also be considered? A key principle in a balanced and effective tax system that does not discourage investment and supports productivity growth is coherence. In our view, the relative coherence of the current New Zealand tax system risks being undermined by recent tax policy developments in two key areas as set out below. A key reform to consider is to focus on keeping the tax system coherent. This is not easy work and the threats to coherence are often not obvious and compound over time. But in our view, it is vital for a tax system that does not wish to discourage investment and productivity. PwC 2 i) Turning policy into law. x reform such as the Base Erosion & Profit Shifting project (BEPS) led by the OECD and the current OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework two pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy is positive, highly regarded, and valuable for New Zealand. However, in supporting those global initiatives and operationalising the policy into our own domestic legislation, we believe that we over complicate the policy design and resulting legislation which, from a New Zealand perspective, applies to a relatively small number of taxpayers. If this trend continues, we will see more and more highly prescriptive and detailed legislation that is drafted in a style that makes it very difficult to discern the policy intent, hard to follow, and increases the risk of drafting errors, is very difficult for all but small number of deeply experienced officials to administer and therefore risks undermining the coherence of the tax system. ii) Compounding impacts of different policy choices political consensus to support a comprehensive capital gains tax. As a result, this drives second or third best policy solutions such as the extended Brightline test and the removal of interest deductibility for residential rentals. These policy tools are deployed to address specific and worthwhile objectives in terms of moderating housing cost growth and encouraging new supply. But because they are not well founded in tax policy design, they interact with other existing settings in unexpected ways and damage coherence, leading to a lowering of investment and productivity. \[Commercially sensitive: to be withheld under section 9(2) of the Official Information Act 1982\] While there are several pre-existing boundary issues between commercial and residential raised by this example, further issues were introduced by the extension and amendment of the Brightline test and the denial of interest deductibility. PwC 3 s 9(2)(b)(ii) The upshot of this lack of coherence is that the foreign capital and expertise that could have been deployed to expand our dwelling stock has been diverted to other jurisdictions.

Hmvever, many have been considered already as part of the Tax 'vVorki ng Groups in 2009 and 20 I 7. Again, it is likely that something bolder is needed. Foreign Direct Investment A key question is whether an increase in FDI would increase New Zealand's productivity. According to the scope document, New Zealand's FDI is low compared to other countries. Ultimately a non-resident investor will vie,v the New 7:ealand tax cost as another cost that will impa(t return on investment or increase the cost of goods and services it d1arges to New Zealand customers. The lo-wer the taxes the lower the charges to Ne\\v Zealand customers and the increased likelihood the investment ,.viii occur. The key issues will be the level of tax, the certainty that these taxes will remain constant and a hove all the predictability of the direction of tax changes. Recent peiiods have suggested that non-residents have faced increased NZ tax obligations.

Ne,v Zealand is going to need an enormous amount of capital to: address the infrastructure deficit; invest in Ne,v Zealand businesses to grow and/or become "frontier firms"; and encourage frontier firms to locate themselves here. It is unlikely that all infrastruci:urc needed can be funded exclusively from the Government balance sheet. The LITB should be considering where the additional capital ,viii come from; and how the tax system should be designed to allow the desired capital flows. If the work concludes that the capital ,viii come from overseas, we recommend the !Tm consider how best to attraLi:. investment into Nevv Zealand. This will include broader considerations such as: cost of capital; cost of engagement; ease of engagement; and ability to link up with the rest of the world; and the tax system has a role in them all. The LTIB work should look at what more can be done in the tax system to ad1ievc each of these, including any changes to tax administration through further leveraging the START system. At the time of introduction, the START system was seen as "billion dollar investment" and should be an asset to be leveraged for medium and long term benefit. The return on investment should not be limited to additional tax collected and reducing head count at Inland Revenue. The I.Tm shou Id consider how the START system can contribute to case of doing business in New Zealand.

At that point, it would be appropriate to consider measures such as thin capitalisation or notional interest deduc"tions, but we recommend that a broader enquiry is undertaken first. i\\ foreign investor will have a choice of entities and structures to use as it looks to put capital into Ne\\v Zealand. The tax system includes specific regimes for many different tax entities and it is often difficult to see the reasons for the differences. It would be easier for a foreign investor to invest into New Zealand if the structures could be chosen for commercial reasons, with tax being neutral across all equivalent structures. A key part of the work should be to articulate the reasons for the differences or establish tax neutrality across all structures. New Zealand infrastructure Concerns have been raised regarding New Zealand's infr<lstructure and the difficulty faced by Government in delivering large scale infrastmcture projec"ts; for example, Transmission Gully and Kiwi build. There is a growing need for additional infrastmcture in Nevv Zealand including: housing; roading (including bridges and tunnels); public transport; \\Yater infrastructure (the Three vVaters project).

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable f or the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. The work should also consider whether an increase in FDI or a change in tax settings could assist to address Ne,v Zealand's infrastructure deficit. }>age 7 Many foreign investors and investment consortiums incur large up-front costs, including due diligence, scoping and tendering for significant infrastructure projects. These costs arc not recovera blc nor arc they tax deductible in the event that the bid is unsuccessful. It is important that foreign investors have certainty of tax outcome from investigation of viability, financing and constrnction if successful and potentially operation. Costs can be reduced if tax outcomes are neutral asbet,veen similar investment stru(tures. At present there is a heavy reliance on private rulings to provide tax certainty. Changes in factual position or key assumptions add to these costs as often a new ruling is required. The future of work As you arc av,-arc, the nature of ,vork is changing. Covid-19 has demonstrated that business can be conducted from home and individual employees can work from home. Many now have more than one income source. Technology continues to improve. This has implications for where people are likely to locate in future and therefore our infrastmcturc need. This should be considered in prioritising infrastmcture projects and developing the tax settings needed to ad1ieve them. The changing nature of work also has implications h)f the way people stmci:ure their business affairs. It would be useful to look at the way businesses are taxed and whether the settings are approp1iate. A person in New Zealand may choose to go into business as a sole trader, or through a partnership, a company or an LTC. Should tax settings be neutral across all structures? If not, why should the treatments be different? Articulating the reasons for the differences ,vill be key in deciding which polky settings to retain or change going forward.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable f or the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. The study should also consider pen;onal tax rates. Businesses operating as a sole trader or through a partnership or LTC ,-vill equally be affected by personal tax rates. This includes those in the "gig economy". For SME companies that arc predominantly New· Zealand owned, the personal tax rate may influence investment decisions. The interaction bet,veen the tax and social policy systems is important. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group (vVFAG) made a range of recommendations in 2019, many of which have not been adopted. vVork undertaken on how to increase New Zealand's prodm.tivity should additionally take into account care required for the most vulnerable member:; of society and how they can transition to generating income/further income if and when appropriate. The WEJ\\G's report highlighted that the rules for benefit abatement could lead to extremely high effective marginal tax rates for people moving into work. It recommended increases to the level at which vVorking for Families credits were abated, and a reduction in the rate at ,vhich they were removed. There arc currently well-publicised labour shortages, which is having a signiflcant effect on New Zealand's productivity. The LTIB should consider ,vhether the interaction between tax and social policy systems has a role to play.

We make this submission on behalf of our members and in the broader public interest. We support the Inland Revenue’s (IRD) proposed focus on tax, investment and productivity in its Long-term insights briefing (LTIB) Consultation Paper (the Consultation Paper). As acknowledged in the consultation paper, the causes of lower productivity and poor economic performance are complex, and the IRD’s focus on the cost of capital and effective marginal tax rates is a practical approach to an issue that goes far beyond the tax system. Consideration could also be given to the composition of the overall tax base with New Zealand being more reliant on income and profit taxes rather than more efficient consumption-based taxes, and the question of whether the imputation system remains appropriate. We also note that, in addition to the tax system settings (i.e., tax base and rate), the cost of complying with, and the administrative burden imposed by, the tax system can also give rise to reduced productivity. The overall regulatory burden on businesses is high and diverts resources away from high value-add activities. Potential opportunities exist in relation to designing tax laws to align with accounting systems and to reducing the cost of complying with tax obligations through business digitalisation. Our responses to the key questions in the Consultation Paper are contained in the Attachment. If you have any queries about this submission, contact Rick Jones, Country Head, New Zealand on +64 21 190 1039 or rick.jones@cpaaustralia.com.au or Elinor Kasapidis, Senior Manager Tax Policy on +61 3 9606 9666 or elinor.kasapidis@cpaaustralia.com.au. Yours sincerely, Dr Gary Pflugrath Mr Rick Jones Executive General Manager, Country Head, Policy and Advocacy New Zealand 006 Attachment Proposed scope of the LTIB Is tax and its impact on investment and productivity a worthwhile subject to investigate further through an LTIB? Yes. Tax settings should be reviewed regularly to evaluate whether they are achieving the desired outcomes and to identify unintended consequences. The impact of taxes on investment and productivity is a worthwhile topic because settings need to support the Government's broader policy goals with sufficient revenue to fund public goods and services, while maintaining a competitive and efficient economy. Earlier OECD research 1 identified a number of areas for productivity improvement in New Zealand, including: • Lowering the corporate income tax rate • Reducing the reliance on income and profit-based taxes • Better aligning tax rates between entity types to reduce arbitrage and tax planning. We expect the findings of the LTIB will help inform the public debate on such potential reforms and identify areas for further policy discussions. Key trends and issues Are there other global tax trends that are critical to this study which should be considered? The OECD’s work on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), including the progression of Pillars One and Two, should have an impact on reducing the effect of tax differences between jurisdictions on investment decisions. This could result in a level of tax rate harmonisation across jurisdictions and a shift away from the use of tax policies to gain a competitive advantage. The increasingly global nature of business and employment also brings international tax issues to the fore, such as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), tax agreements and tax residency. For example, inbound investors see the corporate tax payable in New Zealand as an expense. Only if the double-tax agreement (DTA) imposes an NRWT obligation will the investor benefit via the foreign investor tax credit (FITIC) regime. Overall, this might reduce the tax cost to 15 per cent as the remaining tax is allowable as a tax credit for the New Zealand company. If there is no tax imposed on dividends paid offshore under the DTA, then the cost of capital will increase, as the non-resident investor will lose all imputation credits. The LTIB could also consider the impact of tax on labour productivity in a global market for labour. As technology enables businesses to easily employ people across the globe, higher personal income tax rates can reduce the price competitiveness of New Zealand labour. Insights into the extent to which personal income tax rates may influence the price of labour and domestic employment would assist in determining whether there is a likely impact on tax revenues, thus enabling potential responses to be considered. Suggested outline Are these sensible policy options to consider? We support the exploration of the policy options proposed for the LITB, noting that changes to the rate and structure of income taxes are far more significant than policies such as inflation adjustments or targeted tax incentives. Our preliminary observations, informed by feedback from our members, are: • Company tax should align with other countries, particularly Australia, which is New Zealand’s nearest trading partner and largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI). The analysis could explore the productivity and investment benefits across a range of reduced tax rate settings down to 15 per cent • Depreciation rates need to be revised and simplified as the time over which laws require an asset to be depreciated in New Zealand is too long • Consideration should be given to raising the GST, as necessary, to reduce the reliance on personal income tax and marginal income tax rates. GST is by far the most efficient tax and with its minimal carve outs is contributing over 30% of all tax revenue in New Zealand 1 OECD, 2009. Guillemette, Y., 2009. Structural policies to overcome geographic barries and create prosperity in New Zealand, PECD Economics Department Working Papers No. 696 ECO/WKP(2009)37, OECD https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/224223031816 • Potential changes to thin-capitalisation rules should be evaluated to lower the cost of capital. This could include allowing interest deductions in New Zealand, a reduction in the complexity of the rules and permitting a deemed interest deduction for equity as a mechanism to attract inbound investments. • The adoption of a dual income tax structure for capital income and labour income may not necessarily impact the cost of capital for New Zealand resident shareholders. Countries that have adopted this dual income structure abolished their imputation credit systems, tax domestic dividends and capital gains under the dual system. The introduction of a dual tax system would likely require additional reforms such as the adoption of a capital gains tax for onshore equity investments and the removal of the imputation credit system • Tax incentives may assist in supporting innovation and start-ups and may be more efficient than transfer payments. For example, in Australia, the proposed introduction of a targeted patent box regime and digital games tax offset complements the existing research and development tax incentive (RDTI). Consideration should be given to the design and effectiveness of such programs in other jurisdictions and their suitability for New Zealand • Remaining internationally competitive is important for New Zealand, both in its tax settings as well as ease of administration and alignment with other jurisdictions’ rules. Are there other reforms which should also be considered? The Consultation Paper acknowledges potentially different distributional effects and the need to consider tax neutrality. It is likely that potential reforms identified in the LTIB may lead to the need or opportunity to consider other changes in order to compensate for distributional impacts, or to raise tax revenue from alternative sources. These should also be identified in the LTIB to reflect the trade-offs that may be required.

The Corporate Taxpayers Group (“the Group”) supports Inland Revenue scoping its current Long Term Insights Briefing (“LTIB”) on how tax policy settings could best support raising of productivity in New Zealand, as raised in the Tax, investment and productivity: Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights consultative paper (“the Consultative Paper”). A focus on tax and its impact on investment and productivity does seem a subject worthwhile investigating. The question being posed is whether or not New Zealand’s business tax settings have been part of the reason for New Zealand’s relatively poor productivity performance. 2. The Consultative Paper suggests scoping the paper based on OECD international comparative data on effective tax rates. The Group agrees that there is value in such comparative studies. However, the Consultative Paper seems (at page 13) to accept any study needs also to have a broader perspective. The Group supports a broader view, as there are a number of different tax implications depending on the different situations, which cannot all be assessed the same. For example there is a difference between inbound versus outbound investment, direct investment versus portfolio and domestic investment, and their corresponding tax implications. 3. Effective tax rate analysis in essence tries to measure the tax wedge a country’s policy settings imposes between post-tax and pre-tax returns by measuring the tax levied on a hypothetical standardised investment. This determines how easily an investment can meet an investor’s pre-New Zealand tax hurdle rate of return. However, tax policy settings can also increase an investor’s hurdle rate of return. This is by increasing costs and risks involved with an investment, noting that recent complexity in tax changes appears to have increased such costs and risks. 4. Costs are increased by complexity of rules and associated compliance costs. For New Zealand such costs can be significant. Our size means any investment is likely to be small by international standards but the compliance costs for an investor (including costs of gaining internal investment approvals) have a high fixed cost element. We have, in other words, diseconomies of scale. 5. Perceptions of tax risk increases an investor’s hurdle rate of return. For a long term investment (the type most likely to lead to increased productivity) uncertainty as to the long term tax rules increases investment risk. Both expected and unexpected tax risks increase the hurdle rates of return. An expected adverse tax change 007 CTG – Submission on Tax, investment and productivity: Consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights 6 September 2021 Page 2 of 4 C T G C T G should be factored into an investor’s calculations with the hurdle rate of return increasing to offset it. A history of unexpected adverse tax policy changes will be viewed as an increased risk of further such measures. Neither will be reflected in New Zealand’s effective tax rate data. A stable, low surprises tax environment for investors seems important to New Zealand given the nature of our economy. Our view is that in recent years the perception has been that New Zealand has moved from being a stable, low surprises tax environment; instead the risk of potential adverse tax policy is now a significant factor in the eyes of potential investors. 6. For the proposed study to add real value therefore the Group considers that there is a need to take a broad picture and try to understand fully how tax policy settings are likely to impact on international investment flows for New Zealand. As a related matter, the LTIB should research what tax settings have resulted in positive increases in productivity in other countries, particularly Australia. Members of the Group have had extensive experience with international investment and their experience and perspectives should be drawn upon to give depth and a reality check to the proposed comparative data analysis. This broad view should also take into account other developing issues, such as the Tax Principles Act (and perhaps a tax principle about tax laws not negatively impacting productivity). 7. Consideration should also be given to tax measures that have occurred overseas that appear to have had success. Examples of these are included in appendix 1 to this letter. 8. In addition, when considering the successful tax measures introduced by other countries an additional lens should be applied to that process which allows for the perspective that New Zealand is already considered ‘tricky’ or marginal for foreign investment due to: a) Border restrictions due to COVID-19, and uncertain immigration settings and other flow-on consequences for businesses needing to get people into New Zealand (which could remain an issue for some time) b) Overseas Investment Office requirements and settings and c) Perceived risk of unexpected policy changes (for example the ban on new oil and gas exploration permits, which has made the environment less predictable for that sector) d) investment opportunities are limited given geographic isolation and our relatively small economy. If you have any questions in relation to the above, or would like to meet with the Group again to discuss these matter please do not hesitate to let us know.

In addition, Australia has recently released its consultation materials (including exposure draft legislation for both the tax and corporate law amendments) on its corporate collective investment vehicle regime. This is another example of a close trading partner to New Zealand (and competitor to foreign investment) making it less complex for foreign investment into their country. India Tax initiatives for capital investment through accelerated depreciation, weighted deduction for inhouse R&D and weighted deductions for employing additional workers. It was noted that while the above can be implicitly linked to productivity, as productivity is not a stated goal of the Indian government, there has not been any specific initiatives. Singapore Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme – Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore 2010 - 2017 Activities included: R&D, additional tax deductions for registration of intellectual property, acquisition of intellectual property, design activities, automation through technology or software; and Training of employees. Other incentives include deductions for industrial building acquisition or construction (now phased out) and various tax exemptions which can be applied for.

2\. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12 April 2022 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Executive summary Purpose 1. This report seeks your decision on how GST should apply to services that fund managers and investment managers provide to KiwiSaver and other managed funds. Context and background 2. The current GST treatment of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and inconsistent. It can differ depending on the type of manager which is supplying the service (a manager or an investment manager) or the type of fund (a retirement scheme, or other type of fund) which is receiving the service. 3. There are three different industry practices ranging from: • A full GST exemption (no GST charged) when the relevant services qualify for the GST exemption for management of a retirement scheme; • Treating 90% of their services as exempt, and effectively charging 1.5% GST on their fees (15% GST on 10% of their fees); and • Charging 15% GST on all their services. 4. The inconsistent GST practices mean there is an uneven playing field for pricing these services which may distort competition. It also leads to higher compliance costs, and less revenue. 5. Many of the current practices are not consistent with current GST laws, so a law change is necessary to either allow the current inconsistent practices to continue, or to set a certain and consistent GST treatment. Legislative change is required but the affected parties disagree on the preferred policy option 6. The managed funds industry agrees that a legislative change should be introduced to provide certainty and reduce compliance costs. 7. However, there are two different stakeholder views as to what the GST treatment should be: • Option 1. Retain status quo. This would legislate to allow current practices to continue. The Financial Services Council (who represent large, mature funds) prefers this option. • Option 2. Making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST. This would legislate to require GST to be charged IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 1 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] on all services supplied to managed funds. This option is preferred by a group of boutique fund managers and is consistent with their current practice. 8. The main trade-off between the two options is that applying more GST to managed funds will ensure consistency across the industry, will raise revenue, and is less likely to create pressure for further exemptions. However, this will increase costs for managed funds, which is likely to increase fees and reduce returns from savings, and consequently reduce future balances in KiwiSaver and other managed funds. Recommended policy option 9. Inland Revenue and Treasury recommend Option 2: Making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST. We consider that this will lead to a more consistent treatment and therefore an even playing field across the industry. It will also reduce compliance costs, improve integrity and be more sustainable. This option would raise revenue in a manner consistent with our GST frameworks. 10. We acknowledge that this would lead to higher fees for savers and transitional costs for the industry. However, we consider these costs can be mitigated by options considered further below and that the benefits of this option will outweigh these costs. Additional GST revenue 11. In land Revenue estimates that applying GST to the manager and investment manager fees would raise approximately $250 million to $300 million per annum of additional GST revenue. Impact on fees charged to retail investors 12. We expect that applying more GST to managed funds would increase the fees charged to retail investors (such as KiwiSaver members). To the extent that fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and, ultimately, future retirement balances. 13. If Ministers are concerned about the managed funds fees increasing because of applying GST, then we recommend considering non-GST options for supporting savers. This could include, for example, options such as an explicit fee subsidy or increasing the Government contribution. Such options could also be better targeted to benefit savers with smaller balances (as opposed to GST concessions, which would produce the most benefit for savers with large balances). 14. We consider that these non-GST options are preferable and are likely to be more direct and effective options than a GST concession. New Zealand’s GST system has not been previously used to reduce the price of specific goods or services (unlike other countries, which have concessions, fo r example, on food and education), so it would be an adverse precedent to provide GST concessions to reduce the price of managed fund fees. 15. The Treasury recommends that you consider these options alongside your wider fiscal and other objectives. The revenue from our preferred policy option (to mak e services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST) could, for instance, be used to increase spending or reduce taxes in other areas and this should be compared alongside options to support savers. Application date 16. To mitigate the transitional costs, we recommend providing an adequate transitional period between enactment and when the new rules would apply. For example, 24- 36 months could provide time for the hundreds of affected taxpayers to amend their IT systems, adjust their business practices and replace or renegotiate commercial IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 2 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] contracts, to align with the new rules. A shorter transitional period, such as 12 months, would have a fiscal benefit of collecting GST revenue sooner, but we would recommend against this as it could impose much more disruption to the managed funds industry and associated implementation challenges and transitional costs. 17. We will provide updated advice on the application date and estimated fiscal implications when we report back in May 2022 with a draft Cabinet paper. We are currently seeking further information on transitional costs and more recent managed funds data is expected to be published soon. Next steps 18. Officials are available to meet you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss this report. 19. Following your decision, officials will report back with a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement seeking Cabinet approval of your decision. An indicative timeframe for this Cabinet paper would be: 9 May Report back to the Minister of Revenue with a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement 16 June Lodgement of Cabinet paper for DEV (10am 16 June) 22 June DEV consideration of Cabinet paper 27 June Cabinet approval 20. This timeframe would allow the proposed legislative change to be included in the omnibus Taxation Bill which is scheduled for introduction in August 2022 and enactment in late March 2023. s 9(2)(f)(iv) Recommended action 21. We recommend that you: 22. agree to one of these two options: 22.1 Option 1 –Legislating to allow the current inconsistent GST practices to continue); OR Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 22.2 Option 2 – Making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST (Inland Revenue and the Treasury’s preferred option); Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed 23. note we expect that option 2 would increase fees for retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members. To the extent that fees increase, this would reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and, ultimately, future retirement balances ; Noted Noted IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 3 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 28. The current GST treatment of different types of management services supplied to managed funds is complex and inconsistent. 29. KiwiSaver funds and other types of managed funds purchase three main types of services from third parties: • Manager services. A fund manager has overall responsibility for managing the fund. This includes offering and issuing units in the fund to investors, managing the fund’s investments, reporting to investors, and procuring services from an investment manager and various administration service providers. • Investment manager services. These involve an investment manager managing which assets (shares, bonds, cash) or other funds the fund invests into. When reporting to investors, manager services and investment manager services are both reported as “management fees” which are set as a very small percentage (typically between 0.2% and 2%) of the funds under management. • Various administrative services such as legal, accounting, ICT (information and communications technology) or reporting services. 30. The providers of these services apply GST inconsistently and this results in an uneven playing field across the industry. 1 1 Unlike many other industries, any GST applied to these services represent a real cost for managed funds. This is because under New Zealand’s GST rules managed funds are ‘exempt’ from GST. This means they cannot claim back GST charged to them, but at the same time do not need to apply GST to the fees they apply to consumers. IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 5 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The distinction between retirement schemes and other funds does not reflect the fact that most retirement schemes invest into wholesale funds. B oth types of funds can be used for long-term savings and apply the same income tax rules. Compliance costs 36. The current GST rules also impose compliance costs of correctly identifying and applying different GST treatments depending on the type of service being provided. The compliance costs may include seeking specialist tax advice and the risks of errors or disputes. In-source bias 37. The current GST rules may create a bias for performing certain services in-house where possible rather than outsourcing. This is because if a manager or investment manager’s service is regarded to be GST exempt, they will be unable to recover GST on any inputs they purchase from outside their organisation (such as commercial rent, accounting, and ICT services) to deliver their own service. These GST costs would not arise if they provided the services within their own organisation (in -house). Differing stakeholder views 38. Inland Revenue has been consulting with managed funds about the GST treatment of manager and investment manager fees. The issue and a range of policy options were publicly consulted on in a GST policy issues paper in 2020. 39. Inland Revenue had a further round of targeted consultation meetings with the Financial Services Council (which represents most of the large managed funds) and a group of boutique managed fund providers in November and December 2021. 40. There are two different stakeholder views on how the law should be changed: • Option 1: Retain status quo. The Financial Services Council has expressed a preference on behalf of the large, mature funds it represents for legislating to allow the current, inconsistent GST practices to be able to continue. • Option 2: Making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST. In contrast, the boutique fund managers consider that GST should apply to all manager fees. This would be consistent with these boutique fund managers applying GST to their fees currently. This allows these fund managers to claim GST refunds for GST charged on inputs, such as rent or administrative services, that they buy from external providers. 41. The advantages, disadvantages, and impacts of these two policy options are discussed below. 42. Some additional policy reform options and their impacts are also analysed in the attached draft Regulatory Impact Statement. IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 7 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Options analysis Option 1: Legislating to allow the current inconsistent GST practices to continue 43. Under this option, managed funds will be able to choose between one of three GST treatments. These three treatments are the range of current practices undertaken by the industry: • Fully exempt. This option includes retaining a GST exemption for when management services are directly provided to a retirement scheme (such as a manager providing services directly to a KiwiSaver scheme). • 90% exempt. Treating 90% of their services as exempt and effectively charging 1.5% GST on their fees (15% GST on 10% of their fees). This practice is applied by most retail managed funds and by wholesale funds that other funds, such as retirement schemes, invest into. • Full GST. Charging 15% GST on all their services. This practice is applied by a small number of boutique funds. 44. One of the main stakeholders, the Financial Services Council, which represents large and mature managed funds, has expressed a preference for legislating that the current GST practices be able to continue. 45. Legislation is required if you prefer this option. This is because many of the current industry practices, such as the 90% exempt treatment, are not consistent with existing GST laws. Advantages of option 1 No impact on savers 46. This option does not increase costs for managed funds. As a result, it will not lead to increased fees for savers and will avoid reductions in future balances (including retirement balances) that an increase in GST costs would cause. No change costs 47. Another advantage of this option is that unlike the other policy options, it does not impose change costs on the managed funds industry. These change costs would include scheduling, building, and testing IT systems changes, updating reporting, communications and training staff for customer contacts relating to fee increases. MBIE and the Financial Markets Authority have noted that any GST change costs would occur at a time when the industry is implementing a lot of other regulatory changes, such as climate reporting disclosures and proposed changes to anti-money laundering rules. 48. This option is also likely to be supported by most of the affected funds and service providers as it does not require them to change their longstanding practices and allows each of them to continue with their preferred GST treatment. Disadvantages Complexity and inconsistency 49. The main disadvantage of this option is that it entrenches the complexity and inconsistency of the current practices and the associated impacts on competition, compliance costs and risks of errors (these impacts were further explained in paragraphs 33-37 above). 50. This option would also involve two different exemption rules – a full exemption for management of retirement schemes (such as KiwiSaver) and an optional 90% IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 8 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption for managers and investment managers which provide services to other types of funds (including the wholesale funds that most retirement schemes invest into). These differing exemptions could be complex to apply which increases the risks of inconsistency, errors, and disputes. Integrity 51. This option would introduce new integrity risks. This includes the risk of managers “cherry picking”, which is where they may choose a taxable GST treatment to maximise GST deductions when they are starting up and later switch to an exempt treatment to minimise the GST they charge once they have a large amount of fee revenue. 2 Precedent effects and boundary issues 52. More generally, tax exemptions tend to widen over time and become more complex and costly (both fiscally and for taxpayer compliance costs). This makes them difficult to maintain and administer. 53. An exemption creates boundary issues in determining whether a service is a management service or another type of service. For example, there could be incentives to bundle or reclassify some other types of services as being management services to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. This has been the experience in European Union countries where case law has found that the “management” of an investment fund has a broad meaning for European Union VAT/GST purposes and can include administrative services and advice. In contrast, administrative services and advice are subject to GST in New Zealand. 3 Revenue impact 54. Because option 1 aligns with the current GST positions in the revenue baselines, it would be fiscally neutral. Option 2: Making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST 55. Under option 2, all manager and investment fees will be subject to GST. 56. The other main stakeholder, the boutique funds, prefer this option. This is because it provides a level playing field with other funds and reduces some compliance costs (as all fees have the same GST treatment and it allows them to claim GST refunds for all their purchases). Advantages of option 2 Competitive neutrality 57. This option would mean all providers of these services compete on a level playing field. All their relevant fees would become subject to 15% GST rather than some being treated as exempt or 90% exempt (effectively 1.5% GST). General managed funds and retirement schemes that invest into underlying wholesale funds would no longer be disadvantaged when compared to retirement schemes that procure management services directly. 2 One option to prevent this risk would be to require an irrevocable election for the GST treatment, but imposing such a rule could be a barrier to funds acquiring other funds to achieve efficiency benefits, such as economies of scale 3 General accounting and record package services are excluded from the definition of exempt financial services, and advice is excluded from the exemption for arranging the supply of a financial service. IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 9 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Simplicity and compliance costs 58. Applying GST to all services provided by fund managers and investment managers would simplify GST compliance as they would be able to claim GST deductions for all the GST charged on their external costs. Integrity and precedent effect 59. We consider this option is more sustainable in the long term. It is less likely to lead to calls for further exceptions or put additional pressure on the boundary of the rules over time. Management services provided to funds would have the same GST treatment as administrative services and advice. This consistency removes pressure to define, bundle or reclassify these services and the associated risks of errors or disputes. Revenue 60. Inland Revenue estimates that this option could raise approximately $250 million to $300 million per annum of additional GST revenue. The estimated revenue depends on the proposed application date and estimated values of the affected managed fund assets and fees at that time. Disadvantages Impact on retail fees charged to investors 61. We expect that the additional GST collected under this option will lead to higher fees for retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members. To the extent that fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and the available balances at future dates (e.g., KiwiSaver members would have less available when they withdraw funds to purchase a first home, or at their retirement). 62. The extent to which GST will lead to higher fees for retail investors is uncertain. The economic literature for other types of GST increases and decreases has found they are more likely to affect the prices paid by consumers (in this case, retail investors) in more competitive markets 4 or if the GST reform is broader. 63. New Zealand’s managed fund fees are regarded as being less competitive (higher fees) than other countries. 5 This could suggest that some funds may be able to offset or absorb some of the additional GST cost pressures by changing their commercial practices 6 or reducing their profit margins, rather than raising their fees by the full amount of added GST cost. 64. Feedback from submitters was mixed regarding how much they expected fees would increase. The boutique funds submitted that the additional GST costs may have little impact on fees charged to retail investors due to increasing pressures to compete on fees 7 and the proposed transitional period which would allow time to adjust. In contrast, other submitters, such as the Financial Services Council, 4 In more competitive markets, businesses have lower profit margins so are less able to absorb cost increases as an alternative to increasing their retail prices. 5 Morningstar analysis recently reported that “in a global environment of shrinking fees, the \[NZ\] industry risks falling behind global peers, given the improvements in fees and expenses that other markets are making.” https://www.interest.co.nz/investing/115144/new-zealands-rating-drops-morningstar-analysis-fees-and- expenses-managed-funds 6 For example, by reallocating assets into lower cost wholesale funds or appointing new service providers 7 For example, in 2021, some large KiwiSaver funds announced fee reductions. IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 10 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Transitional costs 67. This option would impose significant transitional costs for most managers and investment managers that are not already applying 15% GST. Making the services subject to GST is the least preferred policy option of the mature funds represented by the Financial Services Council. This is because it would require them to shift from a fully exempt or 90% exempt treatment to GST applying to all the relevant fees. 68. The type of transitional costs involved and how they can be mitigated by providing a transitional period are further discussed in paragraphs 75-79 below. Recommended option 69. Inland Revenue and Treasury recommend Option 2: making services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST. We consider that this would lead to a more consistent treatment and therefore an even playing field across the industry. It would also reduce compliance costs, improve integrity and be more sustainable. Option 2 would raise revenue in a manner consistent with our GST frameworks. 70. We acknowledge that this would lead to fees increasing and transitional costs for the industry. However, we consider these costs can be mitigated by options considered further below and that the benefits of this option will outweigh these costs. There are other policy options to reduce managed fund fees 71. We note that recent measures, such as appointing new default KiwiSaver providers and improving fee transparency and comparison tools, are helping to place competitive pressure on fees. This highlights that there are a range of non-tax policy options to reduce fees. 72. If Ministers are concerned about the managed funds fees increasing because of applying GST, then we recommend considering non-GST options for supporting savers. This could include, for example, options such as an explicit fee subsidy or increasing Government contributions. Such options could also be better targeted to benefit savers with smaller balances (as opposed to GST concessions, which would produce the most benefit for savers with large balances). 73. We consider that these non-GST options are preferable and are likely to be more direct and effective than a GST concession. New Zealand’s GST system has not been previously used to reduce the price of specific goods or services (unlike other countries, which have concessions, for example, on food and education), so it would be an adverse precedent to provide GST concessions to reduce the price of managed fund fees. 74. The Treasury recommends that you consider these options alongside your wider fiscal and other objectives. The revenue from our preferred policy option (to mak e services supplied by fund managers and investment managers subject to 15% GST) could, for instance, be used to increase spending or reduce taxes in other areas and this should be compared alongside options to support savers. Application date 75. We are currently seeking further information from the Financial Services Council and other stakeholders about their expected transitional costs and will report back with further advice on the application date in May 2022 when we provide a draft Cabinet paper. 76. Many managed funds and service providers would face significant transitional costs in implementing the proposed change. There are currently 319 different KiwiSaver IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 12 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] funds (operated by 39 KiwiSaver schemes) and 727 non-KiwiSaver managed funds offered to retail investors. Nearly all of these funds will need to amend their IT systems, appoint new service providers, or renegotiate commercial contracts, update investor disclosure statements, and prepare communications and staff training to deal with increased contacts from customers. 77. Of the changes required, the changes to IT systems are likely to require the most time to prepare and implement. Many of the affected funds, such as those owned by banks, will have to plan, build, and test the IT changes around other significant IT projects. They will also be required to simultaneously implement a lot of other regulatory changes, such as climate reporting disclosures and proposed changes to anti-money laundering rules. 78. To ensure it is viable for funds and service providers to implement the proposed new rules and to mitigate the transitional costs, we recommend providing an adequate transitional period be tween enactment of the law change and when the new rules would apply. Our current best judgement, based on earlier submissions and discussions with stakeholders, is that 24 months should be sufficient. A shorter transition period, such as 12 months, would have a fiscal benefit of collecting GST revenue sooner, but we would recommend against this as it could impose much more disruption to the managed funds industry and associated implementation challenges and transitional costs. 79. The Financial Services Council have previously submitted that they require a 3 to 5- year transitional period and so we are seeking more information from them to help inform your decision. Financial implications 80. Subject to Ministers deciding to apply GST to the fees (option 2), and assuming a 1 April 2025 start date (24 months after enactment), our current best estimates of the fiscal impact of the changes are the revenue gains shown in the following table. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue $0 $0 $0 $42.0 $275.0 Total change in Revenue $0 $0 $0 $42.0 $275.0 81. These estimates depend on the proposed application date. They are based on 30 September 2021 managed funds data and are sensitive to assumptions about future growth in management fees. 8 82. We will provide updated advice on the application date and estimated fiscal implications when we report back in May 2022 with a draft Cabinet paper. We are 8 The estimates assume a 10% per annum increase in the dollar value of management fees. This assumption is based on the dollar value of basic manager's fees on KiwiSaver and Non-KiwiSaver managed funds growing by an annualised average of 14% for the 3 years between 30 Sept 2018 and 30 Sept 2021. A more conservative 10% assumption is used as: • the last 3 years have had historically high investment returns; • the Sep 2021 data we use does not reflect recent reductions in fees from new lower fee default KiwiSaver providers being appointed and having assets transferred to them on 1 December 2021; and • net contributions to KiwiSaver and other retirement schemes may reduce in future years as more of the population of investors reaches retirement age. IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 13 of 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] currently seeking further information on transitional costs which will inform the recommended application date and more recent data (for 31 December 2021) may have been published by then. 83. In May 2022, we will also seek your decision on how any additional revenue should be managed. In a recent instance, the fiscal impact of a tax change that was too large to be managed through the Tax Policy Scorecard was charged as a positive pre-commitment against Budget allowances. In other instances, the revenue impacts of large tax changes have been allowed to ‘flow through’ (i.e., to be reflected in forecasts but not allowances). Our initial view is that any additional revenue from this change should ‘flow-through’ to forecasts, but Ministers should take this into account when setting allowances at HYEFU later this year. Consultation 84. The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Financial Markets Authority were consulted on this report. 85. MBIE supports the aim of having a consistent GST system and the benefits this may have for competitive neutrality and lower compliance costs. However, increased fees and lower net returns for retail investors as a result of additional GST will lead to decreased retirement savings being available to savers in the future, including KiwiSaver members. This outcome risks undermining the positive impacts of recent Government efforts to ensure value for money with KiwiSaver and that the benefits of economies of scale in the funds management sector are being passed to consumers in the form of lower fees. Next steps 86. We recommend that you refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. 87. Officials are available to meet you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss this report. 88. Following your decision, officials will report back with a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement seeking Cabinet approval of your decision. An indicative timeframe for this Cabinet paper would be: 9 May Report back to the Minister of Revenue with a draft Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement. 16 June Lodgement of Cabinet paper for DEV (10am 16 June) 22 June DEV consideration of Cabinet paper 27 June Cabinet approval 89. This timeframe would allow the proposed legislative change to be included in the omnibus Taxation Bill which is scheduled for introduction in August 2022 and enactment in late March 2023. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/152; T2022/848: GST treatment of services supplied to managed funds Page 14 of 14

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s Final Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides the final progress update regarding the modernisation of the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note that Inland Revenue has successfully implemented its transformation programme and delivered the intended outcomes. Executive Summary 2 In just over 5 years, Inland Revenue has successfully transformed the revenue system in a multi-year, multi-stage programme. Changes have been made to every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates, including policy settings, processes, its people capabilities and technology. This has been a high risk, highly complex programme of a scale seldom, if ever, seen previously in New Zealand. 3 The first customer-facing changes were implemented in February 2017 and the final changes in October 2021. The programme has been delivered on time and has achieved the intended outcomes. Inland Revenue estimates it will hand back $250 million to $275 million 1 at the completion of the programme, in addition to the $160 million 2 handed back to date. This is a significant achievement. Many programmes of this size, scale, duration and ambition, whether in the public or private sector, are never fully completed, let alone deliver the outcomes intended. Furthermore, Inland Revenue has achieved this while continuing to deliver services to New Zealanders, navigating earthquakes and building closures, and supporting government to respond to a global pandemic. Formal programme closure is now just months away and will occur by 30 June 2022. 4 One of the objectives of transformation was to provide confidence that revenue would continue to be collected no matter the circumstances. For the year ending 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began, Inland Revenue collected $63 billion in Crown revenue. For the year ended 30 June 2021, Inland Revenue collected $94 billion, an increase of nearly 50%. Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalents working at Inland Revenue reduced by 28% and all staff are now in capability based roles, showing just how much more efficiently and effectively the department is now able to work. 5 Customers’ ability to self-serve has radically changed. This is reflected in customer uptake of myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, where total user sessions have nearly tripled from 17 million to 50 million in total over the 5 year period. Customer contacts through other channels, such as calls to Inland Revenue, have reduced as a result. Experiences for customers have improved significantly. Individual customers now 1 Including depreciation and capital charge 2 Including depreciation and capital charge 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] have refunds automatically calculated and paid to them. Businesses can meet their obligations through their accounting software. The information Inland Revenue holds is more accurate and up-to-date and combined with new analytical capabilities is enabling integrity checks to be completed in real time. Inland Revenue can now act far more quickly to help New Zealanders pay and receive the right amounts and identify and stop those who have fraudulent intent. 6 Although the programme will very shortly close, Inland Revenue will continue to focus on making the most of the suite of new capabilities introduced by transformation to reduce effort and improve experiences for customers further. 7 The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has meant there have been few other times in our history when getting support to New Zealanders as quickly and easily as possible has been as important. New Zealand now has a very responsive and robust revenue system, which has enabled relief packages such as the Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme and the Resurgence Support Payment to be delivered within weeks. Online applications with built in checks have made it easy for customers to check their eligibility for support and, for those eligible, payments arrive in their accounts within days. This would simply not have been possible before transformation. The final changes in Inland Revenue’s transformation programme have gone live 8 Child support moved to new systems and processes as planned on 28 October 2021. Child support customers now have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, and are able to do more for themselves, including applying online and advising the department of any changes in their circumstances. 9 Payments now get to carers faster. Since November 2021, child support payments have been passed on by the 23rd of the same month, as long as the liable (paying) parent has paid on time on the 20th. Previously, payments were made on the 7th of the month following the due date. 10 Legislative changes have also taken effect. Deductions of financial support from payments made by an employer are now compulsory for newly liable parents. As expected, it has taken time for some customers to get used to new ways of doing things and there have been some post go-live issues to address as there has been for every release. 11 As part of the final release, Inland Revenue also upgraded the online services all its customers use. A more modern look and feel for myIR, and simplified presentation of information and navigation, is making it easier for customers to find and do what they need to do. The layout adapts to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality. Following go-live, Inland Revenue surveyed customers to find out about their experiences with using the new look myIR. Overall, most customers found it quite or very easy to do what they needed to do. 12 Co-existence, which refers to running old and new systems in parallel, was the biggest risk to the revenue system during transformation. Inland Revenue’s operational risk profile has reduced significantly following the implementation of the final release as all products are running on new systems and processes. The previous system, FIRST, was decommissioned on 1 December 2021. One of the key objectives of transformation was to deliver stable and robust technology to underpin the revenue system. This is now a 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] reality and we have much greater flexibility to make changes to the products Inland Revenue administers. This needs to be balanced against the very full tax policy work programme we have asked Inland Revenue to deliver and any further COVID-19 related initiatives the department may be required to support. 13 There is still work to be done to decommission all remaining heritage systems and processes, and close the programme by 30 June 2022. However, this work will be largely invisible to anyone outside Inland Revenue. I am asking the committee to authorise the Minister of Finance and me to confirm the closure of the programme at the appropriate time. 14 While the programme will close, Inland Revenue will continue to modernise the revenue system by further embedding its new capabilities. In addition, Inland Revenue’s benefit commitments extend through until 2023/24. As programme-specific reporting will now cease, the department will report on the progress it is making with continued modernisation and achievement of its benefit commitments as part of its Annual Reports for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Inland Revenue has valuable experience others can learn from 15 We have begun a period of significant reform in many areas of the public sector and it is important that these reforms are implemented successfully. In my view, there is much that can be learned from Inland Revenue’s experience in successfully implementing what has been a highly complex, high-risk and multi-year programme. 16 Before getting anywhere near seeking funding and approval to begin implementation, Inland Revenue took the time to understand what it would take to be successful. This included the need to invest in the right capability, dedicated leadership, strong and effective governance, having a clear vision and roadmap, making core technology decisions early, building and maintaining stakeholder and customer support, and taking its people on the journey. Inland Revenue is the first to admit it didn’t get everything right and has some hard-won insights about pitfalls to avoid. The department has actively shared its experiences with other agencies and will continue to do so. 17 I believe it is essential that the lessons Inland Revenue has learned are captured and shared more widely across the public sector so that others may benefit from them. In my view this needs to happen sooner rather than later, while recollections are still fresh and before the key people involved move on to other things. I have asked Inland Revenue to provide a report to the Minister of Finance and me by June 2022 outlining its views about why it has been successful, what lessons it learned along the way, and what it would recommend other major change programmes should consider to set themselves up for success. 18 There are also undoubtedly opportunities to leverage the investment made in Inland Revenue more widely to improve outcomes for New Zealanders and support a unified Public Service. An independent review into where these opportunities may lie was commissioned by Inland Revenue and undertaken in November and December 2021. The findings have been shared with the Minister of Finance and me and the report is consistent with our view that there are opportunities to leverage and recommends: 18.1 The establishment of a system level strategic transformation capability to guide transformation. 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18.2 Appointing Lead Agencies for major shared delivery processes. 18.3 Reviewing the enabling regulatory frameworks as this is a primary source of complexity. 18.4 Strengthening the business case process to incentivise re-use of approaches and systems. 18.5 Ensuring business transformation programmes are funded through multi-year appropriations. 18.6 Conducting a feasibility study into the deployment of common and core capabilities. 19 As these recommendations are all at system level, I have asked the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to work with the Public Service Commissioner to inform further advice to Ministers on how to continue to leverage the business transformation investment and capabilities across the Public Service. The Minister for the Public Service is bringing proposals to this Committee relating to alignment and coordination of key functions across the Public Service that will provide an opportunity to respond to take this work forward. Transformation has delivered the outcomes intended 20 Inland Revenue recognised that a true transformation would involve a combination of changes to policy settings, process, technology, and people capabilities. Changes across all these dimensions were planned for through a multi-year, multi-stage programme. Transformation is far more than an upgrade of technology and has meant changing every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and social policy payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. Customers have significantly improved digital services and can do more for themselves 21 Digital services put customers in control, enabling them to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suits them. This makes it much easier for them to interact with Inland Revenue when they need to. Use of Inland Revenue’s digital channels has increased significantly in recent years. 22 Through their myIR account, customers can file returns, make payments, advise Inland Revenue of changes in their circumstances, and apply for support online. Customers are voting with their fingers as illustrated by the examples below. 22.1 The number of myIR sessions has nearly tripled from around 17 million for the year ending 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began, to more than 50 million for the year ending 30 June 2021. A huge amount of this growth, nearly 20 million sessions, was the result of customers accessing myIR from a mobile device. This was not possible before transformation. 22.2 Individual customers have embraced digital channels. As at 31 December 2021, 99% of individual income tax payments were made digitally, up from 85% for the 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] year ending 30 June 2016 3 . Over the same period, the percentage of donations tax credit claims made digitally increased from 51% to 82%. 22.3 The amount of paper being sent to Inland Revenue has reduced dramatically. 99% of returns were filed digitally for the year ended 31 December 2021. This is up from 73% for the year ended 30 June 2016. As at 31 December 2021, 88% of the correspondence sent to Inland Revenue was sent digitally, up from 57% as at 30 June 2018 4 . 22.4 More than 99.5% of the applications for COVID-19 support have been made online. As at 14 February 2022, of the approximately 135,000 applications received for the small business cashflow (loan) scheme, just 312 were not made through myIR. For the resurgence support payment, of the approximately 896,000 applications received, just 3,896 were not made through myIR. 23 Visits to Inland Revenue’s website have also increased considerably. The re-designed website went live in stages from April 2019 with a simplified and improved information structure, navigation, and language. The website is continually optimised based on customer usage patterns and feedback. The number of user sessions nearly doubled to 57 million for the year ending 30 June 2021, compared to 5 years earlier. 24 Working for Families customers whose entitlements had been too high can now pay back their overpayment by reducing their current entitlements. Customers can set up an instalment arrangement themselves through myIR, or Inland Revenue’s staff can set one up for them after a conversation with the customer. Since this option became available in April 2020, there has been a steady increase in customers setting up arrangements. Currently, around 2,000 customers have chosen to reduce their entitlements to pay back Working for Families debt. It was not possible to do this before transformation. The options previously available to customers were to try and pay it back in a lump sum, ring Inland Revenue to set up a payment arrangement, or have it taken out of their wages. 25 Despite the high uptake of digital services, there will always be customers unable or unwilling to use them or who need to contact Inland Revenue for other reasons. Phone calls and appointments will continue to be available to customers in these situations. While it is clear that use of these services is declining as customers choose digital options, they remain an important part of Inland Revenue’s service offering. The number of attempted calls to Inland Revenue declined by around 25% between the years ending 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2021, and the number of visits to the department’s offices declined by a similar amount. It is easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts 26 New processes and new capabilities are making it seamless and low effort for customers to meet their obligations and receive the right entitlements. 27 Inland Revenue is about to assess entitlements for approximately 380,000 Working for Families customers which will apply from 1 April 2022. This happens in February each year and is known as rollover. This process is now faster and more accurate, providing certainty to customers sooner, following the move of Working for Families to new systems and processes in April 2019. 3 Inland Revenue stopped accepting cheques in March 2020. 4 This measure is not available as at 30 June 2016. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27.1 Previously, using old systems and processes. it took more than 12 hours to rollover entitlements. Now, it takes around 30 minutes. 27.2 Previously, Inland Revenue notified customers over a 4 to 5 day period what their future entitlements would be. Now, notifications are sent as soon as entitlements have been calculated. 27.3 Based on what occurred for the 2021 rollover, Inland Revenue expects to let around 95% of customers know what their entitlements will be through myIR. This is up from around 80% previously. 28 Since the year ending 31 March 2019, an end-of year income tax assessment has automatically been issued to individuals. Inland Revenue pre-populates information in their myIR account and calculates the refund or tax to pay for them. Customers only need to let Inland Revenue know if this information is incorrect or incomplete. Refunds are automatically paid into bank accounts. 29 As at 30 June 2021, more than $1.8 billion in income tax refunds had been automatically paid out to customers over the 3 years the new process has been running. Over the same period, $305 million in bills for tax to pay had been issued. As at 30 June 2021, 90% of the refunds paid for the year ending 31 March 2021 went to customers earning less than $70,000, putting $410 million in customers’ pockets. 30 Prior to the introduction of the new year-end process, Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 1.4 million people did not have any end-of-year interaction with the department. Many could have been entitled to refunds if they had applied for them. For the year ending 31 March 2018, refunds totalling approximately $450 million were paid to those who applied for them. Customers could check to see whether they had a refund owing or tax to pay before taking any action. Inland Revenue’s assumption is that those who did not take any action either had tax to pay or were unaware they could have received a refund. 31 Fundamental changes, such as the introduction of automatic assessments, required an extensive programme of policy changes, all of which have now been implemented. Amongst the most significant legislative changes were the move to payday filing and changes to reporting requirements for investment income. 32 As a result, individuals’ income information is now more accurate and up-to-date and Inland Revenue has greater confidence in sharing it with others to improve outcomes for New Zealanders, with appropriate security permissions in place. This was a pre-requisite for introducing automatic income tax assessments and is helping to make payments during the year more accurate so that fewer people end up in debt or missing out on their entitlements. It has also contributed to the COVID-19 response, particularly in supporting the Ministry of Social Development to administer the wage subsidy. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Analytical capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue to proactively help customers 33 Inland Revenue is proactively using the more accurate information it holds to help customers, support the outcomes of social policies, and improve compliance. 34 Much greater visibility of customer behaviour enables Inland Revenue to quickly provide support and education where customers are struggling. Early detection of errors, both accidental and deliberate, means Inland Revenue can quickly identify and act on areas of confusion and/or compliance risks. For instance, it quickly became clear that customers filing their 2021 returns were either not including the wage subsidy they had received or were filing an incorrect amount. Within a week, Inland Revenue had pre- populated this information for customers. 35 To help ensure people receive the payments they are entitled to, each week Inland Revenue identifies between 50 and 100 customers who should be receiving Working for Families tax credits and aren’t and gets in touch with them. This was not possible before transformation. Inland Revenue also uses information from employers to pick up changes in customers’ income and notifies them that their entitlements may need to adjusted. 36 Automated rules enable the right checks and balances to be put in place upfront so things that need to be looked at by one of Inland Revenue’s people get stopped and those that don’t get processed more quickly, providing certainty to customers sooner. This means that a high trust model does not have to mean high risk. As at 14 February 2022, approximately 135,000 applications for the resurgence support payment had been stopped from being submitted by upfront checks 5 . A further 168,000 had been stopped by these checks to be reviewed by one of Inland Revenue’s experts, with around 70% subsequently approved. Most of the 840,000 payments to 231,000 eligible businesses totalling $2.9 billion so far had the funds in their accounts within three days. 37 Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically. All amended returns are checked and screened. Between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021, approximately 117,000 returns across all tax types were identified that had errors or potentially fraudulent with a value of just over $300 million. Please note this data is unaudited. 38 Both these examples show the power of Inland Revenue’s analytical capabilities to quickly identify and address fraudulent behaviour and ensure those that are eligible for support or a refund get it as quickly as possible. 39 New analytical capabilities are also helping people to better understand their compliance obligations. Compliance with the bright-line rule has been one of the first focus areas. Inland Revenue’s data has been brought together with LINZ and commercial third party data to begin to provide a view of property transactions throughout the country and identify those which are potentially subject to the bright-line rule. 40 When Inland Revenue sends information to customers (or their agent) reminding them that if a sale is subject to income tax due to the bright-line rule, then any profits from the sale must be declared in their income tax return when it becomes due, it delivers results. For the year ended 30 June 2021, 397 voluntary disclosures were received – a 300% increase on the 91 received the previous year. In addition, contacting people shortly after a sale has been made has led to a noticeable increase in bright-line information being filed with tax returns. By prompting more people to come forward and self-correct, Inland 5 This does not necessarily equate to 99,000 individual applications as it could include the same IP address attempting multiple entries. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Revenue’s compliance specialists are freed up to focus on the more non-compliant customers. Inland Revenue’s systems interact directly with customers’ and partners’ systems 41 Through transformation, the role of third parties in the revenue system has been significantly expanded. Services are increasingly being delivered in partnership with other organisations in both the public and private sector. This means that the timeframes for third parties need to be considered when implementing changes, for example changes to software packages. 42 Businesses are able to meet their obligations through their natural business systems. They can file through software and easily provide Inland Revenue with information at the time they’re carrying out a normal business process. For example, reporting employment income information to the department when they do their payroll. As at 31 December 2021, just over 210,000 small to medium sized businesses and tax agents were using business accounting or payroll software to manage their GST obligations. 43 Use of software platforms by customers has increased, in particular the big accounting and business management platforms, the banks and payroll providers (employers and payroll intermediaries). Previously Inland Revenue’s digital channels were not available to many software platforms so most customers used a combination of myIR, phone and paper. 44 Gateway services enable two-way, direct machine-to-machine interactions between external systems, such as tax agents and KiwiSaver providers, and Inland Revenue’s systems. They are a fast, high-volume channel providing on-call access to up-to-date information. All KiwiSaver providers are now using gateway services with a marked improvement in experience for customers. Customers are being enrolled and getting their contributions faster with much lower error rates. For the year ending 30 June 2021, 95% of members’ contributions were transferred to their scheme providers within two days. Previously it took an average of 20 to 23 working days. Inland Revenue is also receiving far fewer manually facilitated requests such as membership queries from KiwiSaver providers. Inland Revenue is working more efficiently 45 Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. As customer effort has reduced, the nature of Inland Revenue’s work has changed. This has freed Inland Revenue up to focus on customers who need help and support and those who choose not to comply with their obligations. The size of Inland Revenue’s workforce has reduced commensurately, with 28% fewer full-time equivalents (FTEs) as at 30 June 2021 compared to 30 June 2016. The reduction of 1,556 in the number of FTEs was achieved by adopting a set of workforce management principles. This meant that redundancies were limited to around 450, some of which were voluntary, with the balance achieved through attrition. 46 Over the same period, revenue collected has increased by nearly 50% and discrepancies identified by Inland Revenue’s compliance specialists have remained relatively steady at around $1 billion a year. The focus of compliance has moved from the end (enforcement) to ‘Right from the Start’, as the quality and frequency of the data Inland Revenue collects 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] has improved. Using analytics, the focus is now on real time integrity, both at the time a transaction takes place and intervening earlier when customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately. This reduces the need for post-return work, whether that is debt collection or audit and investigation. However, discrepancies continue to be identified through investigative activity where the dollar value or risk to the integrity of the revenue system warrants it. 47 To help its people make the most of its new capabilities, Inland Revenue has invested significantly in training and development opportunities. Capability-based roles are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy as well as new capabilities such as data analytics, enabling people to build their capabilities as work has changed. A full organisational redesign was completed. The new operating model enables Inland Revenue to harness collective strengths and knowledge to solve issues and innovate and improve services using new digital capabilities and networked ways of working. Delegated decision-making is enabling Inland Revenue’s front-line people to make decisions in real time as they are working with customers. 48 Mobile workplace technology is enabling Inland Revenue’s people to work from anywhere. This has meant that Inland Revenue could keep providing services during several significant disruptions that occurred during the implementation of the programme, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long-term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Inland Revenue’s ability to keep providing services would have been severely constrained in these situations prior to transformation. 49 Mobile technology and flexible working practices are highly valued by Inland Revenue’s people. The 2021 Public Sector Census showed that Inland Revenue people, compared to all public servants, feel they have and can use more flexible working opportunities and are more satisfied with their work/life balance. The programme will come in under budget and unused funding will be handed back through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process 50 Previously, Inland Revenue has handed back approximately $127 million in capital and operating funding of the total approved $1,870 million capital and operating funding for the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024. Additionally, the department handed back approximately $33 million of the total $740 million approved funding for depreciation and capital charge over the same period 6 . Jointly, the amount handed back to date is around $160 million. 51 Now that the programme is nearly complete, Inland Revenue estimates it will be able to hand back a further $90 million to $100 million in capital and operating funding and $160 million to $175 million of depreciation and capital charge. In total, Inland Revenue estimates it will be able to hand back $250 million to $275 million including depreciation and capital charge through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process. 52 The total estimated amounts to be handed back over the life of the programme are $410 million to $435 million including depreciation and capital charge. This represents about 16% to 17% of the total funding approved for transformation and approximately 30% to 32% of the new Crown funding approved. 6 At the time the business case was approved in November 2015, the capital charge was 8%. This has since reduced to 5%, reducing the approved funding for depreciation and capital charge to $664 million. 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Funding transfer for residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme to be requested through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process 53 In 2022/23 and 2023/24, Inland Revenue intends to undertake necessary residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme on 30 June 2022. These activities were unable to be completed due to COVID-19 priorities. 54 To fund these activities, Inland Revenue intends to cover capital costs estimated at around $21 million from internal reserves as well as to seek expense transfers from the current year’s operating appropriation totalling between $30 million and $35 million. 55 The expense transfers for the operating cost will be requested through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process. Next steps 56 The next steps are to: 56.1 complete decommissioning of all heritage systems and processes; 56.2 provide a lessons learned paper to the Minister of Finance and me by June 2022; and 56.3 close the programme by 30 June 2022. Consultation 57 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation; the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Chief Digital Officer); the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment; the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development; the New Zealand Customs Service; and Stats NZ.

Proactive Release 64 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes, in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) Business Transformation was complex, risky project... 65 The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer agree that Inland Revenue has successfully implemented its Business Transformation programme. This was a very substantial and complex undertaking. ...which has delivered significant change... 66 Every aspect of Inland Revenue’s work has been affected by changes that have made the tax system generally more efficient, more responsive to change, and easier to engage with. 67 Inland Revenue’s management of its finances and its technology throughout the process has been exemplary. And despite being disrupted by a global pandemic and the closure of the agency’s main premises in central Wellington, the project will substantively close in June this year, on-time and under-budget. 68 Business Transformation has already delivered important benefits for Inland Revenue’s customers and the Government. More people are filing electronically and Inland Revenue is better able to help people get their obligations ‘right from the start.’ The agency was also able to play a critical role in the response to COVID-19, standing up the Resurgence Support Payment and Small Business Cashflow Scheme faster than would have been possible before. ...while not detracting from BT’s success, central agencies note... 69 Other benefits are harder to assess. Central agencies have previously questioned whether the projected revenue uplift would be achieved. This is because the agreed proxy measures for revenue uplift only loosely correlate with increased revenue (the proxy measures are supplemented by case studies, which are also inevitably incomplete). Inland Revenue correctly notes that revenue has grown by approximately 50% over the course of Business Transformation, but other factors have also contributed. 70 The evidence is also mixed for some other benefits of the programme. Administrative savings have been achieved through downsizing of Inland Revenue’s workforce, thereby reducing the agency’s baseline beyond the end of the programme. But temporary funding has been provided to prevent some of the downsizing out of concern that this would affect ongoing service levels, especially during the current pandemic. 71 Inland Revenue and the Treasury will need to continue to monitor the sustainability of Inland Revenue’s funding. 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 72 In respect of compliance costs, the direct interaction between Inland Revenue’s systems and business customers’ systems saves time, as does the pre-population of information on returns and automatic refunds. However, the time taken by some taxpayers, such as SMEs, to comply with their tax obligations has not fallen as much or as consistently as hoped. Tax agents, too, have raised concerns about engaging with Inland Revenue. 73 In terms of technology, central agencies would like to better understand IR’s roadmap of future system investment, including the core system provided by FAST. Specifically, when will an investment of a similar scale be needed in the future, and to what extent can Inland Revenue’s systems be continuously and sustainably managed, enhanced and replaced? ...and there are many lessons that can be learned, both for Inland Revenue and for future projects. 74 Ongoing responsibility for tracking Business Transformation benefits has passed to IR’s Performance and Reporting team. The Minister of Revenue should also continue to seek and interrogate assurances from officials that Inland Revenue remains focused on maximising the benefits of BT, and that the agency is addressing areas where there are further opportunities to improve. 75 While central agencies await with interest Inland Revenue’s “lessons learned” report, Business Transformation has shown the importance of taking a rigorous approach to risk management, monitoring, and working collaboratively. Taking this approach will put future projects on track to deliver real benefits for New Zealanders, as this programme has. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that this is the final progress update on Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme; 2 note that child support successfully went live on new systems and processes on 28 October 2021 and that Inland Revenue’s online services were upgraded at the same time; 3 note that Inland Revenue has now implemented New Zealand’s future revenue system in four stages as agreed by Cabinet in November 2015; 4 authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to confirm the closure of the programme by 30 June 2022; 5 note that the Ministry for the Public Service is bringing a paper to this Committee relating to the alignment and coordination of key functions across the Public Service that will provide an opportunity to leverage the business transformation and capabilities across the Public Service; 6 note that Inland Revenue estimates it will hand back a further $250 million to $275 million, including depreciation and capital charge, through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process, taking the total to be handed back over the life of the programme to about $410 million to $435 million, including depreciation and capital charge; 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 note that Inland Revenue intends to undertake necessary residual activities following the closure of the transformation programme on 30 June 2022, and that to help fund these Inland Revenue will be seeking expense transfers totalling $30 million to $35 million through the Budget 2022 Technical Initiatives Process; 8 note that Inland Revenue will continue to report on its progress in meeting its benefit commitments through its Annual Reports for 2022, 2023, and 2024.
