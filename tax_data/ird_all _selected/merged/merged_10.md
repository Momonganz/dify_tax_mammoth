Supplementary Briefing Papers VOLUME 2 Report on Research Commissioned by Inland Revenue November 1999 Preface This second volume of supplementary briefing papers contains Inland Revenue's response to research we commissioned on the economic effects of taxation. In 1997 and 1998 the department's Policy Advice Division circulated for public comment 38 working papers prepared under the supervision of its Taxation Economics Group. Our response to those papers outlines the background to the research being commissioned, identifies and discusses the key results of the research, and examines the implications of the research. In view of the large number of working papers, this report does not seek to comment on each. Instead it discusses the key results of the research that have attracted considerable media attention. These are: • the effect of taxation on economic growth; and • the size of the “hidden” economy and the level of tax evasion. The appendices to the report outline some of our main concerns about the methodologies used in some of the working papers, particularly those relating to the impact of taxation on the rate of economic growth in New Zealand.

In accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP), those working papers have passed through a detailed process of internal and external consultation. Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division has completed its review of that research in the light of the results of that process of consultation. The purpose of this report is to: • outline the background to that research; • identify and discuss the key results of that research (sections 2 and 3 of this report); and • examine the implications of the research (section 4 of this report). This report is not intended to provide a detailed analysis of each of the working papers commissioned by Inland Revenue. Rather, its purpose is to discuss the key results of that research that have attracted considerable media attention. These are: • the effects of taxation on economic growth; and • the size of the “hidden” economy and the level of tax evasion. The appendices to this report outline some of the key concerns we have with the methodologies used by some of the working papers, particularly the methodologies used to comment on the impact of the tax system on the rate of economic growth. Background The primary objective of the working papers commissioned by Inland Revenue was to assist us with the preparation of our “Health Report”. In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Committee chaired by the Rt Hon Sir Ivor Richardson, Inland Revenue has been preparing a regular “Health Report” for the Minister of Revenue. To date, three health reports have been submitted to the Minister of Revenue, one in February 1997, another in December 1997, and the most recent in December 1998. As recommended by the Review Committee, the objective of those health reports is to provide the Government with a clear picture of the full set of major issues confronting the tax administration in the achievement of its objective, including any “pressure points”. This is intended to ensure that the Government has all of the information necessary in order to make purchase and ownership decisions that are in the best long-run interests of the tax administration . Chapter 1 Page 2 In particular, the structure and content of Inland Revenue’s health reports reflect the Review Committee’s recommendation that those reports should: • integrate new and existing strategies; • describe the requirements to operationalise policy initiatives, so that the Government can make purchase decisions consistent with its wider strategies and the overall objective for the tax administration; and • state how Inland Revenue is dealing with any problems developing in the operation of tax legislation reported through the Generic Tax Policy Process. 1 The Review Committee also recommended that Inland Revenue develop and maintain a set of macro performance indicators, for inclusion in its “Health Report”, to assist the Government and Inland Revenue management in making strategic decisions on tax matters. 2 In accordance with that recommendation, Inland Revenue has: • included macro performance indicators of the efficiency of the tax administration in its health reports to the Minister of Revenue; and • commissioned some 38 working papers to assist with the development of indicators of the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. Objectives of the research commissioned by Inland Revenue The working papers commissioned by Inland Revenue have sought to help us monitor: • the extent to which the tax system is imposing costs on New Zealand by reducing economic growth; and • the size of the “hidden economy” and the level of tax evasion in New Zealand. The research was not intended to come up with any specific recommendations as to the nature of possible reforms to the tax system. Rather, it was commissioned with a view to providing some indication of changes in the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system in order to assist both the Minister and Inland Revenue senior management in their consideration of taxation issues. 1 Organisational Review Committee (1994) Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department , Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy also to the Minister of Finance), April, recommendation 8.6.4, page 53. 2 Recommendation 8.6.5, page 53 op cit. Appendix C listed possible indicators including: best estimate of theoretical revenue; actual revenue collected; the “tax gap”; deadweight losses; taxpayer compliance costs; total administration costs; net revenue collected; taxpayer perceptions as a measure of voluntary compliance; tax disputes assessment; return on taxpayer audit; and macro benchmarks assessing IRD’s performance against other industries in New Zealand and overseas tax administrations. Summary Page 3 Process of consultation In accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process, the working papers have passed through an extensive process of internal and external consultation. That process of consultation has included: • internal Inland Revenue workshops, where the working papers were discussed with an audience comprising the authors of the papers, officials from Inland Revenue, the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, academics from New Zealand and overseas, and a number of other interested parties; • circulation of the working papers to a number of overseas academics who served as independent referees; and • wider circulation of the working papers to various Members of Parliament, the media, New Zealand academics, and other interested parties. Inland Revenue has now completed its evaluation of the working papers in the light of comments made during this process of consultation and further evaluation of the working papers by the Policy Advice Division. This process of consultation has culminated in the preparation of this report. Key results of the research Impact of taxation on economic growth The key results of the research into the effects of taxation on economic growth are set out in chapter 2. In brief, although the results of the working papers differ to some extent, they are consistent with the main conclusions reached in the working paper by Branson and Lovell: • The optimal tax burden varies over time around a period mean of 22.5%, well beneath the actual period mean effective tax rate of 28% and far beneath the 1995 effective tax rate of 35%. • The optimal tax mix varies over time around a period mean 65% share of direct taxes in total tax revenue. This optimal share is slightly less than the observed period mean 68% share of direct taxes in total tax revenue, although it is virtually identical to the 1995 share. • A move to an optimal tax structure would on average generate nearly a 17% increase in the level of real GDP. Such a move would have no perceptible impact on the long run rate of growth of real GDP beyond the transition period, although the transition period might be quite long. Chapter 1 Page 4 • The 17% increase in real GDP, in conjunction with the 20% reduction in the tax burden, would reduce government tax revenue by almost 6% on average. As a consequence, purchasing power in the remainder of the economy would increase by 27% on average. It is this release of resources from the public to the private sector which generates the higher output and faster transitional period growth. Size of the hidden economy and level of tax evasion The key results of the research into the hidden economy, and the effects of taxation on the size of the hidden economy, are set out in chapter 3. In brief, the working papers conclude that: • The size of the hidden economy as a percentage of GDP fluctuated over the period of analysis (1968 to 1994) between 7% and 11.3% of GDP in a manner that is positively correlated to the business cycle. • The long run average size of the hidden economy was estimated to be 8.8% of GDP, and it peaked at 11.3% of GDP in both 1987 and 1994. • The size of the hidden economy in New Zealand is in the lower half of the estimated size of the hidden economy for most OECD countries. • A decrease in the tax/GDP ratio reduces the hidden economy ratio. • A one-percentage point reduction in the tax/GDP ratio causes a 0.2 percentage point fall in the hidden economy for recent levels of tax/GDP. • Below a tax/GDP ratio of 21%, the hidden economy decreases at a slower rate. • If the Government were to reduce tax rates to zero, the hidden economy would still remain at 4%-4.5% of GDP. Inland Revenue’s views We are concerned about the approach adopted, and some of the methods used, to estimate the adverse effects that taxation has had on the level of economic growth in New Zealand, and the manner in which the results of that research have been interpreted. However, we are more comfortable with the conclusions reached by other working papers. For example, Professor Giles has provided the first estimates of the potential size of the hidden economy in New Zealand, and that work enables estimates to be made of the overall extent of tax evasion. We intend to explore the possibility of updating that type of analysis on a reasonably regular basis for inclusion in the department’s annual Health Report. Summary Page 5 Our views on the research are outlined briefly below. Effect of the tax system on economic growth Costs and benefits of taxation In the course of raising and redistributing tax revenue, the tax system has the unintended effect of distorting decisions to save, invest, work, consume and produce. This imposes costs on the nation as a whole by encouraging a less efficient use of resources. Those costs, which are often referred to as “deadweight costs” or the “excess burden” of taxation, can take a number of forms including administrative costs, compliance costs, and other deadweight costs that arise because the tax system distorts consumption, production, savings, investment, work and education decisions. At the same time, however, government expenditure financed by tax revenue can benefit the nation as a whole by improving the efficiency with which the economy operates, and achieving a more equitable distribution of income. The net effect of taxation on economic growth, and the well-being of the nation as a whole, therefore depends on the relative magnitudes of these costs of raising tax revenue, and the benefits derived from the government expenditure financed by that tax revenue. Those benefits include both potentially higher rates of economic growth, and a more equitable distribution of income. Objectives of the research Several working papers sought to develop indicators of the net effect that the tax system has been having on rate of economic growth in New Zealand. In particular, those working papers sought to determine: • the effect of the tax burden (as measured by the ratio of tax revenue to GDP) on the rate of growth of GDP; and • the effect of changes in the tax mix (as measured by the ratio of tax revenue raised by direct and indirect taxation to GDP) on the rate of growth of GDP. Concerns regarding the approach adopted Two approaches can be used to estimate the deadweight costs of taxation. One approach is to develop a detailed model of the New Zealand economy that enables a detailed analysis to be undertaken of the extent to which the tax system distorts decisions and reduces the overall efficiency with which the economy operates. Chapter 1 Page 6 This is the approach used by Professor Erwin Diewert and Dr Denis Lawrence to estimate the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of consumption, and labour income, in New Zealand. The main advantage of that “bottom-up” approach is that it seeks to model the factors that actually determine the magnitude of the deadweight costs of the tax system. By contrast, the main disadvantage is that it is informationally demanding since it requires detailed information on the effective marginal tax rates facing taxpayers, and how responsive taxpayers’ decisions are to changes in those tax rates. An alternative approach to estimating the deadweight costs of taxation is to select some indicator of national welfare that is measurable (such as the rate of growth in GDP) and estimate the extent to which taxation has adversely affected that indicator. This is the approach adopted by several of the working papers commissioned by Inland Revenue. In brief, that “top-down” approach involves first estimating the tax burden and tax mix that maximise the rate of economic growth, and then determining the adverse effects on economic growth that arise from a tax system that applies a higher tax burden, and a different tax mix. The main advantage of the “top-down” approach is that it is potentially less informationally demanding than the alternative “bottom-up” approach described above. This enables readily observable data to be used for the purposes of the analysis. The main disadvantage of that approach is that it is possible to reduce the information required for the purposes of the analysis significantly only by making even more simplifying assumptions than those made for the purposes of “bottom-up” models. This means that the results of the analysis have to be interpreted with considerable caution in the light of those simplifying assumptions. The conclusions reached are only as good as the assumptions that have had to be made to reach those conclusions. Unfortunately, the results of empirical analyses are often accepted at their face value, with little regard for the validity of the underlying assumptions. Two key assumptions underlie the working papers on taxes and growth: • The tax structure is adequately described by: -the tax burden (the ratio of tax revenue to GDP); and -the tax mix (the ratio of indirect to direct taxes). • The Government’s sole objective is to maximise the rate of growth of real GDP. As discussed below, we do not consider these assumptions are realistic. First, the complex structure of the tax system cannot be described adequately by the “tax burden”, or “tax mix”. This is because the ratio of tax revenue, or components of tax revenue, to GDP is a poor indicator of the distortions introduced by the tax system. Summary Page 7 In particular: • Major changes in the tax system and the level of distortions it creates may not produce significant changes in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. Indeed, a revenue-neutral package of tax reforms will have no effect on the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP even though it might significantly reduce distortions, improve efficiency and hence economic growth. This is a major problem with the approach adopted since the process of tax reform since 1984 has involved the introduction of numerous largely revenue-neutral packages of reforms aimed at broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates. • Tax reforms that have vastly different effects on the overall efficiency of the tax system can have the same effect on the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP. For example, the introduction of a $100m package of highly distortionary tax concessions, or a $100m increase in tax avoidance and evasion, would have the same effect on the ratio of tax revenue to GDP as a $100m tax cut package that considerably reduced distortions. • The ratio of taxation revenue to GDP can fall as a result of decreases, rather than increases, in the efficiency of the tax system. For example, increases in administrative and compliance costs that do not produce additional tax revenue will tend to reduce the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP. • The ratio of taxation revenue to GDP can change even when there are no changes in the tax system or the distortions it creates in the economy. This is because not all activities face the same rates of taxation. As a result, different patterns of economic growth can have different effects on the level of taxation revenue raised. For example, economic growth that is predominantly due to an increase in the production and consumption of goods and services that are exempt from GST (such as financial services, or exports which are subject to a zero rate of GST) would not produce any additional GST revenue. By contrast, there would be an increase in GST revenue if that economic growth was predominantly due to an increase in the production and domestic consumption of consumer goods and services that are subject to GST. Simply dividing the amount of tax revenue by GDP is not a particularly accurate method of ensuring the estimated tax burden does not change simply as the result of economic growth. These problems mean that if we simply study the relationship between changes in the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP and the rate of growth of GDP, we may get a very misleading view of the effect that changes in the tax system are having on economic growth. In particular, given the nature of the tax reform process to date, there is a risk that such an approach will understate the improvements in growth arising from tax reforms that have not resulted in significant falls in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. Second, it is highly unrealistic to assume that the sole objective of governments is to maximise economic growth. Government expenditure is aimed at objectives other than just increasing the rate of economic growth. These objectives include improving the quality of the environment within which New Zealand residents live, and the equity with which income is distributed in New Zealand. Chapter 1 Page 8 As outlined below, the rate of growth in GDP is not a particularly good indicator of the net benefits of government spending financed by tax revenue. In particular: • The rate of growth of GDP does not adequately reflect the benefits of all government expenditure financed by taxation revenue. The benefits of government expenditure on goods and services are difficult to value for national account purposes, owing to the absence of “arm’s-length” market prices. In practice, most goods and services provided by the Government are valued at cost, which can either under or overstate their true benefit to the community. In particular, there is a risk of undervaluing the benefits arising from services that involve little or no government expenditure. These include the benefits from enforcement of regulations including property rights, quarantine regulations, health regulations, and environmental standards. Problems also arise when valuing the benefits arising from government expenditure that is not directed at increasing the rate of economic growth. This includes expenditure on social welfare programmes which is predominantly aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of income in New Zealand. These benefits will not be reflected adequately by changes in the rate of growth of GDP. By using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator, the approach adopted in the working papers considers the costs of raising the tax revenue required to finance social welfare expenditure, but it fails to take into account adequately the benefits of that expenditure. This has the potential to bias the observed relationship between the tax burden and the rate of economic growth. • Government expenditure needs change over time in response to a range of factors including changes in demographics, technology, the needs of the community, as well as community attitudes about the appropriate distribution of income. For example, the expenditure needs of the Government during the early years of the period of analysis were vastly different from the expenditure needs over recent years. This makes it difficult to establish a stable, longer-term relationship between changes in the tax burden and the rate of growth in GDP. Of particular significance is the increase in the proportion of government expenditure on social welfare programmes over the period of analysis. This has the potential to exacerbate the bias arising from excluding the benefits of social welfare expenditure financed by taxation revenue. • The rate of growth of GDP reflects the benefits of government spending financed from sources other than tax revenue, such as increased government debt and increased government charges for those goods and services. However, the approach adopted in the working papers does not consider the costs of raising that revenue. This has the potential to bias the observed relationship between the tax burden and the rate of economic growth. • The proportion of government expenditure financed from tax revenue has changed considerably over the period of analysis. Once again, this makes it more difficult to establish a stable, longer-term, relationship between the tax burden and the rate of growth of GDP. It also has the potential to exacerbate the bias arising from excluding the costs of raising the non-tax revenue required to finance that expenditure. Summary Page 9 Concerns regarding the methods used We are also concerned about the analytical methods used in some of the working papers. In particular, we are concerned about the methods used by Professor Scully in his working papers on the effects of taxation on economic growth. Those concerns are outlined in chapter 2, and are discussed in more detail in the appendices. In view of those concerns, Inland Revenue does not agree with the conclusions reached by Professor Scully. Interpretation of the results of the research The results of the research into the effects of taxation on economic growth need to be interpreted carefully in the light of the objectives of the research, and the inherent limitations of the approach adopted. As noted in several working papers: • The objective of the research into taxation and economic growth was not to determine the optimal ratio of tax revenue to GDP and tax mix for New Zealand. Rather, the research sought to calculate the “growth maximising” tax burden, and tax mix, in order to develop macro performance indicators of the extent to which taxation has been imposing costs on New Zealand by retarding the rate of economic growth. • Since any Government will have numerous objectives other than maximising the rate of economic growth, it may need to raise revenue in excess of the estimated “growth maximising” ratio of tax revenue to GDP. As a result, Inland Revenue does not consider the research has established that: • the optimal rate of tax for New Zealand is 20% of GDP; • the “optimal tax mix for New Zealand is 65% from direct taxes, and 35% from indirect taxes; and • tax rates and government expenditure should be reduced to achieve those optimal ratios. Consequently, it would be inappropriate to use the estimated “growth maximising” tax burden and tax as targets for tax policy purposes. Even if a Government’s sole objective were to maximise the rate of economic growth, the problems inherent in the “top-down” approach adopted by the working papers are such that the results of the research should be interpreted with considerable caution. As outlined above, the tax burden (as measured by the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP) is a very poor indicator of the structure of the tax system and the extent to which it distorts economic decisions. Many of the increases in the rate of economic growth that are due to relatively revenue neutral packages of tax reform will not be attributed to changes in the tax system. Chapter 1 Page 10 In view of these problems, we do not consider that the working papers have established a clear relationship between the effects of taxation on economic growth in New Zealand. We share the OECD’s concerns about the merits of “top-down” research and agree with its view that current research on the relationship between taxation and economic growth is far from conclusive. However, we do consider that the overall level of taxation in New Zealand is high by historical standards and is likely to be imposing considerable costs on the community as a whole. Size of the “hidden economy” and the level of tax evasion Inland Revenue welcomed the research by Professor Giles into the size of the hidden economy in New Zealand and is concerned about overall level of tax evasion in New Zealand. Although the estimated size of the hidden economy in New Zealand is well below the average for most OECD countries, this is not a reason to be complacent. The overall size of the hidden economy is still significant, and Inland Revenue is committed to reducing that level. It is reassuring, however, to learn that New Zealand does not suffer from an unusually high level of unreported income, and that much of this activity would occur regardless of the level or rate of taxation. The relationship between taxation and the size of the hidden economy does pose an interesting dilemma for policy makers. To the extent that it is possible and desirable for the Government to do so, lowering the tax/GDP ratio may have two offsetting effects on the hidden economy. In itself, the research shows that such a policy would decrease tax evasion. However, because tax evasion and economic growth are positively correlated, it would also encourage tax evasion. The net effect remains ambiguous. It is important to note that reducing tax rates, and broadening the tax base produce numerous benefits in addition to reducing the size of the hidden economy. These include improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. As a result, it is better to view reductions in the size of the hidden economy as being one of the many potential benefits of reducing taxes, rather than the main reason for wanting to cut taxes. Although reducing taxes may help to reduce the incentive to avoid and evade taxes, the Government’s ability to reduce taxes is obviously constrained by its revenue needs. At the end of the day, the tax system must raise sufficient revenue to meet the Government’s expenditure and debt servicing needs. Summary Page 11 A more practical approach to tax evasion is that recommended by the European Commission, endorsed by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and being applied by Inland Revenue. 3 This involves pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at enhancing compliance by simplifying the tax system, and discouraging non-compliance through more effective audits and penalties. These initiatives are discussed in section 3.4.2 of this report. Implications for future research Practical constraints on the development of macro performance indicators Although it is highly desirable to monitor the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system, Inland Revenue’s experience suggests that there are numerous factors that constrain our ability to do so. In particular, research into the efficiency and equity of the tax system: • Requires large amounts of information that is often not available. In the absence of such information, numerous simplifying assumptions need to be made which may not be realistic. • Produces results that can be difficult to interpret. The need to make numerous simplifying assumptions can make it difficult to interpret the results of the analysis. In many instances it is necessary to qualify those results heavily in the light of the simplifying assumptions that have had to be made, and the methodologies adopted, to get around those information constraints. This severely limits the usefulness of those results for the purposes of tax policy development and tax administration. • Consumes considerable resources . Research into the efficiency and equity of the tax system is typically complex, costly and takes considerable time to complete, given an adequate process of consultation. These practical difficulties do not mean that we should not attempt to monitor changes in the efficiency and equity of the tax system. However, they do suggest: • the need for caution when interpreting macro performance indicators of the costs of taxation and the size of the hidden economy; • the need for more practical research; and • the need to explore alternative methods of monitoring the progress that the tax policy work programme is making towards improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. 3 Commission of the European Communities (1998) On Undeclared Work , Communication from the Commission, p.11. Chapter 1 Page 12 Need for caution when interpreting and using macro performance indicators In view of the complexity of the tax system, and the numerous simplifying assumptions that have to be made in order to derive indicators of the overall efficiency and equity of that system, considerable care needs to be exercised when interpreting changes in those indicators. In particular, we should be careful not to place too much emphasis on those macro performance indicators in the tax policy development process. The temptation with indicators is to ignore all of the assumptions that have had to be made to derive those indicators, and to ascribe much greater accuracy and relevance to those indicators than is warranted. Indicators should be used to assist the policy development process, rather than become the entire focal point of that process. In particular, we need to avoid making the indicators the end objective, and forgetting about the real objectives. At the end of the day, tax policy formulation still involves a considerable amount of judgement, both on behalf of advisors and the Government. Indicators can assist in that process, but cannot replace it. It is appealing to think that it might be possible to develop a model that would be capable of determining what rates of tax should apply in New Zealand, and what proportion of tax mix should be raised by direct, as opposed to indirect, taxes. In reality, however, empirical models are incapable of providing answers to these complex questions. The tax system, and the manner in which it affects the operation of the economy, is extremely difficult to model in a realistic manner. Inevitably, it is necessary to make numerous simplifying assumptions that abstract from reality in order to overcome data limitations and ensure the model can be solved. Tax policy design also involves some important and complex trade-offs that cannot, and should not, be made by an empirical model. For example, practical tax policy formulation inevitably involves trade-offs between the efficiency and equity of the tax system which can, and should, only be made by the Government. Tax policy development is not, and is unlikely ever to be, a science. It requires decisions to be made often in the presence of considerable uncertainty and incomplete information. Ultimately, tax policy formulation requires complex judgements to be made by both officials and the Government. Although empirical analysis can assist the Government in making those decisions, it cannot, and should not, seek to make those judgements. Tax reform to date has been designed to deal with these severe information constraints. It has not involved the use of extensive empirical analysis to determine the “optimal” rates of tax to apply to different activities in order to minimise the costs of taxation. Summary Page 13 Rather, the approach has been to improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. This has not required detailed information on differences in effective marginal tax rates, and the manner in which taxpayers are responding to those different tax rates. Need for more practical research In view of the problems with the “top-down” research commissioned into the economic effects of taxation, the results of that research are of little use for the purposes of purposes of tax policy development and administration, or for inclusion in the department’s Health Report. We share the concerns expressed by the OECD about “top-down” research into the effects of taxation and economic growth, and agree that such research needs to be supplemented with further “bottom- up” research. As a result, Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division has decided to discontinue that research and focus its research efforts over the next twelve months on other areas of our current research programme that are of greater practical use to tax policy development and administration. This includes further research aimed at: • Identifying those areas of the tax base that are being eroded by tax planning activities and developing possible solutions to those problems. Such tax base erosion reduces the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system by encouraging inefficient patterns of consumption, production and resource use, as well as a less equitable distribution of income. The recent discussion document on the post- implementation review of GST identified a number of tax planning activities that are eroding the consumption tax base, and proposed solutions to these problems. Other base maintenance initiatives will be proposed for inclusion in future tax bills. • Simplifying the tax system for businesses, especially small businesses. Unnecessary complexity in the tax system also reduces its overall efficiency and equity by increasing both compliance and administrative costs. Phase 1 of the tax simplification project has resulted in significant reductions in the number of individuals required to file tax returns, thereby improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system by reducing compliance costs. Phase 2 of the project is focusing on identifying aspects of the tax system applying to businesses, particularly small businesses, that would benefit from simplification. In the medium term, we also intend to explore the possibility of updating the research into the size of the hidden economy, and the overall level of tax evasion. Although it is not feasible to update that data on an annual basis, it may be possible to provide an update on a less frequent basis, say every three years. In addition, we will be continuing to: • assist the Treasury with the research currently being undertaken by Professor Erwin Diewert and Dr Denis Lawrence into the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of income from capital; Chapter 1 Page 14 • contribute to the joint work on savings issues with the ISI; and • pursue other more practical ways of monitoring the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Need to explore alternative ways of monitoring the efficiency and equity of the tax system In view of the difficulties associated with developing annual indicators of the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system, the department’s Policy Advice Division has been considering alternative ways of providing key decision makers with an overview of the tax system, and the progress that is being made to improve that system. The continuing process of tax reform in New Zealand is extensive and complex. Each year, a large number of detailed proposals for tax reform are proposed and implemented. In the course of working through those detailed proposals for tax reform proposals, it is relatively easy to lose sight of the current tax system, the overall tax policy objectives, and the progress that is being made each year towards the implementation of that work programme. In particular, it is often difficult to see how the various proposals for tax reform fit together to form a consistent approach to tax reform. Often the detailed reforms can appear to be piecemeal, even though they are part of a consistent strategy for improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. The process of tax reform could be improved by raising the overall level of public understanding of the Government’s tax policy work programme, and the progress that is made in implementing it. Therefore we propose to provide up-to-date information on the process of tax reform on our tax policy web site and to update that information at least once a year. This will provide both Ministers and other interested parties with an overview of New Zealand’s tax system, and a qualitative discussion of the progress of the tax policy work programme. In particular, we intend to outline the Government’s revenue strategy, the announced tax policy work programme, and the progress that Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division is making to implement that work programme. Page 15 Chapter 2 Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Ideally, the tax system should be capable of raising and redistributing tax revenue in a manner that does not impose costs on the nation as a whole. That is, the burden imposed on taxpayers should equal the amount of tax revenue raised. In practice, however, the tax system imposes a burden on taxpayers that exceeds the amount of tax revenue raised by an amount referred to as the “excess burden” or “deadweight costs” of taxation. These deadweight costs arise because the tax system unintentionally distorts consumption, production, savings, investment, work and education decisions. This imposes costs on the nation as a whole by encouraging a less efficient use of resources, thereby reducing New Zealand’s prospects for increased economic growth. Deadweight costs can take a number of forms including: • the administrative costs associated with collecting tax revenue; • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers in the course of determining and satisfying their tax liabilities, or collecting tax revenue on behalf of the Government; and • other “deadweight” costs of taxation which arise because the tax system distorts consumption, production, savings, investment, work and education decisions. At the same time, however, the revenue raised by taxation is used to finance government expenditure that can benefit the nation as a whole by improving the efficiency with which the economy operates, and achieving a more equitable distribution of income. For example, government expenditure on public goods, such as infrastructure, can improve the productivity of human and fixed capital, thereby enhancing New Zealand’s prospects for increased economic growth and higher living standards. By contrast, other forms of government expenditure are directed at achieving objectives other than enhancing economic growth. For example, expenditure on social welfare is predominantly redistributive in nature and is directed at improving the welfare of the community by achieving a more equitable distribution of income. The net effect of taxation on economic growth, and the well-being of the nation as a whole, therefore depends on the relative magnitudes of these costs of raising tax revenue, and the benefits derived from the government expenditure financed by that tax revenue. Those benefits include both potentially higher rates of economic growth, and a more equitable distribution of income. Chapter 2 Page 16 Objectives of the research Several working papers sought to develop macro performance indicators of the net effect that the tax system has been having on rate of economic growth in New Zealand. In particular, those working papers sought to determine: • the effect of taxation on the rate of growth in GDP; and • the effect of changes in the tax mix (between direct and indirect taxation) on the rate of growth of GDP. Scully working papers The paper by Professor Scully on Taxation and Growth in New Zealand attracted the most media attention and comment by academics. That working paper sought to determine the relationship between the average level of taxation (as measured by the ratio of tax revenue to GDP), and economic growth (as measured by the rate of growth in GDP). Professor Scully argued that up to a certain level, government expenditure tends to increase economic growth: Economic theory suggests that up to some level government expenditures increase the productivity of private economic resources. The provision of national defense and a judicial system protect property and individual rights. Other publicly provide \[sic\] goods, such as infrastructure, also enhance private productivity. Thus, up to some point, government expenditure acts as a positive externality on private economic activity. Government expenditure for public administration, defense, and law and order represented about 12.2 percent of total outlays in 1987 and 14.1 percent of them in 1994. This expenditure amounted to about 5.5 percent of GDP. 4 By contrast, he argued that expenditure beyond that level tends to reduce growth: Beyond some optimal size of government, increased taxation acts as a negative externality on the private sector. The negative effects of taxation and public expenditure (e.g. incentive effects such as work versus leisure, the wedge between personal savings and investments, debt versus equity financing, etc.) are well known in the public finance literature. The inefficiency of resources allocated in a political market, problems of collective choice (overproduction) and rent-seeking are well known in the public choice literature. Most of government spending in New Zealand is redistributive. Expenditure on education, health, social welfare, housing and community, recreation and culture, and economic services amounted to 87.8 percent in outlays in 1987 and 89.5 percent in 1994. These redistributive outlays were about 39.5 percent of GDP. On a more narrow definition of redistribution as current government transfers, these were about 62 percent of government outlays and a quarter of GDP. 5 4 Scully, G. (1996) Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand, Working Paper No.14, Inland Revenue, March, p.3. 5 Scully, G. (1996) Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand, Working Paper No.14, Inland Revenue, March, p.3-4. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 17 Specifically, the working paper by Professor Scully postulated that increases in taxation up to some “growth maximising” level increase the growth rate at a decreasing rate, whereas taxation above that level reduces the growth rate at an increasing rate. Professor Scully also prepared a working paper on The Growth Maximising Tax Mix in New Zealand. In that paper, Professor Scully examined trends in the revenue collected from direct and indirect taxes in New Zealand, and estimated “growth maximising” tax rates by type of tax in order to determine the “optimal” or “growth maximising” tax mix. Branson and Lovell working paper The working paper by Branson and Lovell also sought to determine the net effect of both the level of taxation (the tax burden) and the tax mix (the ratio direct to indirect taxation) on the rate of economic growth in New Zealand. In particular, that working paper sought to provide answers to the following questions: • Is there a relationship between the rate of growth in real GDP and the tax structure (tax burden and tax mix)? • If so, which component of the tax structure, the burden or the mix, has the more potent impact on the rate of growth of real GDP? • Is it possible to determine values of the tax burden and the tax mix which would maximise the rate of growth of real GDP? • What would be the effect, on both the level and the rate of growth of real GDP, of moving to an optimal tax structure? • What would happen to tax revenues, and to purchasing power in the remainder of the economy, if New Zealand adopted an optimal tax structure? Caragata and Small working papers These papers examined: • the impact of the tax to GDP ratio on the real rate of growth of both the measured and hidden economies in New Zealand; and • the interaction of the tax to GDP ratio and the tax mix (direct versus indirect taxes) and their effects on real output growth in New Zealand. Approach adopted Although the working papers outlined above employed different analytical methods, they all used the same basic approach to determine the net effect that the tax system has been having on economic growth. Chapter 2 Page 18 That approach involved first estimating the level of taxation and tax mix that maximise the rate of economic growth, and then determining the adverse effects on economic growth that arise from a tax system that applies a higher level of taxation, and a different tax mix. For example, Professor Scully’s model sought to estimate the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, which would have maximised the growth rate over the last 70 years. In so doing, the work sought to reveal the forgone growth in output associated with failing to sustain the growth-maximising tax/GDP ratio for the period 1927-94. This was achieved by estimating the rate of growth of real GDP that would have occurred if the tax/GDP ratio was at its growth-maximising level over the period. This growth-maximising level of GDP was then compared with actual (lower) GDP growth over the same period. Key results Trends in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP Figure 1 outlines the trends in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP over the period of analysis. F IGURE 1: T OTAL TAX REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP SOURCE: NZIER and Inland Revenue Department Effect of taxation on the rate of growth Scully concluded that: • The growth maximising tax rate over the period 1927-1994 is about 20 percent of GDP and hence is much lower than the actual tax rate. Tax as a share of GDP was not below this rate in the post-World War II period. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 192619301934193819421946195019541958196219661970197419781982198619901994 % of GDP Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 19 • As such, the economic growth rate and, hence, the level of GDP, is below that which would have been achieved had the optimal tax rate been kept in effect throughout the period. • The difference between the growth rate with the optimal tax rate and the observed growth rate is not trivial. This difference in growth rates is shown to be responsible for a $1.17 trillion (in 1988 NZ dollars) loss in output over the period 1946-1994. Branson and Lovell concluded that: • The optimal tax burden varies over time around a period mean of 22.5%, well beneath the actual period mean effective tax rate of 28% and far beneath the 1995 effective tax rate of 35%. • The optimal tax mix varies over time around a period mean 65% share of direct taxes in total tax revenue. This optimal share is slightly less than the observed period mean 68% share of direct taxes in total tax revenue, although it is virtually identical to the 1995 share. • A move to an optimal tax structure would on average generate nearly a 17% increase in the level of real GDP. Such a move would have no perceptible impact on the long run rate of growth of real GDP beyond the transition period, although the transition period might be quite long. • The 17% increase in real GDP, in conjunction with the 20% reduction in the tax burden, would reduce government tax revenue by almost 6% on average. As a consequence, purchasing power in the remainder of the economy would increase by 27% on average. It is this release of resources from the public to the private sector which generates the higher output and faster transitional period growth. • Applying the analysis to a longer time series (1928 to 1995) changes the estimates of the optimal tax structure and the benefits of moving to it slightly, but does not overturn the major findings. These are that the tax burden has been too high, excessive emphasis has been placed on direct taxes, and the resulting growth penalty has been large. Caragata and Small concluded that: • The total tax burden has a negative effect on real GDP but increases the size of the hidden economy. • The total tax burden has a larger effect on the measured economy than on the hidden economy. • Tax cuts are less attractive at higher levels of the tax/GDP ratio (for example, over 35%) as compared to lower levels (for example, 25%) in promoting economic growth (and possibly generating tax revenue) and reducing the size of the hidden economy (and related tax evasion). Chapter 2 Page 20 • Tax cuts enhance economic growth more when they are applied well before a recession begins. • The cumulative effect of lowering the overall tax burden to 20% over the sample period would have produced in excess of $64 billion real 1991/92 dollars worth of output fiscal year 1994 and shrunk the hidden economy by $1 billion. They argue that these results tend to confirm Scully’s estimates of the growth-maximising tax rate for New Zealand. • The three models developed estimate the optimal tax rate for New Zealand is in a range between 13.4% and 15.5% of GDP. Effect of the tax mix on the rate of economic growth Scully concluded that: • The level of taxation is too high and the tax mix is inappropriate for the economy to grow at its maximum potential rate. Over the period 1927-93, real growth was 3.4 percent per annum. Had the growth-maximising tax rate of around 20 percent of GDP been in effect during the period, growth would have been in the 5 percent range. • The tax mix is misaligned for maximum potential growth. Direct taxes are nearly twice and indirect taxes 28 percent more than is consistent with high growth. • It will be politically difficult to reduce the tax burden and change the tax mix to the levels suggested in this paper. • It would take a decade or so to bring taxes down to 20 percent of GDP, nearly two decades to bring personal taxes down to 7.1 percent of GDP and 13 years to reduce indirect taxes to 5.7 percent of GDP. And after a decade or so, transfer payments would be 14.5 percent of GDP, rather than 25%. While politically difficult, such a fiscal programme is not too radical. Branson and Lovell concluded that: • The tax mix (the ratio of indirect to direct taxes) has varied between 0.31 and 0.75, having increased recently with the introduction of GST. • The optimal tax mix varies over time with a mean of 0.54 suggesting a mean share of direct taxes in total tax revenue of 65%. • An excessive tax burden has done far more damage to economic growth than has an inappropriate tax mix. • Reducing the tax burden is a more potent way on enhancing economic growth than is fine-tuning the tax mix. This is due to the fact that the actual tax burden has consistently been far higher than the growth-maximising tax burden, while the actual tax mix has typically been much closer to the growth-maximising tax mix. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 21 • The cost of maintaining a sub-optimal tax structure was 16.4% of GDP in 1995 (the difference between optimal and observed GDP). • In 1995 an optimal tax structure would have reduced tax revenue by 10.8% and would have increased the purchasing power in the remainder of the economy by 31%. • In 1995, the modified effective tax rate (the observed effective tax rate plus the forgone output sacrificed to a suboptimal tax structure) was 51.4% compared with an observed effective tax rate of 35%. Branson and Lovell also concluded that: • Their primary findings were robust to a lengthening of the time period on which they are based (from 1946-1995 to 1928-1995). They found that their estimates of the optimal tax structure were very close to those obtained with the 1946-1995 data, although their estimates of the cost of maintaining a suboptimal tax structure were somewhat lower. Nonetheless, they considered their long period findings to be consistent with their short period findings. • Their estimates of the optimal tax structure are remarkably close to Scully’s in light of the methodological differences involved. Caragata and Small concluded that: • Decreases in the overall tax burden and increases in the proportions of tax raised indirectly are each associated with greater real growth rates. • The efficacy of changes to the overall tax burden and the tax mix are greater at relatively high growth rates. If the tax burden were reduced to 20% of GDP, changes to the tax mix would have the greatest effect on economic growth when around 72% of taxes were derived indirectly. They note that this does not imply that a 72:28 split of taxation between indirect and direct taxes will maximise growth given a 20% tax burden since they maintain that maximum growth would be attained when all revenue is collected from indirect tax. However, they argue that if a hybrid tax system is deemed desirable for other reasons, then their results provide support for using a 72:28 split. They also note that efficiency is note that efficiency is not the only objective in taxation. Given an equity constraint, the settings of the tax/GDP ratio and the tax mix could be quite different than under a simple efficiency constraint. Inland Revenue comment We have a number of concerns in relation to these working papers on taxation and economic growth. Chapter 2 Page 22 In particular, we are concerned about: • the approach adopted in those working papers; and • the methodologies employed in some of the working papers. These key concerns, and their implications for the interpretation of the results of the research, are outlined below. Concerns about the approach adopted As noted earlier, the overall objective of the working papers is to assist Inland Revenue to monitor the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. Ideally, both officials and the Government would like to know how much it costs the economy to raise the tax revenue required to finance government expenditure, and the benefits the nation derives from that expenditure. In other words, ideally we want an indication of how changes in the tax system are affecting national welfare. There are two main approaches that can be adopted to obtain such an overall estimate of the net effect of taxation on the economy. “Bottom-up” approach One approach is to construct a detailed model of the New Zealand economy that allows us to examine the effects of changes in the tax system on individual consumption, production, and investment decisions. This “bottom-up” type of approach was used by Professor Erwin Diewert and Dr Denis Lawrence to obtain the first estimates of the deadweight costs of taxing labour income and consumption in New Zealand. It is also the approach they are currently using to extend their original study to include estimates of the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of income from capital (income from investment). In principle, the main advantage of this type of approach is that it is capable of modelling the complexities of the tax system, and the effects that changes in that system have on economic decisions, and hence national welfare. In practice, however, the main disadvantage of this type of approach is that it is informationally demanding. In particular, it requires information on the effective marginal tax rates applying to different activities in New Zealand, and how responsive those activities are to changes in those tax rates. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 23 “Top-down” approach An alternative approach is to estimate the impact that the overall tax system has been having on some overall macroeconomic indicator of the welfare of the community as a whole, such as the rate of growth of GDP. This “top-down” type of approach was used by Scully, Branson and Lovell, and Caragata and Small. The main advantage of this type of approach is that it is potentially less informationally demanding than the “bottom-up” approach described above. This enables readily observable data to be used for the purposes of the analysis. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it is only possible to reduce the information required for the purposes of the analysis significantly by making even more simplifying assumptions than those made for the purposes of “bottom-up” models. This means that the results of the analysis have to be interpreted with considerable caution in the light of those simplifying assumptions. The conclusions reached are only as good as the assumptions that have had to be made to reach those conclusions. Unfortunately, the results of empirical analyses are often accepted at their face value, with little regard for the validity of the underlying assumptions. As noted by Branson and Lovell, two key assumptions underlie the working papers on taxes and growth: Two assumptions underlie our analysis. The first assumption is that in evaluating the structure of the tax system the driving policy objective is one of maximising the rate of growth of real GDP. It is possible that different policy objectives could lead to different evaluations. The second assumption is that the tax structure is adequately characterised by two dimensions: the tax burden, or the effective tax rate, and the tax mix, the ratio of indirect to direct taxes. Although a more detailed breakdown of each type of tax would be desirable, the second assumption implies that it would not impact significantly on our findings. 6 We do not consider these assumptions are realistic. As discussed below: • the ratio of tax revenue to GDP is a poor proxy for the distortions created by the tax system; and • the rate of growth of GDP is not a particularly good indicator of national welfare. 6 Branson, J. & Lovell, K. (1997) A Growth Maximising Tax Structure for New Zealand , Working Paper No.30, Inland Revenue, March, p.21. Chapter 2 Page 24 The ratio of tax revenue to GDP is a poor proxy for the distortions created by the tax system In order to determine the impact that changes in the tax system are having on national welfare in New Zealand, it is necessary to have an accurate indicator of those tax changes. As outlined above, the working papers assume that the structure of the tax system can be described adequately by: • the ratio of total tax revenue to GDP, which is used as an indicator of the “tax burden” (also referred to in the working papers as the “average level of tax”, or the “effective tax rate”); and • the ratio of indirect tax revenue to direct tax revenue, which is used as an indicator of the tax mix. Unfortunately, as discussed below, the ratio of tax revenue, or components of tax revenue, to GDP is not an adequate indicator of the distortions created by the tax system. In particular: • The ratio of tax revenue to GDP may not reflect major changes in the tax system. • Vastly different tax reforms can have the same effect on the ratio of tax to GDP. • The ratio of tax revenue to GDP can fall as a result of decreases in the efficiency of the tax system. • The ratio of tax to GDP can fall even when there are no changes in tax distortions. The ratio of tax revenue to GDP may not reflect major changes in the tax system As noted by the OECD in its report Taxation and Economic Performance (1997), 7 the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP does not reveal much about the microeconomic distortions caused by taxation. The structure of the tax system, and the manner in which individuals respond to that system, is much too complex to be described adequately by a macro-level indicator such as the ratio of tax revenue to GDP (See Box 1). 8 This is because the “tax burden”, as measured by the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, is not a particularly good indicator of the factors that actually determine the size of the “excess burden” or “deadweight costs” of taxation. These factors include: • the extent to which the tax system distorts the relative rates of return from substitutable consumption, production and investment activities (which depends on the types of taxes used to raise revenue and the effective marginal tax rates applying to the returns from different activities); and 7 Leibfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A. (1997) Taxation and Economic Performance Economics Department Working Paper No.176, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris. 8 Leibfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A. (1997) Taxation and Economic Performance Economics Department Working Paper No.176, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 25 • how responsive decisions are to those distorted rates of return (which depends on consumer tastes as well as the preferences of producers and investors). As a result, major changes in the tax system and the level of distortions it creates may not produce significant changes in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. For example, a revenue-neutral package of tax reforms will have no effect on the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP even though it might significantly reduce distortions, improve efficiency and hence economic growth. OECD views on macro indicators of tax distortions The difficulties with assessing tax distortions at the macro-level arise from the complex nature of these distortions. Tax distortions must be defined with reference to a neutral tax system, which is generally not observable empirically. In theoretical studies, the lump-sum tax (which is an equal tax amount per person) is used as a reference case for a neutral tax, as this tax provides government revenues without changing relative prices. Virtually all existing taxes are potentially distortionary in the sense that they change relative prices between factors of production (labour and capital) and/or between current consumption and future consumption (which corresponds to current savings), between different goods and/or services or between labour or leisure. However, the economic implications of these distortions depends on the response of economic agents: a given tax system will have large distortionary effects on the economy (i.e. high deadweight losses or excess burden) when the elasticities of substitution are high and small distortionary effects when the elasticity of substitution is low. As the elasticity of substitution generally differs across the economy (for example, between labour and capital or between different goods or between demand and supply of similar factors of production or goods), the tax burden may be shifted to those parts of the economy (or to those economic agents) where the elasticity of substitution is low (for example, the tax burden may be shifted from capital to labour); it may take some time until all tax effects have worked through the system and are noticeable in the data. ... These considerations suggest that any analysis of the effects of taxation on growth and employment should focus on the overall effects of taxation including all secondary effects across factor and product markets. This is a major problem with the “top-down” approach adopted by the working papers given that most of the major reforms to the tax system since 1984 have been relatively revenue neutral packages of reforms aimed at broadening the tax base and lowering tax rates. In particular, there is a risk that the “top-down” approach adopted in the working papers will understate the improvements in growth arising from tax reforms that have not resulted in significant falls in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. Any increases in the rate of economic growth that are the result of those largely revenue-neutral reforms will not be attributed to improvements in the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Chapter 2 Page 26 Vastly different tax reforms can have the same effect on the ratio of tax to GDP In addition, tax reforms that have vastly different effects on the overall efficiency of the tax system can have the same effect on the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP. For example, the introduction of a $100m package of highly distortionary tax concessions, or a $100m increase in tax avoidance and evasion, would have the same effect on the ratio of tax revenue to GDP as a $100m tax cut package that considerably reduced distortions. The ratio of tax revenue to GDP can fall as a result of decreases in the efficiency of the tax system The ratio of taxation revenue to GDP can fall as a result of decreases, rather than increases, in the efficiency of the tax system. For example, increases in administrative and compliance costs that do not produce additional tax revenue will tend to reduce the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP. The ratio of tax to GDP can fall even when there are no changes in tax distortions The ratio of taxation revenue to GDP can change even when there are no changes in the tax system or the distortions it creates in the economy. This is because not all activities face the same rates of taxation. As a result, different patterns of economic growth can have different effects on the level of taxation revenue raised. For example, economic growth that is predominantly due to an increase in the production and consumption of goods and services that are exempt from GST (such as financial services, or exports which are subject to a zero rate of GST) would not produce any additional GST revenue. By contrast, there would be an increase in GST revenue if that economic growth was predominantly due to an increase in the production and domestic consumption of consumer goods and services that are subject to GST. Simply dividing the amount of tax revenue by GDP is not a particularly accurate method of ensuring the estimated tax burden does not change simply as the result of economic growth. The rate of growth of GDP is not a good indicator of national welfare In order to monitor the effects of changes in the tax system on national welfare, we also need to have a good indicator of national welfare. In particular, that indicator needs to reflect both the costs and benefits of all government expenditure financed by tax revenue. In practice, however, it is extremely difficult to measure the benefits of government expenditure. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 27 As noted above, the working papers assume that the sole objective of a Government is to maximise economic efficiency. This assumption enables the working papers to use the real rate of growth in GDP as a proxy for national welfare. It is important to note that it is highly unrealistic to assume that the sole objective of any Government is to maximise economic growth. Government expenditure is aimed at objectives other than just increasing the rate of economic growth. These objectives include improving the equity with which income is distributed in New Zealand as well as the quality of the environment within which New Zealand residents live. The objectives of taxation are to raise revenue in the most efficient, or least distortionary, manner possible, while meeting the expenditure requirements of Government. In this respect, the level of taxation is driven as much by the Government’s expenditure requirements as it is by meeting particular GDP growth targets. Although the rate of growth of GDP might be easy to observe, as explained below, it is not a particularly good indicator of the net benefits of government spending financed by tax revenue. The rate of growth of GDP does not adequately reflect the benefits of all government expenditure financed by taxation revenue One of the major problems with using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator is that it does not adequately reflect the benefits of all government expenditure financed by taxation revenue. As noted by Slemrod, 9 many of the benefits of government expenditures financed by tax revenue are not adequately reflected in national account data because of measurement problems. Included are the benefits derived from government expenditure on the environment, social welfare assistance, and government regulation. In particular, most goods and services provided by the Government are valued at cost, which can either under or overstate their true benefit to the community. In addition, there is a risk of undervaluing the benefits arising from services that involve little or no government expenditure. These include the benefits from enforcement of regulations including property rights, quarantine regulations, health regulations, and environmental standards (see Box 2). 10 Problems also arise when valuing the benefits arising from Government expenditure that is not directed at increasing the rate of economic growth. This includes expenditure on social welfare programmes which is predominantly aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of income in New Zealand. These benefits will not be reflected adequately by changes in the rate of growth of GDP. 9 Slemrod, J, 1995. “What Do Cross-Country Studies Teach about Government Involvement, Prosperity, and Economic Growth?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , 2:1995: 402-403. 10 Slemrod, J, 1995. “What Do Cross-Country Studies Teach about Government Involvement, Prosperity, and Economic Growth?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity , 2:1995: 402-403. Chapter 2 Page 28 Problems associated with measuring the value of goods and services provided by the government An immediate problem is how to measure the value of goods and services provided by government. National income accounts generally value them at cost, since there are no market prices to refer to. National income accounts make no attempt to value the leisure time of a country’s residents, even though it is clear that individuals themselves place a value on their leisure. Among other things, this means that income comparisons will overstate the welfare cost of government involvement that tends to reduce labor supply (that is, increase leisure). A similar, but slightly different, issue relates to the quality of the environment. This does not enter into national income, which therefore reflects only the cost of government programmes designed to improve it. The difference between environmental quality and leisure is that increasing the former reflects an explicit policy goal, while increasing the latter represents an unintended consequence of other goals that require tax revenue. Environmental quality is only one example of a social goal whose achievement is not reflected in standard measures of national income. It is widely accepted that redistributional programs exact some cost in terms of reduced incentives to work. Measures of economic success based on average income do not capture the degree to which such programs succeed, although they capture, with error, the costs they engender. The same can be said of social insurance programs, whose objective is to reduce the uncertainty of citizens faced with risks that are not adequately handled by private insurance markets. Measures of national income are likely to accompany the costs that accompany the moral hazard of social insurance, albeit imperfectly, but they certainly do not account for the reduction in uncertainty that they allow. ... A much more difficult problem is that many of the important avenues by which the government affects the economy have little or no budgetary consequence. Consider such critical aspects of policy as the enforcement of property rights, competition and regulation policies, the extent of government enterprise, minimum wage rules, and trade restrictions. These nonbudgetary aspects of government economic involvement have the potential to introduce bias into any observed relationship between prosperity or growth and the level of measured government activity. The direction of bias is not, a priori, clear. By using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator, the approach adopted in the working papers considers the costs of raising the tax revenue required to finance social welfare expenditure, but it fails to take into account adequately the benefits of that expenditure. This has the potential to bias the observed relationship between the tax burden and the rate of economic growth. The Government’s expenditure needs change over time The problem outlined above is compounded by the fact that the Government’s expenditure needs, and its pattern of expenditure, change over time in response to a range of factors including changes in demographics, technology, the needs of the community, as well as community attitudes about the appropriate distribution of income. For example, a county’s infrastructure needs are not constant over time. Depreciation brought about by physical deterioration, or technological obsolescence, can change the rate at which New Zealand needs to replace its existing infrastructure. Similarly, demographic changes, such as ageing of the population, increased immigration, and the movement of the population into major cities, can dramatically change New Zealand’s infrastructure needs over time. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 29 This makes it difficult to establish a stable, longer-term relationship between changes in the tax burden and the rate of growth in GDP. Of particular significance is the increase in the proportion of government expenditure on social welfare programmes over the period of analysis. This has the potential to exacerbate the bias arising from excluding the benefits of social welfare expenditure financed by taxation revenue. F IGURE 2: S OCIAL WELFARE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE SOURCE: The Budget (1984 - 1998) Statistics New Zealand (GDP 1991-92 current prices, expenditure based). Inland Revenue does not consider that the approach adopted in the working papers on taxation and economic growth pays sufficient attention to the Government’s expenditure needs and changes in those needs over time. Government expenditure requirements over the period of analysis changed significantly in response to changing economic, demographic and social conditions. Since the level of taxation is essentially a function of the level of expenditure planned by government, the appropriate level of taxation should also vary with economic conditions. A useful example is the fiscal pressure arising from demographic trends illustrated in the Retirement Income Report (1997) of the Periodic Report Group. 11 The report forecasts a variety of scenarios demonstrating the policy options for the future superannuation and health requirements of New Zealand’s ageing population. The report shows that the future projection of gross expenditure on New Zealand Superannuation based on current policies will double over the next 50 years, from 5% to 11% of GDP (assuming the superannuation surcharge was abolished in April 1998). 12 11 Periodic Report Group (1997) 1997 Retirement Income Report – A Review of the Current Framework , Interim Report, July, Chapter 6. 12 This applies to both gross and net expenditure measures of New Zealand Superannaution as a percentage of GDP. Net expenditure, which nets off the estimated income tax and surcharge associated with NZ Superannuation, is forecast to increase from 4% to 9% of GDP (p.102-103). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 1982198319841985198619871988198919901991199219931994199519961997 % of Total Government Expenditure Chapter 2 Page 30 This example demonstrates how changing economic and social conditions can significantly change the Government’s requirements for tax revenue over time. This makes it difficult to estimate the “growth maximising” ratio of taxation revenue to GDP, as it is constantly changing over time. The rate of growth of GDP reflects the benefits of government spending financed from sources other than tax revenue Another problem with the rate of growth of GDP is that it reflects the benefits of government spending financed from sources other than tax revenue, such as increased government debt and increased government charges for those goods and services. However, the approach adopted in the working papers does not consider the costs of raising that revenue. This inclusion of the benefits of such expenditure, and exclusion of the costs of financing that expenditure, have the potential to bias the observed relationship between the tax burden and the rate of economic growth. The proportion of government expenditure financed from tax revenue has changed over time The problem outlined above is compounded by the fact that the proportion of government expenditure financed from tax revenue has changed considerably over the period of analysis. As indicated in figure 3, over the period 1974 to 1992 an increasing proportion of government expenditure was financed by increased government debt, whereas more recently the government has been running surpluses and repaying debt and making greater use of government charges to raise revenue.

It also has the potential to exacerbate the bias arising from excluding the costs of raising the non-tax revenue required to finance that expenditure. Concerns about the methodologies used We are also concerned about some of the methodologies used in the working papers. These methodological concerns, which are outlined briefly below, are discussed in more detail in the appendices to this report. Effects of taxation on the rate of economic growth Professor Scully’s working paper Taxation and Growth in New Zealand attracted considerable attention both in the media, and from other academics. 13 Most of the comments made related to the methodology employed by Professor Scully. A number of significant problems were raised in relation to that methodology including the following: • The absence of a well developed theory underlying the model. • The inability of the model to: -properly capture the impact of expenditure on public goods that are used as inputs by the public and private sectors of the economy; -accommodate the consequences of transfer payments, despite their growing importance over the period of analysis; -allow for the different effects of the various types of taxes that are used to raise revenue; and -accommodate the impact of taxes on the proportion of income saved and invested. • The use of only one explanatory variable (the tax burden) in the model to explain variations in the rate of growth in GDP. This means that all of the other determinants of the rate of economic growth are included in the error term in the estimation equation. This might not be a problem if there was no correlation between the tax burden and other determinants of the rate of economic growth. In reality, however, it is highly likely that the tax burden does have an influence on other determinants of the rate of economic growth such as the rate of growth of employment. 13 Scully, G. (1996) Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand, Working Paper No.14, Inland Revenue, March. Chapter 2 Page 32 • Data problems. • Problems with the econometrics including: -the poor statistical performance of the “unrestricted” regression; -the possibility of reverse causation between the rate of growth and the tax burden (for example, increases in the rate of growth in GDP might result in fiscal drag which would increase the tax burden); and -concerns that the 20 percent growth maximising tax burden result is not robust over shorter periods of analysis. • Use of the CPI to deflate GDP. • Misuse of the concept of deadweight cost. • Problems with the algebra in the working paper. In view of the considerable contention surrounding the work of Professor Scully, Inland Revenue commissioned an independent review of the econometrics from Professor Phillips. Professor Phillips is a renowned econometrician at Yale University and the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics. His views on that research are set out in Appendix 4. Professor Phillips identified a wide range of econometric issues in Professor Scully’s work that require resolution, including: • Tax/GDP ratios are the outcome of tax law and millions of economic decisions within the economy. They are not external to the economy, as the paper requires. • The effect that the Great Depression of the 1930s has on the results, and whether an unusual event from so long ago should be accorded such influence. • The effects of human capital accumulation and technological improvements over the years which are omitted from the equations. • How dependent the answers obtained are on the practice of averaging GDP growth rates over rolling nine-year periods in the model. Averaging over some other period of years could yield different results. In view of the concerns outlined above, we do not accept the results of Professor Scully’s Working Paper No.14. In particular, we do not consider that Professor Scully has established that a tax/GDP ratio of 20% would maximise the rate of growth in GDP in New Zealand. Effect of changes in the tax mix on the rate of economic growth This research inherits many of the problems associated with the research into the effects of taxation and growth. Indeed, in some instances, the same structural model is employed to estimate the mix of taxes that would maximise economic growth. Many of the criticisms of the use of the tax/GDP ratio also apply to the use of the direct tax/GDP and indirect tax/GDP ratios. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 33 There are three main concerns with this work. • There is a noticeable lack of theory, and it simply searches for a correlation between particular tax types and the growth rate. • Although the results are unanimous in concluding that a greater emphasis on indirect taxation (GST) is less obstructive to economic growth, there is an alarming variation in the “optimal” tax mix that has been estimated by the various models. • The results offer no evidence of the distortions arising from shifting towards indirect taxation. The real policy issue is how do people alter their decisions between consumption and savings or work and leisure as the tax mix changes. In particular, the wide variation in the results makes it difficult to draw any specific conclusions from the work. This is evident from figure 4, which compares the confidence intervals for six models on the effect of the tax mix on economic growth and the size of the hidden economy. From figure 4, it is clear that there is only a high level of confidence in a range for the growth- maximising share of direct taxes/GDP. For the model Scully (1), for example, to have 95% confidence in the result for the growth-maximising ratio of direct taxes to GDP, the estimates range from 35% to 100%. To know that the growth-maximising ratio of direct taxes to GDP falls in this range is not a particularly useful result.

The research does not determine the “optimal” tax burden or “tax mix” for New Zealand As noted in several working papers, the objective of the research into taxation and economic growth was not to determine the optimal ratio of tax revenue to GDP and tax mix for New Zealand. Rather, the research sought to calculate the “growth maximising” tax burden, and tax mix, in order to develop indicators of the extent to which taxation has been imposing costs on New Zealand by retarding the rate of economic growth: There are several different objectives that governments take into consideration, aside from the maximisation of economic growth, such as increasing spending on health, education or various social benefits in order to correct perceived existing deficiencies. 15 Since the Government has numerous objectives other than maximising the rate of economic growth, the working papers recognised the possibility that the Government may need to raise revenue in excess of the estimated “growth maximising” ratio of tax revenue to GDP: With such multiple objectives, rather than just growth maximisation, the political process may well prefer a tax rate above 20% or 25% of GDP. The intent here is not to advise on policy. Rather, it is to use performance benchmarks for measuring the current consequences of taxation. The optimal range for the tax/GDP ratio in a multi-objective framework cannot be identified until all the research on equity and efficiency has been completed. 16 As a result, we do not consider the research has established that: • The “optimal” rate of tax for New Zealand is 20% of GDP. • The “optimal” tax mix for New Zealand is 63% from direct taxation and 37% from indirect taxation. • Tax rates and government expenditure should be reduced to achieve those optimal ratios. Consequently, it would be inappropriate to use the estimated “growth maximising” tax burden and tax mix as targets for tax policy purposes. This is best illustrated by tracing through the implications of pursuing those targets. 15 Caragata, P. (1997) The Economic and Compliance Consequences of Taxation: A Report on the Health of the Tax System in New Zealand , draft paper presented to the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, p.142. 16 Caragata, P. (1997) The Economic and Compliance Consequences of Taxation: A Report on the Health of the Tax System in New Zealand , draft paper presented to the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, p.142. Effect of Taxation on Economic Growth Page 35 For example, consider the implications of reducing the level of tax revenue to 25% of GDP. Figure 5 shows the breakdown of government expenditure for 1996-97. This chart offers broad indication of the expenditure cuts required to meet the growth-maximising level of taxation. To meet a tax/GDP ratio of 25%, for example, would require pruning Government expenditure by approximately 31%. This could be achieved by reducing expenditure in all areas in equal proportions (for example, spending on social security and welfare would fall to 26% of GDP and health down to 12% of GDP). However, the assumptions underlying the working papers imply that such an across-the-board approach reduction in the total level of government expenditure would not maximise economic growth. This is because the working papers, in effect, assume that there are no benefits from government expenditure that is aimed at objectives other than increasing the rate of growth of GDP (for example, expenditure that seeks to redistribute income such as social welfare expenditure). As a result, if the Government were to use the results of the working papers as targets for tax policy reform, it would have to: • eliminate all government expenditure that is primarily directed at redistributing income (for example, all social welfare expenditure); and • increase government spending on projects designed to improve the rate of economic growth.

Even if the Government’s sole objective was to maximise the rate of economic growth, however, the problems inherent in the “top-down” approach adopted by the working papers are such that the results of the research should be interpreted with considerable caution. As outlined earlier, the tax burden (as measured by the ratio of taxation revenue to GDP) is a very poor indicator of the structure of the tax system and the extent to which it distorts economic decisions. Many of the increases in the rate of economic growth that are due to relatively revenue-neutral packages of tax reform will not be attributed to changes in the tax system. In view of these problems, we do not consider that the working papers have established a clear relationship between the effects of taxation on economic growth in New Zealand. We share the OECD’s concerns about the merits of “top-down” research and agree with its view that current research on the relationship between taxation and economic growth is far from conclusive. It is clear from the literature review and from the additional results presented here that the effects of taxes on economic performance are ambiguous in some areas and unsettled and controversial in others. 17 However, we do consider that the overall level of taxation in New Zealand is high by historical standards and is likely to be imposing considerable costs on the community as a whole. 17 Leibfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A.

Page 37 Chapter 3 Size of the Hidden Economy Objective of the research The research commissioned by Inland Revenue from Professor David Giles represents the first major study of the size of the “hidden” economy in New Zealand, and its interaction with the tax system. The size of the tax base, its maintenance and the level of unreported income are fundamental issues for any tax authority. The “hidden”, or “underground”, economy is comprised of economic activity that is not captured by official GDP statistics. Such activities may range from small cash jobs to the large scale trade in illegal goods. In practice, the precise definition of the hidden economy tends to vary across empirical studies, depending upon the methodologies used and the purpose of the study. Approach adopted Some approaches to measuring the size of the hidden economy involve detailed surveys of tax compliance and are designed only to capture tax evasion. By contrast, the research commissioned by Inland Revenue sought to estimate the economy- wide level of unmeasured market activity. That measure does not include non-market activities such as housework. Since the level of unreported income is not recorded, is has to be indirectly observed. In order to overcome these difficulties, the research adopted a “latent variable” approach to estimating the size of the hidden economy. This approach enables a number of indicators of the size of the hidden economy (“indicator” variables), and causes of the hidden economy (“causal” variables), to be used to ultimately “explain” the size of the hidden economy (the “latent” variable). This approach produced an “index” of the size of the hidden economy which was then converted into dollar terms using an estimate of the long-run average size of the hidden economy. Since much underground activity is conducted in cash, the long run demand for currency was used to obtain an estimate of the long-run average size of the hidden economy expressed as a proportion of real. This long run ratio was then used in conjunction that index and actual GDP figures to derive estimates of the annual value of the hidden economy in each year. Estimates of the revenue loss from tax evasion on income from hidden economy activities were then obtained by applying estimated effective tax rates to the estimated size of the hidden economy. Chapter 3 Page 38 Key results Estimated size of the hidden economy The size of the hidden economy was estimated in proportion to GDP over the period 1968 to 1994. The estimated long-run average size of the hidden economy was 8.8% of GDP while in 1994 it was 11.3%. A casual examination of the time series reveals that the size of the hidden economy fluctuates over time about a rising trend, as shown in figure 6. The research established a positive correlation between the business cycle and the hidden economy, so it is not surprising that the hidden economy was large in 1994 when the business cycle was near its peak, as it was in 1987. F IGURE 6: H IDDEN E CONOMY AS % GDP SOURCE: Inland Revenue Department (NZ) There are no estimates of the size of the hidden economy or the level of tax evasion in New Zealand after 1994. A reliable estimate of the size of the hidden economy for the years after 1994 would entail re- estimating the model using the data for those years. Any attempts to estimate the size of the hidden economy after 1994 without re-estimating the model using the updated data require making an assumption as to the proportionate size of the hidden economy in those later years. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 1969197119731975197719791981198319851987198919911993 % GDP Size of the Hidden Economy Page 39 International comparisons New Zealand’s hidden economy is of an average size for most OECD countries, as illustrated by figure 7.

The Underground Economy: Minimising the Size of the Government, Department of Economics, University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C. The comparison in figure 7 shows New Zealand to have a hidden economy in the lower half of countries with similar economies. At the top end of the scale is Italy, with a hidden economy of approximately 27% of GDP in 1994, compared to Switzerland, with 6% of GDP. Figure 7 also shows the hidden economy to be growing in most OECD countries. Comparisons between studies and across countries, however, must be treated with some caution. There is a wide variation in the estimated size of the hidden economy which depends upon the country concerned, the availability of data and the method employed in estimating it. Park (1979) and Feige (1982), for example, estimated the size of the hidden economy in the US at 4% and 33% of GDP respectively for 1978. 18 These results show, as noted by Professor Giles in his paper, that not only does the evidence “suggest variation over time and across countries for the relative size of the hidden economy, but it is also rather imprecise”. 19 18 Feige, E.

With respect to the level of taxation (as measured by the tax/GDP ratio), the research found that: • A decrease in the tax/GDP ratio reduces the hidden economy ratio. 20 • A one percentage point reduction in the tax/GDP ratio causes a 0.2 percentage point fall in the hidden economy for recent levels of tax/GDP. 21 • Below a tax/GDP ratio of 21%, the hidden economy decreases at a slower rate. 22 • If the Government were to reduce tax rates to zero, the hidden economy would still remain at 4%-4.5% of GDP. 23 In other words, substantial tax revenue must be sacrificed for only marginal gains arising from less unreported income. These results point to some interesting conclusions. First, on its own, reducing the tax/GDP ratio is not a particularly effective means of reducing the size of the hidden economy. This means that, for GDP of $100 billion and a tax/GDP ratio of 34%, reducing the tax/GDP ratio to 33% results in a loss of $1 billion in tax revenue for a gain in $200 million from a smaller hidden economy, of which only some is taxed. Second, getting rid of taxation does not get rid of the hidden economy. This implies that a significant proportion of income is unreported for reasons other than taxation, such as criminal activity or avoiding other forms of government regulation. The research concludes that most of the tax evasion over and above this criminal component is due to individuals, small businesses and the self-employed. While anecdotal evidence from audit experience suggests this is true, the research provides weak empirical evidence to support this conclusion. The research shows that modifying the tax mix combined with reductions in the tax/GDP ratio will reduce the importance of the hidden economy. But to achieve large reductions in it, very large changes are required in both level and mix of taxation. The research exploring the effect of changes in the tax mix on the size of the hidden economy concluded the following: • An increase in the share of indirect taxes to direct taxes reduces the hidden economy. 24 20 Giles, D.

Size of the Hidden Economy Page 41 • Reducing the tax/GDP ratio is more effective at decreasing the size of the hidden economy than changing the tax mix. 25 • GST reduced the relative size of the hidden economy by approximately one percentage point in each of the years up to 1994. Note that introducing GST also increased the tax/GDP ratio but changed the tax mix towards indirect taxation. There were thus two opposing influences on the hidden economy that came into effect. 26 This means that a substantial reversal of the tax mix is required to affect the same reduction in the hidden economy/GDP ratio as would be realised by moderate reductions in the tax/GDP ratio. For example, if the share of personal and indirect taxation as a proportion of total tax revenue were interchanged in 1994, the hidden economy would have fallen from 11.3% to 10% of GDP. If the tax/GDP ratio had then been cut by 40% in addition to this, the hidden economy would have fallen further to 7.3% of GDP. These major policy changes, therefore, yield only a four percentage point reduction in the level of unreported income. 27 The introduction of GST in 1986, however, had a noticeable impact on the hidden economy. Evidently, more than doubling the proportion of tax revenue collected through indirect taxation had a stronger effect than the increase in the total level of taxation. 28 Inland Revenue comment Professor Giles’ research constitutes the first serious attempt to estimate the size of the hidden economy in New Zealand. Size of the hidden economy and the level of tax evasion Although the estimated size of the hidden economy in New Zealand is well below the European Union average, this is not a reason to be complacent. The overall size of the hidden economy is still significant, and Inland Revenue is committed to reducing that level. It is reassuring, however, to learn that New Zealand does not suffer from an unusually high level of unreported income, and that much of this activity would occur regardless of the level or rate of taxation. 25 Giles, D.

Chapter 3 Page 42 Relationship between taxation and the size of the hidden economy Both the level of tax to GDP and the tax mix were found to have an influence on the size of the hidden economy, but not sufficiently to advocate their use in deterring tax evasion. This is particularly so given the revenue loss associated with the necessary reductions in taxation required to have any significant impact on unreported income. Although the research reveals that the individual effects of changing the tax mix and lowering the level of taxation are less effective than jointly introducing these policies, very large modifications to the tax system would be required to achieve a significant reduction in tax evasion. The relationship between taxation and the size of the hidden economy does pose an interesting dilemma for policy makers. To the extent that it is possible and desirable for the Government to do so, lowering the tax/GDP ratio may have two offsetting effects on the hidden economy. In itself, the research shows that such a policy would decrease tax evasion. However, because tax evasion and economic growth are positively correlated, it would also encourage tax evasion. The net effect remains ambiguous. This adds to the recommendation that addressing tax evasion through the level and mix of taxation is not appropriate. Finally, there are many other influences on the size of the hidden economy that proved significant in the research. Aside from the rate of economic growth, unemployment, inflation and government regulation were found to be significant contributors to the size of the hidden economy. It is important to note that reducing tax rates, and broadening the tax base produce numerous benefits in addition to reducing the size of the hidden economy. These include improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. As a result, it is better to view reductions in the size of the hidden economy as being one of the many potential benefits from tax reductions, rather than the main reason for wanting to cut taxes. Inland Revenue’s initiatives to address tax avoidance and evasion The recent report by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance reviewed Inland Revenue’s approach to tax evasion. 29 While supporting its current initiatives, the committee also provided some recommendations for additional measures to tackle non- compliance. What follows is a review of Inland Revenue’s current initiatives to reduce tax evasion, as well as the committee’s recommendations of further action. 29 Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) Tax Compliance , Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue. Size of the Hidden Economy Page 43 Since 1984, successive governments have introduced a range of initiatives that have reduced the scope for tax evasion in New Zealand. For example, reductions in the rates of income tax, in combination with the introduction of GST, significantly reduced both the incentive and opportunities for many taxpayers to evade tax. In particular, these changes discouraged the willingness of businesses registered for GST purposes to pay cash to suppliers of their inputs, as this would result in the loss of their input tax credits. The broadening of the tax base, and reduction in tax rates, also enabled a significant extension of withholding tax. This extension included the introduction of the dividend imputation rules, and the subsequent introduction of a resident withholding tax on interest and dividend income. These measures significantly reduced the scope for individuals to evade tax on their interest and dividend income. More recently, Inland Revenue has been seeking to encourage compliance by simplifying the tax system. This process involves a range of activities including: • The implementation of phase 1 of the tax simplification project. This project improved the accuracy of the resident withholding tax system in order to reduce the number of taxpayers required to file tax returns. • The beginning of phase 2 of the project, which is directed at reducing compliance costs for businesses, especially small businesses. • The rewriting of the Income Tax Act to improve the ability of taxpayers to determine, calculate and satisfy their income tax obligations. • The introduction of a system of binding rulings to help taxpayers determine how the tax system applies in particular circumstances. • The planned introduction of legislation to codify the practice of self-assessment. In addition, Inland Revenue has been pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at discouraging non-compliance. These initiatives include: • Introducing more effective penalty provisions. • Making more effective use of information provided through the binding rulings system to identify potential threats to the tax base. • Implementing legislation to ensure that stolen money is taxable. • Implementing a wide range of compliance improvement initiatives. The department’s Compliance Improvement Strategy is designed to identify key risks and compliance improvement opportunities and to maximise net revenue over time. The factors considered in the assessment of risk include the revenue at risk, the number of taxpayers involved, the opportunity for non-compliance, and the likelihood of the risk continuing. Chapter 3 Page 44 As part of the priorities under the Compliance Improvement Strategy, Inland Revenue has planned the following initiatives. • Investigate improving society’s attitudes toward tax compliance by promoting to the community the consequences to the evader and to society generally of people cheating on their tax obligations. • Improving Inland Revenue presence by, for example, co-locating staff with other agencies and enabling staff to work from home in areas where there is no office presence by the department. • Improving detection capability and investigating the effectiveness of conducting random audits. • Utilising intelligence collected from the several customer segments of the department. • Conducting research into the compliance of immigrants who have English as their second language by testing the extent to which their businesses are included in the tax system. • Improving staff capability by training new staff and retaining those audit staff with existing experience and by being more competitive in the employment market for these skills. The audit selection process complements the Compliance Improvement Strategy by a continuous review of large corporations and by individually selecting taxpayers for audit. The selection criteria include abnormal financial ratios or trading results, prior audit results and selected industry audits based on risk. The Special Audit section of the department audits illegal activities (such as drug dealing, white-collar crime). The resources of Special Audit doubled in 1996 and is under review at present with a view to increasing it given the section’s heavy workload. As shown in table 1, Inland Revenue collects considerable revenue from its audit activities.

Size of the Hidden Economy Page 45 Recommendations by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance on reducing tax evasion In reviewing Inland Revenue’s measures to reduce tax evasion, the committee presented its own set of recommendations. Specifically, the committee recommended that Inland Revenue should: • adopt a goal of sustained accretion of improvements, that steadily whittle away at the amount of tax that is evaded and that enable the department to respond quickly to new business techniques or to new systems of concealment that offer opportunities for new methods of evasion; • not simply target audits based solely on the amount of potential tax evasion, but target many taxpayers evading small amounts of tax as a means of deterrence; • continually identify opportunities for evasion; • continually look for new opportunities for the efficient operation of withholding tax methodologies, whether of existing or new design; • develop a strong community awareness of the cost to the community of tax evasion in terms of facilities, benefits and opportunities forgone, and the increased cost of existing services and facilities; • review the law relating to non-cash transactions, and effectively communicate the law to those sectors of the community where non-cash transactions are prevalent. The committee’s recommendations are being worked through as part of Inland Revenue’s continuing revision of its approach to tax evasion. The recommendations relating to the operational and audit aspects of Inland Revenue reinforce its existing strategic direction. Essentially, the department must concentrate more resources into the area of evasion. Page 46 Chapter 4 Implications for Future Research Practical constraints on our ability to monitor the efficiency and equity of the tax system As noted in the Commissioner’s forward to the department’s second Health Report, Inland Revenue is committed to improving the quality of the purchase information available to the Minister and the department’s senior management. It sees the Health Report as playing a major role in that process: Inland Revenue is committed to improving the quality of the purchase information available to the Minister and the department’s senior management. The Health Report, along with the Compliance Improvement Strategy, forms a significant part of the basis for the priorities identified in the department’s purchase advice and proposed output mix for 1998/99. 30 At the same time, however, Inland Revenue recognises the practical constraints associated with monitoring the efficiency and equity of the tax system, and the implications those constraints have for the development of the Health Report. As noted by the Commissioner: ... the development of the Health Report as a long term project. The kind of information required to make assessments of the health of the tax administration is, in some cases, very difficult to collect. However, the quality of the information available will continue to improve over time, enabling the Health Report to more fully meet its purpose. Although I believe the second report represents significant progress towards achieving this purpose, I expect further progress to be made over the course of the next year. 31 Although it is highly desirable to monitor the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system, the experience of Inland Revenue suggests that there are numerous factors that constrain our ability to do so. In particular, research into the efficiency and equity of the tax system: • Requires large amounts of information that is often not available. In the absence of such information, numerous simplifying assumptions need to be made which may not be realistic. • Produces results that can be difficult to interpret. The need to make numerous simplifying assumptions can make it difficult to interpret the results of the analysis. In many instances it is necessary to qualify those results heavily in the light of the simplifying assumptions that have had to be made, and the methodologies adopted, to get around those information constraints. This severely limits the usefulness of those results for the purposes of tax policy development and tax administration. 30 Inland Revenue Department (1997) The Health Report , December. 31 Inland Revenue Department (1997) The Health Report , December. Implications for Future Research Page 47 • Consumes considerable resources. Research into the efficiency and equity of the tax system is typically complex, costly and takes considerable time to complete, given an adequate process of consultation. These practical constraints do not mean that we should not attempt to monitor changes in the efficiency and equity of the tax system. However, as discussed further below, they do suggest: • The need for caution when interpreting macro performance indicators of the costs of taxation and the size of the hidden economy. In particular, we should be careful not to place too much emphasis on those macro performance indicators in the tax policy development process. • The need for more practical research. Much of the “top-down” research undertaken to date on the effects of taxation on economic growth in New Zealand is of little practical use for the purposes of tax policy development and administration. As a result, the Policy Advice Division intends to discontinue that research and focus on other areas of the current research programme that are of greater practical use to tax policy development and administration. • The need to explore alternative methods of monitoring the progress that the Government’s tax policy work programme is making towards improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. Need for caution when interpreting and using macro performance indicators In view of the complexity of the tax system, and the numerous simplifying assumption that have to be made in order to develop indicators of the overall efficiency and equity of that system, considerable care needs to be exercised when interpreting changes in those indicators. Importance of underlying assumptions The temptation with indicators is to ignore all of the assumptions that have had to be made to derive those indicators, and to ascribe much greater accuracy and relevance to those indicators than is warranted. Indicators should be used to assist the policy development process, rather than become the entire focal point of that process. In particular, we need to avoid making the indicators the end objective, and forgetting about the real objectives. At the end of the day, tax policy formulation still involves a considerable amount of judgement, both on behalf of advisors and the Government. Indicators can assist in that process, but cannot replace it. Chapter 4 Page 48 Limitations of empirical analysis It is appealing to think that it might be possible to develop a model that would be capable of determining what rates of tax should apply in New Zealand, and what proportion of tax mix should be raised by direct, as opposed to indirect, taxes. In reality, however, empirical models are incapable of providing answers to these complex questions. The tax system, and the manner in which it affects the operation of the economy, is extremely difficult to model in a realistic manner. Inevitably, it is necessary to make numerous simplifying assumptions that abstract from reality in order to overcome data limitations and ensure the model can be solved. Tax policy design also involves some important and complex trade-offs that cannot, and should not, be made by an empirical model. For example, practical tax policy formulation inevitably involves trade-offs between the efficiency and equity of the tax system which can, and should, only be made by the Government. Tax policy development is not, and is unlikely ever to be, a science. It requires decisions to be made often in the presence of considerable uncertainty and incomplete information. Ultimately, tax policy formulation requires complex judgments to be made by both officials and the Government. While empirical analysis can assist the Government in making those decisions, it cannot, and should not, seek to make those judgements. Advantages of a “broad-base, low-rate” approach to tax reform Tax reform to date has been designed to deal with these severe information constraints. It has not involved the use of extensive empirical analysis to determine the “optimal” rates of tax to apply to different activities in order to minimise the costs of taxation. Rather, the approach has been to improve the overall efficiency of the tax system. This has not required detailed information on differences in effective marginal tax rates, and the manner in which taxpayers are responding to those different tax rates. This approach has been endorsed, for example, by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in its report Tax Compliance in reference to policy measures to reduce the level of tax evasion in New Zealand. 32 The committee noted, in particular, that the level of tax evasion would have been much higher than its current estimate had previous governments not decided to a broaden the tax base and lower tax rates. 32 Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) Tax Compliance, Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue. Implications for Future Research Page 49 Need for more practical research In view of the problems outlined in chapter 2, much of the “top-down” research commissioned into the economic effects of taxation is of little use for the purposes of purposes of tax policy development and administration, or for inclusion in the department’s Health Report. As a result, the department’s Policy Advice Division intends to discontinue that research and focus on other areas of the current research programme that are of greater practical use to tax policy development and administration. Current research programme It is important to note that the research commissioned by Inland Revenue that is the subject of this report is not the only research currently being conducted by officials into the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Rather, it is only a small part of an extensive programme of research being undertaken by in support of the Government’s tax policy work programme, and in the course of administering the tax system. In effect, the tax policy work programme involves two main categories of research: • research directed at improving our understanding of the overall performance of the tax system, and the progress that is being made towards a better tax system (including research into the costs of taxation, as well as overall compliance with the tax system); and • detailed research aimed at identifying problems with the current tax system, and possible options for reform (including changes to the administration of the tax system). The first category of research includes the work commissioned by Inland Revenue that is the subject of this report. That research is directed at improving our understanding of the overall performance of the tax system, and the progress that is being made towards a better tax system. Other research in this first category includes: • The project being carried out by Professor Erwin Diewert and Dr Denis Lawrence for the Treasury. These consultants undertook the first major study of the deadweight costs of taxation in New Zealand for the Business Roundtable in 1994. Their first study, however, looked only at the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of labour income and consumption. Their current study extends their original analysis to include an estimation of the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of income from capital. Chapter 4 Page 50 • The joint work being undertaken by officials and the Investment Savings and Insurance Association (ISI) on savings issues. This involves research into the factors influencing the quality of investment and savings decisions in New Zealand, and the role of housing as a vehicle for retirement savings. Institutional structures, such as differences in the tax treatment across different types of investment, have the potential to reduce the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system by distorting savings and investment decisions. The second, and by far the largest, category of research into the efficiency and equity of the tax system involves a wide range of projects aimed at reducing the overall costs of taxation, and improving compliance with the tax system including: • The base maintenance work programme. In the course of developing and continually updating the base maintenance work programme, the Policy Advice Division closely monitors the nature and extent of tax avoidance using information sent to us from other areas of the department (such as the Corporates unit and the Rulings and Adjudication unit). This allows us to identify different types of tax avoidance activity, and assess their relative importance both from the point of view of overall economic efficiency, and potential revenue loss. This helps us prioritise the order in which these issues should be addressed. • Post-implementation reviews of specific tax legislation, including that relating to depreciation, accruals, GST, and the trading stock rules. These reviews all involve an assessment of the extent to which these regimes impose deadweight costs on the community, and provide avenues for tax avoidance, and the manner in which they can be reformed in order to reduce those costs. • The tax simplification project involves a detailed assessment of the extent to which the tax system is being administered in a manner that minimises the deadweight costs (particularly compliance costs) associated with raising tax revenue. Many of Inland Revenue’s administrative activities undertaken by other areas of the department also involve monitoring and, where possible, improving the efficiency and equity of various aspects of the tax system. Examples include: • Inland Revenue’s audit activities. In effect, this involves surveys of the extent of non-compliance with the tax system (monitoring the extent of tax evasion) and the application of penalties for non-compliance. • The provision of taxpayer services to help taxpayers comply with their legal obligations. • The binding rulings system, which once again seeks to help identify and clarify legal ambiguities, thereby reducing compliance costs, reducing uncertainty concerning the tax treatment of certain transactions, and improving the overall efficiency of the tax system. Implications for Future Research Page 51 Direction of future research Over the next twelve months, the Policy Advice Division intends to focus its research on those areas of the Government’s tax policy work programme that have been accorded the highest priority. This includes further research aimed at: • Identifying those areas of the tax base that are being eroded by tax planning activities and developing possible solutions to those problems. Such tax base erosion reduces the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system by encouraging inefficient patterns of consumption, production and resource use, as well as a less equitable distribution of income. The recent discussion document on the post- implementation review of GST identified a number of tax planning activities that are eroding the consumption tax base, and proposed solutions to these problems. Other base maintenance initiatives will be proposed for inclusion in future tax bills. • Simplifying the tax system for businesses, particularly small businesses. Unnecessary complexity in the tax system also reduces its overall efficiency and equity by increasing both compliance and administrative costs. Phase 1 of Inland Revenue’s tax simplification project has resulted in significant reductions in the number of individuals required to file tax returns, thereby improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system by reducing compliance costs. Phase 2 of the project will focus on identifying aspects of the tax system applying to businesses, particularly small businesses, which would benefit from simplification. In the medium term, we also intend to explore the possibility of updating the research into the size of the hidden economy, and the overall level of tax evasion. While it is not feasible to update that data on an annual basis, it may be possible to provide an update on a less frequent basis, say every three years. As noted above, we have also decided to discontinue “top-down” research into the effects of taxation on economic growth. We share the concerns expressed by the OECD about “top- down” research into the effects of taxation and economic growth, and agree that such research needs to be supplemented with further “bottom-up” research. The “top-down” approach has several shortcomings as a reliable basis for the assessment of tax effects on the economy. The analysis in the paper suggests that it is necessary to supplement it with a “bottom-up” approach which examines the various channels through which taxation affects economic growth, in particular via distortions in saving, physical and human capital formation and labour supply. Thus, in addition to the literature survey, the tax effects on economic growth were simulated by applying econometric models which incorporate these channels of transmission. While the results are model-dependent, one of the endogenous growth models finds that a cut in the tax-to-GDP ratio by 10 percentage points of GDP (accompanied by a deficit-neutral cut in transfers) may increase annual growth by 1/2 to 1 percentage points (a somewhat larger effect than that found by the “top- down” approach). 33 33 Leibfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A. (1997) Taxation and Economic Performance Economics Department Working Paper No.176, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris, p.10. Chapter 4 Page 52 As a result, we will be continuing to assist the Treasury with the research currently being undertaken by Professor Erwin Diewert and Dr Denis Lawrence into the deadweight costs arising from the taxation of income from capital. At the same time, however, we agree with the OECD that caution needs to be exercised when interpreting the results of such “bottom-up” models since they inevitably do not capture all of the complexities of the actual tax system and the economy in which it operates. As such simulation models do not capture the complex structural features and linkages of real world economies, these results must be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, they indicate that there may be some room for tax policy to improve economic performance. 34 We also intend to continue our involvement in the joint work on savings issues with the ISI. As explained further below, we also intend to pursue other, more practical ways of monitoring the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Need to explore alternative ways of monitoring the efficiency and equity of the tax system In view of the difficulties associated with developing annual indicators of the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system, Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division has been considering alternative ways of providing key decision makers with an overview of the tax system, and the progress that is being made to improve that system. Complexity of the tax reform process The continuing process of tax reform in New Zealand is extensive and complex. Each year, a large number of detailed proposals for tax reform are proposed and implemented. In the course of working through those detailed proposals for tax reform proposals, it is relatively easy to lose sight of the current tax system, the overall tax policy objectives, and the progress that is made each year towards the implementation of that work programme. In particular, it is often difficult to see how the various proposals for tax reform fit together to form a consistent approach to tax reform. Often the detailed reforms can appear to be piecemeal, even though they are part of a consistent strategy for improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. 34 Leibfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A. (1997) Taxation and Economic Performance Economics Department Working Paper No.176, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris, p.11. Implications for Future Research Page 53 Regular tax policy communication The process of tax reform could be improved by raising the overall level of public understanding of the Government’s tax policy work programme, and the progress that is made each year towards implementing it. To this end, the Policy Advice Division intends to provide up-to-date information on the process of tax reform on our tax policy web site and will update that information at least once a year. This will provide both Ministers and other interested parties with an overview of New Zealand’s tax system, and a qualitative discussion of the progress made over the previous year to improving that system. In particular, we intend to outline the Government’s revenue strategy, the announced tax policy work programme, and progress towards implementing that work programme. Page 54 Appendix 1 Key Methodological Concerns Introduction The research into the economic effects of taxation by Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division comprises 38 working papers. The papers cover a wide range of research areas and vary significantly in their quality. The purpose of this appendix is to highlight some of the key methodological concerns regarding some, not all, of the working papers. This coverage is considered important to avoid taking some of the conclusions on these papers at face value. Some of the working papers were technically competent, but their conclusions not useful. Much of the sound work undertaken is not covered here for this reason. A comprehensive review of all the papers was undertaken by the Policy Advice Division, and this appendix draws upon some of its conclusions. Some of the criticisms are specific to individual working papers and should not be carried over to the wider papers in that research area. Other concerns encompass methodologies adopted by groups of papers and therefore apply to all the papers that have followed that particular methodology. The appendix is divided by area of research. Specifically, the areas of research discussed are: • taxation and economic growth; • effective tax rates (including data issues); • compliance; and • firms’ costs and taxes; A full list of all the working papers can be found in Appendix 5. The analysis of these areas of research concludes that there are some significant methodological problems with some of the papers serious enough to undermine their results. Taxation and economic growth This section highlights some important concerns with Professor Scully’s Working Paper No.14, Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand, referred to in chapter 3. The approach adopted by the research, on the relationship between taxation and economic growth, is discussed in some detail there. The following technical issues should be considered in addition to the problems discussed earlier. Appendix 1 Page 55 We retained Professor Phillips of Yale University and the Cowles Foundation for Research into Economics to comment generally on Working Paper No.14 as well as provide feedback on a specific technical disagreement that was raised at the time of the first draft of the paper in 1995. The disagreement continued until 1998. Our objection to the paper was modified, refined and extended while Professor Phillips was part of the way through his assessment. In the event, he reviewed both of our notes. These notes, as well as Professor Phillips’ entire report, are attached to the end of this appendix (see Appendices 2, 3 and 4). We explain the approach of Working Paper No.14 before summarising Professor Phillips’s critique. In a given year, GDP is assumed to be produced by the previous year’s government expenditure and lagged private sector output in a Cobb-Douglas production function. In the obvious notation, Y t = aG t-1 b \[(1- τ )Y t-1 \] c τ is the tax/GDP ratio so the square bracket is private sector output in the previous period. The government’s budget is assumed to be continuously balanced so government expenditure is replaced by tax revenue in the production function. The growth factor, 1+g, is set equal to the ratio of consecutive year’s output. The previous equation can then be shown to become: 1+g = Y t /Y t-1 = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-1 b+c-1 This expression is maximised with respect to τ to obtain the expression for the tax/GDP ratio which would maximise the GDP growth rate: τ \* =b/(b+c) Two real GDP series were used, one obtained from the GDP deflator and the other from the CPI. The coefficients were estimated and the constant returns to scale hypothesis could not be rejected, hence b+c=1. The effect of this is that the growth maximising tax/GDP ratio, τ \*, equals b and b had already been econometrically estimated. We reject the results in Working Paper 14. The practical reason is that the econometric methods are poor so the results cannot be relied upon. The econometric deficiencies are set out by Professor Phillips in Appendix 4 and are informally summarised below. In addition to the specific econometric objections, there are other reasons for scepticism about the work. The model is not a proper description of the New Zealand economy and it is internally contradictory. In general terms, the other reasons are: Appendix 1 Page 56 • The model does not recognise that market equilibrium or disequilibrium are major issues in macroeconomic modelling that have to be confronted. • The business cycle, foreign shocks, regulatory, speculative or inflationary periods and growth theory are all omitted from the model. • The tax/GDP ratio is not a direct policy variable. • The distributional consequences of taxation and government expenditure are central aspects of the role of government which are side-stepped in the formal model. On the econometric issues, Professor Phillips has informed us that Working Paper 14, in brief: • treats the tax/GDP ratio as exogenous when it is an endogenous variable; • should have distributed the effects of tax rates over a number of years because a nine-year moving average of GDP growth rates was used; • inadequately treats the effects of taxation on government expenditures on education and health; • cannot claim to be a reduced form estimate of the effects of otherwise omitted variables because the tax/GDP ratio should be endogenous; • requires a more sophisticated structural model to incorporate the foregoing effects; • does not provide reliability measures for to 20% figure (is unreliable, as another paper shows); • requires a sensitivity analysis of the effects of using the nine-year moving average of GDP rates; • is heavily dependent of the effects of the 1920s and 1930s; • should be extended to more recent years past 1994. On the points raised in our two notes, Professor Phillips: • considers that Working Paper 14 applies only to an economy with an unchanging growth rate over time and constant returns to scale, as Inland Revenue claimed; • notes, on the presence or otherwise of constant returns to scale in the New Zealand economy, that robust tests should have been conducted; • concurs that Inland Revenue showed that there are some technical deficiencies in the development of the model, although the econometric considerations noted the previous set of bullet points are considered to be much more important; and • advises that a disequilibrium growth model would be superior to Professor Scully’s model, about which Professor Phillips concurs with the drift of Inland Revenue’s comments. The two notes and Professor Phillips’s full report are contained in Appendices 2, 3 and 4. Appendix 1 Page 57 Effective Tax Rates What is an effective tax rate? When people refer to rates of tax, they are usually referring to the statutory marginal tax rates as set out in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. For example, the statutory marginal tax rate applying to companies is 33%. This means that tax is imposed at a rate of 33% on every additional dollar of net taxable income earned by a company. In practice, however, statutory marginal tax rates provide a somewhat misleading indication of: • the amount of tax actually paid by each company on the total net amount of economic income derived from their activities; and • the amount of tax actually paid by a taxpayer on an extra dollar of income from a particular economic activity. For example, consider the 33% statutory marginal tax rate applying to companies. At first sight, it would appear that all companies pay the same rate of tax on their net income. On closer inspection, however, it is clear that this is not the case. Indeed, there are considerable differences in the actual rates of tax that apply to companies engaging in different types of economic activity. Companies deriving the same amount of economic income can be paying different amounts of income tax. Similarly, an additional dollar of income from one economic activity can be taxed at a different rate than an additional dollar of income from another activity. These differences in actual tax rates arise because: • Not all forms of economic income and expenditure are respectively assessable and deductible for tax purposes (for example, gains made on the sale of shares that are not purchased with the intent of resale). • Different “timing” rules apply to the recognition of different forms of income and expenditure. For example, some forms of income and expenditure are recognised for tax purposes as they accrue, whereas other forms of income and expenditure are not recognised until the payments are actually made. “Effective tax rates” are intended to provide a more accurate indication of the actual (or “effective”) rates of tax being paid by taxpayers, and the actual rates of tax applying to an additional dollar of income from a particular economic activity. For example, average effective tax rates provide an indication of the amount of tax actually being paid by a particular taxpayer on total net economic income. As a result, average effective tax rates can be useful when considering issues such as how equitable the tax system is, and whether individual taxpayers are paying their “fair share” of tax. Appendix 1 Page 58 By contrast, effective marginal tax rates provide an indication of the actual rate of tax applying to an additional dollar of revenue from a particular economic activity. As such, effective marginal tax rates can be useful for the purposes of determining the efficiency of the tax system – that is, the extent to which the tax system is capable of raising revenue without distorting decisions of consumers, and producers. Objectives of the research and approach adopted A number of the working papers commissioned by Inland Revenue sought to study differences in the tax burdens borne by companies, and whether those tax burdens were in accordance with the ability to pay. In order to resolve these issues, the research involved the calculation of average effective tax rates for companies. 35 The estimated average effective tax rates were then used to estimate econometrically the relationship between company performance and the tax burden. As discussed below, Inland Revenue does not accept the results of the research since: • The methods used to calculate average effective tax rates do not result in accurate estimates of the actual tax burdens imposed on taxpayers. • The data used in the research are not appropriate for the purposes of calculating average effective tax rates. These problems are discussed further below. Problems with the methods used to calculate average effective tax rates As noted above, the most appropriate concept of effective tax rates to use for this purpose is the average effective tax rate. The average effective rate of tax paid by a particular taxpayer is equal to the total amount of tax actually paid expressed as a proportion of the total economic income the taxpayer derives from all activities. In other words, the average effective tax rate indicates the amount of tax actually paid “averaged” over the total net income of the taxpayer. By contrast, the research involved the calculation of a number of ratios which were described in the working papers as “effective tax rates” including: • current tax paid/accounting profit; • current tax paid/total corporate costs; • current tax paid/total corporate revenue; and • current tax paid/total assets. 35 Working Papers No.2(Rev), No.6, No.10, and No.11 explicitly calculated effective tax rates, while Working Paper No.1 considered the appropriateness of using financial reporting data for calculating effective rates Appendix 1 Page 59 Of these, only the first ratio is a potential indicator of the average effective tax rate imposed on a company. The other ratios appear to have been included in view of concerns that accounting profits are “to some extent, at choice, partly by virtue of management decisions to modify timing of profits and because there is, to a degree, some freedom in accounting conventions across companies”. 36 However, this argument ignores the fact that many of the problems associated with obtaining consistent measures of accounting profit actually stem from differences in the methods used to measure corporate revenue, corporate costs, and the value of company assets. For example, Sawyer (1994) 37 outlined the reasons for the significant differences across companies in the accounting practices used to compile their annual public accounts. It also ignores the fact that these other ratios can vary considerable across firms for a variety of normal commercial reasons, including differences in the nature of the business in which the company engages, and the types of production technologies employed. This makes it extremely difficult to compare these ratios across companies. For example, high value-adding companies will tend to exhibit lower ratios of current tax paid to total corporate revenue than high turnover, low value adding companies. As a result, a supermarket will inevitably have a much higher ratio of current tax paid to sales revenue than many other companies since it derives net income from earning small profit margins on a high volume of turnover. However, this does not necessarily mean that supermarkets have a high tax burden. Similarly, companies that use capital-intensive production technologies will tend to exhibit lower ratios of current tax paid to total assets than companies that use labour-intensive production technologies. However, this does not mean that companies that use labour-intensive production technologies face a higher tax burden than companies using more capital-intensive production technologies. Since many of the indicators used in the research do not provide an accurate indication of the tax burden facing companies, this raises the question as to what the results of the research really show. Working Paper No. 11, The Determinants of Effective Tax Rates , reconciles the reported profits of a sample of firms with their taxable income. The paper shows the difference between the statutory and effective tax rate to be composed of timing and permanent differences between accounting and tax policy, as well as other specific tax policy elements such as losses carried forward. 36 McCann, E., Small, J. & Caragata, P. (1995) Effective Tax Rates for Corporations: A New Econometric Approach to Assessing Their Tax Payment Behaviour , Working Paper No.2, Inland Revenue (December) (p1). 37 Sawyer, A. (1994) An Analysis of the “Tax Gap” of Listed Public Companies in New Zealand: 1984-1993 Consultative Report for the New Zealand Treasury. Appendix 1 Page 60 Problems with the data used to calculate average effective tax rates The New Zealand Corporate Database (NZCDB) was used to estimate the effective tax rates of companies and their relationship with the economic efficiency in a number of the working papers. The NZCDB is a sample of data collected from the financial reports of approximately 800 companies over the period 1982-94. The data had been collected directly from the financial reports submitted by firms held at the Company Offices around New Zealand. The data were specifically collected for the study of “ETRs, debt/equity ratios and other financial indicators and \[they\] must also reflect the true measurement of the variables that are applied in the calculation of those ratios”. 38 Working Paper No.1, Financial Ratios and Tax Policy Development: Investigating Accuracy Issues of the New Zealand Corporate Database , examined the problems associated with using financial data for this purpose. It clearly demonstrates that the NZCDB is inappropriate for analysing effective tax rates, despite the concluding chapter in that paper stating otherwise. The principal reasons that financial data were problematic for the calculation of effective tax rates are summarised below. Accounting definition of tax paid Tax data recorded in financial statements and the actual tax paid as recorded by Inland Revenue records differ markedly. The reporting entry adopted in the working papers is current tax paid, thus omitting the deferred component of the tax figure. This figure is expected to differ from the Inland Revenue tax calculations because in calculating the income upon which tax is levied: • Certain items are considered income in accounting terms, but not for tax purposes. • Certain items are recorded as expenses for accounting purposes but not for tax purposes. • There exist timing differences between tax and accounting policies. Working Paper No.1 and associated research comparing accounting and Inland Revenue tax data fails to demonstrate any reasonable consistency between the tax liability calculated by Inland Revenue and that shown in the financial report of the company. 39 Working Paper No.1, for example, showed that comparing the parent company tax figure as per Inland Revenue records with that of the consolidated financial report resulted in an average discrepancy of 65%. However, the Inland Revenue and financial report tax paid figures from 401 companies were aggregated and then compared for discrepancies, rather than examined on a company by company basis. Such a comparison did not demonstrate the accuracy of the reported tax figure of an individual firm. 38 Gillion, C., Aldersley, D. & Caragata, P (1995) Financial Ratios and Tax Policy Development: Investigating Accuracy Issues of the New Zealand Corporate Database, Working Paper No.1, Inland Revenue. 39 The “associated research” is summarised in a memorandum entitled “Comparing Tax Variables and Accounting Variables” from Shee Boon Law, Financial Analyst, to Dr Patrick Caragata dated 4 August 1997. Appendix 1 Page 61 The associated research investigated the difference between a range of tax and accounting variables, including current tax expense. The analysis of these variables relied on the differences between tax and accounting values as a percentage of total assets measured using accounting rules. That is: Difference = \[Financial Variable (tax) – Financial Variable (accounting)\] / Total Assets (accounting) The results showed generally small discrepancies between the tax and accounting variables with the exception of total assets that had a discrepancy of 36% across all firms. However, the main problem with this approach is that it uses a particularly large base for comparison – namely, the value of total assets. Any discrepancies will appear small when measured against such a large base. It might have been more appropriate to use the value of each respective variable as the basis for comparison. In addition, the use of an accounting variable as the basis for comparison also tends to bias the results obtained. The problems associated with using accounting data to calculate effective tax rates are not restricted to problems arising from the use of a tax figure in the numerator. The denominators themselves (accounting profit, sales, costs and assets) all suffer from inconsistencies in their estimation by each individual firm, depending upon the accounting conventions each one has adopted. An example of this is the accounting method for valuing a company’s assets. There is significant flexibility in the accounting regulations for companies to adopt quite different asset valuation methods. Little can be done about this, except recognise that such differences will implicitly flow though to effective tax rates adopting assets as a base. 40 Sample selection bias The NZCDB contained some 800 firms in for 1994 and fewer than 200 in 1982. This sample of firms was collected from those registered at the Companies Office and therefore was not a randomly selected. There exists a degree of sample selection bias in the sample because: • The sample was over-represented with respect to some sectors and under-represented by others. The manufacturing sector, for example, provided, on average, 50% of the sample over the 1982-94 period. 41 • Companies were included on the basis that they had available data for the 1982-94 period. In other words, only companies that had survived over the period were selected. 40 Gillion, C., Aldersley, D. & Caragata, P. (1995) Financial Ratios and Tax Policy Development: Investigating Accuracy Issues of the New Zealand Corporate Database Working Paper No.1, Inland Revenue, (June) (p.35-41). 41 The disaggregation of the sample into sectors was compared to the entreprise and activity units by industrial classification of Business Activity 1992-93 by Statistics New Zealand. Manufacturing only comprised of 10% of enterprises and activity according to that data. See Table 5.5 in Gillion, C., Aldersley, D. & Caragata, P. (1995) Financial Ratios and Tax Policy Development: Investigating Accuracy Issues of the New Zealand Corporate Database Working Paper No.1, Inland Revenue (June). Appendix 1 Page 62 Any extension of the conclusions reached from studies using the NZCDB to the corporate population should, therefore, be treated with considerable caution. In addition to Working Paper No.1, a consultative report prepared for the Treasury by Sawyer (1994) also undertook to verify and standardise the treatment of financial data for 40 companies over the 1985-92 period. 42 The study therefore investigated the degree to which financial data could be compared across companies and across years as a result of substantial differences in their accounting policies. Sawyer “standardised” the raw reported data to enable cross-company comparisons. This involved checking for simple coding errors, correcting for variances in the choice of disclosure items, readjustments to provide consistency both between companies and from year to year, with a standard classification and calculation procedure. Sawyer concluded that “inter-company distortions are not insubstantial and inconsistencies are present between various income years”. These conclusions applied to the Net Profit figures and the Income Tax Expense variables, which were key in the calculation of effective tax rates in the working papers. An example given by Sawyer was Fernz Corporation’s 1988 Net Profit Before Tax figure, which was $16.6 million but appeared as a loss of $(1.2) million after standardisation. 43 Compliance The research on tax compliance comprised three types of studies, all of which estimate some definition of compliance either as a function of the financial characteristics of the firm or through the measurement of effective tax rates. The types of studies are those that estimate: • the probability of a firm being compliant or non-compliant given its financial characteristics; 44 • the probability of a firm paying no tax; 45 • the deviation from a benchmark tax burden (as measured by some defined effective tax rate) by companies. 46 42 Sawyer, A.

Appendix 1 Page 63 The objective of the research on compliance was to identify firms that pay less tax than they might be expected to pay. The causes of less-than-expected tax may be the financial health of the company or tax planning, tax avoidance or evasion. This was an ambitious exercise, particularly for those studies that sought to estimate the extent to which firms over or under pay tax. Estimating the probability of compliance Working Paper No.28 used Inland Revenue’s audit outcomes to predict, in advance of a tax audit, the probability that an individual firm will be tax compliant, tax avoiding or tax evading. 47 The probability prior to a tax audit of a firm falling in one of the three audit outcomes, were an audit undertaken, depends on various financial variables available to Inland Revenue and on the firm’s industrial sector. Working Paper No.28 used a very large random sample of 51,000 observations drawn from Inland Revenue’s IR10 and taxpayer audit database (ORACLE). 48 The random sample was extremely important in evaluating this paper. That feature of the research substantially strengthens the results of the paper. It reduces, without eliminating, the adverse effects of random errors in the data. The random sampling of companies means that the effects of random understatements in some companies’ data will be offset by the overstatements in others’ data. Audits are conducted with different of degrees of intensity. Each classification of an audit outcome used in Working Paper No.28, such as “tax compliant” for example, could be the result of a limited perusal of a firm’s records, or it could be the outcome of a detailed examination of a firm’s affairs. The closer is the audit, the more reliable the classification will be in a particular case. Stringent audits can be expected to yield accurate classifications. Mild examinations are more likely to result in mis-classified outcomes than strict audits. A number of data quality issues arose from the use of IR10 and ORACLE data: • The sample of firms is drawn from the taxpayer audit data and therefore includes only firms that have, in the past, been audited. There will be some sample selection bias because of this. • The classification of firms as “avoiders” in the audit database is not based on any consistent scientific reasoning; it is simply an outcome of the judgement of the investigating officer. • Taxpayers may simultaneously be classified as “evaders” and “objectors” given those objections have yet to be settled. This raises the possibility of double counting between the two groups. 47 See Giles, D. (1997) Modelling the Tax Compliance/Non-compliance Profiles of Audited New Zealand Firms: Evidence From the ORACLE Database , Working Paper No.28, Inland Revenue, May. 48 See Giles, D. (1997) Modelling the Tax Compliance/Non-compliance Profiles of Audited New Zealand Firms: Evidence From the ORACLE Database , Working Paper No.28, Inland Revenue, May, p. 2. Appendix 1 Page 64 Legitimate concerns about the quality of the data should be kept in perspective and of themselves need not be over riding. The concerns are balanced by the sheer volume of the data and the methodology employed. The preliminary results of the paper are that the revenue/assets ratio, sector, year, revenue and tax/assets are useful predictors of the probabilities of compliance, avoidance and evasion. Of particular interest is the result that the greater is a firm’s revenue the greater is the probability that it will be tax compliant, other things equal. 49 If the difficulties concerning the data can be overcome and the method re-worked, this model of compliance might provide a useful addition to the current audit selection procedures in place. Estimating the probability of being a zero or positive taxpayer Working Papers No.15 and No.26 examine the probability of a firm not paying any tax and the factors that affect this probability. The papers differ slightly in their approach. Working Paper No.15 considers the probability of a firm moving to a position of paying no tax to one of paying a positive amount of tax given the length of time it has paid no tax. Weights are allocated to a selection of financial variables (assets, costs, revenue and profits), so we know the leverage each has on the probability of moving to a positive tax position. The paper uses the NZ Corporate Database, whose problems have been discussed in some detail previously. Although the statistical technique employed is of good quality, the concept of splitting taxpayers into “zero” and “positive” taxpayers must be questioned. It is not clear why the zero or positive split is more meaningful than, say, the split above or below the $2 million tax payment line. The purpose of the paper was to “establish the range and boundaries of normal commercial behaviour with respect to tax payment practice”. 50 The concept of normal commercial behaviour is never properly defined in the study and it is hard to see how such behaviour could be defined by distinguishing between positive and zero taxpaying firms. Working Paper No.26 separates companies into two groups: those whose median tax payments were zero and those whose median tax payments were positive over the 1991-95 period. This “tax” or “no-tax” status was thought to be caused by three sets of relationships: (i) activity ratios (sales/net assets), sales and residence status; (ii) interest costs, depreciation and losses carried forward; (iii) the combined variables in (i) and (ii). As with Working Paper No.15, there seems little reasoning behind the division of taxpayers into positive and zero taxpaying categories. Further, the study uses only five years of tax data (1991-95), so the probability of the median tax payment being zero over this period requires only three years of losses. Many companies would be expected to find themselves in a loss position for tax purposes following the recession period of the earlier 1990s. Therefore defining 49 See Giles, D. (1997) Modelling the Tax Compliance/Non-compliance Profiles of Audited New Zealand Firms: Evidence From the ORACLE Database , Working Paper No.28, Inland Revenue, May, (conclusions a-f, p.p. 22-24). 50 Rogers, A. (1995) Effective Tax Rates: Zero Payments and the Migration of Firms Across Tax Bands , Working Paper No.15, Inland Revenue, December, p 2. Appendix 1 Page 65 “high-risk” companies as those whose median tax payment is zero over this period seems inappropriate. 51 Unfortunately, the paper contains a fundamental flaw that undermines the results. The tax or no-tax status was separately related to three sets of variables. 52 This is a non sequitur. We cannot simultaneously have: y = f(x) and y = g(z) and y = h(x,z) All we can have is: y = h(x,z) The paper estimates the three separate equations. It is h(x,z) that is relevant and the paper provides it. f(x) and g(z) are regressed and statistically analysed. The paper does not say which equations the graphs and econometric results are based on. They should be based on h(x,z). Estimating the deviation from a benchmark effective tax rate The final set of research on compliance estimated the deviation from a benchmark tax burden (as measured by a defined effective tax rate) by companies. The two papers in this section have very different objectives. The first, Working Paper 27, is a regression of tax paid on the probability of financial distress along with other financial variables. 53 Estimated coefficients for each of the financial variables are obtained. Those coefficients can then be applied to the financial variables for a particular firm to predict the tax it is expected to pay. A firm whose tax deviates from this estimate would be scrutinised by a tax audit. The methodology for estimating the deviation from the mean tax/asset ratio is used. The results, however, rest on some fundamental assumptions that are themselves difficult to accept: • The model assumes that the tax/asset ratio is a good proxy for the expected tax burden of the firm. The research demonstrated that total assets measured for tax purposes differed significantly from that measured for accounting purposes. 54 Assets are not a reliable denominator for calculating effective tax rates using financial reporting data and yield little useful information regarding a company’s tax burden. 51 Heiler, A. (1997) Establishing the Risk Profiles of Corporate Tax Behaviour: FIRST System Taxpayer Database , Working Paper No.26, Inland Revenue, April, p4. 52 Rogers, A. (1995) Effective Tax Rates: Zero Payments and the Migration of Firms Across Tax Bands , Working Paper No.15, Inland Revenue, December, p 8. 53 Law, S.B. (1997) Risk Profiling of Corporate Taxpayers: New Zealand Corporate Database , Working Paper No.27, Inland Revenue, May. 54 The research was a memorandum titled “Comparing Tax Variables and Accounting Variables” from Shee Boon Law, Financial Analyst, to Dr Patrick Caragata dated 4 August 1997. Appendix 1 Page 66 • A selection of variables was used to estimate the predicted or “normal” tax/asset ratio (depreciation, deferred tax, net interest and a group of financial distress variables) for each firm. Any deviations from the predicted tax/asset ratio were attributed to “strategic” behaviour and pointed to a “high-risk” taxpayer. In reality, the deviation from the prediction is the error term in the regression. This error is required to be random by the definition of the least squares’ estimator. It cannot be systematic, so the deviation cannot be classified as strategic tax evasion. 55 Although the methodology is reliable, there remain significant problems with the study. The methodology used in the final study, Working Paper No.37, has fundamental problems. The paper also presents misleading conclusions. 56 It attempts to estimate the aggregate level of corporate tax avoidance for New Zealand for the period 1969-94. The method of calculating company tax avoidance is to take the highest company tax/company sales ratio in the years 1968-1994 (which was 1968) and to subtract each year’s tax/sales fraction from it. The difference in the ratios is then applied to each year’s aggregate company sales to give the avoided tax. The paper uses gross company sales, 1992-1994, and the annual change in gross output for all New Zealand firms, to construct a series for company sales, by extrapolating annually back to 1969. 57 This long extrapolation from so few points is unjustifiable, particularly since the arithmetic extrapolation is highly non-linear. 58 The study uses 1969 as the “benchmark for corporate taxpaying behaviour”, when tax avoidance was claimed to be at its lowest. 59 The reasons given for choosing 1969 are that “there was less incentive and opportunity to avoid tax due to low inflation, a small tax/GDP ratio, protection of markets and heavy regulation of the NZ economy and its interactions with the rest of the world”. 60 There is no empirical evidence presented to justify 1969 being used for “identifying a best practice frontier” with respect to tax avoidance. This was also the year with the highest aggregate tax/sales ratio. The fallacy here is that the companies’ best profit year, on which tax was paid, indicates they are avoiding. This is one of the key criticisms of using the tax/sales ratio generally as a measure of a firm’s tax burden. In view of the problems outlined above, we have serious reservations about the results obtained. 55 The author makes this point, see Law, S.B.

Appendix 1 Page 67 Conclusions The outcome of the research on compliance is varied. Although some of the studies adopted sophisticated statistical techniques that were well applied, the other models were built on weak foundations. An example is the work on the positive and zero taxpayers. Establishing the reasons firms make losses (and carry them forward) reveals less about their taxpaying behaviour than it does about their performance as a company. In this sense, much of the research was misdirected. Working Paper No.28 provides a useful approach to estimating the probability of compliance by firms. The only serious obstacle to its application is the availability of reliable data. The paper shows that it is possible to use individual tax return information to calculate the probabilities that a firm is a tax evader, a tax avoider or is tax compliant. The statistical advantages of the variation of firms and the reductions in standard deviations following from the large sample enhance the quality of the results. Working Papers No.15, No.26, and No.27 all suffer from conceptual flaws, if not from data problems. The study of taxpayers by positive and zero taxpaying groups has as much to do with the performance of individual firms and the wider economic conditions as it does the design of the tax system. No real policy proposals emerge from these papers. Working Paper No.37 has fundamental shortcomings in both its purpose and execution. Firms’ costs and taxes The purpose of the research on firms’ costs and taxation was to establish a relationship between a firm’s efficiency and its tax burden. The general hypothesis is that more efficient firms pay less tax. As outlined below, we have a number of concerns about the methodology employed to test this hypothesis. Quartile analysis There are three working papers that wholly or partly apply an unorthodox method it calls quartile (sometimes “quartal”) analysis. 61 Quartiles are a standard way of grouping sets of data used to indicate the range and skewness of their distributions. Conventionally they do little more than that. 61 See Caragata, P. (1996) The Impact of the Revenue and Profit Efficiency Performance of Firms on Taxation , Working Paper No.19, Inland Revenue, December, Table 1; Caragata, P. & Heiler, A. (1997) The Life-cycle Analysis of Corporate Taxpaying Behaviour: Implications of Integrating the Learning Curve and the Production Frontier , Working Paper No.36, March, Tables 1,3,4,5 and Caragata, P. & Heiler, A. (1997) The Tax and Labour Hiring Trade-off: A Study of the Non-durable Retail Sector in New Zealand , Working Paper No.34, Inland Revenue, March, p 13. Appendix 1 Page 68 The papers unsuccessfully attempt to put quartiles to a different use. Data are grouped into their quartiles for different years and the median 62 of each quartile is compared with the median of the same quartile year by year. Inferences are drawn from the behaviour of the medians of, say, the first quartile over time. Firms may be becoming more or less efficient, for example, 63 if the median of a quartile increases. The interpretations are questionable. To see this, suppose that some firms near the top of the first quartile raise their efficiency, exchanging places with those at the bottom of the second quartile, whose efficiency has also improved but insufficiently to preserve their rankings. Efficiency in the industry has clearly improved if other firms’ efficiencies are unchanged. However, the medians of each of the quartiles will be unaltered from one year to the next and it will be falsely concluded that efficiency is unchanged. A change in the number of firms in the industry usually changes the medians. The change in the medians then implies nothing about the efficiency of pre-existing firms, in that case. Firm numbers change in an industry through reclassification, the amalgamations of firms and the growth of an industry. Amalgamations occurring to obtain a modicum of market power reduce economic efficiency. The use made of the quartiles does not allow for the reshuffling of firms within a quartile in succeeding years. The conclusions of papers substantially relying on this self-styled quartile analysis must, therefore, be discarded. These problems raise doubts about the following conclusions emerging from the working papers: • New Zealand companies with higher activity ratios had higher probabilities of paying no tax than companies with lower activity ratios, when no such conclusion is possible from use made of quartiles. 64 • There is an inverse relation across countries between companies’ return on net assets and their effective tax rates. 65 • The tax system favours established firms and is biased against new firms. 66 One of the papers also contains unwarranted conclusions on revenue efficiency and effective tax rates in the electricity industry. 67 62 Working Paper No.19 uses medians within quartiles. Working Paper No.36 takes the fractional differences of the bounds of each quartile. 63 Working Paper No.34 defines stagnant, threshold, ascending and efficient firms by their quartals (sic) (paragraph 78, Tables 5.5 - 5.7). 64 Caragata, P.

(1997) The Life-cycle Analysis of Corporate Taxpaying Behaviour: Implications of Integrating the Learning Curve and the Production Frontier , Working Paper No.36, March, p 21-22. Appendix 1 Page 69 These criticisms arise from the weaknesses of quartile analysis. Learning curves and bulk line costing This method approaches the efficiency of firms by using their average costs. The average costs of different firms are ranked in ascending order and graphed, usually against cumulative industry output, though this is not always clear. Extensive informal argument ensues on managerial efficiency, X-inefficiency, learning, (average cost reduction) and technological change. We are particularly concerned about the graphing procedure. The initial ascending 68 ranking ensures that the curve will be positively sloped regardless of the shapes of firms’ average cost curves. The positive slope is consistent with firms having average cost curves of any shape, including U-shaped, because of the construction of the diagram. To illustrate this problem, suppose that each firm or plant has a continuously falling average cost curve. We select the output point for each firm and obtain its unit costs. All of those unit costs are ranked, from smallest average cost to largest, and graphed. 69 The graph can be nothing but positively sloped because of the ranking. Yet every firm had decreasing average costs. The graph conveys no information on the cost structures of firms. The same argument applies for firms with differing cost curves of a variety of shapes. As a result, little can be concluded from the cumulative average cost diagram. It contains little information on the nature of firms’ cost curves in an industry. Although the concept of unit cost is relatively straightforward for single product firms, it is much more complex in the case of multi-product firms. This is because the total cost of a firm producing two goods depends on the output level of each. Unit costs of the first good, therefore, vary with the output of the second. Little can be said about the efficiency of the first good by looking at its “average” cost. The notion of “ray average cost” was developed for this reason. In any event, if a cost criterion of efficiency for the single product firm is to be adopted, it is the marginal cost, not average cost, that should be applied. Working Papers No.7(rev) and No.19 are somewhat disorganised papers, over 200 pages in total, whose empirical work rests on the questionable graphical treatment of firms’ average cost curves described above. The working papers cover optimal cost structures, differentiated firms, unit cost analysis, learning curves and bulk line costing. Each concept returns to the problematic cumulative average cost diagram devoted to optimal cost structures. Duality methods and distance functions, incisive in these problems for multi-product firms, were not considered in those papers. All of the conclusions and assertions on learning curves and 68 Descending order in the case of learning curves to obtain a negative relation. 69 Unit costs are graphed against the cumulative fraction of the industry’s output or the industry’s total output in Working Paper No.19, Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and apparently Figures 6 and 7. Falling unit cost diagrams attributed to Wright in Working Paper No.7(rev) (for example, at paragraph 520 and elsewhere) are obtained by ranking plants’ unit costs in descending order. Working Paper No.7(rev) calls these learning curves (see paragraph 520 also). Appendix 1 Page 70 efficiency, based on unit cost analyses and dispersed through the papers, are highly questionable. As a result, we do not accept the results of Working Papers No.7 (rev) and No.19. The relationship between the activity ratio and the effective tax rate Working Paper No.36 is a preliminary examination of firms in the New Zealand electricity generation industry, 1989-1995. The industry became liable for tax in 1989. The study examines the relationship between the activity ratios (sales/net assets) and the effective tax rates (tax/sales) of electricity generating companies. A firm with a high sales/net asset ratio is interpreted as an efficient firm. Low tax/sales ratios are interpreted as tax-efficient firms. There are three main concerns with the results of this paper: • The tax/sales ratios lie between 1.2 and 7.2. In other words a firm pays 120% to 720% of its sales in tax, on average over the years. This is far too high to be correct. The best that can be hoped is that somehow a ratio has been inverted. Were that the case the conclusions would be reversed. • The conclusion that firms with high sales/net asset ratios will have low tax/sales effective tax rates (that firms more efficient at generating revenue are more efficient at minimising their tax burden) is redundant. Sales appear as the numerator in the activity ratio and in the denominator of the effective tax rate. A rise in sales will cause the activity ratio to rise and the effective tax rate to fall, all other things being equal. Hence the discovery of an inverse relationship between the ratios was almost inevitable. • The learning curve discussion seems closely related to declining average costs, discussed in the previous section, which need not be the result of learning; the spreading of overheads is sufficient. The essential idea of learning is absent – of incorporating the outputs of previous periods as a measure of firms’ expanding experience and learning how better to produce this period’s output. The inverse relation between the activity ratio and the effective tax rate is central to the paper. Consequently, we cannot validly conclude that: • “Taken together, both figures indicate that as firms become more proficient at generating revenue per unit of total assets, their effective tax rates will decline.” 70 • “This suggests that as firms learn to generate revenue more efficiently, they learn to minimise their tax burdens more efficiently”. 71 The paper contributes little to the understanding of firms’ efficiency and the relationship to their tax burdens. 70 Caragata, P. & Heiler, A.

Appendix 1 Page 71 Conclusions The aim of this technical appendix was to highlight some of the more important concerns regarding specific methodologies adopted by some of the working papers. A comprehensive review of all the research was performed, and the issues raised here were those that were considered important enough to bring to the reader’s attention. Much of the good work performed has not been commented here. In summary, the areas of research with significant problems were: • the relationship between taxation and economic growth (specifically Working Paper No.14); • the measurement of effective tax rates (both the quality of the data used and the unconventional bases were unreliable); • the measurement of compliance by corporate taxpayers; • the relationship between firms’ efficiency and their tax burden. The exception was Working Paper No.28, which, data issues aside, showed the potential to forecast compliant and non-compliant companies. Also, the estimation techniques used in calculating effective tax rates were innovative and promising, but unfortunately undermined by data and conceptual problems. From a policy perspective, there were no recommendations arising from the research covered here that would require amending our current work programme.

The production function is set out in equation (1) of Working Paper No.14. It is: Y t = aG b t-1 \[(1- τ )Y t-1 \] c (1) Y t , G t and τ are respectively GDP, Government expenditure and the aggregate tax rate all at the variable time t.Equation (2) of Working Paper No.14 defines the growth rate, g t : 1+ g t = Y t /Y t-1 (2) where we have made explicit the time dependence of the growth rate. Similarly, the rate of growth for period t-1 is: 1+ g t-1 = Y t-1 /Y t-2 (2’) After substituting the balanced budget requirement, G t-1 = τ Y t-1 , into equation (1), equation (7) of the paper is: Y t = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-1 b+c (7) Use (7) to write Y t-1 as a function of Y t-2 : Y t-1 = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-2 b+c (7’) Put equations (7) and (7’) in (2). Upon cancellation obtain: 1+g t = (Y t-1 /Y t-2 ) b+c Using (2’): 1+g t = (1+g t-1 ) b+c (A) Equation (A) is for the variable growth rate situation, covering the constant growth rate possibility as a special case. There are two cases to consider: (a) the steady state or long run equilibrium where g t = g t-1 = g t-2 ... = g, a constant for all t, and (b) disequilibrium growth where g t does not equal g t-1 in general. We examine the cases in turn. 72 Scully, Gerald, W. Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand; Working Paper 14, Inland Revenue Department, March 1996. 17 pages plus diagrams. Appendix 2 Page 74 Steady state In the steady state equation (A) becomes: 1+g = (1+g) b+c which is a contradiction since, in general, b+c ≠ 1 as Working Paper No.14 notes (p 6). The effect of this is that the model does not have a long run equilibrium outside the constant returns to scale situation. We are confined to the steady state equilibrium in this instance. The econometric test used in Working Paper No.14 to determine whether or not b+c=1, fails. This is because it requires an estimate using unrestricted values for b+c (see Working Paper No.14, p 8), a situation which we have now shown to be contradictory in the steady state. This point on the statistical test does not apply with disequilibrium growth, which has its own problems, to which we now turn. Disequilibrium growth Disequilibrium growth is the condition where g t ≠ g t-1 in general. We consider two cases, where b+c=1 and b+c ≠ 1. Using equation (A) for b+c=1 yields: 1+g t = 1+g t-1 This violates the assumption of generally unequal growth rates in disequilibrium. When b+c ≠ 1 equation (A) holds and there are non-constant returns to scale. Equation (A) shows that unequal growth rates require b+c ≠ 1. Yet Working Paper No.14 uses the condition that b+c=1 along with unequal growth rates in the disequilbrium growth situation. The simultaneous use of these two conditions is a contradiction. Conclusion The flaws in the mathematics of Working Paper No.14 mean that the paper does not demonstrate that the GDP growth maximising tax/GDP ratio is about 20%. Nor does the paper show that the losses in GDP are $1.17 trillion through not having that tax/GDP ratio.

The production function is set out in equation (1) of Working Paper No.14. It is: Y t = aG b t-1 \[(1- τ )Y t-1 \] c (1) Equation (2) of Working Paper No.14 defines the growth rate, g: 1+ g = Y t /Y t-1 (2) This must hold for incomes in any adjacent periods. After substituting the balanced budget requirement, G= τ Y, into equation (1), equation (7) of the paper is: Y t = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-1 b+c (7) This equation also holds for any adjacent periods. Use (7) to write Y t-1 as a function of Y t-2 : Y t-1 = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-2 b+c (7’) Put equations (7) and (7’) in (2). Upon cancellation obtain: 1+g = (Y t-1 /Y t-2 ) b+c The term in the brackets is the ratio of income in adjacent periods. From (2) it necessarily equals 1+g. Hence: 1+g = (1+g) b+c which is a contradiction. In general b+c does not equal unity, as Working Paper No.14 notes after equation (1) in the comment about first degree homogeneity. Since we manipulated equation (2) by applying the balanced budget production function to it and found that there is a contradiction, the definition of g and the production function are inconsistent. Divide (7) by Y t-1 and use (2) to obtain: 1+g = a τ b (1- τ ) c Y t-1 b+c-1 (8) 73 Scully, Gerald, W. Taxation and Economic Growth in New Zealand; Working Paper 14, Inland Revenue Department, March 1996. 17 pages plus diagrams. Appendix 3 Page 77 The growth maximising tax rate is obtained by differentiating equation (8) with respect to τ and solving. This procedure yields the optimum value, τ \*: τ \* = b/(b+c)(10) However, the contradiction between g and the production function shows that the two sides of equation (8) are inconsistent. Hence the formula for τ \* is wrong. The logarithmic form of equation (8) was estimated as a part of the statistical test for constant returns to scale. To quote p 8 (emphasis added), “The log form of equation (8), with and without the (b+c-1) lnY t-1 term was estimated.” i.e. the statistical test at one point required an estimate of a transformation of (8) without a restriction on b+c. We have proved that this unrestricted version of equation (8) is incorrect, by virtue of the prior contradiction. Hence, the statistical test of the restriction fails because it requires the invalid unrestricted form of equation (8). It cannot be concluded from this test that the data supports b+c=1. It has not been shown that constant returns to scale apply. The subsequent econometrics builds on equation (8). The restriction b+c=1 is applied to (8). Using the restriction gives: 1+g = a τ b (1- τ ) 1-b (8’) There are two reasons why (8’) is wrong. First, because its predecessor (8) rests on the contradiction, and second, because the restriction on placed on b+c has not been econometrically validated. The logarithmic transformation of the incorrect equation (8’) is econometrically estimated. The conclusions of the paper are drawn from an estimate of an invalid equation and are therefore unsubstantiated. Thus, the growth maximising tax/GDP ratio has not been shown to be about 20% and the loss in GDP from the actual tax/GDP ratio has not been demonstrated to be $1.17 trillion. All of the conclusions of the paper are invalidated. Page 78 Appendix 4 Report on E. McCann (1998) “An Error in Professor Scully’s WP 14” BY Peter C.B.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For an income tax to be based on ability to pay, there needs to be a deduction for the costs of producing the income 1 . Compared to the status quo, Option 2 will support income being used as a measure of a taxpayer’s ability to pay tax. Inland Revenue’s recommended option is Option 2. Option 2 means that income will be a better measure of ability to pay than would have been true under Option 1. It also means that tax will be less of a barrier to people making efficient commercial decisions. Finally, Inland Revenue is concerned that the denial of interest deductions is likely to make investment in rental housing an unattractive proposition for many investors. Over time, this is likely to reduce the supply of housing and rental housing (relative to what would be the case if interest expense was deductible). This would place upward pressure on rents, which would increase housing costs for tenants and decrease the equity with the tax treatment of other investments that are taxed on a net basis. Views of stakeholders The Treasury Treasury agrees that allowing deductions for costs incurred in deriving income ensures that income tax reflects ability to pay and that restoring interest deductions will make the income tax system more consistent and coherent. Treasury considers it unlikely that landlords will pass on the tax change through lower rents in the short run. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, found that the main drivers of rents over the past twenty years have been household income growth and the physical supply of rental housing relative to demand. The Treasury therefore expects that restoring interest deductibility would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. In the longer term, the change could result in some increase to rental housing supply, thereby putting downward pressure on rents. This will depend on the degree of flexibility in urban land supply and/or opportunities to intensify existing land. As a result, the impact of interest deductibility in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that restoring interest deductibility increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga (HUD) HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response. General public There was a wide range of views expressed when the current interest limitation rules were introduced, and there is likely to be that same wide range of views expressed as those 1 It has been common for people to argue that tax should be levied on the basis of ability to pay, i.e. that those with greater ability to pay should pay more tax. If income is used to measure ability to pay, this means that those with greater incomes should pay more tax. In this context income is a net concept, after accounting for expenses incurred in earning that income, like interest.

Time constraints also applied to the policy development of the proposal and has not permitted consultation on the various options, or refinement of the preferred option.

The rental market 1.Upward pressure on rents can be driven by many factors that influence the supply of rental properties. These factors may be related or unrelated to tax settings. 2.However, restoring interest deductibility could have a long-term effect on reducing the cost of housing for tenants by incentivising new construction with this putting downward pressure on rents. This is even true under the status quo with a new build exemption from the rules that deny interest deductions if it creates incentives for an important group of investors to pull back from investing in the housing market. 3.Rental affordability is a significant issue in New Zealand. Based on Household Economic Survey data for the year ended June 2022, a quarter of renting households were spending over 40% of their disposable income on housing costs, and rents have risen faster than mortgage payments. Renters also have higher rates of reporting housing issues like dampness, mould, and heating. 2 4.While rental affordability (measured by the ratio of changes in rent prices to changes in incomes) has been mostly constant over the past decade, 3 New Zealand has not fared favourably in international comparisons. The proportion of low-income households (the lowest income quintile) in New Zealand spending over 40% of their income on rent was the highest in the OECD in 2018 data at 61%. 4 The same analysis for households of all incomes finds New Zealand is also near the top of OECD countries for the proportion of renters spending over 40% of their income on housing costs (24%), 5 and for median spend on housing costs by renting households (28% of household income). 6 The latter measure of median spend increases to 41% for low-income households. 7 Interest limitation rules 5.The interest limitation rules for residential investment property were originally introduced to address housing affordability. 8 The aim of the rules was to reduce demand for residential property by preventing investors from deducting interest expenditure for tax purposes. 6.The interest limitation rules were introduced in 2021 and deny a deduction for interest incurred for residential investment property. For property acquired on or after 27 March 2 https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/housing-affordability-more-challenging-for-renters-than-homeowners/ 3 https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/Methods-Nov-2022.pdf 4 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 18. 5 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners , p. 20 6 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 22. 7 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 23 8 The regulatory impact statement published for the introduction of these rules is available here. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] taxable income. Deductions are generally allowed whether or not assets generate non- taxable gains as well as taxable income. Impact of deductibility settings on rents 12. In addition, denial of interest deductions may be reducing new construction and the supply of dwellings below the level that would have arisen if interest continued to be deductible. Over time, this could put upward pressure on rents and gradually make rental properties less affordable for tenants. A healthy housing market requires a good supply of housing for both tenants and owner-occupiers. 13. The reintroduction of the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties would reduce pressure on landlords which, in the longer run, should have a flow-on effect in reducing rents for tenants. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 14. The Government’s objective in reintroducing interest deductibility for residential investment land is to reduce upward pressure on rents. 15. In addition, restoring interest deductions is an important step to make the income tax system more consistent and coherent by ensuring tax is based on ability to pay. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 16. The likely impact of the options will be assessed against the status quo under the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents and improving housing affordability in the rental market. 17. The options will also be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below: a. Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b. Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the appropriate treatment of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c. Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d. Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e. Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer. f. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? Government commitments 18. The Government has already announced its intention to phase the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties back in with the phasing and timing specified described in Option 2 below. 19. Ministers have directed officials to provide advice on this policy within the timeframes required for decisions in December 2023. Therefore, the scope of feasible options is limited. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Limitations on consultation 20. Formal stakeholder engagement following the Generic Tax Policy Process has not been possible in the time allowed for preparation of this advice. The risks of a lack of formal consultation include the potential for unintended consequences arising from the policy change. Consultation also enables a more rigorous understanding of trade-offs when making policy changes. This is pertinent for a proposal like reintroducing interest deductions, which could have impacts on the rental property market and the housing system more generally with respect to prices, rents, and the supply of housing. 21. The intention to change the interest limitation rules was signalled in the pre-election manifestos of the parties that have formed the Government. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option 1: Retain the status quo 22. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties will continue to be denied entirely for properties purchased on or after 27 March 2021. For properties acquired before 27 March 2021 (and lending drawn down before that date), the ability to claim interest deductions will continue to be phased out, with a deduction for 50% of the interest being allowed in the current income year (2023/24), a deduction for 25% of the interest being allowed in the next income year (2024/25), and no deductions for interest being allowed in all subsequent income years. Option 2: Reintroduce interest deductibility 23. Option 2 is to phase back in the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties. The option would allow a deduction for 50% of the interest in the current income year (2023/24), a deduction for 80% of the interest in the next income year (2024/25), and full deductions for interest in all subsequent income years. Although the percentage of deductions allowed for the 2023/24 income year does not change from the status quo above, it will apply for all property owners unlike the status quo, so there is some retrospective effect. Options analysis 24. Option 2 is assessed relative to Option 1 (the status quo) against the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents as well as the tax policy criteria listed above. 25. Reducing upward pressure on rents: Option 2 will remove a tax bias that is discouraging debt-financed investors from acquiring rental properties. This makes it less likely that leveraged investors will withdraw from the property market. This can increase the construction of new dwellings and, over time, reduce upward pressure on rents. 26. Efficiency: Restoring deductions for the costs of earning income will tend to promote economic efficiency. If someone discovered a profitable venture where they could earn revenue of $30,000 by incurring costs of $25,000, this would be a worthwhile venture in Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the absence of tax because of the $5,000 of net income it generates. If a taxpayer faced an income tax rate of 30%, the venture would still be worthwhile to undertake so long as expenses are deductible. In that case the taxpayer would pay tax of $1,500 on the $5,000 of profit and earn an after-tax income of $3,500. 27. However, if the revenue is taxed but the expense is not deductible, the taxpayer would pay tax of $9,000 on the gross revenue of $30,000, and make a loss of $4,000. Failing to allow deductions for the costs of earning income can create a penalty standing in the way of people making decisions which would be sensible in the absence of tax. By doing so, this will tend to reduce economic efficiency. 28. Denying deductions for interest can also reduce economic efficiency by encouraging investment to be undertaken with a landlord’s own funds rather than through using borrowed funds. Investment in rental property that is debt-financed can be double taxed. If investment in rental property is financed with a landlord’s own funds, rental income will be taxed in the landlord’s hands. But suppose, instead, that the investment in a rental property is financed by borrowing from another New Zealander. The rental income will be taxed in the landlord’s hands in the same way as if the investment were equity financed. There will be no deduction for interest, but the lender of the funds will also be taxed on the interest stream. This creates a tax bias discouraging the debt finance of residential rental property. 29. The current 20-year exemption from the interest limitation rules for new builds can also increase economic inefficiencies by encouraging leveraged landlords to invest in new residential rental properties ahead of existing properties. This biases the stock of rental and owner-occupied housing by encouraging landlords to hold a greater fraction of new builds in their portfolios, and owner-occupiers to hold a smaller fraction of new builds than would be the case under more neutral tax settings. 30. Equity: Denying interest deductions for residential rental property can also reduce horizontal equity. Suppose that A earns $30,000 of residential rental income with no interest expense, B earns $30,000 of residential rental income with $25,000 of interest expense and C earns $30,000 of rental income from a commercial (non-residential) property with $25,000 of interest expense. A (residential rental with no interest) B (residential rental with interest) C (commercial rental with interest) Rental income $30,000 $30,000 $30,000 Interest expense $0 $25,000 $25,000 Rental profit $30,000 $5,000 $5,000 Taxable income if interest is denied for residential rental $30,000 $30,000 $5,000 31. In reality, A has $30,000 of income while B and C have $5,000 of income. C is taxed on their $5,000 of income because their investment is in a commercial property. However, B is taxed on $30,000 as though they were in the same position as A while, in reality, B Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] has only earned $5,000 just like C. If taxes are not horizontally equitable, they will not be vertically equitable because income becomes a poor measure of ability to pay. 32. As has been noted, some might argue that denying B an interest deduction may be an offset for the possibility that B might be generating untaxed capital gains. However, this is a weak rationale for denying interest deductions, given that A or C may also be generating untaxed capital gains. 33. There is another potential fairness issue. Under current settings where interest deductions are denied on rental property, there is a 20-year exemption for new builds. This means that someone who purchased a property that was a new build just before the new rules came into effect is having interest deductions phased out over 4 years while someone who purchased a property just after the new rules came into effect is allowed interest deductions for 20 years. This can be seen as unfair to leveraged investors with sunk investments who purchased a residential rental property shortly before the new rules came into force. 34. Revenue integrity: There are no revenue integrity impacts, other than compliance issues arising from the complex nature of the interest limitation rules. 35. Fiscal impact: The expected fiscal cost of Option 2 over the forecast period (to 2027/28) is estimated to be $2,920m. 36. Compliance and administration costs: Option 2 is likely to reduce ongoing administration and compliance costs. It will reduce the complexity of the rules for taxpayers; interest limitation sits alongside already complex rules for the taxation of investment property, including the bright-line test, loss ring-fencing and rules for mixed- use assets such as holiday homes. A reduction in complexity consequently leads to less customer contact for Inland Revenue in supporting the interest limitation rules. Restoring interest deductibility retrospectively (i.e., changing the proportion of allowed deductions for the 2023/24 income year for property owners currently being denied any deductions) will create some initial administrative work such as providing guidance and education campaigns (detailed in Section 3). 37. Coherence: Limiting interest deductions has reduced the coherence of the tax system. A principle underlying the tax system is that generally only the amount of income after deducting any associated costs is taxable. Denial of interest deductions was an exception to this rule. Restoring interest deductions would therefore increase coherence. Treasury assessment of the options 38. Treasury agrees that allowing deductions for costs incurred in deriving income ensures that income tax reflects ability to pay and that restoring interest deductions will make the income tax system more consistent and coherent. 39. In the short and medium term, the bulk of the impact from restoring interest deductibility is likely to be reflected in house prices, with minimal impacts on rents. House price impacts are highly uncertain and will depend on the final policy design and timing of the reintroduction of interest deductibility. The Treasury will analyse these potential impacts further and may adjust our house price forecasts to reflect them as part of the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 40. In the long run, tax changes could also impact the supply of housing by incentivising new construction, and could therefore have more significant impacts on rents. The long-run incidence on house prices and rents will depend on the flexibility of urban land supply and the availability of opportunities to intensify existing urban land: a. low flexibility of urban land supply and limited opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily raise house prices in the long run. b. high flexibility of urban land supply and significant opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily reduce rents in the long run. 41. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, suggests that rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for rental housing. The Treasury therefore expects that restoring interest deductibility would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. 42. The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that urban land supply has been highly restrictive over the last two decades, as demonstrated by the gradual fall in interest rates pushing up house prices rather than pushing down rents. 43. Recent policy changes (such as the Auckland Unitary Plan) appear to have improved the responsiveness of supply for higher-density housing. However, without further changes, housing supply may continue to be unresponsive to demand in the long term. 44. As a result, the impact of interest deductibility in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that restoring interest deductibility increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. 45. The Treasury recommends phasing the restoration and consideration of a cap on deductions (either as a maximum dollar amount or a fraction of interest expenses) to manage the large fiscal cost of restoring interest deductibility. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga assessment of the options 46. HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross- agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response.

Have you put in place policies to encourage other individuals or companies to join the Rainbow tick? Please provide copies of these policies. Diversity and inclusion at Inland Revenue Inland Revenue’s approach to diversity and inclusion in the workplace supports us to source, recruit and develop an inclusive workforce representative of the customers we serve. To do that we need an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. The Rainbow Tick accreditation supports us in these goals by ensuring we are a safe organisation for members of the LGBTTQIA+ community. Rainbow Tick certification As set out on Rainbow Tick’s website (https://www.rainbowtick.nz/#offer ), their certification process evaluates an organisation’s level of LGBTTQIA+ inclusion in the following five areas: • Policies • Staf f Training • Staff Engagement & Support • External Engagement • Monitoring Inland Revenue had updated its policies and processes across these areas of evaluation before seeking certification from Rainbow Tick. In response to the evaluation, Inland Revenue supplied examples of various policies, guidelines and documents to support how LGBTTQIA+ inclusion fits into each of the areas. Along with the evaluation, were references Ref: 22OIA1730 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] to individuals’ success stories, internal communication, and Inland Revenue’s internal websites. Question 1 Please inform me of any extra costs involved with Rainbow Tick, for example payments made for training staff and managers and registration fees for the Rainbow excellence awards. Please show the amount broken down year by year. There are no extra costs involved with th e Rainbow Tick, other than the annual subscription fees. Details of payments that have already been made to Rainbow Tick regarding the annual subscription costs and the Rainbow Excellence awards, are outlined in our response to your previous OIA request 22OIA1447 sent to you on 15 December 2021. Question 2 Have the policies been put in place either of our own volition or in the process of accreditation for the Rainbow Tick? As mentioned above, Inland Revenue already had a number of policies and practices in place that support it to be an inclusive organisation. The Rainbow Tick accreditation programme offers us a way to systematically assess, with a rainbow lens, all aspects of our work environment, including policies and procedures, and we continue to monitor and evaluate these policies to ensure they remain current. Question 3 What training was given to your department to obtain the Rainbow Tick or because of the Tick. What entity supplied the training and what costs were involved from 2016 to the present day and year by year. What was the program? Please supply copies of the training documents. As part of achieving the Rainbow Tick, the Rainbow Tick Organisation will provide training sessions within the organisation. This training is the intellectual property of Rainbow Tick and there are no extra costs involved to receive this training. Release of this training material is therefore refused under section 9(2)(j) of the OIA, as releasing this would prejudice future negotiations between Rainbow Tick and Inland Revenue. More information on Rainbow Tick’s processes and resources can be found on their website www.rainbowtick.nz and on their social media sites: LinkedIn:www.linkedin.com/company/rainbow-tick-nz/ Facebook: www.facebook.com/rainbowtick Question 4: What reports were made to Rainbow Tick to secure their endorsement? Please supply copies of these reports. We have interpreted your request for reports made to Rainbow Tick to be the self- evaluation sheet Inland Revenue completed, which was considered by Rainbow Tick. This evaluation sheet is the intellectual property of Rainbow Tick and is refused under section 9(2)(j) of the OIA as releasing this would prejudice future negotiations between Rainbow Tick and Inland Revenue. Although I have decided to withhold the evaluation sheet under the above section of the OIA, I did consider providing a copy of the evaluation sheet and redacting the information owned by Rainbow Tick. However, due to the nature of Inland Revenue’s responses the redacted information could potentially be identified. I have therefore provided a summary of what was included in Inland Revenues response under sections 16(1)(e) and 16(2)(c) of the OIA. This summary can be found in the above Rainbow Tick certification section of this response Ref: 22OIA1730 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 5: Have you put in place policies to encourage other individuals or companies to join the Rainbow Tick? Please provide copies of these reports Inland Revenue has not put any new policies in place to encourage other individuals or companies to join the Rainbow Tick as a result of our relationship with Rainbow Tick. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz.

### COVERSHEET: BEPS – Hybrid mismatch arrangements

* * *

| --- | --- |
| Advising agencies | The Treasury and Inland Revenue |
| Decision sought | The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet |
| Proposing Ministers | Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) |

### SUMMARY: PROBLEM AND PROPOSED APPROACH

### Problem Definition

#### What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required?

The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries.

### Proposed Approach

#### How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option?

A tailored adoption of the OECD’s BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with.

### SECTION B: SUMMARY IMPACTS: BENEFITS AND COSTS

#### Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit?

The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis.

There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries.

Where do the costs fall?

Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law.

#### What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated?

There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD-recommended rules as needed.

#### Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

### SECTION C: EVIDENCE CERTAINTY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

#### Agency rating of evidence certainty?

Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal.

### IMPACT STATEMENT: BEPS – HYBRID MISMATCH ARRANGEMENTS

* * *

### SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

* * *

### Purpose

Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet.

### Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis

#### Evidence of the problem

Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem primarily comes from Inland Revenue’s investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group’s worldwide tax obligations), which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals.

#### Range of options considered

Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations.

#### Assumptions underpinning impact analysis

The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.

### SECTION 2: PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES

* * *

### 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed?

#### BEPS

Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.

In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

#### Hybrid mismatch arrangements

Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD’s BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens.

#### New Zealand’s BEPS work

The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations.

In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_; and _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_.

As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions.

At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017.

### 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place?

#### New Zealand’s tax system

New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours.

#### Company tax and international rules

The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income.

Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment.

At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest.

### 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity?

#### The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements

Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax-deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets.

Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements.

It is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income.

#### Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand

New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament’s contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements.

New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements.

Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year.

### 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations.

Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties.

We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal.

### 2.5 What do stakeholders think?

#### Stakeholders

Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations.

Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity. In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example, Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital.

#### Submissions to discussion document

There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand.

Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals.

#### Further and ongoing consultation

We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers’ Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements.

We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation.

We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank.

The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government.

### SECTION 3: OPTIONS IDENTIFICATION

* * *

### 3.1 What options are available to address the problem?

Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements.

None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory options. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986).

These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD’s work in this area.

#### Status quo: No action

This option relies on New Zealand’s existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand.

#### Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations

The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand. It would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law.

#### Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations

Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD-consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed.

Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand’s existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation.

#### Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules

Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. It would avoid enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand.

#### Consultation

These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government’s alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally.

### 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration?

The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria:

*   Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible
*   Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible
*   Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible
*   Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way
*   Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved

In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal.

### 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why?

We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs.

### SECTION 5: CONCLUSIONS

* * *

### 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits?

We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. It is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered.

Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a ‘hybrid’ business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed.

In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally.

Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of.

Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a ‘secondary’ right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business.

Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade-off compliance costs. It attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as “unstructured imported mismatches”. This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries.

Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment.

It is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non-hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules.

Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand’s major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country’s rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low.

The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand’s major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area.

Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand’s response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes.

### 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Affected parties**  <br>_(identify)_ | **Comment**: _nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks_ | **Impact**:  <br>_$m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts_ | **Evidence certainty**  <br>_(High, medium or low)_ |
| **Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action** |     |     |     |
| Regulated parties | _Compliance costs:_ Increased costs from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers’ transactions and structures. Or, restructuring costs of transitioning to non-hybrid arrangements to fall outside the scope of the rules. | Medium | Medium |
| _Tax payable:_ Foreign hybrid entity double deduction structures are included in the rules and we are confident of collecting a significant amount of revenue from the disallowance of that type of hybrid mismatch arrangement. | Approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis | Low\* |
| Regulators | _Administrative costs:_ Inland Revenue staff, particularly investigations staff, need to develop their knowledge of the hybrid mismatch rules. | Low | High |
| Wider government |     |     |     |
| Other parties |     |     |     |
| **Total Monetised Cost** | _Tax payable_ | Approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis | Low\* |
| **Non-monetised costs** | _Compliance costs_ | Medium | Medium |
| **Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action** |     |     |     |
| Regulated parties |     |     |     |
| Regulators | _Revenue:_ Revenue collected from tax payable item described above. | Approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis | Low\* |
| _Reduced administrative costs:_ Less investigations and disputes resources spent on hybrid mismatch arrangements using the general anti-avoidance law (GAAR). | Low | High |
| Wider government |     |     |     |
| Other parties |     |     |     |
| **Total Monetised Benefit** | _Revenue_ | Approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis | Low\* |
| **Non-monetised benefits** | _Reduced administrative costs_ | Low | High |

\*Note that the evidence for the $50 million figure is strong, but it is a conservative estimate made in light of the behavioural uncertainty associated with introducing hybrid mismatch rules together with the fact that the full extent of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand is unknown. The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence.

### 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have?

As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself.

### 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?

Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document.

* * *

### SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

* * *

### 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice?

The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB).

Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms.

The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are:

*   the proposed rule for “unstructured imported mismatch arrangements”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and
*   the proposed rules applying to New Zealand “reverse hybrids”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019.

Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016.

Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill.

### 6.2 What are the implementation risks?

We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment.

In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset.

* * *

### SECTION 7: MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW

* * *

### 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?

In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995.

Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal.

However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. It will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect.

Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools.

### 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed?

The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post-implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.

If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Policy update - news from Minister's speech to IFA
==================================================

The Government's tax policy work programme, anti-avoidance legislation and the forthcoming review of the tax system were covered in a speech delivered today by Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen to the International Fiscal Association in Christchurch. The main points are summarised in [Policy Update](/news/2000/2000-02-18-policy-update-news-ministers-speech-ifa#update)
.

* * *

### Policy update: summary of news from speech by Finance and Revenue Minister Hon Dr Michael Cullen to International Fiscal Association

Much of the tax policy work programme will continue under this Government. This includes revenue base maintenance, regular remedial legislation, cost minimisation, and tax simplification, as well as major projects like reviews of the GST legislation and the compliance and penalty legislation. The Government has endorsed the generic tax policy process as a consultative tool in developing policy, and will continue its use.

Measures to support the 1 April increase in the top personal tax rate and fringe benefit tax are to be included in a bill scheduled for introduction in late March, with mid-year enactment expected. The Government is looking at options for dealing with avoidance of the tax increase on high incomes by substituting salary and wages for employer contributions to superannuation funds that can be drawn on at any time. Also under consideration for the March bill are measures to lower the tax on fringe benefits provided to low-income and middle-income earners. Under consideration for a May bill are solutions to the problem of people using service companies or trusts to avoid the tax increase.

Anti-avoidance legislation that has been before Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee since 1994 is to be updated and enacted. Originally part of a bill introduced in 1994 but held over pending the outcome of what later became the Wine-box inquiry, the legislation introduces further measures to prevent the abuse of foreign tax credits.

The terms of reference and process for the review of the tax system announced by Labour in the lead-up to the election are being developed. The Minister sees it as "a high-level review that looks at the robustness of the current system and whether it meets the demands of today's fast-changing business environment."

### SPEECH TO INTERNATIONAL FISCAL ASSOCIATION

### Hon Dr Michael Cullen

I am very pleased to be here to address this 23rd annual conference of the International Fiscal Association. It sounds like a fun organisation!

As Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue I am part of a government that is determined to make New Zealand the sort of country we want to live in and are proud to live in. That means a country that is culturally and economically prosperous, and where prosperity is fairly shared.

We are currently developing our fiscal policy framework and budget priorities. These will be released in the Budget Policy Statement in March. We are determined to run a prudent fiscal policy to support monetary policy and take the pressure off the external position.

Our vision for economic prosperity is for a knowledge based, high skill, high income, high employment economy. To do this we need to take a longer-run perspective. In an upswing this means banking the gains from increased revenues and lower cyclical expenditures. The result will be a predictable and stable fiscal policy that will create the conditions for ongoing economic and employment growth.

Tax has an important role to play in this. Obviously, the tax system needs to raise the revenue necessary to fund the schools, hospitals, benefits and services that the government should provide. Equally obviously, the tax system should raise these funds in as logical and efficient a way as possible.

We all want a system of taxation that is coherent, rational and easy to comply with. And I am equally certain that we all want a system of taxation that is fair, even if our perceptions of what is fair may differ slightly.

Thus a key tax policy priority for the Government is to protect the tax base against erosion, to ensure that the necessary revenue flow is maintained. This includes continuing to close legislative loopholes as they arise. It also means pursuing a programme of regular remedial legislation to ensure the law is effective and up-to-date.

It is also vital to maintain the integrity of the tax system, by ensuring that taxpayers meet their obligations, and reducing opportunities for tax avoidance. If that integrity is seen to decline, the voluntary compliance of the taxpaying public is also likely to contract. This would necessitate more audits of taxpayers by the tax administration, increasing costs for everyone involved.

That leads us to another policy priority, which is to minimise the costs imposed by taxation: the economic costs, compliance costs and administrative costs. Further tax simplification -- for taxpayers and the tax administration alike -- has an important role to play here.

These principles are consistent with past tax policy. As a result, you will see a continuation of much of the existing tax policy work programme. We will also continue the use of the generic tax policy process as a consultative tool in developing policy on major reforms. That process resulted from a recommendation by the committee that reviewed the Inland Revenue Department in 1994, chaired by your next speaker, Sir Ivor Richardson. I understand the process has become widely appreciated in the tax community for the consultative opportunities it provides. It has improved the quality of tax legislation.

Although there will be a lot of continuity in tax policy, there will also be significant changes. Unlike the previous government, this Government does not see tax as just a cost to be minimised. We see government as having a positive role to play in building the sort of country we want to live in, and tax as having an important role to play in that. For example, the tax system can be used to distribute income more fairly. This is one of the main reasons that we increased the tax rate on high income earners. As cuts in pensions helped pay for the last round of tax cuts so the increase in the top rate more than pays for restoring the level of the pension.

As I have made clear in the past, we need to look at the role the tax system should play in tackling the issues of New Zealand's low savings rate and how we can best guarantee decent living standards for the next generation of retirees. Other areas where the tax system may be able to play a positive role are research and development and environmental protection.

We will not return to excessive interventionism in any part of government, including tax policy. But the balance can swing too far in the opposite direction. One example of extreme non-interventionist thinking was the research commissioned by Inland Revenue that suggested we should have a flat tax rate of 22 percent to 23 percent of GDP. I was pleased to see Inland Revenue thoroughly debunk such nonsense in the briefing papers I was given as incoming Minister of Revenue. I commend the department's analysis but question the length of time it took them to conclude the obvious.

Part of the work of the revenue portfolio will be shared with my Parliamentary Under-secretary, Mr John Wright. His key areas of responsibility are the compliance and penalty review, the inquiry of the Finance and Expenditure Committee into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue, and child support legislation. As Minister I shall obviously retain oversight of these areas.

I was part of the FEC inquiry, and I fully accept the need for improvements in Inland Revenue. It is worth remembering, however, that throughout history tax collecting has not been the most popular of occupations. Tax agencies are open to unfair attack, and that attack can be especially destructive when it is cynical and politically motivated. I saw a lot of that on the inquiry.

As a member of the select committee it was clear to me that there are areas where Inland Revenue operates well. But there are also areas where improvement is essential. A well-functioning tax administration is essential to good government, and John Wright and I will work with the department to achieve the changes that are necessary. In that regard I am very interested in any feedback from you about what is required. One of our next steps will be to introduce legislation to support the increases in the top personal tax rate and fringe benefit tax rate that were enacted just before Christmas. We'll be legislating for two things: one, to counter high-income earners avoiding the effect of the increase in the top personal rate, and two, to lower the tax on fringe benefits provided to low-income and middle-income earners.

As some of you will be aware, we have been consulting with a range of groups about options for dealing with the fringe benefit tax issue. In choosing a workable solution, I want to ensure that over-taxation is minimised without substantially increasing compliance costs. My thinking at present is that fringe benefits that can be directly linked to an individual employee, such as cars and loans, should be subject to FBT at a rate that equates with the employee's marginal tax rate. By attributing the value of benefits in this way the problem of over-taxation is reduced. My understanding from consultation is that this proposal is generally favoured, despite some increase in compliance costs that would result. 1 note that resolving over-taxation issues in this way would resolve some longstanding problems with the fringe benefit Tax regime.

I would now like to say a few words on the problem of avoidance of the tax increase on high incomes. Much has been made of this issue, some by people in this room. As a government, we have to be realistic. Every additional dollar in tax we collect, by whatever means, is going to be subject to some leakage. This does not justify NOT raising taxes -- nor does it justify reducing them to zero.

Officials delightfully call this leakage "behavioural effects". In calculating the additional revenue we will get from the tax increase, "behavioural effects" were factored in. Very approximately, of the $1.9 billion that could be collected over the next three years, officials estimated that only $1.65 billion would actually be collected. This means the tax increase could bring in as much as $600 million per year, even after allowing for leakage if we made no adjustment to F.B.T. As it is, by 2002-3 we are very confident will exceed our $400M target in the first year. Latest migration data does not, incidentally, suggest a flood of emigrants. I can assure you that money will be put to good use.

We will reduce this leakage by anti-avoidance measures, although this will be offset by the revenue costs of the fringe benefit tax changes. But we will have to be pragmatic: there will be some limited leakage. We are not going to go overboard and increase the company and trust tax rates to counter avoidance. We will rely on the general anti-avoidance rules and other specific rules to counter specific problems.

One of these is the possibility that high-income earners could avoid the effects of the increase of the top personal tax rate by substituting salary and wages for employer contributions to superannuation funds which can be drawn on at any time, like a bank account.

We are looking at two options for dealing with this. One is to cap the value of contributions per employee. Contributions up to the cap would be taxed at the current rate of 33%, and those contributions above the cap the rate would be taxed at 39%.

Alternatively, if the contributions are locked into a long-term retirement savings plan they would be taxed at 33%. But if they are not locked in they would be taxed at 39%.

The aim is that people with genuine superannuation contributions, even if they are high-income earners, will be taxed at 33%. If people increase genuine superannuation contributions there will be some leakage, but the Government is not averse to this.

We're also developing some workable solutions to the problem of people using service companies or trusts to avoid the tax increase. As part of this work we've been looking at how other countries deal with similar problems, though our chosen solution will be tailored to the New Zealand environment. Once again, one of our main concerns in developing such rules is the potential compliance and administrative costs. I intend to consult with relevant private sector groups on the workability of these solutions, and the consultation is likely to begin next month.

Subject to the results of consultation, the Government intends to introduce legislation to deal with the fringe benefit tax and superannuation scheme issues in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in late March, and mid-year enactment. The FBT changes will be effective from 1 April 2000. The service company legislation is likely to be included in a May bill.

On tax avoidance more generally, I'm keen to see the enactment, finally, of the anti-avoidance legislation that has been before the Finance and Expenditure Committee since 1994. It was originally part of a bill introduced in 1994 but was held over pending the outcome of what later became the Wine-box inquiry. The amending legislation introduces further measures to prevent the abuse of foreign tax credits, and it is time it was updated and enacted. Past delay in this area has been purely for political reasons.

The review of GST, which began in 1997, is soon to be completed. Officials have studied the more than 60 submissions received on proposals contained in last year's discussion document, and made their final policy recommendations to the Government. We expect to have made final decisions on the proposals by early next month, and to include resulting legislative changes in a tax bill to be introduced into Parliament in May.

The submissions supported many of the compliance cost reduction measures and remedial measures proposed in the discussion document. Base maintenance measures such as those relating to second-hand goods input tax credits, and the effects of de-registration when assets are retained, were, as expected, unpopular. However, such measures are essential to the revenue.

I realise that many of the submissions came from businesses and groups represented here today, so I take this opportunity to thank you for the time and effort that obviously went into them.

The next stage of the review involves reconsidering the GST treatment of imported services, since electronic commerce has vastly improved the ability of New Zealand businesses to export and import services. The review will consider whether New Zealand should introduce a reverse charge mechanism for imported services. Officials will be reporting to me on the issues later this year.

Turning briefly to another review, the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation, which came into effect in 1997, has just begun. As you may know, reviewing new legislation after it has had time to "bed in" is an important part of the generic tax policy process. To date, the review has concentrated on identifying problem areas and considering relevant recommendations of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and the Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry. Consultation with professional groups will begin soon.

Submissions on proposals contained in two discussion documents issued late last year, Less Taxing Tax and Interest Deductions for Companies, are being analysed. Submissions on the former were generally favourable, with the main concern being that they didn't go far enough. Submissions on the interest proposals supported the recasting of the core rule, but opposed the thin capitalisation "safe harbour" proposal. The Government broadly supports the proposals set out in the discussion documents, but there is still a fair bit of detailed policy work to do on both sets of proposals, so changes to the interest deductibility rules are not expected to make it into legislations in the first half of the year.

In the months leading up to the election Labour announced its intention to review the tax system when we were in office. The terms of reference and the process of the review are in the process of being developed. I see it as a high-level review that looks at the robustness of the current system and whether it meets the demands of today's fast-changing business environment. I do not see the terms of reference concentrating on specific issues, like whether we should have a capital gains tax or carbon charge, for example, even though these issues may come up in the course of the review. 1 do intend to consult with interested parties, such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, on the terms of reference and the process of the review.

To conclude, it is going to be a busy year or two in the tax policy area. As I have stated, the Government endorses the generic tax policy process and believes it has a vital role to play in shaping tax policy. This means there will be continuing consultation, on both a formal and informal basis, between the Government and the stakeholders in the tax community. I value your views and look forward to working with you.

Rotorua, Hamilton and the Bay of Islands are the focus this week of consultation with taxpayers on the Government review of the taxation of Maori authorities. Officials from Te Puni Kokiri, the Treasury and the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue are travelling to different parts of New Zealand in a series of visits that have included New Plymouth, Gisborne and Christchurch. They are meeting with a variety of people from Maori organisations, tax practitioners and other interested parties to discuss possible options for changing the law relating to Maori authorities and charitable organisations.

The review, which began in 1998, is still in the policy formulation stage. The next step is for officials to finalise policy options to present to Government ministers. Next comes a mid-year discussion document setting out proposals for change. That will be followed by wide consultation with Maori, a process that will include regional hui to discuss proposals.

### Terms of Reference for the Review of the Taxation of Maori Authorities and related issues

**Introduction**

The taxation rules applying to Maori authorities have remained largely unchanged since their initial design in 1952. As a result, they do not incorporate subsequent tax reforms such as company imputation, nor do they seem to acknowledge the broader range of economic activities Maori have entered into or the greater resources available to Maori today, compared with the 1950s. Thus the rules may hinder rather than assist Maori economic and social development in the long term.

The Government's strategic objective for Maori development involves developing and implementing policies and processes that lead towards closing the economic and social gaps between Maori and non-Maori. The review will consider whether these laws are impediments to this objective or otherwise distort Maori economic and social development.

**Purpose of the review**

The review will consider whether the current tax treatment of Maori authorities distorts Maori social and economic development and, if so, how those distortions can be addressed. It will also clarify the "public purpose" test for charitable status to provide certainty for iwi and hapu trusts and other entities seeking charitable income tax exemption.

The review will result in policy recommendations to the Government on the most appropriate tax treatment of Maori authorities, having regard to the Government's objectives for tax policy and Maori development.

**Review methodology**

The review will be carried out in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP), which the Government has adopted for the development of tax policy. This process provides opportunities for taxpayers affected by the proposed changes, and other interested parties, to be consulted at key points in the policy-making process.

The review methodology will include:

1.  an historical overview of the Maori authority tax rules, including policy, administrative practice and compliance issues.
2.  examining the underlying tax policy objectives of the current rules and their appropriateness for the taxation of Maori authorities within the existing framework for tax policy.
3.  assessing the appropriateness of alternative tax rules (such as the company and trust rules) that could be applied to Maori authorities and considering any transitional issues.
4.  examining all available information on Maori authorities (including Inland Revenue tax legislation files and operational guidelines) to determine what additional information is required.
5.  taking account of the work being undertaken by other government departments that may affect this review.
6.  identifying Maori individuals and organisations and other key stakeholders to provide input into the review process.
7.  developing and implementing an effective consultation strategy that satisfies the Government's treaty obligations as well as the consultation requirement under the GTPP.
8.  analysing policy options, and making recommendations for consideration by the Government.
9.  preparing and releasing a Government discussion document on any proposals for reform and seeking public submissions on those proposals.
10.  analysing submissions and finalising policy proposals for Government approval.
11.  finalising legislation for inclusion in the next available taxation bill following approval by the Government.
12.  reporting to Ministers before and after consultation, as appropriate.
13.  developing an effective communication strategy to inform the Maori community and other key stakeholders of any changes arising from the review.

**Issues to be examined in the review**

_Appropriateness of the current taxation model for Maori authorities and the Maori Trustee_

The review will examine the underlying tax policy objectives of the current rules and their appropriateness for the taxation of Maori authorities within the existing framework of taxation. It will also examine how other tax rules, such as the company and trust rules, or rules applying to indigenous peoples in other tax jurisdictions, would apply to Maori authorities and assess any reasons for not applying those rules.

The Maori Trustee is included in the definition of "Maori authority" except in its capacity as collection and distribution agent for rents, royalties and interest. In those circumstances the taxation of income is governed by section HK 14 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The reason for this distinct tax treatment is uncertain and appears to be a source of confusion for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The review will consider whether this distinction is valid having regard to the special features of the Trustee.

_The definition of "Maori authority"_

The definition of "Maori authority" sets the outer boundary of the Maori authority rules. With few exceptions, the rules apply to almost every person(s) administering or controlling property or income in trust for the benefit of Maori. The definition is very wide and would appear to include entities that may otherwise wish to be classified under another taxpayer type, such as a company or trust, notwithstanding the diversity of their objectives and activities. Because there are no explicit guidelines or criteria for determining what a Maori authority is, there is potential for inconsistency in the tax treatment of such entities.

_The potential for double taxation of Maori authority income_

The four-year rule (in section HI 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994) ensures that income distributed within four years of being earned is taxed at the beneficiary level only. However, income distributed after four years is taxed at the Maori authority level at the time it is earned, and taxed again when it is distributed to the beneficiary - which is double taxation. The four-year rule prevents an authority from claiming a refund of the tax already paid on income from which those distributions are made.

This rule may disadvantage Maori authorities because it forces them to distribute their income before the four-year deadline to avoid double taxation, rather than reinvesting the income in the authority. This serves to distort income distribution or retention decisions by authorities. Furthermore, the way the rule functions to prevent double taxation is inherently flawed and can mean that even when the rule is invoked, the full amount of tax paid will never be recovered for distribution.

_The appropriateness of "Commissioner discretions"_

The taxation of distributions made from a Maori authority is reliant on the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. As a result, income which is exempt to the authority, such as treaty settlement money, may become taxable when it is distributed to beneficiaries. This is because the law deems all distributions made from a Maori authority to be "out of income" and, therefore, taxable to the recipient, unless the Commissioner determines otherwise. Distributions made on winding-up are also subject to this discretion.

Another discretion operates when the number of beneficiaries increases from one year to the next and the 20- beneficiary threshold is crossed. This discretion is intended to ensure that income taxed in one year is not taxed again in the next year.

There are no explicit guidelines as to how the Commissioner's discretion will be applied in either instance. The review will consider alternative ways of giving certainty to the tax treatment of distributions made from a Maori authority and the taxation of income when the 20- beneficiary threshold is crossed. The results will be incorporated into the Rewriting the Income Tax Act project, which is considering the appropriateness of certain types of "Commissioner discretions" in a tax system based on taxpayer self-assessment.

_The compliance costs associated with the current rules_

The application of the four-year rule has associated compliance costs, including those arising from the adverse cash flow consequences, making application for reassessment, and specifying the year in which the adjustment is to be made. The uncertainty surrounding the exercise of the "Commissioner discretions" and the requirement on large authorities to keep a register of beneficiaries to keep track of their whereabouts gives rise to potentially burdensome obligations for Maori authorities. The review will also assess how these rules fit into the Inland Revenue Department's tax simplification project, which is looking at ways of simplifying the information requirements the department places on business taxpayers.

_The tax concessions associated with Maori authorities_

There is some uncertainty as to whether the Maori authority rules provide penal or concessionary treatment for Maori authorities. This is dependent on:

*   whether the entity is a large or small authority;
*   the distribution policy of the authority; and
*   the tax treatment if the Maori authority tax rules did not exist.

A deduction is also available to Maori authorities for donations they may make to Maori associations under section DI 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994.

Some tax concessions appear to have arisen from administrative practice and to have no basis in law, such as the various exemptions relating to the gross income from sales of indigenous timber and exotic timber.

The review will consider whether the reasons for these tax concessions are still valid today.

_The "public purpose" test for charitable status_

The review will clarify the "public purpose" test for charitable status, and develop options on ways to amend it to give greater certainty to iwi and hapu-based structures and other entities seeking charitable income tax status. The policy question to be answered here is whether an entity can be charitable if the beneficiaries are connected with that trust through a personal relationship such as genealogy or contract. Although this issue is especially relevant to iwi and hapu structures, the review is not limited to them.

**Review team**

The review will be carried out by officials from:

*   the Inland Revenue Department
*   the Treasury
*   the Ministry of Maori Development.

GST changes to be introduced
============================

The Government is to introduce wide-ranging changes to GST to improve the workability and effectiveness of the tax. The changes will be included in legislation to be introduced into Parliament in May. The changes arise from the Government review of GST, which has been looking at GST in light of developments that have taken place since it was introduced, to see where improvements can be made and to update the law where necessary. The changes range from compliance cost reduction measures, to anti-avoidance measures, through to clarification of the law. For details, see [GST review: proposed changes](/news/2000/2000-04-06-gst-changes-be-introduced#summary)

### GST Review: Proposed Changes

Unless otherwise indicated the changes listed here are proposed to take effect from the date of enactment of the tax bill scheduled for introduction in May.

| Topic | Proposal |
| --- | --- |
| **Main Issues** |     |
| Second-hand goods input tax credits | The second-hand goods input tax credit in relation to supplies between associated persons will be limited to the lesser of:<br><br>*   the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or<br>*   1/9th of the purchase price; or<br>*   1/9th of the open market value.<br><br>This proposal will remove the remaining potential for taxpayers to make windfall gains by manufacturing transactions with associates. |
| Deregistration | Output tax will be based on market value in all cases (rather than the current cost or market option), but the current cost or market option will continue to apply to pre-GST assets.<br><br>This proposal aims to correct the anomaly in the GST treatment between assets retained and sold after deregistration and assets sold before deregistration. The exception for pre-GST assets addresses the concerns expressed in submissions. |
| Deferred settlements | GST will be required to be returned on an invoice (or accrual) basis for any supply exceeding $200,000, unless the supply is in relation to a short-term agreement (93 days, in line with the accrual rules).<br><br>This is intended to address the potential for a purchaser on an invoice basis to obtain an up-front input tax credit but a vendor on the payments basis to significantly defer the payment of output tax in the same transaction. |
| Local authorities accounting basis | The automatic entitlement to account on a payments basis will be removed from 1 July 2001. Specific time-limited exceptions to the invoice basis of accounting for local authorities may be made by Order in Council.<br><br>The legislation will be clarified so that local authorities under the invoice basis of accounting will be required to pay output tax on rates at the earlier of:<br><br>*   the date of an instalment notice for a single payment; or<br>*   the due date for payment; or<br>*   the date when payment is received. |
| General anti-avoidance provision | Section 76 will be changed to align with the Income Tax Act provision. |
| Adjustments to input and output tax | Taxpayers will have the choice when making adjustments for changes in use (e.g. from business to personal use or vice versa) of making ongoing input or output tax adjustments either:<br><br>*   annually; or<br>*   in each taxable period.<br><br>In relation to business assets used for private or other non-taxable purposes, taxpayers will have the choice of making one output tax adjustment (either when the asset is acquired or when the change in use occurs), rather than periodic adjustments. If a taxpayer chooses to make a one-off adjustment, additional adjustments will be required if the relative use changes further by 20% or more.<br><br>A long-term review of the change in use versus apportionment methodologies is included in the work programme. |
| Registration threshold | The compulsory registration threshold will be increased from $30,000 to $40,000, in line with inflation since 1990 and with expected inflation for the next five to ten years. This preserves the balance between the following competing considerations achieved when the threshold was originally set:<br><br>*   A high registration threshold reduces compliance costs because it allows many small businesses to fall outside the GST system.<br>*   A low threshold reduces the potential for smaller businesses to place significant competitive pressures on businesses operating above the threshold.<br><br>The change will apply from 1 October 2000. |
| **Other Issues** |     |
| "Associated persons" definition | The definition of "associated persons" will be replaced with the broader definition used in the Income Tax Act 1994 for international tax and certain other purposes, with the following modifications:<br><br>*   The definition of "relative" in the "relatives test" will be narrowed.<br>*   A universal test for treating as associated persons those with a common relationship to another person will be included.<br>*   The "habitually acting in concert" test will be removed.<br><br>People in de facto relationships will be included in the definition of "associated persons". |
| Debt collection services | Third-party debt collection services will be excluded from the definition of "financial services". |
| Financial options | Financial options will be included in the definition of "financial services". |
| Non-deliverable futures contracts | Non-deliverable futures contracts will be exempt if they are tradeable on a defined market or are traded at arm's length. |
| Deliverable futures contracts | Deliverable futures contracts will be subject to GST unless the deliverable commodity is exempt. |
| Penalty interest | Penalty interest will be treated as being in respect of a financial service. |
| General insurance | The words "indemnify" and "indemnity" will be removed from sections 5(13) and 20(3)(d) to clarify the scope for general insurers to claim input tax credits.<br><br>The term "taxable supply" in section 5(13) will be changed to "taxable activity".<br><br>Section 5(13) will be amended to ensure that an insured party is liable for output tax where a payment is made directly to a third party (instead of to the insured) under the insured?s contract of insurance. |
| Subrogation payments | The Act will be amended to ensure that the GST liability of an insurer on receipt of payments resulting from the exercise of subrogation rights is limited to the amount of any input tax credit received for making a subrogation payment to an insured person. |
| Termination of a taxable activity | The definition of "taxable activity" will be amended to include both a premature ending of a taxable activity as well as a successful completion of a taxable activity. |
| Meaning of "cash price" | The "cash price" of a good or service will be the higher of the lowest price in cash or the open market value of those goods or services. |
| Vouchers, stamps and tokens | The value of vouchers, stamps or tokens redeemable for goods or services will be recognised when a voucher, stamp or token is acquired. For compliance reasons registered persons will have the option to recognise GST when a voucher, stamp or token with a face value is redeemed. |
| Vouchers as prizes | The value of a voucher, stamp or token with a face value will be allowed to be deducted from the gross proceeds of a lottery event regardless of when the supplier of the voucher, stamp or token chooses to recognise the GST. |
| "Going concerns" | The "going concern" test for zero-rating purposes will be applied when the supply is deemed to be made.<br><br>A business will be required to be capable of being carried on by a purchaser for it to be transferred as a "going concern". |
| Services supplied in relation to exported goods | Services supplied in relation to exported goods will be zero-rated if the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside NZ at the time the services are performed. |
| Temporary imports | Services supplied to a NZ resident directly in connection with a temporary import will be zero-rated. |
| Importers acting as agents for non-residents | Importers who are acting as an agent for a non-resident will be allowed to claim an input tax credit for any GST levied under section 12. |
| Zero-rating of exported information services | Services supplied to a non-resident who is outside NZ at the time the services are performed and that comprise the supply of information from NZ to outside NZ that is provided directly in connection with personal property in NZ will be zero-rated. |
| Exported aircraft | Aircraft that are exported and leave NZ under their own power will be zero-rated. |
| Goods destroyed prior to export | Supplies of goods that were to be exported but cease to exist owing to circumstances outside the control of either the supplier or purchaser of the goods will be zero-rated. |
| Residential accommodation | The supply of residential property for lease or rental under a head lease will be exempt if the property is acquired for the purposes of providing residential accommodation unless the supplier and purchaser agree that the exemption not apply. |
| The six-monthly filing threshold | No increase to the current $250,000 threshold is proposed but the Commissioner will have the discretion on written application to allow taxpayers to file on a six-monthly basis taking into account:<br><br>*   whether the taxpayer has a history of accurate and timely filing and payment of GST;<br>*   whether the taxpayer has good record-keeping practices;<br>*   whether the taxpayer has previously been entitled to account for GST on a six-monthly basis;<br>*   the nature of the taxable supplies;<br>*   the volume of taxable supplies. |
| The last day of a taxable period | The legislation will be amended to provide the Commissioner with the power to reverse a decision allowing registered persons to change the last day of their taxable period. |
| The payments basis threshold | The threshold under which a person can account for GST when payments are received will increase from $1 million to $1.3 million.<br><br>The change will apply from 1 October 2000. |
| Factored debts | Registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis will be required to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. When a debt is factored on a recourse basis the assignor can claim a deduction if the debt becomes bad after it is returned. |
| Adjustments to input and output tax | The current methods of allocation will be legislated in the GST Act. Taxpayers will be required to adopt the allocation method that gives the fairest and most reasonable allocation.<br><br>The input tax credit allowed for changes from non-taxable to taxable use will be limited to supplies of goods and services on which GST has been charged and to supplies of second-hand goods.<br><br>The $10,000 threshold for one-off input tax adjustments from non-taxable to taxable use will be increased to $18,000. (The increase is in line with inflation since 1986.)<br><br>The minimum threshold for exempt supplies (over which adjustments must be made) will be increased from $48,000 to $90,000. (The increase is in line with inflation since 1986.)<br><br>Output tax adjustments will be required for any non-taxable use of goods and services acquired or produced as well as applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.<br><br>An adjustment will be triggered by any change of use (not just a subsequent change of use).<br><br>Fringe benefits provided to past employees (including associated persons) will be subject to GST.<br><br>Section 21(6) will be amended so that it refers to "goods and services deemed to be supplied by a person under section 5(3)" rather than "to" a person.<br><br>Section 21 will not give rise to an unintended output tax liability for services provided by employees.<br><br>Section 21(1) will be amended so that it does not apply if a deemed supply has arisen because of a change in the legislation.<br><br>The time of supply of output tax adjustments for non-deductible entertainment expenditure will be the same time as when the income tax return is due (or furnished, whichever is the earlier).<br><br>Section 21(5) will apply to goods and services acquired or produced on or after 1 October 1986, rather than after that date. |
| Abbreviated tax invoices | The threshold under which an abbreviated tax invoice is accepted will increase from $200 to $1,000.<br><br>The change will apply from 1 October 2000. |
| Unincorporated bodies: debt priority and members' liability for GST | GST debts recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body will have preferential status.<br><br>Unpaid GST debts of an unincorporated body will have preferential status if a receiver is appointed other than by court order.<br><br>The liability of a member of an unincorporated body for GST payable during the time the person was a member will extend beyond the period of membership, but only in respect of liabilities arising during the period the person was a member.<br><br>The current requirement to provide written notification to the Commissioner will involve actual receipt of the notice and the change in membership will take effect from this date. |
| Personal representatives, liquidators and receivers (specified agents) | Section 58(1A) (specified agent carrying on taxable activity) will be amended to include appointments of receivers to control only part of a taxable activity.<br><br>An agency period will terminate when the taxable activity is no longer carried on by a specified agent whether by a liquidator, receiver or both.<br><br>Section 58 will be amended to ensure that input tax credits not previously claimed by an incapacitated person in relation to pre-agency supplies can be claimed by their specified agent.<br><br>Section 58(1A) will override section 5(2).<br><br>A specified agent will not be personally liable for any liability incurred on (as well as before) the date of commencement of the agency period.<br><br>The appointment of a specified agent will not affect the membership of a group of registered persons. |
| Other minor issues | The circularity between sections 10(3) and 10(3A) will be removed by replacing the reference to "registered person" in section 10(3A) with "person".<br><br>To ensure that section 10(3) will apply where consideration is not provided in money the references to "consideration in money" will be replaced with "consideration".<br><br>Various redundant provisions and references will be repealed and minor amendments made to update and correct other provisions. |

Taxation bill introduced
========================

The Government today introduced the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Most of the bill is devoted to wide-ranging changes to GST arising from the Government review of the tax. Also introduced is anti-avoidance legislation to prevent people who are essentially employees from avoiding the new 39% income tax rate through the use of a company, trust or partnership as a shelter for employment income. Other anti-avoidance legislation prevents the abuse of foreign tax credits. Amendments arising from recommendations of the Finance and Expenditure Committee in its inquiry into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue introduce greater flexibility into the rules relating to overdue tax and reduce penalties for late tax.

The exception for pre-GST assets addresses the concerns expressed in submissions on the March 1999 discussion document. |
| Deferred settlements | GST will be required to be returned on an invoice (or accrual) basis for any supply exceeding $225,000 (including GST), unless the supply is in relation to a short-term agreement (93 days, in line with the accrual rules).<br><br>This is intended to address the potential for a purchaser on an invoice basis to obtain an up-front input tax credit but a vendor on the payments basis to significantly defer the payment of output tax in the same transaction. |
| Local authorities accounting basis | The automatic ability to account on a payments basis will be removed from 1 July 2001.

However, the amendment to limit the input tax credit for changes from non-taxable to taxable use will apply on and after 1 October 1986, unless the Commissioner has agreed, in writing, before 16 May 2000 to the input tax credit claim.<br><br>A long-term review of the change in use versus apportionment methodologies is included in the Government's tax policy work programme. |

In addition, the current 10% threshold for association between an individual shareholder and a company will be changed to 25%. |
| Debt collection services | Third-party debt collection services will be excluded from the definition of "financial services"<br><br>. |
| Financial options | Financial options will be included in the definition of "financial services". |
| Non-deliverable futures contracts | Non-deliverable futures contracts will be exempt if they are tradeable on a defined market or are traded at arm's length. |
| Deliverable futures contracts | Deliverable futures contracts will be subject to GST unless the supply of the deliverable commodity is exempt. |
| Penalty interest | Penalty interest will be treated as being consideration for an exempt supply. |
| General insurance | The words "indemnify" and "indemnity" will be removed from sections 5(13) and 20(3)(d) to clarify the scope for general insurers to claim input tax credits.<br><br>The term "taxable supply" in section 5(13) will be changed to "taxable activity".<br><br>Section 5(13) will be amended to ensure that an insured party is liable for output tax where a payment is made directly to a third party (instead of to the insured) under the insured?s contract of insurance. |

| Termination of a taxable activity | The definition of "taxable activity" will be amended to include both a premature ending of a taxable activity as well as a successful completion of a taxable activity. This change will also be made in other provisions that refer to the "cessation" or "termination" of a taxable activity. |
| Meaning of "cash price" | The "cash price" of a good or service will be the higher of the lowest price in cash or the open market value of those goods or services. |
| Vouchers, stamps and tokens | The sale of a token, stamp or voucher will be treated as a supply but their redemption will not be a supply. However, for compliance reasons, suppliers will generally have the option to recognise GST when a voucher, stamp or token with a face value is redeemed.<br><br>No further change to ensure that an input tax credit is allowed in relation to vouchers acquired as prizes for lottery events, as foreshadowed in the discussion document, is required. This is because the input tax credit will be allowed on acquisition. |
| "Going concerns" | The "going concern" test for zero-rating purposes will apply when the supply is deemed to be made.<br><br>A business will be required to be capable of being carried on by a purchaser for it to be transferred as a "going concern". |

| The six-monthly filing threshold | No increase to the current $250,000 threshold is proposed but the Commissioner will have the discretion on written application to allow taxpayers to file on a six-monthly basis taking into account:<br><br>*   whether the taxpayer has a history of accurate and timely filing and payment of GST;<br>*   whether the taxpayer has good record-keeping practices;<br>*   whether the taxpayer has previously been entitled to account for GST on a six-monthly basis;<br>*   the nature of the taxable supplies;<br>*   the volume of taxable supplies. |

| Adjustments to input and output tax | The current methods of allocation will be legislated in the GST Act. Taxpayers will be required to adopt the allocation method that gives the fairest and most reasonable allocation.<br><br>The input tax credit allowed for changes from non-taxable to taxable use will be limited to supplies of goods and services on which GST has been charged and to supplies of second-hand goods that have either always been situated in New Zealand or have incurred GST under section 12(1). This change will apply from 1 October 1986 other than where the Commissioner has agreed to an input tax credit claim.<br><br>The $10,000 threshold for one-off input tax adjustments from non-taxable to taxable use will be increased to $18,000. (The increase is in line with inflation since 1986.)<br><br>The minimum threshold for exempt supplies (over which adjustments must be made) will be increased from $48,000 to $90,000.

| Personal representatives, liquidators and receivers (specified agents) | Section 58 will include appointments of receivers to control only part of a taxable activity.<br><br>An agency period will terminate when the taxable activity is no longer carried on by a specified agent whether by a liquidator, receiver or both.<br><br>Section 58 will be amended to ensure that input tax credits not previously claimed by an incapacitated person in relation to pre-agency supplies can be claimed by their specified agent.

Compliance and penalties review - terms of reference announced
==============================================================

Revenue Under-secretary John Wright today announced the terms of reference for the Government review of the compliance and penalty legislation in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Media Statement

**Tax law on compliance and penalties to be reviewed**

The Government today announced the terms of its review of the tax law relating to taxpayer compliance and penalties.

Revenue Under-secretary John Wright said the review would assess how well the legislation is achieving its objectives.

"The compliance and penalty legislation in the Tax Administration Act has four main aims," Mr Wright said. "It should deter non-compliance with the law, be understandable and fair, be flexible yet consistent, and be administered consistently.

"The review will look at how well the legislation does that, and identify areas where improvement is needed.

"The legislation, which came into effect in 1997, sets out the obligations of taxpayers and the tax standards they are expected to meet. It prescribes standard penalties across all taxes and duties for not complying with the law.

"The new legislation replaced a collection of tax rules that had built up over many years. The rules had gaps in coverage and were inconsistent in their application. For example, some actions attracted a penalty for certain kinds of taxes but not for others, while there were major inconsistencies in the size of penalties for similar defaults.

"Now that the new legislation has had three years to bed in, it is timely to review it.

"A further incentive is to respond to criticism of aspects of the legislation, mainly that it is too harsh or lacking in flexibility. For this reason the review will pick up on the relevant recommendations of the 1998 report of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, and last year's report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee's inquiry into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue. Both inquiries made valuable contributions to understanding where the legislation could be improved.

"Changes inspired by their recommendations form part of a recently introduced taxation bill. They include the reduction of the incremental penalty for late payment from 2 percent to 1 percent, and the extension of relief provisions to all taxes, both of which introduce greater lenience and flexibility into the administration of the legislation.

"The public will be able to have its say on any changes arising from the review well before they are drafted into legislation. A discussion document seeking public submissions on proposals is planned for February of next year," John Wright said.

### Terms of reference for the review of the compliance and penalties legislation

The review is to assess how well the compliance and penalties legislation is achieving its objectives, which encompass being:

1.  effective in deterring non-compliance and encouraging remedial action;
2.  understandable and fair, and perceived as such;
3.  appropriately flexible and consistent; and
4.  consistently administered.

The review will identify areas where improvements can be made to better achieve the objectives of the compliance and penalties legislation.

In relation to the objectives above, the review will consider the following issues:

_Effective in deterring non-compliance and encouraging remedial action_

*   Whether there has been any change in compliance behaviour caused by the new legislation.
*   Whether a past record of "good behaviour" should be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty, and if so how; whether the Inland Revenue Department needs to exercise a greater degree of flexibility when applying shortfall penalties; whether shortfall penalties should apply when it is determined that the taxpayer has made an inadvertent error.
*   Whether the legislation sets standards clearly. For example, what constitutes "lack of reasonable care" or "unacceptable interpretation"? How late filing penalties, late payment penalties and shortfall penalties are applied, including whether the levels of late filing penalty are appropriate given the different taxpayer groups. Whether the rates of shortfall penalties are appropriate, by being fair while deterring non-compliance and encouraging remedial action. Whether the standards imposed on agents are appropriate.
*   In relation to sections 16 and 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, whether:
    *   Section 17 should be amended to deem the records of an offshore entity controlled by a New Zealand resident to be under the control of that New Zealand resident.
    *   Section 17 should be amended to remove the words "necessary or relevant".
    *   Section 17 should be amended to give the Commissioner the discretion to require that documents requisitioned under that section should be sent to an Inland Revenue office.
    *   Section 16 should be amended to allow documents to be removed from premises for copying and to be returned as soon as practicable.
    *   Section 16(2) should be amended to clarify that it applies to third parties.
*   The method by which use-of-money interest is calculated to determine whether changes which can be made to the interest rates for overpayments and underpayments in order to reduce the differential between the rates are appropriate.
*   Whether there are circumstances that require relief from the use-of-money interest rules.
*   In relation to write-offs, whether there should be a time limit on the reinstatement of a debt; whether, if the present policy continues, the term "write-off" should be replaced by wording that more accurately describes the policy (for example, "provisional write-off"); whether it is necessary for the write-off provisions to be contained in the Inland Revenue Acts.
*   Whether there should be no penalties for voluntary disclosures.
*   The criteria for entering into instalment arrangements, reporting to the Government on the matter.
*   Whether there should be the option of having an annual GST return based on figures from the financial statements, with GST payments during the year being regarded as provisional. In the case of GST returns it may only be when the annual accounts are completed that GST errors are identified. Taxpayers are potentially exposed to penalties.
*   Whether Inland Revenue should be required to reinforce internally and publicly the principle that if a taxpayer (or advisor) has not interpreted the legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply.
*   Whether there should be penalties on temporary shortfalls.
*   The wider remission powers of the Commissioner in respect of use-of-money interest to cover the situation where the taxpayer did not have the benefit of the use of the funds or no economic benefit was gained; the Commissioner's split rate approach and its validity.

_Understandable and fair, and perceived as such_

*   Whether the fairness of the penalties provisions is apparent to all taxpayers, and taxpayers that comply can see that those who do not comply are adequately penalised.
*   Whether the Government's performance expectations of taxpayers are reasonable.
*   Whether the debt hardship and instalment arrangement provisions are adequate and the rules for offsetting overpayments or tax credits against underpayments or tax debits are adequate.
*   Whether the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to provide a clear, four-year time bar in relation to all taxes except where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds to suspect a return to be fraudulent or wilfully misleading.
*   The process by which assessments can be challenged, in particular considering whether a time limit should be placed on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when addressing a taxpayer's Notice of Response.
*   The concept of encouraging the retention, on file, of particulars of tax situations and their rationale if some uncertainty is involved; the issue of requiring disclosure if the tax at risk in a tax position exceeds a specified threshold (such disclosure would be required to be accompanied by sufficiently informative statements on the tax situation at issue and the tax position taken); the role of record keeping versus disclosure to the Commissioner and the appropriate treatment of such disclosure.
*   Whether incentives could be provided to taxpayers to ensure that they pay off their debt in the shortest timeframe they can afford. For example, the use-of-money interest rate could reflect the term of the instalment arrangement.
*   Whether the remission provisions can be applied to companies.

_Appropriately flexible and consistent_ 

*   Whether the legislation minimises compliance costs where possible and is consistent with the proposals in the discussion document Less Taxing Tax.
*   The extent of any lack of consistency in the application of the compliance and penalties legislation, owing to unclear or uncertain legislation.
*   Whether there should be more flexibility in considering remission and hardship.
*   Whether Inland Revenue should be required to develop an administrative solution to the problem whereby a taxpayer claiming GST in the wrong entity may be harshly penalised, despite there being no economic disadvantage to the Government (or advantage to the taxpayer); whether such administrative measure then requires to be embodied in the law by a suitable legislative change.

_Consistently administered_ 

*   Whether the penalties legislation and administrative practices complement the efficient operation of the tax system, are practicable and aim to keep compliance and administration costs as low as possible; whether the compliance and penalties legislation is integrated with various initiatives such as Inland Revenue's Audit 2000 and self-assessment projects.
*   The extent of any lack of consistency in Inland Revenue administration. A separate report from the Operations Group will be sent to the Government outlining any administrative issues identified and the priorities in finding solutions. 

* * *

Bill writes off interest on many student loans
==============================================

The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill, introduced today, writes off interest for full-time, full-year students and low-income, part-time students. It also introduces a new base interest write-off that will reduce the loan balances of many other students and former students. See the Minister's media statement:

### Media Statement

Office of Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Treasurer  
Minister of Finance  
Minister of Revenue  
Minister for Accident Insurance  
Leader of The House of Representatives

### Government legislates to abolish interest on student loans for current students, reduce interest for former students

Legislation introduced today scraps interest on student loans for full-time, full-year students and for low-income, part-time students while they are studying.

Also potential winners are many former students paying off loans. They may see their loan balance reduced by hundreds of dollars a year.

The changes, which were announced late last year, will be backdated to 1 January 2000 for loans taken out after that date, and to 1 April 2000 for earlier loans.

"This will make a real difference to thousands of students and former students," said Revenue Minister Michael Cullen.

"Although most students earn little or no income while they are studying, until now the interest on their loan has compounded each year. By the time they completed their studies the interest could have represented a significant part of the debt. After a four-year course, for example, the interest component could have been as much as one-fifth of the total debt."

"Many former students will also be better off as a result of the new base interest write-off, which will help them to pay off their loans more quickly. For example, someone who earns $25,000 and has a $15,000 loan to pay off will save about $400 this year," Dr Cullen said.

The changes to interest charged on student loans are:

*   Current full-time, full-year students, irrespective of income, will have their interest fully written off.
*   Current students whose courses are not full-time and full-year and whose income is $24,596 or less will also have their interest fully written off.
*   For former students and current students who do not meet the criteria above, 50 percent of their compulsory repayment obligation will be credited to the base interest charged on their loan, with any excess written off. The other 50 percent will be credited to the CPI component of the interest charge and to the principal, thus accelerating repayment of the principal.

The loan statements issued by the Department of Work and Income and the Inland Revenue Department will continue to show accrued interest on all loans. The interest of eligible borrowers will be written off after the end of each income year.

NB: The above figures are the maximum savings for borrowers who do not qualify for a full interest write-off. The savings arise because, from the 2000/01 income year, only 50 percent of the repayment obligation will be credited to the base interest charged and any excess will be written off. The other 50 percent will be credited first to the interest adjustment interest (this is equivalent to CPI and until now has been capitalised as at 31 March each year) charged for the year and second to the loan principal. This means that your loan balance will reduce faster.

The savings vary according to the size of the loan balance (which determines the amount of base interest charged) and the borrower's income (which determines the amount of the repayment obligation). The maximum amount saved is 50 percent of the compulsory repayment obligation. For simplicity, the above figures assume that no payments were made during the year. Because the maximum amount that can be saved is 50 percent of the repayment obligation, payments (which would reduce the interest charge) may not reduce the above savings.

The savings for any particular borrower can only be determined on the basis of his or her income and loan balance.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Revenue

### Towards a stronger, fairer tax system

The Inland Revenue Department gets a funding boost of $35.7 million in the Budget.  
Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said the increase was "a significant improvement" on what might have happened had there not been a change in government.

"The IRD was scheduled to take a $30.4 million cut in the 2000-01 financial year. We could not allow that to proceed as it would have damaged the department's ability to do its job properly. This Government is committed to rebuilding capacity in the State sector and to promoting a strong and effective public service," Dr Cullen said.

The additional money would assist the IRD to administer the tax system, discourage avoidance and implement the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee's recommendations to make it easier for taxpayers to understand and meet their tax obligations.

"Legislation is now before Parliament to reduce the incremental penalty for late payment of tax, expand the IRD's discretion to cancel, remit or accept payment by instalment and extend the application of these hardship provisions to all tax types.

"Other initiatives arising from the FEC inquiry on the IRD's agenda for the 2000-01 financial year include a review of the compliance and penalties regime and the re-establishment of a new complaints management process.

"These changes have a common theme, to make the IRD more responsive to the needs of the individual taxpayer," Dr Cullen said.

The Government will introduce legislation this year to require trust distributions of beneficiary income to minors to be taxed at the 33 percent trustee rate. This will limit the benefits of any income splitting through directing trust income to children. Currently this income could be taxed at rates as low as 19.5 percent. By way of comparison, Australia taxes most trust income distributed to minors at 47 percent.

"We are considering allowing limited exclusions to this new rule - for example, for court-ordered trusts.

"We will also legislate to remove the ability of a company to elect the 19.5 percent resident withholding tax rate. Companies which choose the lower rate rather than the 33 cent corporate rate obtain a short-term timing advantage before the discrepancy is made good upon payment of provisional or terminal tax.

"The Government will develop and consult on these proposals over coming months with the aim of bringing them into effect by 1 April, next year," Dr Cullen said.

Hon Pete Hodgson  
Minister of Research, Science and Technology

### Investing in Knowledge

The Government will invest over $43 million in research, science and technology next year, an increase of more than 10 percent, Minister of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson said today.

The increase brings the total public investment in RS&T to $474 million. It includes a record injection of $20.8 million to partner private sector research and development.

"This is a Government that puts money where its mouth is when it comes to building a knowledge economy," Mr Hodgson said.

"We're providing the largest ever increase in Government support for private sector R&D because we want to stimulate it, not just complain about the lack of it. The support comprises a new $11.8 million grants programme and an increase of $9 million in funding for Technology New Zealand.

"We've opted for a grants approach rather than tax deductions because our advice was that grants were more effective. Tax deductions may be unavailable to innovative firms in the start-up phase, when the need for R&D support is often most urgent."

The extra funding for Technology New Zealand takes its budget to $24.7 million. The agency co-funds qualifying businesses to assess their technology needs, investigate new technology and place research graduates in industry.

"We have also increased public investment in basic research," Mr Hodgson said. "This is the work that builds New Zealand's knowledge base and leads to opportunities with major benefits for our society and the economy."

*   **The New Economy Research Fund** increases by $2.9 million to a total of $50.8 million. It opens up new areas of research with an identifiable potential to create whole new types of business for New Zealand.
*   **The Marsden Fund** increases by $2 million to $25.8 million. It supports curiosity-driven research at the frontiers of knowledge that has the potential to be of international significance.

Mr Hodgson said the Budget also introduced a more transparent way of allocating public investment in strategic research, replacing the Public Good Science Fund with five smaller, better targeted research funds.  
Some $36 million has been moved from the former PGSF to the New Economy Research Fund, as previously announced. The new research funds include:

*   **Maori Knowledge and Development**\- increased by $0.5 million to $3.99 million.
*   **Social Research** - increased by $0.6 million to $4.3 million.

In addition - **Health Research** has increased by $1.5 million to $33.4 million and funding of $0.55 million has been provided for the new Science and Innovation Advisory Council, which will provide advice directly to the Prime Minister on strengthening New Zealand's innovation system.

"This Budget represents a major commitment by the Government to developing New Zealand as a high-tech, high-skill, knowledge-based economy," said Mr Hodgson.

### Revenue Strategy

To generate the Government's revenue requirement at least possible economic cost, whilst supporting the Government's equity objectives

This in practice results in the following tax policy priorities:

*   maintaining revenue flows
*   minimising the economic costs of the tax system
*   tax simplification from both a compliance and an administrative perspective
*   maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that taxpayers meet their tax obligations, and reducing opportunities for avoidance
*   maintaining a direct taxation system augmented by broadly based indirect taxes
*   the implementation of policy through the generic tax policy process
*   a review of the overall tax system in terms of
    *   increasing fairness
    *   increasing economic efficiency
    *   the extent to which it encourages voluntary compliance.

### Tax Revenue Changes Since the 1999 Pre-Election Forecast

The tax revenue forecasts produced by the Treasury and Inland Revenue for this Budget include the effects of both policy changes and forecasting revisions made since detailed tax forecasts were previously published, in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update.

Policy measures which have been introduced by the present government, and incorporated into the tax revenue forecasts for the 2000 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update, include:

*   Cancellation of the previous government's planned personal tax rate reductions.
*   Introduction of a new income tax rate of 39% on personal incomes over $60,000.
*   Introduction of a new rate for Fringe Benefits Tax, originally at a fixed 64%, but subsequently revised to provide for rates varying with income of the recipient.
*   Increasing the floor for New Zealand Superannuation relative to average wages.
*   Introduction of rules attributing certain income streams to individuals.
*   Increases in the excise rate on tobacco.
*   A freeze on many tariff rates, replacing the planned phase down in these rates.

These changes will boost tax revenue, to a limited extent in the current year, but more significantly from 2000/01 onwards, with their full effect impacting from 2001/02. In 2000/01, the additional revenue is estimated at nearly $1.0 billion, while over the subsequent three years, it ranges from $1.2 to $1.3 billion.

In addition to these explicit policy measures, an improvement in prior year corporate profits, generally stronger than anticipated economic performance over the past eight months, and a more favourable economic outlook are all helping to boost tax revenues in the current year and over the forecast outlook period, to June 2004. As a consequence, upward adjustments have been made to tax revenue forecasts, on top of the policy effects.

Details of the revenue impact of the various policy measures, and of the changes due to economic and other forecasting factors, are shown in the table below.

How harmful is tax avoidance to the public interest? How effective or defective are the current rules? How can the current rules be improved? A generally accepted starting definition of tax avoidance is any lawful behaviour designed to avoid tax. Illegal behaviour constitutes tax evasion. In my opinion, this unrefined starting definition is sufficient to determine whether tax avoidance should be the subject of specific regulation, involving the refinement of its application to particular taxes. It is generally accepted amongst welfare economists that tax avoidance is harmful to the public interest. First, the government seeks to raise taxes to achieve its national welfare objectives, and tax avoidance undermines that objective. Secondly, tax avoidance is characterised by an excessive degree of tax influence in decisionmaking, which magnifies the dead-weight loss of the tax system. There are also equity arguments against tax avoidance. First, if government is to achieve its revenue target, unwanted tax avoidance results in a redistribution of the tax burden. Secondly, excessive tax avoidance will undermine the public's confidence in the tax system which will affect their willingness to comply with tax laws and procedures. I am unaware of any scientific study of the economic costs of avoidance in New Zealand. There are related measures however. The Report of the Committee of Experts, starting at page 152, provides some statistics on the black economy (a proxy for evasion), which shows that it hovers around 9% of GDP (c$9 billion), having a tax effect of around $3 billion, being c10% of taxes collected (c$31 billion). The second observation is that the economic definition of tax avoidance is likely to include any adverse tax induced behaviour, which would incorporate dead-weight losses. \[I note however that I do not support such a broad legal definition of tax avoidance on the basis that much of the behaviour causing these economic costs cannot be avoided by avoidance provisions\]. A 1994 New Zealand Business Roundtable study estimated deadweight losses to be 18% in respect of labour income. Given that the dead-weight loss on capital income would be higher (as capital is a more elastic factor), we can therefore say the Report estimates the minimum overall dead-weight loss in New Zealand from tax avoidance at $18 billion. The next question concerns the effectiveness of current tax avoidance rules. Tax avoidance is usually discussed in an income tax context, whereas such rules do exist outside the income tax, such as section 76 of the Goods and Services Act 1985. Indeed, avoidance legislation is sometimes enacted in non-tax legislation. For example the definition of a credit contract in the Credit Contracts Act 1981 includes the following limb: (4) Where, by virtue of any contract or contracts (none of which by itself constitutes a credit contract) or any arrangement, there is a transaction that is in substance or effect a credit contract, the contract, contracts, or arrangement shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a credit contract made at the time when the contract, or the last of those contracts, or the arrangement, was made, as the case may be. A further example is section 68 of the Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998 that states that: No person may at any time do anything to defeat the purposes of Parts 1 to 5. I have also reproduced in the attached Appendix, the present anti-avoidance provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Act 1985. There appears to be a lack of consensus in New Zealand about whether exsiting rules and approaches are effective. For example, the Valabh Committee was keen to revise the income tax avoidance rules, whereas, the Committee of Experts preferred they remain largely unaltered. Some commentators prefer that there be no general income tax avoidance provision, whereas others such provisions. And finally, there is a diversity of judicial approach across time and place to defining and applying avoidance provisions. Unfortunately, this cleavage of opinion contributes to an uncertain and unstable tax avoidance law. I consider that the test for adequacy of the existing rules turns on their ability to enable persons to predict that an anticipated arrangement, or determine that an actual arrangement, constitutes tax avoidance. A contrary argument is that an uncertain tax avoidance law increases the cost of tax avoidance transactions. In other words, risk averse taxpayers are more likely to engage in less tax avoidance around an uncertain boundary. I consider that an uncertain definition is more costly because it kills off legitimate transactions and complicates dispute resolution. Income tax legislation contains the most extensive range of specific avoidance provisions ("SAP's") in addition to a general avoidance provision ("GAP"). I consider that these provisions largely do not meet the test set out in the above paragraph. In particular, they do not specify the relationship between SAP's, the GAP and non-avoidance legislation. Furthermore, the GAP is incomplete. It defines tax avoidance in terms of avoidance of a liability to tax, but fails to specify when a normative liability has been avoided. This requires the Court to first determine whether the liability asserted by the taxpayer, the Commissioner, or some other liability, was the tax liability intended by the Legislature. This matter is not answered by the provision dealing with purpose or effect, because that provision relies on a starting definition of tax avoidance. The second general inadequacy concerns an unsettling of a traditional approach to the construction of taxing statutes. A number of English tax decisions have moved towards the North American tradition of relaxing the focus on a formal analysis of the facts and the statute, bearing in mind that the English judges still dominate our highest appellate Court. For example, in the House of Lords decision in IRC v McGuckian \[1997\] 3 All ER 817, Lord Steyn made the following remarks: It is necessary to distinguish between two separate questions of law. The first is whether there is a special rule applicable to the construction of fiscal legislation. The second question is whether there is a rule precluding the court from examining the substance of a composite tax avoidance scheme. I consider first the construction of tax statutes. Towards the end of the last century Pollock characterised the approach of judges to statutory construction as follows: "Parliament generally changes the law for the worse, and that the business of judges is to keep the mischief of its interference within the narrowest possible bounds": Essays on Jurisprudence and Ethics (1882), 85. Whatever the merits of this observation may have been when it was made, or even earlier in this century, it is demonstrably no longer true. During the last 30 years there has been a shift away from literalist to purposive methods of construction. Where there is no obvious meaning of a statutory provision the modern emphasis is on a contextual approach designed to identify the purpose of a statute and to give effect to it. But under the influence of the narrow Duke of Westminster doctrine tax law remained remarkably resistant to the new non formalist methods of interpretation. It was said that the taxpayer was entitled to stand on a literal construction of the words used regardless of the purpose of the statute: Pryce v Monmouthshire Canal and Railway Cos (1879) 4 App Cas 197, 202-203 ; Cape Brandy Syndicate v IRC \[1921\] 1 KB 64, 71 ; IRC v Plummer \[1980\] AC 896 . Tax law was by and large left behind as some island of literal interpretation. The second problem was that in regard to tax avoidance schemes the courts regarded themselves as compelled to adopt a step by step analysis of such schemes, treating each step as a distinct transaction producing its own tax consequences. It was thought that if the steps were genuine, ie not sham or simulated documents or arrangements, the court was not entitled to go behind the form of the individual transactions. In combination those two features - literal interpretation of tax statutes and the formalistic insistence on examining steps in a composite scheme separately - allowed tax avoidance schemes to flourish to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers. The result was that the court appeared to be relegated to the role of a spectator concentrating on the individual moves in a highly skilled game: the court was mesmerised by the moves in the game and paid no regard to the strategy of the participants or the end result. The courts became habituated to this narrow view of their role. On both fronts the intellectual breakthrough came in 1981 in Ramsay, and notably in Lord Wilberforce's seminal speech which carried the agreement of Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord Roskill and Lord Bridge of Harwich. Lord Wilberforce restated the principle of statutory construction that a subject is only to be taxed upon clear words at \[1982\] AC 300, 323C-D. To the question "what are clear words?" he gave the answer that the court is not confined to a literal interpretation. He added "There may, indeed should, be considered the context and scheme of the relevant Act as a whole, and its purpose may, indeed should, be regarded." This sentence was critical. It marked the rejection by the House of pure literalism in the interpretation of tax statutes. But that left the problem of the courts' self denying ordinance of not examining the true nature of a composite transaction. Lord Wilberforce observed, at p. 323H that the Duke of Westminster case did not compel the court to look at documents or transactions in blinkers, isolated from the context in which they properly belong. Lord Wilberforce concluded, at p. 326C-D: "... While the techniques of tax avoidance progress and are technically improved, the courts are not obliged to stand still. Such immobility must result either in loss of tax, to the prejudice of other taxpayers, or to Parliamentary congestion or (most likely) to both. To force the courts to adopt, in relation to closely integrated situations, a step by step, dissecting, approach which the parties themselves may have negated, would be a denial rather than an affirmation of the true judicial process. In each case the facts must be established, and a legal analysis made: legislation cannot be required or even be desirable to enable the courts to arrive at a conclusion which corresponds with the parties' own intentions." In other words, if it was shown that a scheme was intended to be implemented as a whole, legal analysis permitted the court in deciding a fiscal question to take into account the composite transaction. While Lord Tomlin's observations in the Duke of Westminster case \[1936\] AC I still point to a material consideration, namely the general liberty of the citizen to arrange his financial affairs as he thinks fits, they have ceased to be canonical as to the consequence of a tax avoidance scheme. Indeed, as Lord Diplock observed, Lord Tomlin's observations tells us little or nothing as to what method of ordering one's affairs will be recognised by the courts as effective to lessen the tax that would otherwise be payable: RC v Burmah Oil Co Ltd (1981) TC 200, 214-215 . The new Ramsay principle was not invented on a juristic basis independent of statute. That would have been indefensible since a court has no power to amend a tax statute. The principle was developed as a matter of statutory construction. That was made clear by Lord Wilberforce in Ramsay and is also made clear in subsequent decisions in this line of authority: see the review in the dissenting speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in Craven v White \[1989\] AC 398, 520C-521E . The new development was not based on a linguistic analysis of the meaning of particular words in a statute. It was founded on a broad purposive interpretation, giving effect to the intention of Parliament. The principle enunciated in Ramsay was therefore based on an orthodox form of statutory interpretation. And in asserting the power to examine the substance of a composite transaction the House of Lords was simply rejecting formalism in fiscal matters and choosing a more realistic legal analysis. Given the reasoning underlying the new approach it is wrong to regard the decisions of the House of Lords since Ramsay as necessarily marking the limit of the law on tax avoidance schemes. I do not believe the above approach has been traditional in New Zealand. For example, in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA), Richardson J summarised the position: The legal principles governing the ascertainment of the true legal character of a transaction are now well settled and for recent discussions in this Court it is sufficient to refer to Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 Buckley & Young Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485; (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271; (1978) 2 TRNZ 485, Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 586 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Smythe \[1981\] 1 NZLR 673. It frequently happens that the same result in a business sense can be attained by two different legal transactions. The parties are free to choose whatever lawful arrangements will suit their purposes. The true nature of their transaction can only be ascertained by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. Not on an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction measured by the results intended and achieved; or of the overall economic consequences to the parties; or of the legal consequences which would follow from an alternative course which they could have adopted had they chosen to do so. The forms adopted cannot be dismissed as mere machinery for effecting the purposes of the parties. It is the legal character of the transaction that is actually entered into and the legal steps which are followed which are decisive. That requires consideration of the whole of the contractual arrangement and if the transaction is embodied in a series of inter-related agreements they must be considered together and one may be read to explain the others. In characterising the transaction regard is had to surrounding circumstances: not to deny or contradict the written agreement but in order to understand the setting in which it was made and to construe it against that factual background having regard to the genesis and objectively the aim of the transaction. The only exceptions to the principle that the legal consequences of a transaction turn on the terms of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out are: (i) where the essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged and sham is established; and (ii) where there is a statutory provision, such as s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976, mandating a broader or different approach which applies in the circumstances of the particular case. A document may be brushed aside if an to the extent that it is a sham in two situations: (a) where the documents does not reflect the true agreement between the parties in which case the cloak is removed and recognition given to their common intentions (as happened in Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue); and (b) where the document was bona fide in inception but the parties have departed from their initial agreement while leaving the original documentation to stand unaltered. The reason why the Courts have adopted the approach I have been discussing is obvious enough. Commercial men are entitled to order their affairs to achieve the legal and lawful results which they intend. If they deliberately enter into a genuine transaction intended to operate according to its tenor, those intentions should be recognised. It is what they choose to do that counts and their rights and obligations should be determined on that basis except where the legislation has itself directed otherwise. I consider that the principles of statutory interpretation enunciated in McGuckian move tax law further away from the goals outlined in paragraph 7. The development of this line of cases in the United Kingdom occurred in the context of tax legislation that lacked a GAP. My crude observation is that the English House of Lords got fed up with tax schemes that flourished on the basis of more certain tax laws based on a formal and traditional analysis of transactions and statutes. I prefer the use of legislative avoidance provisions alongside a formal approach to tax legislation in general. I suspect that this particular issue would be highly controversial amongst lawyers, economists and accountants. Again, I would test the various approaches by assessing their impact on the overall certainty of the tax law. The final question for consideration is how existing tax avoidance law could be improved. The most difficult practical problem with such provisions is how to determine whether the arrangement undertaken is in accordance with legislative intent. I recommend a 2-tier approach. First, focus only on those arrangements in which a tax objective is dominant. Secondly, save those arrangements in which the Legislature can reasonably be regarded as condoning the tax consequence sought by the taxpayer. This second test is necessary to save those commercial decisions in which tax factors must predominate, such as an election to be a consolidated company for tax purposes. Finally, I would emphasise that avoidance provisions are a blunt instrument, and they should not be relied on to substantially mitigate the economic costs of avoidance activity. Tax systems should be designed in ways that reduce the returns to avoidance activities, the key design elements being: a broad tax base and a broad mix of bases; low tax rates; effective penalty and interest systems; effective disclosure and rulings regimes; effective policy formation and implementation; effective detection, audit, and dispute (including Court) resolution. APPENDIX General Avoidance Provisions Income Tax Act 1994 SECT OB 1 "TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT" In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - Tax avoidance arrangement means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly - Has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or Has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the purpose or effect is not merely incidental: SECT OB 1 "TAX AVOIDANCE", In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - Tax avoidance in sections BG 1, EH 1, \[EH 42,\] GB 1, and GC 12, includes - Directly or indirectly altering the incidence of any income tax: Directly or indirectly relieving any person from liability to pay income tax: Directly or indirectly avoiding, reducing, or postponing any liability to income tax: SECT OB 1 "LIABILITY" In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - Liability in the definition of "tax avoidance", includes a potential or prospective liability to future income tax: SECT OB 1 "ARRANGEMENT" In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - Arrangement means any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect: SECT BB 3.

Page 1 Tax Avoidance Revisited RA MCLEOD 6/2000 1. The purpose of this note is to discuss the definition, objectives and nature of avoidance rules by focussing on the following questions: 1.1. Is there a generally accepted concept of tax avoidance that enables a determination of whether tax avoidance should be regulated? 1.2. How harmful is tax avoidance to the public interest? 1.3. How effective or defective are the current rules? 1.4. How can the current rules be improved? 2. A generally accepted starting definition of tax avoidance is any lawful behaviour designed to avoid tax. Illegal behaviour constitutes tax evasion. In my opinion, this unrefined starting definition is sufficient to determine whether tax avoidance should be the subject of specific regulation, involving the refinement of its application to particular taxes. 3. It is generally accepted amongst welfare economists that tax avoidance is harmful to the public interest. First, the government seeks to raise taxes to achieve its national welfare objectives, and tax avoidance undermines that objective. Secondly, tax avoidance is characterised by an excessive degree of tax influence in decisionmaking, which magnifies the dead-weight loss of the tax system. There are also equity arguments against tax avoidance. First, if government is to achieve its revenue target, unwanted tax avoidance results in a redistribution of the tax burden. Secondly, excessive tax avoidance will undermine the public's confidence in the tax system which will affect their willingness to comply with tax laws and procedures. 4. I am unaware of any scientific study of the economic costs of avoidance in New Zealand. There are related measures however. The Report of the Committee of Experts, starting at page 152, provides some statistics on the black economy (a proxy for evasion), which shows that it hovers around 9% of GDP (c$9 billion), having a tax effect of around $3 billion, being c10% of taxes collected (c$31 billion). The second observation is that the economic definition of tax avoidance is likely to include any adverse tax induced behaviour, which would incorporate dead-weight losses. \[I note however that I do not support such a broad legal definition of tax avoidance on the basis that much of the behaviour causing these economic costs cannot be avoided by avoidance provisions\]. A 1994 New Zealand Business Roundtable study estimated deadweight losses to be 18% in respect of labour income. Given that the dead-weight loss on capital income would be higher (as capital is a more elastic factor), we can therefore say the Report estimates the minimum overall dead-weight loss in New Zealand from tax avoidance at $18 billion. Page 2 5. The next question concerns the effectiveness of current tax avoidance rules. Tax avoidance is usually discussed in an income tax context, whereas such rules do exist outside the income tax, such as section 76 of the Goods and Services Act 1985. Indeed, avoidance legislation is sometimes enacted in non-tax legislation. For example the definition of a credit contract in the Credit Contracts Act 1981 includes the following limb: (4) Where, by virtue of any contract or contracts (none of which by itself constitutes a credit contract) or any arrangement, there is a transaction that is in substance or effect a credit contract, the contract, contracts, or arrangement shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a credit contract made at the time when the contract, or the last of those contracts, or the arrangement, was made, as the case may be. A further example is section 68 of the Electricity Industry Reform Act 1998 that states that: No person may at any time do anything to defeat the purposes of Parts 1 to 5. I have also reproduced in the attached Appendix, the present anti-avoidance provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Act 1985. 6. There appears to be a lack of consensus in New Zealand about whether exsiting rules and approaches are effective. For example, the Valabh Committee was keen to revise the income tax avoidance rules, whereas, the Committee of Experts preferred they remain largely unaltered. Some commentators prefer that there be no general income tax avoidance provision, whereas others such provisions. And finally, there is a diversity of judicial approach across time and place to defining and applying avoidance provisions. Unfortunately, this cleavage of opinion contributes to an uncertain and unstable tax avoidance law. 7. I consider that the test for adequacy of the existing rules turns on their ability to enable persons to predict that an anticipated arrangement, or determine that an actual arrangement, constitutes tax avoidance. A contrary argument is that an uncertain tax avoidance law increases the cost of tax avoidance transactions. In other words, risk averse taxpayers are more likely to engage in less tax avoidance around an uncertain boundary. I consider that an uncertain definition is more costly because it kills off legitimate transactions and complicates dispute resolution. 8. Income tax legislation contains the most extensive range of specific avoidance provisions ("SAP's") in addition to a general avoidance provision ("GAP"). I consider that these provisions largely do not meet the test set out in the above paragraph. In particular, they do not specify the relationship between SAP's, the GAP and non-avoidance legislation. Furthermore, the GAP is incomplete. It defines tax avoidance in terms of avoidance of a liability to tax, but fails to specify when a normative liability has been avoided. This requires the Court to first determine whether the liability asserted by the taxpayer, the Commissioner, or some other liability, was the tax liability intended by the Legislature. This matter is not answered by the provision dealing with purpose or effect, because that provision relies on a starting definition of tax avoidance. 9. The second general inadequacy concerns an unsettling of a traditional approach to the construction of taxing statutes. A number of English tax decisions have moved towards the North American tradition of relaxing the focus on a formal analysis of the facts and the statute, bearing in mind that the English judges still dominate our highest appellate Court. For example, in the House of Lords decision in IRC v McGuckian \[1997\] 3 All ER 817, Lord Steyn made the following remarks: It is necessary to distinguish between two separate questions of law. The first is whether there is a special rule applicable to the construction of fiscal legislation. The second question is whether there is a rule precluding the court from examining the substance of a composite tax avoidance scheme. I consider first the construction of tax statutes. Page 3 Towards the end of the last century Pollock characterised the approach of judges to statutory construction as follows: "Parliament generally changes the law for the worse, and that the business of judges is to keep the mischief of its interference within the narrowest possible bounds": Essays on Jurisprudence and Ethics (1882), 85. Whatever the merits of this observation may have been when it was made, or even earlier in this century, it is demonstrably no longer true. During the last 30 years there has been a shift away from literalist to purposive methods of construction. Where there is no obvious meaning of a statutory provision the modern emphasis is on a contextual approach designed to identify the purpose of a statute and to give effect to it. But under the influence of the narrow Duke of Westminster doctrine tax law remained remarkably resistant to the new non formalist methods of interpretation. It was said that the taxpayer was entitled to stand on a literal construction of the words used regardless of the purpose of the statute: Pryce v Monmouthshire Canal and Railway Cos (1879) 4 App Cas 197, 202-203 ; Cape Brandy Syndicate v IRC \[1921\] 1 KB 64, 71 ; IRC v Plummer \[1980\] AC 896 . Tax law was by and large left behind as some island of literal interpretation. The second problem was that in regard to tax avoidance schemes the courts regarded themselves as compelled to adopt a step by step analysis of such schemes, treating each step as a distinct transaction producing its own tax consequences. It was thought that if the steps were genuine, ie not sham or simulated documents or arrangements, the court was not entitled to go behind the form of the individual transactions. In combination those two features - literal interpretation of tax statutes and the formalistic insistence on examining steps in a composite scheme separately - allowed tax avoidance schemes to flourish to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers. The result was that the court appeared to be relegated to the role of a spectator concentrating on the individual moves in a highly skilled game: the court was mesmerised by the moves in the game and paid no regard to the strategy of the participants or the end result. The courts became habituated to this narrow view of their role. On both fronts the intellectual breakthrough came in 1981 in Ramsay, and notably in Lord Wilberforce's seminal speech which carried the agreement of Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord Roskill and Lord Bridge of Harwich. Lord Wilberforce restated the principle of statutory construction that a subject is only to be taxed upon clear words at \[1982\] AC 300, 323C-D. To the question "what are clear words?" he gave the answer that the court is not confined to a literal interpretation. He added "There may, indeed should, be considered the context and scheme of the relevant Act as a whole, and its purpose may, indeed should, be regarded." This sentence was critical. It marked the rejection by the House of pure literalism in the interpretation of tax statutes. But that left the problem of the courts' self denying ordinance of not examining the true nature of a composite transaction. Lord Wilberforce observed, at p. 323H that the Duke of Westminster case did not compel the court to look at documents or transactions in blinkers, isolated from the context in which they properly belong. Lord Wilberforce concluded, at p. 326C-D: "... While the techniques of tax avoidance progress and are technically improved, the courts are not obliged to stand still. Such immobility must result either in loss of tax, to the prejudice of other taxpayers, or to Parliamentary congestion or (most likely) to both. To force the courts to adopt, in relation to closely integrated situations, a step by step, dissecting, approach which the parties themselves may have negated, would be a denial rather than an affirmation of the true judicial process. In each case the facts must be established, and a legal analysis made: legislation cannot be required or even be desirable to enable the courts to arrive at a conclusion which corresponds with the parties' own intentions." In other words, if it was shown that a scheme was intended to be implemented as a whole, legal analysis permitted the court in deciding a fiscal question to take into account the composite transaction. Page 4 While Lord Tomlin's observations in the Duke of Westminster case \[1936\] AC I still point to a material consideration, namely the general liberty of the citizen to arrange his financial affairs as he thinks fits, they have ceased to be canonical as to the consequence of a tax avoidance scheme. Indeed, as Lord Diplock observed, Lord Tomlin's observations tells us little or nothing as to what method of ordering one's affairs will be recognised by the courts as effective to lessen the tax that would otherwise be payable: RC v Burmah Oil Co Ltd (1981) TC 200, 214- 215 . The new Ramsay principle was not invented on a juristic basis independent of statute. That would have been indefensible since a court has no power to amend a tax statute. The principle was developed as a matter of statutory construction. That was made clear by Lord Wilberforce in Ramsay and is also made clear in subsequent decisions in this line of authority: see the review in the dissenting speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in Craven v White \[1989\] AC 398, 520C-521E . The new development was not based on a linguistic analysis of the meaning of particular words in a statute. It was founded on a broad purposive interpretation, giving effect to the intention of Parliament. The principle enunciated in Ramsay was therefore based on an orthodox form of statutory interpretation. And in asserting the power to examine the substance of a composite transaction the House of Lords was simply rejecting formalism in fiscal matters and choosing a more realistic legal analysis. Given the reasoning underlying the new approach it is wrong to regard the decisions of the House of Lords since Ramsay as necessarily marking the limit of the law on tax avoidance schemes. 10. I do not believe the above approach has been traditional in New Zealand. For example, in Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA), Richardson J summarised the position: The legal principles governing the ascertainment of the true legal character of a transaction are now well settled and for recent discussions in this Court it is sufficient to refer to Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 Buckley & Young Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485; (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271; (1978) 2 TRNZ 485, Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue \[1981\] 1 NZLR 586 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Smythe \[1981\] 1 NZLR 673. It frequently happens that the same result in a business sense can be attained by two different legal transactions. The parties are free to choose whatever lawful arrangements will suit their purposes. The true nature of their transaction can only be ascertained by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. Not on an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction measured by the results intended and achieved; or of the overall economic consequences to the parties; or of the legal consequences which would follow from an alternative course which they could have adopted had they chosen to do so. The forms adopted cannot be dismissed as mere machinery for effecting the purposes of the parties. It is the legal character of the transaction that is actually entered into and the legal steps which are followed which are decisive. That requires consideration of the whole of the contractual arrangement and if the transaction is embodied in a series of inter-related agreements they must be considered together and one may be read to explain the others. In characterising the transaction regard is had to surrounding circumstances: not to deny or contradict the written agreement but in order to understand the setting in which it was made and to construe it against that factual background having regard to the genesis and objectively the aim of the transaction. The only exceptions to the principle that the legal consequences of a transaction turn on the terms of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out are: (i)where the essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged and sham is established; and (ii)where there is a statutory provision, such as s 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976, Page 5 mandating a broader or different approach which applies in the circumstances of the particular case. A document may be brushed aside if an to the extent that it is a sham in two situations: (a)where the documents does not reflect the true agreement between the parties in which case the cloak is removed and recognition given to their common intentions (as happened in Marac Finance Ltd v Virtue); and (b)where the document was bona fide in inception but the parties have departed from their initial agreement while leaving the original documentation to stand unaltered. The reason why the Courts have adopted the approach I have been discussing is obvious enough. Commercial men are entitled to order their affairs to achieve the legal and lawful results which they intend. If they deliberately enter into a genuine transaction intended to operate according to its tenor, those intentions should be recognised. It is what they choose to do that counts and their rights and obligations should be determined on that basis except where the legislation has itself directed otherwise. 11. I consider that the principles of statutory interpretation enunciated in McGuckian move tax law further away from the goals outlined in paragraph 7. The development of this line of cases in the United Kingdom occurred in the context of tax legislation that lacked a GAP. My crude observation is that the English House of Lords got fed up with tax schemes that flourished on the basis of more certain tax laws based on a formal and traditional analysis of transactions and statutes. 12. I prefer the use of legislative avoidance provisions alongside a formal approach to tax legislation in general. I suspect that this particular issue would be highly controversial amongst lawyers, economists and accountants. Again, I would test the various approaches by assessing their impact on the overall certainty of the tax law. 13. The final question for consideration is how existing tax avoidance law could be improved. The most difficult practical problem with such provisions is how to determine whether the arrangement undertaken is in accordance with legislative intent. I recommend a 2-tier approach. First, focus only on those arrangements in which a tax objective is dominant. Secondly, save those arrangements in which the Legislature can reasonably be regarded as condoning the tax consequence sought by the taxpayer. This second test is necessary to save those commercial decisions in which tax factors must predominate, such as an election to be a consolidated company for tax purposes. 14. Finally, I would emphasise that avoidance provisions are a blunt instrument, and they should not be relied on to substantially mitigate the economic costs of avoidance activity. Tax systems should be designed in ways that reduce the returns to avoidance activities, the key design elements being: 14.1. a broad tax base and a broad mix of bases; 14.2. low tax rates; 14.3. effective penalty and interest systems; 14.4. effective disclosure and rulings regimes; 14.5. effective policy formation and implementation; 14.6. effective detection, audit, and dispute (including Court) resolution.

Government announces terms of tax inquiry
=========================================

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen today announced the terms of reference of the Government's forthcoming tax inquiry. The inquiry will have a broad focus, looking at four questions: whether the tax system can be fairer in its role of redistributing income; how the tax system can be designed to encourage desirable conduct such as work and saving and to discourage such undesirable behaviour as the wasteful use of non-renewable resources; how the level of tax that is reasonably required by the Government for the provision of essential social services can be achieved reliably in the medium and long term; and whether the tax system and tax rates need to be modified in light of new technology and international competition.

The inquiry will be conducted by a four-person panel, still to be announced, that will report to the Minister of Revenue and Minister of Economic Development.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Terms of Tax Inquiry

"The tax inquiry is intended to be architectural in nature. It will examine how the tax structure meets New Zealand's current and future needs," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"A top to bottom review is long overdue. The last one - the 1967 Ross Report - pre-dated the global economy, the deregulation of the financial sector, e-commerce and such important social developments as the rise of the two income household and the single parent family.

"These are all significant events carrying huge implications for the fairness and on-going viability of the tax system.

"The Government's decision to commission an inquiry developed out of these changes rather than out of any specific tax reform agenda.

"Indeed we have promised that we will not implement any significant new taxes without first seeking a mandate from the electorate through the 2002 general election," Dr Cullen said.

The inquiry will be independent and has been given a comprehensive brief which allows it to consider all relevant options. Stage One, to be completed by the end of July next year, will involve designing a set of principles to guide tax policy and the general structure of the tax system.

The Government will release this report and will make public its response to the Inquiry's recommendations. Stage Two will be devoted to developing concrete policy proposals for announcement by the Government before the end of the Parliamentary term.

"The Inquiry's focus will be deliberately broad. It will ask the following questions:

*   Can the tax system be fairer in its role of redistributing income? This includes: whether the income tax base should be broadened; the extent to which marginal tax rates should increase with income, wealth and expenditure; the best mix between different tax bases, such as income, consumption, financial transactions and assets.
*   How the tax system can be designed to encourage desirable conduct such as work and saving and to discourage such undesirable behaviour as the wasteful use of non-renewable resources.
*   How can the level of tax that is reasonably required by the Government for the provision of essential social services be achieved reliably in the medium and long term?
*   Do the tax system and tax rates need to be modified in light of new technology and international competition?

"The Inquiry will be conducted by a four-person panel which will report to me and to the Minister of Economic Development, Jim Anderton. Decisions about personnel are still being finalised.

"A provisional budget of $520,000 has been allocated for the exercise. This is not new expenditure. Instead the money has been provided by reprioritising within Vote: Finance.

"A full-time secretary, reporting to the Inquiry Chair, will be appointed. Analytic and secretariat support will be supplied by tax policy officials in Treasury and Inland Revenue. I would expect them to contribute significantly to the Inquiry's work.

"But the inquiry panel will also have the ability and the budget to engage outside experts for advice and assistance on specific issues.

"This is an important exercise which has the potential to lift the standard of the taxation debate in New Zealand and to substitute some of the heat for light," Dr Cullen said.

Select committee recommends changes to FBT, super fund withdrawal tax, FIF proposals
====================================================================================

Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee today reported to Parliament on the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill. Following its consideration of the bill, introduced in March, the committee has recommended substantial changes to the proposed legislation on the three-tier fringe benefit tax and superannuation fund withdrawal tax, both of which are intended to support the recent increase in the top personal tax rate to 39%. It has also recommended two "threshold" changes to the proposed amendments to the foreign investment fund rules to clarify how they apply to resident companies that migrate from New Zealand.

The amended bill, which includes the committee's commentary, is available at Bennetts Government Bookshops.

### FEC recommendations on the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill back to Parliament and recommended substantial changes to the SSCWT and FBT proposals contained in the bill, as introduced.

It has also recommended changes to the proposed amendments to the foreign investment fund rules. This legislative update outlines the major recommended amendments. They remain recommendations until the bill has had its second reading.

### Superannuation fund withdrawal tax

The bill provides for a fund withdrawal tax of 5% of an employer's contribution to the amount withdrawn from a superannuation fund. The measure is intended to counter avoidance through the use of superannuation funds of the already legislated increase in the top personal tax rate, effective from 1 April 2000.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has recommended a number of amendments to reduce compliance costs, reduce the number of withdrawals potentially subject to the tax, and increase the certainty of the rules.

#### Background

The specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT), set at 33%, is a tax on employers' monetary contributions to superannuation funds. Increasing the top personal tax rate to 39% and leaving the SSCWT rate unchanged at 33% introduced scope for avoidance. Employees earning over $60,000 could negotiate an increase in their employer superannuation contributions, subject to the 33% SSCWT rate, with a corresponding reduction in salary and wages subject to tax at 39%. They could withdraw the increased employer contributions shortly afterwards, thus avoiding the 39% top personal marginal tax rate.

The fund withdrawal tax is intended to remove this avoidance concern. It works by effectively applying a 5% tax on withdrawals which are not exempt.

#### Key features of the bill

The bill, as reported back from the committee, provides that:

*   A withdrawal tax of 5% of the amount withdrawn from a superannuation fund will apply to withdrawals on or after 31 July 2000. This tax will be restricted to the amount of the employer contribution on an employee's behalf if the trustee can identify this.
*   Existing contributions and contributions that continue at current levels will not be subject to the withdrawal tax. This was the intended position on introduction of the bill. The committee has recommended amendments which confirm this position.
*   The tax on a withdrawal is payable in the following income year. This measure is intended to address provisional tax and use-of-money interest issues. Exceptions to this rule exist in the case of a wind-up of a fund, or a fund that becomes a foreign superannuation fund.
*   Trustees can withhold the withdrawal tax on payment to a member or recover any amount necessary from a member to meet any withdrawal tax liability. The ability to withhold from payments made was recommended by the committee.
*   Trustees may request any information necessary to apply the withdrawal tax. Further, trustees are entitled to rely on the information provided as being correct unless there are reasonable grounds for them to believe the information is incorrect.

##### Withdrawal exemptions

*   The withdrawal tax does not apply when funds are withdrawn by members on or after they cease employment.
*   The bill provides that the withdrawal tax will not apply to withdrawals on the basis of significant financial hardship. A list of events which may give rise to significant financial hardship has been included by the committee to provide guidance to trustees.
*   The committee has also recommended that the withdrawal tax not apply to withdrawals to settle the division of matrimonial property upon separation.
*   The committee has recommended a reduction in the amount liable for the withdrawal tax for those earning less than $60,000. For each of the four income years preceding the year of withdrawal in which the member's taxable income and the employer specified superannuation contributions are less than $60,000, the withdrawal tax is reduced by 25%.
*   The committee has recommended that withdrawals made on the basis of partial retirement also be exempt. Partial retirement means that if all employer and employee contributions to a superannuation fund cease, the member of that fund works less than 30 hours per week and has reduced his or her working hours as a lead-in to full retirement, the member may make a withdrawal with no tax applying. The member must provide written notification that he or she does not intend to increase hours in paid employment in the future. The written notice also requires a statement by the member's employer or employers that there is no agreement that work hours will increase.
*   Withdrawals used to purchase a life annuity or pension, or an annuity or pension to be paid over 10 or more years, will not be subject to the withdrawal tax. The committee also recommends that withdrawals to meet fund administration costs and the costs of group and individual life, health, sickness or accident insurance on behalf of members be exempt.

##### Treatment of transfers to or from superannuation funds and superannuation schemes

The committee has recommended amendments to clarify the treatment of transfers of amounts between superannuation funds, as well as to and from superannuation schemes. Amounts moved between superannuation funds retain their nature if appropriate information is provided. When a superannuation fund invests in another superannuation fund or scheme, however, the investment in and withdrawals from the second superannuation fund or scheme are not transfers. This means that the notification provisions do not apply. Nor does the tax apply to the withdrawal from the second superannuation fund.

Amounts received from a superannuation scheme are treated as employee contributions with amounts paid to a superannuation scheme being treated as a withdrawal.

##### Defined benefit funds

The committee has recommended that withdrawals from defined benefit funds be taxable to the extent they are not member contributions or pre-1 April 2000 reserves.

##### Other features

*   Individual members may elect, with the approval of their employer, that a 39% SSCWT rate apply to specified superannuation contributions made by their employer on their behalf. Only employees who earn over $60,000 a year are likely to use this option.
*   Employers may elect to apply the optional 39% SSCWT rate from 1 October 2000.

At 5%, the fund withdrawal tax should remove any tax benefit for those earning over $60,000 from substituting employer contributions to a superannuation fund for salary and wages. However, the officials' report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the submissions received noted that the measure is anti-avoidance in nature and if significant revenue is received by way of this tax the rate will be reviewed.

##### Application date

The application date of the measures is 31 July 2000, the date the bill is to be reported back to Parliament. The grandparenting provisions, however, apply as at 1 April 2000.

### Multi-rate fringe benefit tax

The bill introduces a three-tier fringe benefit tax (FBT) system that will allow fringe benefits that can be attributed to an employee to be subject to FBT at a rate based on the employee's marginal tax rate.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has recommended a number of the amendments to remove avoidance opportunities and possible inefficiencies in remuneration decisions, clarify the rules and reduce compliance costs in certain circumstances.

#### Background

The FBT rate was increased to equate with the top personal tax rate of 39% to prevent high-income earners substituting salary or wages for fringe benefits to avoid the increase in the top personal tax rate. Without these changes, the 64% would have further exacerbated the over-taxation of low-income employees and would have overtaxed middle-income employees subject to a 33% personal tax rate.

The multi-rate fringe benefit system will generally allow employers to choose to apply a FBT rate based on the remuneration they pay to the employee receiving the benefit. Employers will continue to pay FBT on the value of benefits provided to or granted to employees.

#### Inclusion of the value of attributed benefits in the calculation of FBT payable

The bill, as introduced, provides for the fringe benefit tax payable on attributed benefits to be calculated by reference to the cash remuneration received by the employee from the employer who provided or granted the fringe benefit.

The committee has recommended that this calculation be amended to require the value of attributed fringe benefits to an employee to be taken into account in calculating the fringe benefit tax payable on those benefits. To enable this calculation to be undertaken a fringe benefit inclusive cash remuneration tax scale has been devised. This is a progressive tax scale that has the effect of taxing the value of the attributed fringe benefits on a marginal income basis, as opposed to a flat rate basis. The income scale is based on net income rather than gross income, with the individual tax rate scale grossed up, and is equivalent to the personal tax scale, taking into account the low income rebate. The fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration tax scale, which is set out in table 1, is applied to the aggregate of the net cash remuneration received by the employee and the value of the attributed benefits.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |TABLE 1 - RATES FOR ATTRIBUTED FRINGE BENEFITS
| Value of the fringe benefit-inclusive cash remuneration | Rate - cents in $ |
| Less than $8,075<br><br>More than $8,075 but less than $30,590<br><br>More than $30,590 but less than $45,330<br><br>More than $45,330 | 17.65<br><br>26.58<br><br>49.25<br><br>63.93 |

The new calculation requires the employer, for each employee to whom fringe benefits have been attributed, to:

1.  Calculate the net cash remuneration - this amount is the result of deducting the tax payable on the cash remuneration paid to the employee by that employer, as if that remuneration was the only income received, and taking into account the low income rebate.
2.  Add to the net cash remuneration the value of the attributed fringe benefits provided or granted to that employee.
3.  Calculate the tax payable on the aggregate of the net cash remuneration and the value of the attributed benefits using the rates in table 1.
4.  Deduct from the tax calculated in (3), the amount of tax calculated in (1) on the cash remuneration.
5.  The resultant amount is the FBT payable on the fringe benefits attributed to the employee.

The example demonstrates how the calculation would apply in practice.

Employee receives a salary of $50,000, a bonus of $2,000, and attributed fringe benefits valued at $5,000.

Calculate the net remuneration: $52,000 (gross cash remuneration) less $12,030 (tax on gross cash remuneration) = $39,970

Add the value of the attributed benefits to the net remuneration: $39,970 + $5,000 = $44,970

Calculate the tax payable on the fringe benefit inclusive cash remuneration using the tax rates in table 1: $14,491.86

Deduct from the tax calculated in (3) the tax payable on the gross cash remuneration: $14,491.86 - $12,030 = $2,461.86

In the example the employer would be required to pay $2,462.15 on the value of the attributed fringe benefits.

#### Requirement to annualise "cash remuneration"

The committee has recommended that the requirement to annualise "cash remuneration" such as salary and wages if the employee works only part of the year be removed.

#### Increase in threshold for catch-all category of fringe benefits - section CI 1(h)

The bill, as introduced, requires fringe benefits with a taxable value of more than $1,000 per category per year to which any one of paragraphs (d) to (h) of section CI 1 applies to be attributed to the employee to whom the benefit is provided or granted.

The committee has recommended that the attribution requirement apply when the value of the benefit is $1,000 or more. This recommendation clarifies the threshold level, since the bill, as introduced, does not cover the situation where the value was equal to $1,000. Furthermore, the committee has recommended that the threshold for benefits to which paragraph (h) of section CI 1 applies be increased to $2,000 or more per year.

These thresholds can be increased by the Governor-General by Order in Council.

#### Option for subsidised transport to be pooled

The committee has recommended that employers have the option to attribute or to pool subsidised transport to which paragraph (d) of section CI 1 applies if the taxable value of the benefit is $1,000 or more. This option applies only if the employer is not a close company (controlled by five or fewer persons) and all the employer's employees have the same or similar entitlement to the fringe benefit. If the employer decides to pool such benefits, the taxable value of the benefits will be taxed at 49%.

#### Principle recipient or user of fringe benefits

The bill, as introduced, requires the benefit to be attributed to the employee who principally used, enjoyed or received it. The committee has recommended that the bill be amended so that the employee who principally uses, enjoys or receives the benefit is determined by the use or enjoyment during the quarter. In the case of employers who file on an income year basis in respect of fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees, the usage or enjoyment during the income year will determine which shareholder-employee principally used, enjoyed or received the benefit. If no one employee has principally used, enjoyed or received the benefit, it is treated as a pooled benefit.

#### Requirement to pay 64% extended to the second quarter

Because the bill is not likely to be passed until early September, and Inland Revenue needs to undertake its systems changes and inform employers of the changes, the committee has recommended that all employers be required to pay FBT at 64% on fringe benefits provided during the second quarter beginning 1 July 2000. In other words, employers will not able to elect the 49% FBT rate for this quarter.

#### Employers unable to undertake final quarter calculation process

The committee has recommended that employers be able to pay FBT on all benefits provided during the 2000-01 year at the 64% flat rate. This provision will apply when an employer has elected to pay 49% on the benefits provided in the third quarter, but cannot for the final quarter undertake the calculation process of attributing benefits to individual employees and calculating the tax liability on those benefits owing to a lack of the systems and records necessary to do this. This provision will apply only for the 2000-01 year.

#### Pooled benefits

The bill, as introduced, requires pooled benefits to be taxed at 64% if one of the recipients of the pooled benefits was a major shareholder-employee, and at 49% in all other cases. The committee has recommended that employers be able to create two pools for such benefits. The first pool would include only those benefits for which one of the recipients is a major shareholder or associate of the major shareholder. This pool would be taxed at 64%. The second pool would include all other benefits for which none of the recipients is a major shareholder or associate. This pool would be taxed at 49%.

#### Due date for filing of return for final quarter

The bill, as introduced, provides two return filing and payment dates for the final quarter return, depending on whether an employer used the 64% flat rate or opted to attributed fringe benefits and undertake the final calculation. The committee has recommended that the filing and payment date for all final quarter returns be aligned to the 31st of May next following the end of the quarter.

#### Election irrevocable

The committee has recommended that the bill be clarified so that the filing of FBT return for any quarter is treated as an irrevocable election as to the rate elected by the employer.

### The FIF rules and company migration

The bill amends the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to clarify how they apply when a resident entity migrates from New Zealand.

The committee has recommended raising from $20,000 to $50,000 the threshold under which taxpayers with small interests in foreign entities are exempted from the FIF rules, in light of the time that has passed since the threshold was set.

For similar reasons the committee has also recommended raising from $100,000 to $250,000 the threshold below which taxpayers can elect to use the deemed rate of return method when calculating FIF income.

Russia-NZ DTA to be signed
==========================

The Government is expected to sign a double tax agreement with the Russian Federation tomorrow in Wellington. Two years in the making, the Russia-New Zealand agreement will bring to 27 the number of New Zealand DTAs in force with other countries. The new DTA will come into force once both countries have completed domestic procedures to give legal effect to the signed agreement, which in New Zealand will require an Order in Council. The DTA is expected to apply in New Zealand from 1 January 2001 for withholding tax, and from the 2001-02 income year for all other income tax.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Goff to sign Double Tax Agreement with Russia

Foreign Minister Phil Goff and Russian First Deputy Minister of Finance, Dr Sergei Shatalov, will sign a Double Tax Agreement between New Zealand and Russia tomorrow.

"The Agreement will help to reduce the costs for New Zealanders doing business in Russia. It is the most significant agreement signed with Russia since the establishment of the Russian Federation," Mr Goff and Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue said.

"Russia is one of our largest markets for dairy products and offers significant potential for other kinds of business. This agreement will go a long way to reduce the tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment in that country."

"Double tax agreements help trade and investment by better integrating the income tax systems of the two countries involved. For example, they prevent businesses being taxed twice on income they earn in another country, once in that country and again at home.

"Double tax agreements provide greater certainty about future taxation, reduce compliance costs on short-term activities, and lower tax on some income. They also assist enforcement of the law by allowing the exchange of information between tax authorities.

Mr Goff will meet Dr Shatalov in Wellington tomorrow at 3.30pm and they will sign the agreement then.

The Ministers said that the agreement with Russia will extend to 27 the number of double tax agreements in force with our main trading partners.

Key features of the Russia-New Zealand double tax agreement are:

*   New Zealanders will pay non-resident withholding tax of no more than 15% for dividends derived from Russia, 10% for interest, and 10% for royalties.
*   The profits of New Zealand businesses will generally be exempt in Russia if the business is of a temporary nature.
*   Mobile activities such as consultancy, building and construction sites, installation and assembly projects, and natural resource exploration and exploitation must be conducted in Russia for more than 12 months before Russia can tax the income.
*   Income from professional services can be taxed in Russia only if the person performing the services is present for more than 183 days or has a fixed base there.
*   New Zealand employees working in Russia will generally not be taxed by Russia unless they spend more than 183 days there.
*   Profits from insurance, coastal shipping, domestic air transport and real property (including agriculture and forestry) can be taxed in the country in which they are situated, even if the activity is of a temporary nature.
*   Pensions paid by the government of either state can be taxed in both states (although in the case of the state of residence of the recipient, the taxing right is limited to 50% of the amount of the pension. All other pensions and annuities are to be taxed solely by the state of residence.
*   Certain forms of discriminatory tax treatment between non-residents by either tax authority are prohibited.

Russians living or carrying on a business in New Zealand will enjoy similar benefits.

The agreement is expected to apply in New Zealand from 1 January 2001 for withholding tax, and from the 2001-02 income year for all other income tax.

Select committee recommends changes to GST proposals, anti-avoidance "attribution rule"
=======================================================================================

Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back to Parliament on the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced in May. The main changes recommended by the committee relate to the proposed GST legislation and the "attribution rule", a measure designed to counter avoidance of the 39% top personal tax rate.

### FEC recommendations on Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back to Parliament on the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and recommended several changes to the legislation proposed in the bill. The main recommendations relate to the proposed GST legislation and to the "attribution rule", a measure designed to counter avoidance of the 39% top personal tax rate.

This report outlines the main changes recommended by the committee. They remain recommendations until the bill has had its second reading.

[The Attribution Rule](/news/2000/2000-09-12-select-committee-recommends-changes-gst-proposals-anti-avoidance-attribution-rule#attributionrule)

* * *

### Goods and Services Tax

The GST proposals are wide-ranging and include extensive base maintenance, compliance cost and remedial measures. The main amendments to the proposals recommended by the committee are as follows:

#### Input tax credits for "changes in use" of imported goods

The bill removes any ability to claim an input tax credit when an asset that has previously been outside the New Zealand tax base, and has not therefore been used in making taxable supplies, starts to be used to make supplies in New Zealand.

The provision in the bill will apply from 1 October 1986, subject to a savings provision for claims agreed to in writing by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before the date of introduction of the bill. The committee recommended clarification of the savings provision so that it will apply to:

*   input tax credit claims which the Commissioner has paid or agreed to pay before the date of the introduction of the bill; and
*   claims of which the Commissioner has not been specifically notified other than by inclusion in a GST return before introduction date.

#### "Associated persons" definition

The bill amends the existing definition of "associated persons" to include categories of persons between whom there is a degree of connection sufficient to justify their inclusion. Some submissioners expressed concern, based on one interpretation, that the definition in the bill, as it was introduced, is unduly broad. The committee considered that the general scope of the proposed definition is appropriate but recommended two minor amendments to the universal tripartite test to ensure that the definition is not interpreted more broadly than intended.

#### Deregistration

Under the bill as introduced, taxpayers contemplating the sale of high-value appreciating assets (such as real property) after the legislation is enacted might be encouraged to change the use of their property from business to private, make a one-off output tax adjustment for the change in use and then sell the property in their private capacity. This would effectively avoid the provision in the bill aligning the treatment of assets sold immediately before deregistration and assets retained on deregistration by requiring output tax in the latter case to be paid on a market value basis. To remove such opportunities, the committee has recommended a specific anti-avoidance measure to provide that a deemed supply would not arise if a taxpayer were contemplating the sale of the asset for which a change in use was claimed.

#### Deferred settlements

The bill addresses a revenue risk caused by the difference between the time at which GST is returned (if the vendor accounts for GST on a payments basis) and an input tax credit claimed. (If the purchaser is on the invoice basis this will be immediately.) The bill was drafted to exclude transactions when settlement is required within 93 days. Submissioners commented on whether there was a need for amendments to target deferred settlements and also noted that the 93-day grace period would not be sufficient for some business transactions. While the committee considered that reform is necessary to prevent the growing number of deferral arrangements, it acknowledged that the proposal could be narrowed in its focus so as to ensure that genuine transactions are not caught. The committee therefore recommended that the time period in which a deferred settlement will not be subject to the proposed amendments be extended from 93 days to 365 days.

#### Last day of taxable period

The bill, as introduced, limited the extent to which taxpayers are able to use an alternative day as the last day of their taxable period. This change was recommended as some taxpayers have been able to use the existing right to choose an alternative last day of taxable period to obtain sizeable tax timing advantages.

In the submission process, however, new issues were raised concerning the ability of exporters to mitigate the cash flow disadvantages of GST. In the committee's view, these issues require further analysis. The committee has recommended that the relevant clauses be removed from the bill and that officials report to the Government after further consideration of the cash flow impacts of GST on exporters.

#### One-off adjustments for changes from non-taxable to taxable use

There is currently some doubt as to whether it is possible to make one-off, rather than periodic, adjustments for assets with a value in excess of $10,000. For assets shifting from non-taxable to taxable use the bill, as introduced, did not extend the ability to make one-off claims beyond a proposed threshold of $18,000. This was to protect the revenue.

The committee received a submission, however, that significant compliance costs would arise from this limitation if assets that exceed $18,000 regularly undergo a 100 percent change in use. To address this concern, and at the same time reduce the revenue risk in providing one-off adjustments, the committee has recommended that a one-off adjustment be allowed at the discretion of the Commissioner in these circumstances. Before the Commissioner approves such an adjustment the taxpayer will have to satisfy a number of statutory criteria, including that one-off adjustments are also made for taxable to non-taxable changes in use.

#### General insurance

To address concerns expressed by the Insurance Council, the committee has recommended the following changes to the bill affecting the treatment of general insurance:

*   The clause that would impose a GST liability on an insured person in relation to an insurance payment to a third party (if registered for GST) should be amended to place the liability instead on the third party when that party receives the payment. This change is recommended to reduce significant compliance costs that the industry might otherwise face.
*   Further amendments should be made to clarify the treatment of subrogation payments received by insurers and the availability of an input tax credit for such payments.

As introduced, the bill provided that payments to registered recipients for losses incurred in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity are taxed. However, the committee considered that the issue needs further consideration in the wider context of financial services. It has therefore recommended that amendments affecting the treatment of interest included in subrogation payments be removed and the issue deferred for further consideration as part of the planned review of the GST treatment of financial services.

#### Definition of input tax

Some submissions suggested that the reform of the definition of "input tax" did not go far enough to resolve inconsistencies that existed between the application of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The committee has recommended that further legislative amendments be made to make the reforms more effective. These changes will make it easier for agents of non-resident principals (who are selling the non-resident's goods in New Zealand) to claim an input tax credit for GST levied at the border.

The committee has also recommended changes to ensure that:

*   when an asset is imported but is unsuitable for its intended use, a refund of any GST paid at the border is still available;
*   agents involved merely in delivering goods cannot obtain refunds of GST paid in those goods.

#### Tokens, stamps and vouchers

The bill provides that the supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher redeemable for goods and services will be recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is acquired. However, to reduce the compliance costs that may arise in some cases, there will be an option for the supplier to account for GST when a token, stamp or voucher with a monetary face value is redeemed.

The committee has recommended the following changes to the bill to clarify the GST treatment of tokens, stamps and vouchers:

*   The option to return GST on the redemption of a token, stamp or voucher will only affect the issuer of the token, stamp or voucher and the supplier of the goods and services specified in the token, stamp or voucher. Therefore a registered person who chooses to on-sell a voucher rather than redeem it for goods and services will be required to return GST when the voucher is sold, not when it is redeemed by the purchaser.
*   The option to return GST on the redemption of a token, stamp or voucher will apply only if it is not practical for the issuer to return GST when it is supplied and the issuer of the token, stamp or voucher and the supplier of the goods and services specified in the token, stamp or voucher agree that GST is to be returned on redemption.

#### Time of supply for rates

The GST Act deems a supply of goods and services by a local authority to occur when any amount of rates is payable to the local authority. The bill provides that the time of supply will be the earlier of:

*   the date on which an instalment notice is issued if the instalment notice requires payment by a particular date;
*   the date on which payment is required by the instalment notice;
*   the date on which payment is received.

A submission on the bill raised a potential problem with routine notices of levy unintentionally triggering the time of supply. The committee agreed that notices of levy should not trigger a supply for GST purposes in relation to annual rates. It has recommended that a minor amendment be made to the bill to ensure that a GST liability arises in relation to each separate instalment payment, rather than the total amount of rates payable for the year.

#### Going concerns

The transfer of a going concern between registered persons is zero-rated for GST purposes. The bill as introduced provided that the test for a going concern is applied at the time of supply, and to qualify for zero rating the purchaser must be able to continue to carry on the activity as a going concern. Submissioners considered that the proposed amendment meant that the test would have to be met twice, once when the agreement for the sale and purchase is agreed, and again when the business is transferred, and that this "two tier test" would give rise to additional compliance costs.

The committee agreed that further clarification is desirable and has recommended that the bill be amended to provide that zero rating will apply to the supply of a taxable activity or part of a taxable activity that is a going concern at the time of supply if at that time:

*   the supply is agreed in writing by the supplier and the recipient to be the supply of a going concern; and
*   the supplier and the recipient intend that the supply is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the recipient.

#### Tax invoices

One submission on the bill considered that the Tax Administration Act should be amended so as to reinstate the failure to issue a tax invoice within 28 days after a request as a specific offence. The committee agreed and has recommended that such failure be an absolute penalty offence so that a fine not exceeding $4,000 could be imposed for the first offence, increasing to $8,000 for the second offence and $12,000 for the third and subsequent offences

### The Attribution Rule

The attribution rule is an anti-avoidance measure aimed at ensuring that in defined circumstances a person's income from personal exertion is attributed to that person for tax purposes.

*   The rule was to apply only when all of the following criteria are met:
*   The personal service provider (person C) and the interposed entity (person B) are associated.
*   Eighty percent of the gross income from the services of person B is derived from one source (person A or an associate of person A).
*   Eighty percent of the gross income from the services of person B relates to the services personally provided by person C and related persons.
*   Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the income from services.

Example:

![Example: Attribution rule](/-/media/project/ir/tp/news/2000/2000-09-12-select-committee-recommends-changes-gst-proposals-anti-avoidance-attribution-rule/2000-09-12-example-attribution-rule.gif?sc_lang=en&modified=20200910060355&hash=AB22C17F205B91F877831EF8C2FCF13B)

If all four criteria are met, the $99,000 net income of the intermediary will be attributed for tax purposes to Person C, the personal services provider.

This attribution is required for tax purposes only. It is expected that the accounting treatment will frequently follow the tax treatment. In most cases where it could apply, the intermediary's personal service income will be paid out to the personal services provider as salary, so the rule will not actually apply. This outcome is in accordance with the policy.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has recommended a number of changes to the attribution rule following its consideration of the bill and submissions. These changes result in more targeted legislation while leaving the core rule intact. They include:

#### Two way transfers of provisional tax

The committee has recommended that transfers of provisional tax from the intermediary to the high income earner and vice versa be allowed. Specifically:

*   These transfers will be allowed where the attribution rule could have applied.
*   Only overpaid tax can be transferred.
*   The transfer can be at the provisional tax payment dates.

This is proposed via a new section MB 9A which largely mirrors the existing section MB 9, which concerns transfers of provisional tax between group companies.

#### A new threshold

The committee has recommended that the attribution rule not apply when the income of the personal service provider is less than $60,000 after attribution. Although this will not lower compliance costs for individuals whose post-attribution income is around $60,000, where the income is obviously lower it will be clear that the rule does not apply. This will reduce compliance costs.

When two associated persons are providing the services, the income of both has to be under $60,000 for the rule not to apply.

#### Potential double tax of companies

As introduced, the bill provided scope for the amount attributed to be subject to tax twice when the attribution rule was applied to intermediaries that are companies. Instead, the committee has recommended that when the attribution rule applies, the company is to receive an extra imputation credit at 33% of the amount attributed. This will ensure that any dividend sourced from the personal services income can be imputed and is therefore not subject to double tax.

#### Ancillary personal services

The committee has recommended that when personal services are provided in association with a product also provided by the intermediary, the attribution rule not apply when the services are an ancillary but integral part of the product.

#### Other amendments

The committee has also recommended a number of minor amendments including:

*   ensuring that partners who provide administrative services to a partnership are not disadvantaged;
*   eliminating the potential double tax issue for trusts;
*   not applying the rule when both the intermediary and the personal services provider are non-resident;
*   ensuring that assets subject to finance lease and hire purchase can be counted as substantial assets;
*   allowing loss offset from losses carried forward when they have arisen from the derivation of income from personal services - this is targeted at businesses starting up.
*   applying the substantial assets 20 percent private use rule to all assets, not just to vehicles;
*   restricting the application of the relative and associated persons tests.

This makes New Zealand unusual in the OECD world. We inherited our lack of capital gains taxation, along with most of our other legal and constitutional framework, from the English. By contrast with other countries (the USA, UK, Canada and Australia) with a similar inheritance, we have retained an income tax that does not include capital gains as income. This paper, therefore, uses New Zealand as a sort of case study of what life is like without capital gains being taxed. I comment on this from my perspective, that of someone who was a tax practitioner and is now a tax enforcer or at least a tax policy adviser. I should point out at this juncture that the views in this paper are my own and not necessarily those of the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department or the views of the New Zealand Government. To describe what life is like without a capital gains tax it is necessary to define more precisely what the term means. As a general rule, capital gains do not form part of income for the purposes of our income tax system. Indeed, our Courts have held that our income tax law does not even recognise the concept of capital gains. In our law it is not exempt or untaxed income; it has no legal recognition. This means, for example, that there is no requirement to apportion interest expenses between expenses that relate to the derivation of taxed income and expenses relating to capital gains. Nor does New Zealand have a capital gains tax separate from the income tax, although matters do not stop there. Our income tax legislation (the Income Tax Act 1994) includes within �income� many forms of gain that in the absence of specific legislation would generally be considered capital gains. Each such provision has its own history, but very broadly, since income tax was first introduced in New Zealand, in 1891, our Parliament has considered it necessary to prevent people from characterising otherwise taxable income as untaxed capital gain. The result is detailed and often complex legislation. I shall describe that legislation in outline form. The important point is that it seems a bit simplistic to describe a tax system as one that does or does not tax capital gains. Any income tax that left all capital gains tax-free would be unworkable. On the other hand, I am not aware of any income tax that taxes all capital gains in all circumstances. The issue is always to what extent capital gains are taxed. From a policy perspective, the issue is to what extent capital gains should be taxed. Different countries have positioned themselves at different points along a spectrum from fully untaxed to fully taxed. New Zealand is towards the untaxed end of the spectrum. Even so, for some asset types we would be located towards the extreme of the fully taxed end of the spectrum. Debt instruments and certain overseas equity holdings of residents are examples of these asset types. In these cases New Zealand legislation can tax all capital gains on a full accrual basis. Bearing these points in mind, this paper focuses on the effect of this income tax that does not bring to tax capital gains. My first point here is that New Zealand is an example that totally refutes Professor Herbert Grubel�s following claim: �If the capital gains tax were abandoned completely, many government employees, and private sector tax accountants and lawyers could be re-employed to produce goods and services valued by society more than the enforcement and manipulation of the tax code.� I am an accountant and a lawyer, and I can assure you that I have for many years been very gainfully employed both in manipulating and enforcing tax legislation that has no specific capital gains tax. Indeed, in both my private sector and public sector work, manipulating and enforcing the border between taxed income and untaxed gains has been a central part of that work. Simplicity has not been the outcome of a lack of capital gains tax in New Zealand. Nor is there much evidence to suggest that the absence of taxes on capital gains has had a marked effect on investment, capital markets and overall economic performance. A possible but unlikely exception here is the propensity for New Zealanders to hold their wealth in the form of real property. From my perspective, the most marked effect of not having a specific capital gains tax has been on the inconsistencies and complexity of our income tax rules that have resulted. Our income tax system is especially open to manipulation as a direct result of not having a general body of rules taxing capital gains. Moreover, in some areas our tax rules defy policy logic, creating problems that defy an obvious policy solution for this same reason. It is this aspect on which the paper focuses. Personally, I am neither a zealot for a capital gains tax, nor am I a vehement opponent of introducing one. The issue requires a detailed weighing up of arguments for and against taxing capital gains. For those who oppose this form of taxation, New Zealand is an example of how the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill. New Zealand Income Tax Law New Zealand has two main forms of taxation: income tax and Goods and Services Tax (a VAT). The income tax is levied as one tax across personal, business and investment income. There is no separate set of tax rules for the corporate sector or any other sector. New Zealand�s income tax legislation leaves the term �income� undefined. Tax is levied on all income derived by every person but there is no comprehensive statutory definition of what income is. That has been filled out by our judiciary. The judiciary turned to trust law and other precedents for a definition of income. In general, this meant that most increases in the value of assets, other than trading stock, were excluded from the tax base. This was generally derived from trust law concepts that differentiated the interests of the life tenant (entitled to income) from the interests of the remainder man (entitled to capital and so to the realisation of capital assets of the trust). This is what is meant by not taxing capital gains. It is divorced from any economic concept. As New Zealand�s 1988 Royal Commission on Social Policy commented: �With hindsight it seems surprising that concepts of trust law were considered an appropriate substitute for a direct focus on economic efficiency and equity concerns in the raising of taxes�. In practice, the distinction between income and capital gains is difficult to apply. The Privy Council noted in BP Australia Limited v FCT that the distinction is �sometimes difficult to draw and leads to distinctions of some subtlety between profit that is made �out of� assets and profit that is made �upon� assets or �with� assets.� An example of this difficulty can be found in the investment area. An entity holding a portfolio of shares, such as a mutual fund, is usually taxed on profits on realisation. The rationale is that shares held in a portfolio are on revenue account because selling shares is a normal part of the business of such an entity. A small investor holding shares directly, on the other hand, can realise a tax-free capital gain. New Zealand�s Inland Revenue Department has held that a share portfolio that is determined by an index based on listed shares does not hold those shares on revenue account and can make tax-free capital gains. That is because its share purchases and sales are not part of a business but determined by the requirements of the index. This provides a tax incentive for investments in passive funds rather than actively managed funds. This ill-defined capital/revenue boundary provides many opportunities for tax advisers and many problems for the revenue authority. In a trust situation, the courts can refer to the intention of the settlor to help determine what is income and what is capital. In a tax situation the intention of the taxpayer is invariably to make all gains capital and all expenses deductible on revenue account. Hence to protect the tax base it has been found necessary to bring into taxable income many items that would otherwise have been tax-free capital gains. The following are some examples of how New Zealand has legislatively broadened what is included in taxable income. Gains from the sale of personal property Profits or gains from the sale of property where the taxpayer is a dealer in such property are taxable. It appears that the legislative intent was to tax those who were dealers in property of a particular type even if the property on which the profit was made was held by the person for other purposes. The courts, however, have restricted the provision to trading assets that would have been on revenue account in any case. All profits or gains from the sale of property acquired for the purpose of sale are taxable. This means, broadly, that shares acquired for their dividend yield give rise to untaxed gains, while those acquired for their capital yield do not. The provision has given rise to lengthy case law distinctions between property acquired with the purpose of sale (taxable) and those acquired with the intention of sale (not taxable). Gains from profit-making undertakings or schemes are also made taxable by legislation. Again, however, the courts interpreted the provision out of existence by requiring the gains to be taxable as ordinary income before the provision operates. Land transactions New Zealand income tax legislation has detailed and complex provisions bringing many gains on land transactions into the tax net. This was to counter the situation whereby land developers and builders became, in effect, untaxed occupations. In broad terms, we tax gains on the sale of land acquired with an intention of resale, gains made by land dealers, developers and builders and gains arising from the rezoning, subdivision or development of land. There are exceptions for private residences, business premises and farmland. Income from debt instruments The difficulty of sustaining the traditional capital/revenue distinction is particularly acute with respect to debt instruments. In the UK, profits on discounts of financial instruments were made taxable as early as 1805. If a lender can make a return that is taxable by way of coupon payments or tax-free by way of a redemption payment, it is likely that the lender will prefer the latter. Since 1986 New Zealand has effectively removed the capital/revenue distinction for debt instruments and taxed all gains as they accrue. Foreign investment fund rules New Zealand aims to tax the worldwide income of its residents. This includes income derived by offshore companies and similar entities. Since it is not possible to subject foreign entities to tax, as a proxy for this New Zealand levies an accrued capital gains tax on all foreign portfolio equity investment if the companies are not resident in one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the UK and USA. Other provisions Other New Zealand legislative provisions tax the following: redundancy payments, lease premiums, site goodwill on sale of a business, royalties, income from patents and copyright, and income from the sale of forests and petroleum mining interests. The Results It is difficult to see evidence that New Zealand�s lack of a capital gains tax has had a major impact on our capital markets. The New Zealand stock exchange has not been noted for its high performance. The stock exchange capital index still remains below the high it achieved in October 1987. In any case, New Zealand listed shares are strongly influenced by non-resident investors who hold up to 40% of the value of total market capitalisation. Such shareholders have been the marginal investors and are generally unaffected by domestic tax rules on mobile capital. Under international rules, which New Zealand follows, investors with no establishment in a foreign country are not taxed on capital gains in that country. There is also little evidence that lack of a capital gains tax has encouraged entrepeneurial endeavour. New Zealand�s post-war economic performance has been well below the OECD average. Moreover, New Zealand has one of the lowest levels of business expenditure on research and development in the OECD. In 1997/98, our business expenditure on R&D was 0.32% of GDP compared with an average of 1.48% of GDP. The Government is considering ways to encourage business investment in R&D. The absence of a capital gains tax may have encouraged New Zealanders to invest heavily in real property, especially housing. New Zealand�s home ownership ratio (percentage of homeowners as a proportion of the household population) is a bit higher than most OECD countries (73% compared with 66% in the UK, 60% in Canada and over 60% in the USA). The most significant difference, however, arises when comparing housing investment as a proportion of total investment. Housing represents approximately 70% of total net assets for New Zealand households, while it represents only about 30% of US total net assets. One explanation for this is that New Zealanders are simply poorer, so that the same level of home ownership constitutes a higher percentage of wealth. The result is that New Zealand holdings of financial assets are relatively low. In 1998 approximately 15% of assets were holdings in investment intermediaries (superannuation, life insurance and mutual funds), 14% in bank accounts and only 1.4% in private share holdings. Although the pattern of New Zealand savings is clear, it is less clear that this can be attributed to tax causes. As explained later, the most tax-favoured form of investment � direct equity � constitutes a very small proportion of household assets. Debt instruments and equity held through intermediaries are not tax-favoured to the same extent but constitute a much higher proportion of wealth. The average real capital gain on housing since 1960 has been, in real terms, towards 1% per annum. A far higher return (estimated at 2% to 2.5% per annum real) has come in the form of untaxed imputed rental income. Not fully taxing imputed rental income is a feature of most tax systems (where housing is a less dominant feature of investment) and in New Zealand is significantly clawed back by not allowing mortgage interest deductions. It is likely that many years of high inflation, government subsidies and controlled interest rates (often negative in real terms) that applied until the late 1980s have been more influential than the tax system in setting the pattern of private investment in New Zealand. Similarly, our economic performance has probably been influenced more by broader economic issues than by the absence of a capital gains tax. A concern that has been raised by countries with a capital gains tax is that, in the absence of such a tax, there could be an incentive for the excessive reinvestment of business profits. As well as eroding the tax base by encouraging the transformation of otherwise taxable income into non-taxable gains, this could incur a high economic cost by locking capital into existing firms with a lower rate of return than new firms. There is no evidence of this being a consequence of the lack of a capital gains tax in New Zealand. The average dividend yield of New Zealand�s listed companies is about 5% to 7% per annum. That is high by world standards. Smaller companies tend to distribute most of their available income to the owners. The reasons for this are likely to lie in the overall structure of the tax system. Obviously, where there is a choice between providing owners with a return that could be either taxable (salary or dividends) or non-taxable (capital gain), owners will prefer the non-taxable form of return. In New Zealand, however, salaries are deductible and dividends carry credits for tax paid at the corporate level. Until 1 April 2000, the company rate was equal to the top personal marginal tax rate (33%). This meant that any tax on distribution of income taxed at the company level was offset by a deduction or tax credits. Indeed, because of the progressive tax scale there could be incentives to distribute income. That occurs when the recipient of the distribution is on a low tax rate (say, a spouse or child on 19.5%), whereas the salary deduction is taken at a 33% rate. There has always been an incentive in New Zealand not to distribute non-taxable company income (such as capital gains) in a taxable form. This has led to some retention of income and then tax planning to return it in a non-taxable manner. It should be noted, however, that merely selling a company pregnant with non-taxable profits is not a solution. It merely passes the problem of extracting those profits tax-free to someone else. From 1 April 2000, New Zealand�s top personal marginal tax rate was increased from 33% to 39%. The company and trustee tax rates remained at 33%. It is likely that this will lead to an increase in profit retention. That will be balanced by the increased advantage from income splitting by making distributions to low-tax rate family members. In general, however, it is the overall nature of the tax system, such as the rate structure and the manner in which dividends are taxed, that can lead the tax system to encourage excessive profit retention. The presence or absence of a capital gains tax seems peripheral. Problems created by not taxing capital gains The conclusion of the previous section was that the absence of a capital gains tax has not had an easily identifiable impact on the economy. Earlier, however, I described some of the complexities of New Zealand income tax legislation caused by not taxing capital gains. Why the legislative complexity in the absence of discernible impacts? The answer is that while it may be difficult to attribute any underperformance of our economy to the absence of a capital gains tax, the absence of such a tax has caused us significant problems. This is the result of it leaving a structural weakness in the income tax base. The concept of a capital gain is not an economic concept; it is a concept from equity law. By not taxing capital gains a type of income return is removed from the income tax base in a rather ad hoc fashion. Two consequences flow from this. First, artificial boundaries are required between what is taxable and what is not taxable. Defining those boundaries leads to complex tax legislation. It also leads to policy inconsistencies and unintended incentives built into the tax structure that cannot be resolved without moving closer to a concept of economic income and thus removing the capital/revenue distinction. Second, artificial boundaries are the life-blood of the tax planner. The capital/revenue boundary is a prime hunting ground for tax planning schemes. The remainder of this paper considers these two issues by way of examples drawn from the New Zealand experience. Structural problems created by the capital/revenue boundary The structural problems created by the capital/revenue boundary in New Zealand are probably best illustrated by the inconsistent tax rules in the savings area when an individual wishes to invest in equity or bonds. This can be done directly through an intermediary such as a mutual fund. The lack of a general capital gains tax has resulted in a series of rules that generally encourages direct over indirect investment, and equity over debt instruments. First, dividends are taxable as ordinary income. The problem of double taxation of corporate income is overcome by allowing the dividend recipient to get a credit for tax paid at the corporate level. However, when a company distributes to its shareholders a capital gain, no tax credit is available because no company tax has been paid. The end result is that the capital gains exemption provided at the company level is clawed back when the gain is distributed as a dividend. If, on the other hand, the shareholder held equities directly and not through an intermediary company, the shareholder would retain the benefit of tax-free capital gains. Trusts are not subject to this dividend claw-back, so an investment made through a trust retains the benefit of capital gains. That clearly places trusts at an advantage over companies as an investment intermediary. In response, New Zealand legislation deems certain trusts to be companies subject to the dividend rules. The trusts treated in this way are those that subscribe for funds � what in North America, I understand, would be mutual funds. Although this shores up the tax base, it reinforces the incentives of the tax system towards disintermediation. The general common law rule that profits from the sale of shares held in a managed portfolio are taxable as ordinary business income has the same disintermediation incentive. It makes it very difficult for intermediaries to make capital gains even if they can distribute the profits tax-free. The effect of the rule seems to be to give a tax break to portfolios that are not properly managed. Naturally, individuals have a better chance than professional intermediaries of making a convincing case that investments are mis-managed in this way. An exception to the rule that investment intermediaries have difficulty establishing that their share gains are tax-free is an Inland Revenue ruling that passive funds (funds tied to a stock index) are not in business and therefore not taxed under the business income test. This removes one penalty on intermediation but creates an incentive for passive funds over those that are actively managed. The previous discussion has been in terms of equity investments. New Zealand taxes debt investments on a full accrual basis, creating an incentive for equity over debt for resident investors. This contrasts with tax rules applying to non-residents that heavily favour debt investment over equity. Finally, as previously noted, New Zealand has rules that tax overseas share investments in most countries on a full accrual basis, in contrast to the capital gains available for domestic share investments. As a government policy adviser I can say that there was never a deliberate intention to design a set of tax rules that discouraged intermediation, and favoured mismanagement of equity portfolios, domestic shares over foreign shares and equity over debt. These rules have been the consequence of the need to protect a tax base that suffers form the structural problem of not taxing one form of income. A second example of a structural problem caused by the lack of a capital gains tax is share repurchases by the issuing company. Conceptually, a share repurchase is the same as a dividend. A dividend is the distribution of corporate reserves to shareholders. From the company�s point of view, a share repurchase produces the same transfer of legal ownership of wealth from the company to shareholders as a dividend. From the shareholder�s point of view, however, selling the share back to the issuing company can be equivalent to selling the share to any other party so as to realise a capital gain. Other countries deal with this issue by taxing share repurchases either as a dividend or as a capital gain. New Zealand does not have that option. If the shares are held on capital account, the repurchase is either a taxable dividend or a tax-free capital gain. This leads to complex rules and somewhat arcane legislation necessary to determine what is taxable as a dividend and what is not. Under these rules, some taxpayers are taxed on gains they have not made, while others are not taxed on gains they do make. The lack of a capital gains tax has also resulted in New Zealand tax legislation having unclear basis rules for determining and modifying the tax value of assets. This can lead to opportunities for taxpayers to hold assets deliberately on revenue account and to take multiple deductions - for example, a deduction for the share subscription and a deduction for expenditure incurred by the subsidiary company. This is not, of course, an inevitable consequence of not taxing capital gains. It is, however, the consequence of a tax system that does not focus on changes in the wealth or balance sheet of the taxpayer. Depreciation creates a further structural problem. A system that provides for depreciation recognises that holders of depreciating assets suffer an annual unrealised decline in wealth, or loss in income terms. Since our income tax system was based on the non-recognition of changes in asset values, our original income tax system did not provide for depreciation. Within a few years the obvious over-taxation of actual business income that this caused led our Parliament to legislate for depreciation as a special allowance. Few would argue against the proposition that an income tax system should recognise depreciation, although it creates an asymmetry in a tax system that does not tax capital gains. Declines in asset values give rise to deductions, while increases in those values are tax-free. Tax planners have recognised the opportunity. For example, a company can be paid a capital sum for running a pipeline underground rather than overground. The funds are used to build the pipeline, which is then depreciable. The odd result is that the company appears to have obtained a deduction for expenditure that, in substance, it has not had to outlay. The result seems even odder if the person making the payment receives a deduction. Odd as these results may seem, they can arise, illustrating some structural problems when capital sums or gains are not taken into account for tax purposes. Tax planning problems created by the capital/revenue boundary The examples of multiple deductions and depreciation lead naturally to the problems created by the capital/revenue boundary in creating tax planning opportunities. Tax practitioners attempt to get all accretions to wealth on tax-free capital account and all expenditure on deductible revenue account. Methods to achieve this are myriad and sometimes ingenious. The following are a few examples drawn from the New Zealand experience. The average salary earner has few opportunities to earn tax-free capital sums. One opportunity was a redundancy payment. This is, in effect, a payment for human capital. Since in many circumstances such payments could be traded off for taxable salary, the New Zealand Parliament made redundancy payments taxable. However, payments for humiliation on redundancy have retained their tax-free status. As this opportunity has become more widely known, New Zealand employers have shown a tendency to ensure that redundant staff have been subject to increasing levels of humiliation. In a similar way, employers and contractees have shown an increasing tendency to provide workers with capital payments to induce them to leave their previous occupations or restrictive covenants to inhibit their ability to work elsewhere. The tax-free nature of such payments has been upheld by our courts. The apparent ability to substitute in this way tax-free for otherwise taxable remuneration has led the Government recently to propose that legislation be enacted that taxes inducement payments and payments under restrictive covenants. A recent variant of this was a case where an international accounting firm received a lump sum payment to lease floors of a commercial building. It was clear that, in present value terms, the lump sum payment offset rentals set above prevailing market levels. The rentals were deductible but the Privy Council held that the lump sum payment was a tax-free capital sum. More imaginative schemes also utilise the capital/revenue boundary. Two examples illustrate this. First, as previously mentioned, New Zealand levies tax on the worldwide income of residents. This includes income generated through offshore subsidiaries. One attempt to get round this is for a New Zealand company to pay an unrelated non-resident bank a sum of money in return for the option to purchase, for a minimal amount, shares in a New Zealand cash-box subsidiary of the non-resident bank. The bank then invests the sum tax-free in a haven and returns the capital plus tax-free interest in the form of share capital in the New Zealand subsidiary. The New Zealand company gains the value of the return of capital plus interest when it exercises its option to purchase the subsidiary. A second example of such a scheme is one used by high wealth individuals who feel that their tax bill is excessive. The taxpayer borrows funds from offshore. The funds are used to invest in a venture entity. The loan is back-ended so that no payments are required until the loan matures, although accrued interest on the borrowings is deductible. The venture entity expends the funds on a high-risk venture (in which the lender also has an interest), giving rise to further tax deductions. The loan plus interest can be repaid at maturity by way of the investor exercising an option to put his or her interest in the venture entity for the principal plus interest. The gain is a tax-free capital gain. The investor, for an up-front investment, receives a return by way of substantial tax deductions. The examples here are merely illustrative of the many ways in which taxpayers do use the capital/revenue boundary in their attempts to organise their affairs so as minimise tax. Proposals for Reform in New Zealand The structural problems that the lack of tax on capital gains poses for our income tax system have not gone unnoticed. A number of reviews of the tax system have considered the extent to which New Zealand should tax such gains. In 1966 the Government established a committee of independent experts (the Ross Committee) to undertake a comprehensive review of all aspects of central government taxation in New Zealand. The committee reported in October 1967. It noted that there was a strong justification for taxing realised capital gains, although it considered the issue needed further study, and any reforms in this area should follow implementation of other reforms such as lower marginal income tax rates. In 1982 a task force on tax reform reported. It concluded that although there was no reason in principle not to tax capital gains, it did not recommend the introduction of a capital gains tax at that time. The task force�s views seemed to be influenced by its view that introducing a capital gains tax during a period of high inflation, as then prevailed, would create more problems than it would cure. In 1989 the then Labour Government did propose the taxation of capital gains, along with across-the-board indexation of the income tax base. With the defeat of that Government in a General Election late in that year, the proposals did not proceed. In 1998 the then Government established a �Committee of Experts� to review a number of aspects of the tax system, including compliance costs and how to make the tax system more robust against avoidance. The committee reported in December 1998. Whether capital gains should be taxed was outside the Committee�s terms of reference. The committee did comment, however, that whether a capital gains tax would be a beneficial reform would probably be determined by the type of taxation reform proposed. Finally, the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government formed at the end of 1999 has stated that it will not introduce a capital gains tax in its first term of office. The Government has announced an inquiry into the tax system. Questions that will be posed to the Inquiry include whether the tax system can be made fairer and whether the income tax base should be broadened. This may involve consideration of the issues surrounding the taxation of capital gains. Conclusion This paper has canvassed the problems posed for a tax system by the absence of a general capital gains tax. That reflects the New Zealand experience. Undoubtedly, if we had a capital gains tax, the paper would have canvassed the problems posed by having such a tax. Certainly, designing an efficient capital gains tax raises a number of issues for policy makers. They include the following: whether the tax base needs to be indexed for inflation; the timing of recognition of gains and the extent to which tax can be levied on an accrual basis (and if on a realised basis, as is likely, the definition of �disposal� or �realisation� is critical); the ambit of any such tax, including the treatment of personal assets such as including residences; the treatment of capital losses; the appropriate rate of tax. The issue is always the extent to which capital gains should be taxed. The best option needs to be determined by a careful analysis of where any boundary should be drawn so as to produce a tax system that is as fair and as efficient as possible. This needs to be considered in the context of the overall structure of each country�s tax system. There is probably no perfect answer. What seems clear to me is that economic and tax Nirvana is not to be found by an income tax that simply excludes from measured income that which the English Court of Chancery has held is properly attributed to the remainder man of a trust with a life tenant. References Grubel, HG Unlocking Canadian Capital, The Fraser Institute, Vancouver BC, 2000 New Zealand Royal Commission on Social Policy, April 1988 Report, Volume III Part 2, Wellington, NZ, 1988.

Capital Gains Tax – The New Zealand Case A Paper Prepared for the Fraser Institute 2000 Symposium, on Capital Gains Taxation September 15-17 2000 Vancouver, BC, Canada By: Robin Oliver General Manager (Policy) Inland Revenue Department New Zealand Email: robin.oliver@ird.govt.nz Page 2 Introduction New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax, nor does it levy tax on inheritances. This makes New Zealand unusual in the OECD world. We inherited our lack of capital gains taxation, along with most of our other legal and constitutional framework, from the English. By contrast with other countries (the USA, UK, Canada and Australia) with a similar inheritance, we have retained an income tax that does not include capital gains as income. This paper, therefore, uses New Zealand as a sort of case study of what life is like without capital gains being taxed. I comment on this from my perspective, that of someone who was a tax practitioner and is now a tax enforcer or at least a tax policy adviser. I should point out at this juncture that the views in this paper are my own and not necessarily those of the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department or the views of the New Zealand Government. To describe what life is like without a capital gains tax it is necessary to define more precisely what the term means. As a general rule, capital gains do not form part of income for the purposes of our income tax system. Indeed, our Courts have held that our income tax law does not even recognise the concept of capital gains. In our law it is not exempt or untaxed income; it has no legal recognition. This means, for example, that there is no requirement to apportion interest expenses between expenses that relate to the derivation of taxed income and expenses relating to capital gains. Nor does New Zealand have a capital gains tax separate from the income tax, although matters do not stop there. Our income tax legislation (the Income Tax Act 1994) includes within “income” many forms of gain that in the absence of specific legislation would generally be considered capital gains. Each such provision has its own history, but very broadly, since income tax was first introduced in New Zealand, in 1891, our Parliament has considered it necessary to prevent people from characterising otherwise taxable income as untaxed capital gain. The result is detailed and often complex legislation. I shall describe that legislation in outline form. The important point is that it seems a bit simplistic to describe a tax system as one that does or does not tax capital gains. Any income tax that left all capital gains tax-free would be unworkable. On the other hand, I am not aware of any income tax that taxes all capital gains in all circumstances. The issue is always to what extent capital gains are taxed. From a policy perspective, the issue is to what extent capital gains should be taxed. Different countries have positioned themselves at different points along a spectrum from fully untaxed to fully taxed. New Zealand is towards the untaxed end of the spectrum. Even so, for some asset types we would be located towards the extreme of the fully taxed end of the spectrum. Debt instruments and certain overseas equity holdings of residents are examples of these asset types. In these cases New Zealand legislation can tax all capital gains on a full accrual basis. Bearing these points in mind, this paper focuses on the effect of this income tax that does not bring to tax capital gains. My first point here is that New Zealand is an example that totally refutes Professor Herbert Grubel’s following claim: Page 3 “If the capital gains tax were abandoned completely, many government employees, and private sector tax accountants and lawyers could be re- employed to produce goods and services valued by society more than the enforcement and manipulation of the tax code.” 1 I am an accountant and a lawyer, and I can assure you that I have for many years been very gainfully employed both in manipulating and enforcing tax legislation that has no specific capital gains tax. Indeed, in both my private sector and public sector work, manipulating and enforcing the border between taxed income and untaxed gains has been a central part of that work. Simplicity has not been the outcome of a lack of capital gains tax in New Zealand. Nor is there much evidence to suggest that the absence of taxes on capital gains has had a marked effect on investment, capital markets and overall economic performance. A possible but unlikely exception here is the propensity for New Zealanders to hold their wealth in the form of real property. From my perspective, the most marked effect of not having a specific capital gains tax has been on the inconsistencies and complexity of our income tax rules that have resulted. Our income tax system is especially open to manipulation as a direct result of not having a general body of rules taxing capital gains. Moreover, in some areas our tax rules defy policy logic, creating problems that defy an obvious policy solution for this same reason. It is this aspect on which the paper focuses. Personally, I am neither a zealot for a capital gains tax, nor am I a vehement opponent of introducing one. The issue requires a detailed weighing up of arguments for and against taxing capital gains. For those who oppose this form of taxation, New Zealand is an example of how the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill. New Zealand Income Tax Law New Zealand has two main forms of taxation: income tax and Goods and Services Tax (a VAT). The income tax is levied as one tax across personal, business and investment income. There is no separate set of tax rules for the corporate sector or any other sector. New Zealand’s income tax legislation leaves the term “income” undefined. Tax is levied on all income derived by every person but there is no comprehensive statutory definition of what income is. That has been filled out by our judiciary. The judiciary turned to trust law and other precedents for a definition of income. In general, this meant that most increases in the value of assets, other than trading stock, were excluded from the tax base. This was generally derived from trust law concepts that differentiated the interests of the life tenant (entitled to income) from the interests of the remainder man (entitled to capital and so to the realisation of capital assets of the trust). 1 Grubel, HG The Case for Capital Gains Tax Reform, The Fraser Institute, Vancouver BC, 2000, page 30. Page 4 This is what is meant by not taxing capital gains. It is divorced from any economic concept. As New Zealand’s 1988 Royal Commission on Social Policy commented: “With hindsight it seems surprising that concepts of trust law were considered an appropriate substitute for a direct focus on economic efficiency and equity concerns in the raising of taxes”. 2 In practice, the distinction between income and capital gains is difficult to apply. The Privy Council noted in BP Australia Limited v FCT 3 that the distinction is “sometimes difficult to draw and leads to distinctions of some subtlety between profit that is made “out of” assets and profit that is made “upon” assets or “with” assets.” An example of this difficulty can be found in the investment area. An entity holding a portfolio of shares, such as a mutual fund, is usually taxed on profits on realisation. The rationale is that shares held in a portfolio are on revenue account because selling shares is a normal part of the business of such an entity. A small investor holding shares directly, on the other hand, can realise a tax-free capital gain. New Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department has held that a share portfolio that is determined by an index based on listed shares does not hold those shares on revenue account and can make tax-free capital gains. That is because its share purchases and sales are not part of a business but determined by the requirements of the index. This provides a tax incentive for investments in passive funds rather than actively managed funds. This ill-defined capital/revenue boundary provides many opportunities for tax advisers and many problems for the revenue authority. In a trust situation, the courts can refer to the intention of the settlor to help determine what is income and what is capital. In a tax situation the intention of the taxpayer is invariably to make all gains capital and all expenses deductible on revenue account. Hence to protect the tax base it has been found necessary to bring into taxable income many items that would otherwise have been tax-free capital gains. The following are some examples of how New Zealand has legislatively broadened what is included in taxable income. Gains from the sale of personal property Profits or gains from the sale of property where the taxpayer is a dealer in such property are taxable. It appears that the legislative intent was to tax those who were dealers in property of a particular type even if the property on which the profit was made was held by the person for other purposes. The courts, however, have restricted the provision to trading assets that would have been on revenue account in any case. All profits or gains from the sale of property acquired for the purpose of sale are taxable. This means, broadly, that shares acquired for their dividend yield give rise to untaxed gains, while those acquired for their capital yield do not. The provision has given rise to lengthy case law distinctions between property acquired with the purpose of sale (taxable) and those acquired with the intention of sale (not taxable). 2 New Zealand Royal Commission on Social Policy, April 1988 Report, Volume III Part 2, Wellington, NZ, 1988, page 450. 3 (1964) AC 244 at 262. Page 5 Gains from profit-making undertakings or schemes are also made taxable by legislation. Again, however, the courts interpreted the provision out of existence by requiring the gains to be taxable as ordinary income before the provision operates. Land transactions New Zealand income tax legislation has detailed and complex provisions bringing many gains on land transactions into the tax net. This was to counter the situation whereby land developers and builders became, in effect, untaxed occupations. In broad terms, we tax gains on the sale of land acquired with an intention of resale, gains made by land dealers, developers and builders and gains arising from the rezoning, subdivision or development of land. There are exceptions for private residences, business premises and farmland. Income from debt instruments The difficulty of sustaining the traditional capital/revenue distinction is particularly acute with respect to debt instruments. In the UK, profits on discounts of financial instruments were made taxable as early as 1805. If a lender can make a return that is taxable by way of coupon payments or tax-free by way of a redemption payment, it is likely that the lender will prefer the latter. Since 1986 New Zealand has effectively removed the capital/revenue distinction for debt instruments and taxed all gains as they accrue. Foreign investment fund rules New Zealand aims to tax the worldwide income of its residents. This includes income derived by offshore companies and similar entities. Since it is not possible to subject foreign entities to tax, as a proxy for this New Zealand levies an accrued capital gains tax on all foreign portfolio equity investment if the companies are not resident in one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the UK and USA. Other provisions Other New Zealand legislative provisions tax the following: redundancy payments, lease premiums, site goodwill on sale of a business, royalties, income from patents and copyright, and income from the sale of forests and petroleum mining interests. The Results It is difficult to see evidence that New Zealand’s lack of a capital gains tax has had a major impact on our capital markets. The New Zealand stock exchange has not been noted for its high performance. The stock exchange capital index still remains below the high it achieved in October 1987. In any case, New Zealand listed shares are strongly influenced by non-resident investors who hold up to 40% of the value of total market capitalisation. Such shareholders have been the marginal investors and are generally unaffected by domestic tax rules on mobile capital. Under international rules, which New Zealand follows, investors with no establishment in a foreign country are not taxed on capital gains in that country. Page 6 There is also little evidence that lack of a capital gains tax has encouraged entrepeneurial endeavour. New Zealand’s post-war economic performance has been well below the OECD average. Moreover, New Zealand has one of the lowest levels of business expenditure on research and development in the OECD. In 1997/98, our business expenditure on R&D was 0.32% of GDP compared with an average of 1.48% of GDP. The Government is considering ways to encourage business investment in R&D. The absence of a capital gains tax may have encouraged New Zealanders to invest heavily in real property, especially housing. New Zealand’s home ownership ratio (percentage of homeowners as a proportion of the household population) is a bit higher than most OECD countries (73% compared with 66% in the UK, 60% in Canada and over 60% in the USA). The most significant difference, however, arises when comparing housing investment as a proportion of total investment. Housing represents approximately 70% of total net assets for New Zealand households, while it represents only about 30% of US total net assets. One explanation for this is that New Zealanders are simply poorer, so that the same level of home ownership constitutes a higher percentage of wealth. The result is that New Zealand holdings of financial assets are relatively low. In 1998 approximately 15% of assets were holdings in investment intermediaries (superannuation, life insurance and mutual funds), 14% in bank accounts and only 1.4% in private share holdings. Although the pattern of New Zealand savings is clear, it is less clear that this can be attributed to tax causes. As explained later, the most tax-favoured form of investment – direct equity – constitutes a very small proportion of household assets. Debt instruments and equity held through intermediaries are not tax-favoured to the same extent but constitute a much higher proportion of wealth. The average real capital gain on housing since 1960 has been, in real terms, towards 1% per annum. A far higher return (estimated at 2% to 2.5% per annum real) has come in the form of untaxed imputed rental income. Not fully taxing imputed rental income is a feature of most tax systems (where housing is a less dominant feature of investment) and in New Zealand is significantly clawed back by not allowing mortgage interest deductions. It is likely that many years of high inflation, government subsidies and controlled interest rates (often negative in real terms) that applied until the late 1980s have been more influential than the tax system in setting the pattern of private investment in New Zealand. Similarly, our economic performance has probably been influenced more by broader economic issues than by the absence of a capital gains tax. A concern that has been raised by countries with a capital gains tax is that, in the absence of such a tax, there could be an incentive for the excessive reinvestment of business profits. As well as eroding the tax base by encouraging the transformation of otherwise taxable income into non-taxable gains, this could incur a high economic cost by locking capital into existing firms with a lower rate of return than new firms. There is no evidence of this being a consequence of the lack of a capital gains tax in New Zealand. The average dividend yield of New Zealand’s listed companies is about 5% to 7% per annum. That is high by world standards. Smaller companies tend to distribute most of their available income to the owners. Page 7 The reasons for this are likely to lie in the overall structure of the tax system. Obviously, where there is a choice between providing owners with a return that could be either taxable (salary or dividends) or non-taxable (capital gain), owners will prefer the non-taxable form of return. In New Zealand, however, salaries are deductible and dividends carry credits for tax paid at the corporate level 4 . Until 1 April 2000, the company rate was equal to the top personal marginal tax rate (33%). This meant that any tax on distribution of income taxed at the company level was offset by a deduction or tax credits. Indeed, because of the progressive tax scale there could be incentives to distribute income. That occurs when the recipient of the distribution is on a low tax rate (say, a spouse or child on 19.5%), whereas the salary deduction is taken at a 33% rate. There has always been an incentive in New Zealand not to distribute non-taxable company income (such as capital gains) in a taxable form. This has led to some retention of income and then tax planning to return it in a non-taxable manner. It should be noted, however, that merely selling a company pregnant with non-taxable profits is not a solution. It merely passes the problem of extracting those profits tax- free to someone else. From 1 April 2000, New Zealand’s top personal marginal tax rate was increased from 33% to 39%. The company and trustee tax rates remained at 33%. It is likely that this will lead to an increase in profit retention. That will be balanced by the increased advantage from income splitting by making distributions to low-tax rate family members. In general, however, it is the overall nature of the tax system, such as the rate structure and the manner in which dividends are taxed, that can lead the tax system to encourage excessive profit retention. The presence or absence of a capital gains tax seems peripheral. Problems created by not taxing capital gains The conclusion of the previous section was that the absence of a capital gains tax has not had an easily identifiable impact on the economy. Earlier, however, I described some of the complexities of New Zealand income tax legislation caused by not taxing capital gains. Why the legislative complexity in the absence of discernible impacts? The answer is that while it may be difficult to attribute any underperformance of our economy to the absence of a capital gains tax, the absence of such a tax has caused us significant problems. This is the result of it leaving a structural weakness in the income tax base. The concept of a capital gain is not an economic concept; it is a concept from equity law. By not taxing capital gains a type of income return is removed from the income tax base in a rather ad hoc fashion. 4 Small, family-owned companies can pay out dividends from income on which no company tax is payable (such as capital gains) tax-free under the qualifying company rules. Page 8 Two consequences flow from this. First, artificial boundaries are required between what is taxable and what is not taxable. Defining those boundaries leads to complex tax legislation. It also leads to policy inconsistencies and unintended incentives built into the tax structure that cannot be resolved without moving closer to a concept of economic income and thus removing the capital/revenue distinction. Second, artificial boundaries are the life-blood of the tax planner. The capital/revenue boundary is a prime hunting ground for tax planning schemes. The remainder of this paper considers these two issues by way of examples drawn from the New Zealand experience. Structural problems created by the capital/revenue boundary The structural problems created by the capital/revenue boundary in New Zealand are probably best illustrated by the inconsistent tax rules in the savings area when an individual wishes to invest in equity or bonds. This can be done directly through an intermediary such as a mutual fund. The lack of a general capital gains tax has resulted in a series of rules that generally encourages direct over indirect investment, and equity over debt instruments. First, dividends are taxable as ordinary income. The problem of double taxation of corporate income is overcome by allowing the dividend recipient to get a credit for tax paid at the corporate level. However, when a company distributes to its shareholders a capital gain, no tax credit is available because no company tax has been paid. The end result is that the capital gains exemption provided at the company level is clawed back when the gain is distributed as a dividend. If, on the other hand, the shareholder held equities directly and not through an intermediary company, the shareholder would retain the benefit of tax-free capital gains. Trusts are not subject to this dividend claw-back, so an investment made through a trust retains the benefit of capital gains. That clearly places trusts at an advantage over companies as an investment intermediary. In response, New Zealand legislation deems certain trusts to be companies subject to the dividend rules. The trusts treated in this way are those that subscribe for funds – what in North America, I understand, would be mutual funds. Although this shores up the tax base, it reinforces the incentives of the tax system towards disintermediation. The general common law rule that profits from the sale of shares held in a managed portfolio are taxable as ordinary business income has the same disintermediation incentive. It makes it very difficult for intermediaries to make capital gains even if they can distribute the profits tax-free. The effect of the rule seems to be to give a tax break to portfolios that are not properly managed. Naturally, individuals have a better chance than professional intermediaries of making a convincing case that investments are mis-managed in this way. An exception to the rule that investment intermediaries have difficulty establishing that their share gains are tax-free is an Inland Revenue ruling that passive funds (funds tied to a stock index) are not in business and therefore not taxed under the business income test. This removes one penalty on intermediation but creates an incentive for passive funds over those that are actively managed. Page 9 The previous discussion has been in terms of equity investments. New Zealand taxes debt investments on a full accrual basis, creating an incentive for equity over debt for resident investors. This contrasts with tax rules applying to non-residents that heavily favour debt investment over equity. Finally, as previously noted, New Zealand has rules that tax overseas share investments in most countries on a full accrual basis, in contrast to the capital gains available for domestic share investments. As a government policy adviser I can say that there was never a deliberate intention to design a set of tax rules that discouraged intermediation, and favoured mismanagement of equity portfolios, domestic shares over foreign shares and equity over debt. These rules have been the consequence of the need to protect a tax base that suffers form the structural problem of not taxing one form of income. A second example of a structural problem caused by the lack of a capital gains tax is share repurchases by the issuing company. Conceptually, a share repurchase is the same as a dividend. A dividend is the distribution of corporate reserves to shareholders. From the company’s point of view, a share repurchase produces the same transfer of legal ownership of wealth from the company to shareholders as a dividend. From the shareholder’s point of view, however, selling the share back to the issuing company can be equivalent to selling the share to any other party so as to realise a capital gain. Other countries deal with this issue by taxing share repurchases either as a dividend or as a capital gain. New Zealand does not have that option. If the shares are held on capital account, the repurchase is either a taxable dividend or a tax-free capital gain. This leads to complex rules and somewhat arcane legislation necessary to determine what is taxable as a dividend and what is not. Under these rules, some taxpayers are taxed on gains they have not made, while others are not taxed on gains they do make. The lack of a capital gains tax has also resulted in New Zealand tax legislation having unclear basis rules for determining and modifying the tax value of assets. This can lead to opportunities for taxpayers to hold assets deliberately on revenue account and to take multiple deductions - for example, a deduction for the share subscription and a deduction for expenditure incurred by the subsidiary company. This is not, of course, an inevitable consequence of not taxing capital gains. It is, however, the consequence of a tax system that does not focus on changes in the wealth or balance sheet of the taxpayer. Depreciation creates a further structural problem. A system that provides for depreciation recognises that holders of depreciating assets suffer an annual unrealised decline in wealth, or loss in income terms. Since our income tax system was based on the non-recognition of changes in asset values, our original income tax system did not provide for depreciation. Within a few years the obvious over-taxation of actual business income that this caused led our Parliament to legislate for depreciation as a special allowance. Few would argue against the proposition that an income tax system should recognise depreciation, although it creates an asymmetry in a tax system that does not tax capital gains. Declines in asset values give rise to deductions, while increases in those values are tax-free. Tax planners have recognised the opportunity. For example, a company can be paid a capital sum for running a pipeline underground rather than overground. Page 10 The funds are used to build the pipeline, which is then depreciable. The odd result is that the company appears to have obtained a deduction for expenditure that, in substance, it has not had to outlay. The result seems even odder if the person making the payment receives a deduction. Odd as these results may seem, they can arise, illustrating some structural problems when capital sums or gains are not taken into account for tax purposes. Tax planning problems created by the capital/revenue boundary The examples of multiple deductions and depreciation lead naturally to the problems created by the capital/revenue boundary in creating tax planning opportunities. Tax practitioners attempt to get all accretions to wealth on tax-free capital account and all expenditure on deductible revenue account. Methods to achieve this are myriad and sometimes ingenious. The following are a few examples drawn from the New Zealand experience. The average salary earner has few opportunities to earn tax-free capital sums. One opportunity was a redundancy payment. This is, in effect, a payment for human capital. Since in many circumstances such payments could be traded off for taxable salary, the New Zealand Parliament made redundancy payments taxable. However, payments for humiliation on redundancy have retained their tax-free status. As this opportunity has become more widely known, New Zealand employers have shown a tendency to ensure that redundant staff have been subject to increasing levels of humiliation. In a similar way, employers and contractees have shown an increasing tendency to provide workers with capital payments to induce them to leave their previous occupations or restrictive covenants to inhibit their ability to work elsewhere. The tax-free nature of such payments has been upheld by our courts. The apparent ability to substitute in this way tax-free for otherwise taxable remuneration has led the Government recently to propose that legislation be enacted that taxes inducement payments and payments under restrictive covenants. A recent variant of this was a case where an international accounting firm received a lump sum payment to lease floors of a commercial building. It was clear that, in present value terms, the lump sum payment offset rentals set above prevailing market levels. The rentals were deductible but the Privy Council held that the lump sum payment was a tax-free capital sum. More imaginative schemes also utilise the capital/revenue boundary. Two examples illustrate this. First, as previously mentioned, New Zealand levies tax on the worldwide income of residents. This includes income generated through offshore subsidiaries. One attempt to get round this is for a New Zealand company to pay an unrelated non-resident bank a sum of money in return for the option to purchase, for a minimal amount, shares in a New Zealand cash-box subsidiary of the non-resident bank. The bank then invests the sum tax-free in a haven and returns the capital plus tax-free interest in the form of share capital in the New Zealand subsidiary. The New Zealand company gains the value of the return of capital plus interest when it exercises its option to purchase the subsidiary. Page 11 A second example of such a scheme is one used by high wealth individuals who feel that their tax bill is excessive. The taxpayer borrows funds from offshore. The funds are used to invest in a venture entity. The loan is back-ended so that no payments are required until the loan matures, although accrued interest on the borrowings is deductible. The venture entity expends the funds on a high-risk venture (in which the lender also has an interest), giving rise to further tax deductions. The loan plus interest can be repaid at maturity by way of the investor exercising an option to put his or her interest in the venture entity for the principal plus interest. The gain is a tax-free capital gain. The investor, for an up-front investment, receives a return by way of substantial tax deductions. The examples here are merely illustrative of the many ways in which taxpayers do use the capital/revenue boundary in their attempts to organise their affairs so as minimise tax. Proposals for Reform in New Zealand The structural problems that the lack of tax on capital gains poses for our income tax system have not gone unnoticed. A number of reviews of the tax system have considered the extent to which New Zealand should tax such gains. In 1966 the Government established a committee of independent experts (the Ross Committee) to undertake a comprehensive review of all aspects of central government taxation in New Zealand. The committee reported in October 1967 5 . It noted that there was a strong justification for taxing realised capital gains, although it considered the issue needed further study, and any reforms in this area should follow implementation of other reforms such as lower marginal income tax rates. In 1982 a task force on tax reform 6 reported. It concluded that although there was no reason in principle not to tax capital gains, it did not recommend the introduction of a capital gains tax at that time. The task force’s views seemed to be influenced by its view that introducing a capital gains tax during a period of high inflation, as then prevailed, would create more problems than it would cure. In 1989 the then Labour Government did propose the taxation of capital gains, along with across-the-board indexation of the income tax base. 7 With the defeat of that Government in a General Election late in that year, the proposals did not proceed. In 1998 the then Government established a “Committee of Experts” to review a number of aspects of the tax system, including compliance costs and how to make the tax system more robust against avoidance. The committee reported in December 1998 8 . Whether capital gains should be taxed was outside the Committee’s terms of 5 Government of New Zealand, The report of the New Zealand Taxation Review Committee Chaired by Sir Lewis Ross, Wellington, New Zealand, 1967. 6 New Zealand Government, The Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform Chaired by PM McCaw, Wellington, New Zealand, 1982. 7 New Zealand Government, Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Wellington, New Zealand, 1989. 8 New Zealand Government, The Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, Wellington, New Zealand, 1998. Page 12 reference. The committee did comment, however, that whether a capital gains tax would be a beneficial reform would probably be determined by the type of taxation reform proposed. Finally, the Labour-Alliance Coalition Government formed at the end of 1999 has stated that it will not introduce a capital gains tax in its first term of office. The Government has announced an inquiry into the tax system. Questions that will be posed to the Inquiry include whether the tax system can be made fairer and whether the income tax base should be broadened. This may involve consideration of the issues surrounding the taxation of capital gains. Conclusion This paper has canvassed the problems posed for a tax system by the absence of a general capital gains tax. That reflects the New Zealand experience. Undoubtedly, if we had a capital gains tax, the paper would have canvassed the problems posed by having such a tax. Certainly, designing an efficient capital gains tax raises a number of issues for policy makers. They include the following: • whether the tax base needs to be indexed for inflation; • the timing of recognition of gains and the extent to which tax can be levied on an accrual basis (and if on a realised basis, as is likely, the definition of “disposal” or “realisation” is critical); • the ambit of any such tax, including the treatment of personal assets such as including residences; • the treatment of capital losses; • the appropriate rate of tax. The issue is always the extent to which capital gains should be taxed. The best option needs to be determined by a careful analysis of where any boundary should be drawn so as to produce a tax system that is as fair and as efficient as possible. This needs to be considered in the context of the overall structure of each country’s tax system. There is probably no perfect answer. What seems clear to me is that economic and tax Nirvana is not to be found by an income tax that simply excludes from measured income that which the English Court of Chancery has held is properly attributed to the remainder man of a trust with a life tenant.

MEDIA STATEMENTS

### Tax bill cuts business compliance costs

The Government has moved to reduce tax compliance costs for businesses in a bill introduced into Parliament yesterday.

"The compliance costs created by the tax system are a concern for the business community and for the Government," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said. "This bill is the third this year to tackle the problem by introducing a number of initiatives that, together, will help reduce those costs."

"For example, one small administrative change in the bill will make a big difference to the one in eight people who forget to make the necessary adjustments for fringe benefits on their GST returns. We are simply transferring this adjustment to the fringe benefit tax return, which will save these taxpayers a lot of time and money."

"These are small but significant changes designed to prevent small errors turning into big costs. This means that business people can spend less time worrying about tax matters and more time running their businesses," Dr Cullen said.

The main changes are:

*   GST on fringe benefits will be included on the fringe benefit tax return instead of the GST return.
*   Businesses that pay their taxes just a few days late will not incur a heavy late payment penalty.
*   Incremental late payment penalties will not apply while taxpayers meet the terms of their instalment arrangements with Inland Revenue.
*   Failure to pay approved issuer levy on time will no longer result in a disproportionatly large withholding tax bill.

Detailed information on these and other matters in the bill can be found in the commentary on the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill.

### Taxation bill introduces equity measures

Legislation introduced into Parliament yesterday contains two key measures for making the progressive tax system more equitable.

The first is to make restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments taxable so they cannot be used to replace taxable income such as salary and wages. The other will tax certain distributions of trust beneficiary income to children under 16 at the trustee rate of 33%, rather than the minor's marginal tax rate, which can be as low as 19.5%.

"Both measures are intended to introduce greater equity into paying tax," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said. " Most ordinary New Zealanders cannot get around paying lower taxes by arranging a restrictive covenant with their employer, or putting income-earning assets into a trust that distributes the income to their young children. Instead they pay their full tax bill."

"Restrictive covenant payments compensate people for restricting their activities to endorsing a single product, for example, or working for a single employer. They are commonplace in some industries, and are likely to receive greater use as a way of avoiding the top 39% tax rate. Exit inducement payments are used to encourage people to give up a position or activity. Both types of payment can be for millions of dollars. They are employment-related, and it is clearly unfair that they are not taxed."

"The minor beneficiary legislation will reduce the tax advantage gained by using a trust. It will apply only if the beneficiary income is derived from property settled on a trust by a minor's relative or guardian, or someone associated with the relative or guardian."

"It is estimated that in 1998 about 3,500 children under six shared $27 million in beneficiary income from various business activities. Again, it is unfair that this income should be taxed at a lower rate than their parents' rate."

"The legislation spells out a number of exceptions to ensure that taxing beneficiary income of minors at 33% is not unjust. For example, it will not apply to income from property for which the settlor was ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the child," Dr Cullen said.

Detailed information on these and other matters in the bill can be found in the commentary on the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill.

R&D tax treatment to be clarified
=================================

The Government is proposing to reduce uncertainty in the tax treatment of research and development expenditure by clarifying when it is immediately deductible. In a statement issued today, Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen outlined a proposal to align certain aspects of the tax and accounting treatments of R&D expenditure. This would permit immediate tax deductions for R&D costs that are treated as an immediate expense for accounting purposes. The first step towards any legislative change will be the release of a discussion paper for public consultation, probably before Christmas. For more information see:

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Government to clarify R&D tax treatment

"All research expenditure and most development expenditure will be available for an immediate tax deduction under changes now being considered by the Government," Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

Dr Cullen told the Business - Government Forum in Auckland that the Government was preparing a discussion paper on the issue to put out to the public for wider consultation.

"I said after the 2000 Budget that my door was open to anyone who could come up with a mechanism to create a more supportive R&D regime without significant risk to the revenue.

"Since then I have been canvassing the matter with private sector tax practitioners and accountants. One of the issues accountancy firms in particular raised was that, while in most cases R&D was being deducted, there were concerns that the boundary between deductible and non-deductible was unclear and that the Inland Revenue Department was adopting an aggressive pro-revenue approach.

"The initiative the Government is announcing today arose directly out of those discussions. Essentially the proposal is that the tax laws be brought into conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in terms of what qualifies as R&D expenditure," Dr Cullen said.

"Currently the 'Eureka point' at which an idea is judged to have become an asset and to no longer automatically qualify for immediate R&D deductibility as a business expense is a grey area in tax law.

"The definition for accountancy purposes is much clearer, and tends to occur further on in the product development process. The effect, therefore, of bringing the two codes into alignment will be to introduce more certainty into the system and, in most cases, to support a more generous tax treatment.

"No-one will be disadvantaged. Those wishing to continue with the status quo will have that option. There should, however, be compliance cost savings for many taxpayers in applying the same regime across both their accounting and their tax treatments.

"This latest move will complement the $12 million R&D grants programme in the budget. Response to this has been strong, and has enabled the Government to give private sector R&D an early and much-needed boost," Dr Cullen said.

The aim of the proposal is to reduce uncertainty in the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditure by clarifying when R&D expenditure is immediately deductible.

**Summary of Proposal**

Broadly, the proposal permits taxpayers immediately to deduct for tax purposes R&D costs that are treated as an immediate expense for accounting.

In essence, all R&D would be immediately deductible for tax unless the expenditure gives rise to an identifiable and valuable asset under paragraph 5 of the accounting standard for R&D.

**Details of Proposal**

These will be discussed in a discussion paper which will be released for public consultation.

R&D expenditure that is treated as an immediate expense under paragraph 5 of FRS-13 in the year it is incurred will be immediately deductible for tax purposes provided the link with the income earning process is satisfied.

This means that all expenditure on research will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. Expenditure on development will be immediately deductible unless and until all of the following criteria contained in paragraph 5 are satisfied -

*   the product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably;
*   the technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated;
*   the entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process;
*   the existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated;
*   adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process.

Only development costs incurred after all the criteria are satisfied will not be automatically immediately deductible for tax. (They may be deductible under existing provisions.)

Taxpayers will need to comply with paragraph 5 of FRS-13 in relation to R&D costs (including costs that are immaterial for accounting) in order to obtain the benefit of the proposal. Existing provisions will continue to apply to taxpayers who are not required to comply with paragraph 5 and who choose not to. This means that no one will be disadvantaged by the proposal relative to current treatment.

Normal tax treatment would apply to costs that are not immediately expensed under FRS-13.

### Questions and Answers

**What R&D expenditure do accounting standards allow to be expensed immediately?**

This is covered by paragraph 5 of Financial Reporting Standard 13 (the accounting standard for R&D). Paragraph 5 requires research expenditure to be expensed immediately for accounting. It requires development expenditure to be expensed immediately for accounting unless and until all the following criteria are satisfied:

*   the product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably;
*   the technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated;
*   the entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process;
*   the existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated;
*   adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process.

Development costs incurred after all the criteria are satisfied are not expensed immediately for accounting, rather they are capitalised and amortised over the economic life of the asset.

**What is the change from current law?**

In many cases, it is currently not clear whether a particular item of R&D expenditure will be immediately deductible. This will depend upon the application of case law principles that determine whether the expenditure is capital or revenue. Broadly, expenditure is capital if it gives rise to an enduring benefit to the taxpayer. Otherwise, it is on revenue account. There is little New Zealand case law on whether R&D expenditure is on capital or revenue account that helps taxpayers in making this distinction.

There is therefore some uncertainty about how much R&D expenditure is immediately deductible. This proposal reduces this uncertainty by permitting R&D that is expensed when it is incurred under paragraph 5 of FRS-13, to be deducted immediately for tax. In essence, the proposal allows taxpayers to use the accounting standard, instead of case law on the capital/revenue boundary, to determine when R&D expenditure is immediately deductible.

This means that research expenditure will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. Development expenditure will also be immediately deductible unless all of the paragraph 5 criteria are met.

**Can anyone be disadvantaged?**

The proposal will not disadvantage any taxpayers, relative to existing tax treatment. It will operate as a "safe harbour".

If taxpayers comply with paragraph 5 of FRS-13 in relation to their R&D expenditure (including expenditure that is not material for accounting purposes) they will obtain the benefit of this proposal. If they are not required to comply with that paragraph, and they do not want to incur compliance costs in complying with it, the existing tax treatment will continue to apply to them.

If taxpayers capitalise and amortise R&D expenditure for accounting because the criteria in paragraph 5 are satisfied, they may nevertheless argue that such expenditure is on revenue account for tax purposes.

**Accounting standards are uncertain so what is the benefit?**

The criteria in paragraph 5 are flexible. For example, it is a matter of judgement when technical feasibility is demonstrated. Taxpayers will be in the best position to make those judgements. Such judgements are likely to be challenged by Inland Revenue only when they are clearly not sustainable. The proposal will therefore in practice provide greater certainty to taxpayers than they currently have.

**Won't this increase compliance costs?**

No. Many companies already have a legal requirement to apply FRS-13 when reporting to shareholders. They will use the same rules when reporting income to Inland Revenue. Taxpayers who do not currently have to comply with paragraph 5 of FRS 13 will have the choice of applying existing law, or complying with paragraph 5 and obtaining increased certainty.

**How does this affect software?**

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue set out his views on the tax treatment of software development costs in 1993 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 4 No. 10). That item includes a discussion on the deductibility of the costs of developing software for in-house use. Broadly, pre-development costs are immediately deductible, and development expenses are capitalised until the project is completed and then depreciated over three years.

Under this proposal, if software development costs fall within the definitions of research and development under FRS-13, and are expensed immediately under paragraph 5, they will be immediately deductible for tax.

**What is the estimated fiscal cost?**

The fiscal cost of the proposal is difficult to estimate. The Government understands that almost all R&D is immediately deducted for tax purposes. If this is the case, it is likely that the measure will not have a significant fiscal cost.

The exception is likely to be in relation to software development costs that are capitalised and amortised over three years. It is not clear how much software development that is currently depreciated would become immediately deductible. Treasury has provided its best estimate of the cost by making assumptions about the amount that would become immediately deductible. It estimates a one-off revenue cost of $12.4 million over two years (not taking future growth in software development expenditure into account).

**Is this a tax concession?**

No. However, in legislating for a capital/revenue boundary in this area the Government is proposing a rule that is likely to be more generous than existing tax law.

**Is this going to be reconsidered by the McLeod Tax Review?**

The McLeod Review will report on the structure of the tax system including whether taxes should be used to encourage worthwhile activities such as R&D. Following that report, the Government will consider specific tax issues. That may include further changes to the tax treatment for R&D.

**Why is the Government proposing this change?**

By clarifying the distinction between expenditure that is immediately deductible from what is not and by aligning tax and accounting treatment in this area, there should be more certainty for taxpayers and fewer disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. That should allow businesses to focus more on their business and less on their tax affairs. Discussions with tax practitioners identified uncertainty and risk of tax disputes as a significant problem in the R&D area. The proposal addresses that concern.

**When will the proposal be in legislation?**

The Government will issue a Discussion Paper on the proposal. In accordance with the normal tax policy process, it will consult on that. The result of those consultations could result in legislation next year.

**Will the R&D grants scheme announced in the Budget continue?**

Yes. This proposal aims to reduce tax problems encountered with R&D but is not a tax concession. The grants scheme is specific targetted Government assistance to increase the level of R&D in New Zealand.

**What proportion of R&D will be immediately deductible?**

That is not clear. All research expenditure will be immediately deductible. Discussions with private sector accountants suggest that most development expenditure will be immediately deductible.
Hon Dr Michael Cullen Treasurer, Minister of Finance, Minister for Accident Insurance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House EMBARGOED TO Tuesday, 3.15 pm 24 October 2000 Speech Notes Michael Cullen to Business - Government Forum Could I begin by saying how much I appreciate everyone being here today. I think it is a sign of the enormous amount of goodwill that exists amongst practical people of varying views in New Zealand that we get together to talk through both where we want to go as a country, and how to get there. I must confess to having, at times, a certain sense of frustration about the first part – where we want to go. Frustration because I believe there exists a much greater level of consensus about that than we sometimes allow ourselves to express or even admit to. It is as if our very smallness – our air of being one large family – makes us overconcentrate on our differences at times. Nevertheless, it would be hard to find more than a handful of New Zealanders who think seriously about our future who do not agree on some key directions. Or, to put it another way, if we were all to write down our vision statement for the next twenty years for New Zealand Inc., I am sure there would be a very high degree of commonality. New Zealand must be in the first division of knowledge–based producers of high quality added-value goods and services in the world. We must use the new sciences and the new technologies to overcome our traditional disadvantages of size and distance. We must produce much higher levels of human capital and retain and invest that capital in the generation of wealth. We must, therefore, lift our performance in skills development, science and technology, research and development, design and marketing to international best practice standards. We will find much of our success in niche industries and markets, exploiting our traditional excellence at short-run production. We will need to build the infrastructure to support this new economy. And we will need to attract new businesses from overseas into greenfields development in New Zealand, build new businesses in New Zealand, support rapid growth and reward excellence and enterprise while protecting New Zealand’s unique heritage of our environment, our multicultural society, and our innate sense of fairness. 2 2 I might have lost a few of you at the last stage. But I suspect not many. The hard bit, of course, is translating such a vision into practical policies that will work. And let’s be blunt; as a country we haven’t done anything like as well at that as we ought to. What I would also hope is becoming clearer is that some of the most important reasons for our relative under performance relate to deep-seated structural problems which predate not just this government but the start of the radical structural reform process in 1984 and even, in at least some respects, predate the start of our long relative decline. So there’s not a lot of point in lacerating ourselves or each other about them. We just need to get on with the job of addressing these problems better. I hope today's meeting is an important stage in getting down to the nitty gritty of how we do that. The key policy response areas I want to touch on very briefly today are savings, investment, research and development, skills, compliance costs, and infrastructure. First, savings. Clearly, we need to produce more of our own savings. I make no apology for emphasising that this government has put before the public a long- term structure for New Zealand Superannuation which will result in a strong public savings stance over the next twenty years or more. But it is crucial that this is accompanied by a clear message that private savings remain essential. That means we must have an intelligent national conversation about how best to facilitate private savings in a way which is fiscally and economically sound, but produces better results than we have had hitherto. And we have to ensure that those savings are more in a form which makes them available for investment in growth and development rather than locked up in real estate. Which brings me to investment. A positive programme of investment attraction is crucial but government and business need to talk further about how far that programme can go in a realistic way. Interestingly, some of the successes that Jim’s Ministry has had already have been less reliant on financial inducements than on clearing away obstacles and facilitating processes. But certainly we need a much more proactive stance if our small nation is to get its fair share of the sort of investment which will create new businesses and dramatically grow existing ones. Strengthening our capital markets has many dimensions. The takeovers code is one aspect. I firmly believe the New Zealand and Australian sharemarkets getting together is another. But let us be open to further suggestions on this matter. 3 3 With respect to research and development, we have already substantially increased state support for the private sector. The question of taxation has remained crucial. The government is preparing a discussion paper for wider consultation which proposes that the tax laws be brought into conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in terms of what qualifies as research and development expenditure. If a company tells its shareholders that research and development expenditure is not in effect the same as the purchase of a saleable asset, that expenditure will be able to be immediately deducted. Currently the 'Eureka point' at which an idea is judged to have become an asset and to no longer automatically qualify for immediate R&D deductibility as a business expense is a grey area in tax law. The definition for accountancy purposes is much clearer, and tends to occur further on in the product development process. Development expenditure not creating an asset will be immediately deductible. The application of the same regime across both accountancy and tax treatments will bring greater clarity and should reduce compliance costs for many taxpayers. The Government plans to introduce this as a voluntary option to ensure that no- one will be disadvantaged. Those who are happy with their current arrangements will be allowed to continue with them. There are many other areas we need to look at. Pete Hodgson and I are both concerned that we extract better results from the CRIs in terms of the feedback effect, and in terms of the creation of new businesses and activities. We seek your input on these matters. Research and development is intricately related, especially in our universities, to skills development. Moves on student costs and modern apprenticeships have already been made. But it is crucial that business interacts positively with the new Tertiary Education Advisory Commission. The mechanisms are there to produce a much more strategically focused tertiary education sector in place of the rather odd mish-mash of competition and state support that we have at present. The other body where I know business is active in presenting its views is the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification. A balanced approach to the threats and opportunities presented by new technologies is a prime requirement by business and for economic growth in New Zealand. In particular, biotechnology under appropriate safeguards, must be part of our scientific and economic future. 4 4 On compliance costs, the government is adopting a much broader-based approach than we have seen hitherto. A Business Compliance Cost Panel comprised largely of private sector representatives is to be set up no later than 1 July next year. It will report to Paul Swain and myself on unnecessary compliance costs arising out of existing regulations. Business test panels will be set up to assess the likely compliance costs and the workability of proposed new regulations. Paul Swain is due to report back to a Cabinet Committee by the end of next month on an implementation plan for these panels. Finally, a few brief words on infrastructure. Our traditional approach has been ad hoc, and often overly influenced by crude political considerations. Part of the framework for the new New Zealand Superannuation scheme will require us to develop a much more strategic approach to capital expenditure. This will be no easy task, but one that it is important to carry out. At the same time, we need to integrate that strategic approach with better integration of infrastructure planning and development. A good example is the recent threat to the Napier-Gisborne railway line which has opened up the whole issue of infrastructure on the East Coast. Again, it will be important here to get clear input from business on likely future needs and developments. Most important of all is the new infrastructure. That leads us into the area of e-commerce where Paul Swain is leading a highly focussed approach on which we need strong business buy-in to make work as well as it should. There is, of course, much else I could talk about. But I have chosen to highlight some key areas where I believe we can achieve very significant gains which are crucial to lifting our economic performance. I look forward to our second session of discussions today and to on-going debate in these key areas of economic policy. We need to combine two things: be clear about our vision for the future and our strategic direction. But we need also to move on to the concrete and the practical and to work on the doable. This country is full of people of goodwill who want to contribute. Let's do it. 5 5

The timing is appropriate. It was just under a year ago that the new Government took office. You will remember that in the lead-up to the election, tax rates had become a key issue. Throughout that period we had made our position on tax rates clear: under a Labour Government the better paid would be expected to contribute more to the country's wellbeing. Therefore one of our first actions as part of the Labour Alliance Coalition Government was to legislate for the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39 percent on income over $60,000 a year. We had to work fast, and within a tight timeframe, so the change would be enacted in time to take effect from the start of present income year. We were well aware that the increase would act as an incentive to some to avoid the top tax rate. For this reason I announced at the same time, in December, that complementary legislation would be introduced as soon as possible. Its purpose would be to counter avoidance of the top rate, and to lower the tax on fringe benefits paid to low-income employees. That has been largely achieved by means of three bills introduced into Parliament this year, two of them already enacted. It has been a busy year on the legislative front, but the big changes have been implemented and our election commitment has been met. We are now in a position to concentrate on the wider tax policy programme and to focus more on the policy development process itself. The generic tax policy process builds public consultation into key stages of tax policy development on major issues. Thus the practical experience and expertise of those who must eventually work with a proposed law change are drawn upon at an early stage. Where consultation shows it to be necessary, the proposal is amended, well before any of it is incorporated into a bill. The results are better, more workable tax law. The Government endorses the generic tax policy process. Even when we were under pressure to deal with issues related to the 39 percent tax rate, we took as much time as we could to talk the changes over with tax practitioners and others. I appreciate that the consultation time was not as much as desired. From now on I will ensure that we use the process fully so that we all get maximum advantage from it. The proposal for the tax treatment of research and development expenditure outlined in the discussion paper released last week has already benefited from this approach. The final form of the proposal reflected the comments and observations of a number of tax practitioners, among them John Shewan of this firm. I would like to thank them for their contribution. We have built a policy work programme that takes into account both the Government's priorities, and the observations and concerns of members of the business and tax communities. We have listened to those observations and concerns, and we will continue to listen. In many cases they are reflected in items that have been included in the work programme. I shall now briefly outline the contents of the work programme over the next two years. Considerable policy resources will be needed to support the Ministerial Review into the Tax System. From a structural perspective the review is important, but it will not yield results until some time in 2003. The review will report to the Government in September next year, and that report will form the basis of proposals that we will take to the electorate for the 2002 election. Clearly, there will not be any big structural reforms in the meantime. Revenue base maintenance is always part of the work programme. Its presence reflects the importance of maintaining stable revenue flows to fund Government expenditure. Part of our efforts are directed at the tax avoidance arena, where, for example, a response is needed to certain schemes targeted at high-income individuals. These schemes, incidentally, date back to when the top personal tax rate was 33 percent. Also as part of base maintenance, we are looking to close loopholes in the law. For example, we recently amended the accrual rules to ensure that gifts of financial arrangements did not give rise to a deduction for the donor. This amendment was the result of the Court of Appeal decision in relation to the Auckland Harbour Board case, which is currently being heard at the Privy Council. Many of the issues on our work programme are organised under three main themes. One of these themes is "tax in a changing world economy". The wider purpose of projects in this group is to ensure that our tax system is appropriate to a small, open economy that is a net capital importer. We also need to ensure that, while our tax system raises the necessary revenue, it also minimises the costs on the New Zealand businesses that compete internationally. For example, more New Zealanders are investing their funds internationally, and our tax system should ensure that offshore investments are treated on a comparable basis to investments within New Zealand. It could be argued that investors in New Zealand unit trusts are disadvantaged compared with investors in certain UK investment funds. This needs to be considered from a policy perspective, as do a number of associated problems. There was some discussion earlier in the year about whether the Government should remove the tax advantage enjoyed by UK unit trusts. I considered it but decided we needed to look at this issue taking into account private sector views. And we need to look at it in the wider context of the overall tax regime that best suits us. Therefore we will be undertaking a general review of the foreign investment fund rules over the next two years. I do not expect proposals to be developed until after the Tax Review has reported in September next year. This will allow for the necessary discussions with the private sector on what you see the issues as being. Those of you who are aware of the policy rationale underlying the foreign investment fund rules will also be aware that there are no easy solutions to the various problems that the regime is reckoned to have. The present rules represent a delicate balance -- or compromise, if you wish -- between policy rationale, compliance costs, and potential taxpayer reaction. The review will consider this compromise, as well as focusing on more detailed issues. GST and imported services is another work programme issue relating to the theme of our tax system in a changing world economy. This project is looking at whether the GST system needs to be modified in light of the growth of electronic commerce. This will be the subject of a discussion document to be released next year. And there is the perennial issue of trans-Tasman imputation issues. Indeed, it was John Shewan who pointed out in a radio interview that the press statement that Peter Costello and I issued on the subject recently bore a strong resemblance to one issued by Peter Costello and Bill Birch on the subject four years ago. I think the similarity indicates that the previous government did not score many points in this area, which admittedly is hard to do, given the bilateral nature of any solution to the triangular taxation problem. However, I have hopes that we will do better. Tax simplification is high priority area of the tax policy work programme. The recent business forum in Auckland, as well as discussions I have held with business people, have emphasised business's frustration with high tax compliance costs. We all want quick action in this area. Paul Swain has been appointed associate Minister of Revenue, and part of his job is focused on tax simplification and compliance costs. You can also expect to see discussion documents in the first part of next year on tax simplification for small business and as part of the review of the compliance and penalty legislation. I also expect to be able to announce proposals for clarifying and simplifying the rules on interest deductibility for companies shortly. A third major theme of the work programme is the taxation of savings and the entities through which individuals invest and save. One of the objectives here is to make the tax rules more consistent between different types of entities. A particular concern of mine is our poor savings record, a situation not helped by the number of disincentives to private savings found in the tax system. We are going to be looking at whether the current tax treatment of savings should be changed in line with this thinking and whether different tax rules will encourage long-term savings. I will conclude by mentioning what the tax community can expect in the way of policy developments over the next six months. There will be numerous opportunities to consult on policy. You will be seeing the release of issues papers on the tax treatment of monetary remuneration -- relating to transfers of holiday pay provisions from one employer to another. A number of discussion documents on other tax topics are also planned. They include the publications on the review of the compliance and penalty legislation, tax simplification for business, and GST and imported services -- as well as the taxation of charities and the tax treatment of Maori authorities. You can expect to see the draft, for public comment, of the rewritten Parts C, D and E of the Income Tax Act, along with a commentary. The rewrite is a massive project whose purpose is to simplify the language and structure of the Act as much as possible, to make the Act more accessible and easier to use. The release of the draft of the first parts to be rewritten will be the culmination of several years' work. Finally, you can expect to see the passage through Parliament of the taxation bill introduced in October, and the introduction of the first of the usual two or three annual taxation bills covering a wide range of topics on the work programme. I am looking forward to hearing your views on these matters of policy and legislation, and to working with you and other members of the tax community. Thank you. PAGE 8 PAGE 5   PAGE 5 Hon Dr Michael Cullen Treasurer, Minister of Finance, Minister for Accident Insurance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House  PAGE 1

Hon Dr Michael Cullen Treasurer, Minister of Finance, Minister for Accident Insurance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House 1 Friday 24 November 2000 Speech Notes Address to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Annual National Tax Conference DR MICHAEL CULLEN SPEECH TO THE ANNUAL NATIONAL TAX CONFERENCE, WAIRAKEI RESORT HOTEL, TAUPO Thank you for inviting me to address your conference today on the Government's tax reform programme. The timing is appropriate. It was just under a year ago that the new Government took office. You will remember that in the lead-up to the election, tax rates had become a key issue. Throughout that period we had made our position on tax rates clear: under a Labour Government the better paid would be expected to contribute more to the country's wellbeing. Therefore one of our first actions as part of the Labour Alliance Coalition Government was to legislate for the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39 percent on income over $60,000 a year. We had to work fast, and within a tight timeframe, so the change would be enacted in time to take effect from the start of present income year. We were well aware that the increase would act as an incentive to some to avoid the top tax rate. For this reason I announced at the same time, in December, that complementary legislation would be introduced as soon as possible. Its purpose would be to counter avoidance of the top rate, and to lower the tax on fringe benefits paid to low-income employees. That has been largely achieved by means of three bills introduced into Parliament this year, two of them already enacted. It has been a busy year on the legislative front, but the big changes have been implemented and our election commitment has been met. We are now in a position to concentrate on the wider tax policy programme and to focus more on the policy development process itself. The generic tax policy process builds public consultation into key stages of tax policy development on major issues. Thus the practical experience and expertise of those who must eventually work with a proposed law change are drawn upon at an early stage. 2 2 Where consultation shows it to be necessary, the proposal is amended, well before any of it is incorporated into a bill. The results are better, more workable tax law. The Government endorses the generic tax policy process. Even when we were under pressure to deal with issues related to the 39 percent tax rate, we took as much time as we could to talk the changes over with tax practitioners and others. I appreciate that the consultation time was not as much as desired. From now on I will ensure that we use the process fully so that we all get maximum advantage from it. The proposal for the tax treatment of research and development expenditure outlined in the discussion paper released last week has already benefited from this approach. The final form of the proposal reflected the comments and observations of a number of tax practitioners, among them John Shewan of this firm. I would like to thank them for their contribution. We have built a policy work programme that takes into account both the Government's priorities, and the observations and concerns of members of the business and tax communities. We have listened to those observations and concerns, and we will continue to listen. In many cases they are reflected in items that have been included in the work programme. I shall now briefly outline the contents of the work programme over the next two years. Considerable policy resources will be needed to support the Ministerial Review into the Tax System. From a structural perspective the review is important, but it will not yield results until some time in 2003. The review will report to the Government in September next year, and that report will form the basis of proposals that we will take to the electorate for the 2002 election. Clearly, there will not be any big structural reforms in the meantime. Revenue base maintenance is always part of the work programme. Its presence reflects the importance of maintaining stable revenue flows to fund Government expenditure. Part of our efforts are directed at the tax avoidance arena, where, for example, a response is needed to certain schemes targeted at high-income individuals. These schemes, incidentally, date back to when the top personal tax rate was 33 percent. Also as part of base maintenance, we are looking to close loopholes in the law. For example, we recently amended the accrual rules to ensure that gifts of financial arrangements did not give rise to a deduction for the donor. This amendment was the result of the Court of Appeal decision in relation to the Auckland Harbour Board case, which is currently being heard at the Privy Council. 3 3 Many of the issues on our work programme are organised under three main themes. One of these themes is "tax in a changing world economy". The wider purpose of projects in this group is to ensure that our tax system is appropriate to a small, open economy that is a net capital importer. We also need to ensure that, while our tax system raises the necessary revenue, it also minimises the costs on the New Zealand businesses that compete internationally. For example, more New Zealanders are investing their funds internationally, and our tax system should ensure that offshore investments are treated on a comparable basis to investments within New Zealand. It could be argued that investors in New Zealand unit trusts are disadvantaged compared with investors in certain UK investment funds. This needs to be considered from a policy perspective, as do a number of associated problems. There was some discussion earlier in the year about whether the Government should remove the tax advantage enjoyed by UK unit trusts. I considered it but decided we needed to look at this issue taking into account private sector views. And we need to look at it in the wider context of the overall tax regime that best suits us. Therefore we will be undertaking a general review of the foreign investment fund rules over the next two years. I do not expect proposals to be developed until after the Tax Review has reported in September next year. This will allow for the necessary discussions with the private sector on what you see the issues as being. Those of you who are aware of the policy rationale underlying the foreign investment fund rules will also be aware that there are no easy solutions to the various problems that the regime is reckoned to have. The present rules represent a delicate balance -- or compromise, if you wish - - between policy rationale, compliance costs, and potential taxpayer reaction. The review will consider this compromise, as well as focusing on more detailed issues. GST and imported services is another work programme issue relating to the theme of our tax system in a changing world economy. This project is looking at whether the GST system needs to be modified in light of the growth of electronic commerce. This will be the subject of a discussion document to be released next year. And there is the perennial issue of trans-Tasman imputation issues. Indeed, it was John Shewan who pointed out in a radio interview that the press statement that Peter Costello and I issued on the subject recently bore a strong resemblance to one issued by Peter Costello and Bill Birch on the subject four years ago. I think the similarity indicates that the previous government did not score many points in this area, which admittedly is hard to 4 4 do, given the bilateral nature of any solution to the triangular taxation problem. However, I have hopes that we will do better. Tax simplification is high priority area of the tax policy work programme. The recent business forum in Auckland, as well as discussions I have held with business people, have emphasised business's frustration with high tax compliance costs. We all want quick action in this area. Paul Swain has been appointed associate Minister of Revenue, and part of his job is focused on tax simplification and compliance costs. You can also expect to see discussion documents in the first part of next year on tax simplification for small business and as part of the review of the compliance and penalty legislation. I also expect to be able to announce proposals for clarifying and simplifying the rules on interest deductibility for companies shortly. A third major theme of the work programme is the taxation of savings and the entities through which individuals invest and save. One of the objectives here is to make the tax rules more consistent between different types of entities. A particular concern of mine is our poor savings record, a situation not helped by the number of disincentives to private savings found in the tax system. We are going to be looking at whether the current tax treatment of savings should be changed in line with this thinking and whether different tax rules will encourage long-term savings. I will conclude by mentioning what the tax community can expect in the way of policy developments over the next six months. There will be numerous opportunities to consult on policy. You will be seeing the release of issues papers on the tax treatment of monetary remuneration -- relating to transfers of holiday pay provisions from one employer to another. A number of discussion documents on other tax topics are also planned. They include the publications on the review of the compliance and penalty legislation, tax simplification for business, and GST and imported services -- as well as the taxation of charities and the tax treatment of Maori authorities. You can expect to see the draft, for public comment, of the rewritten Parts C, D and E of the Income Tax Act, along with a commentary. The rewrite is a massive project whose purpose is to simplify the language and structure of the Act as much as possible, to make the Act more accessible and easier to use. The release of the draft of the first parts to be rewritten will be the culmination of several years' work. Finally, you can expect to see the passage through Parliament of the taxation bill introduced in October, and the introduction of the first of the usual two or three annual taxation bills covering a wide range of topics on the work programme. 5 5 I am looking forward to hearing your views on these matters of policy and legislation, and to working with you and other members of the tax community. Thank you.

Presentation to PricewaterhouseCoopers TLS Conference By: Robin Oliver General Manager (Policy) Inland Revenue Department Phone: (04) 474 7113 (021) 633 748 Fax: (04) 474 7006 E-mail:  HYPERLINK mailto:robin.oliver@ird.govt.nz robin.oliver@ird.govt.nz 23 November 2000 Introduction Depending upon one�s point of view, New Zealand embarked on a period of major tax reform in 1982 (with the McCaw Report) or 1984 (with the election of the fourth Labour Government). Since that time significant tax legislation has been constantly before our Parliament. Few in our profession can now recall the times when tax change consisted of annual Budget announcements that tinkered with rates or incentives. Changes to fundamental tax rules now seem to be a constant. Over the past year we have seen the introduction of legislation covering: The increase in the top personal marginal tax rate to 39%. The tax on superannuation fund withdrawals. Fringe benefit tax changes. The taxation of alienated personal services income. Changes to the tax treatment of income derived by minor beneficiaries. Tax measures arising from the Finance and Expenditure Committee Inquiry. The taxation of restraints of trade and inducement payments. A raft of measures flowing from the GST review. Spanning over 15 years of activity, this level of tax reform amounts to a lot of expended energy. In this address I consider what has been achieved. I also reflect on what it means for the future. Will it ever stop? Right now seems an appropriate time for such reflection. The Government has announced the membership and terms of reference of the McLeod Tax Review. That review has been given the task of considering the architecture of a tax system appropriate for New Zealand into the future. The Tax System Since 1984 The relative level of taxation has not altered significantly since 1984. Taxation rose from about 30% of GDP in 1984 to about 35% by the end of the decade. However, that increase largely reflected a more prudent fiscal position. In other words the government started meeting its expenditure from taxation rather than borrowing. Throughout the 1990s, the tax/GDP ratio remained at about 35%. As table 1 illustrates, New Zealand is a middle-level tax burden country in the OECD. Our tax/GDP ratio is lower than those of Denmark or Sweden but higher than those of Japan, USA and Australia. There has been little significant change here.   Table 1:Tax/GDP ratios\* (1996) % Denmark 52.2 Sweden 52.0 France 45.7  Germany 38.1 New Zealand 35.8 United Kingdom 36.0 Australia 31.1 United States of America 28.5 Japan 28.4 \*includes local taxes Where there has been significant change is in the composition of tax. This is illustrated in table 2. Table 2: The changing composition of the New Zealand tax base from 1984 to 1999 In 1984 the New Zealand tax system was characterised by a high reliance on individual income taxes and a low reliance on consumption or sales taxes. In addition, a relatively small proportion of tax was collected from the corporate sector. The main change since 1984 has been the increased reliance on consumption tax (from 13% to 25% of tax revenue) as a result of the introduction of GST. The income tax base has been broadened (FBT, accrual rules, international tax rules, and removal or reduction of corporate tax concessions). This has allowed less reliance to be required to be placed on individual income tax. From this being about two-thirds of the tax base, it has reduced to less than half. These changes have also allowed a number of taxes to be removed (land tax, death duties and stamp duties). Other features of tax reform since 1984 have been: The increased use of withholding taxes (company imputation and resident withholding tax on interest and dividends). The expansion of the use of the tax system to deliver social programmes: Family Support Family Plus Student loans Child Support ACC. Ongoing efforts to simplify the tax system. Achievements here have been more apparent for individuals than for companies. The single most important measure was probably the removal of deductibility for employment-related expenses. This allowed the more recent measures to remove the requirement for most individuals to file tax returns. Income Tax on Individuals As previously noted, post-1984 reforms have significantly reduced the reliance the tax system placed on individual income taxes. That enabled a reduction in high individual marginal income tax rates. The top marginal rate was reduced from 66% to 33% until this year, when it was increased to 39%. This is not very high by international standards (although the top rate does cut in at what is in international terms relatively modest income levels, $60,000). This is illustrated in table 3.   Table 3:Top Individual Income Tax Rates  % New Zealand 39 Australia (over 50K) 47 United Kingdom 40 United States of America 40 Japan 50\* Germany 53\* \*plus local taxes This still leaves New Zealand with an individual income tax scale that is distinctly progressive. As illustrated in table 4, most taxpayers earn under $20,000 a year, but less than 15% of tax is collected from this group. Conversely, a small proportion of taxpayers derive over $100,000 of annual income, but over 15% of income tax is collected from this group. Table 4:Income tax collected from individuals for year ended March 1998  One should not conclude from this that most tax is collected off the top of high incomes. Quite the reverse is, in fact, true. A key feature of the New Zealand income tax scale is that there is no income threshold before tax is payable. A few rebates aside, income is collected on the first dollar derived. As illustrated in table 5, a high proportion of the tax revenue is collected from the first $10,000 of income derived by everyone (rich and poor), whereas relatively little is collected from marginal income over $100,000 a year. This simply reflects the fact that most adults earn $10,000 a year, but few people earn over $100,000 a year. Table 5:Additional income tax collected from individuals by taxing their next $10,000 of income for the year ended March 1998  Our lack of income threshold explains why New Zealand can collect reasonably high levels of tax at rates that are relatively low internationally. For a single person on average employment income, New Zealand�s marginal rate of income tax plus social security contributions was in 1998 the second lowest in the OECD. Only Korea was lower. By contrast, New Zealand had relatively high marginal rates (similar to those of Germany and USA) for a married single income earner with two children. That reflects Family Support abatement. Company Tax The New Zealand company tax rate of 33% is well below previous rates of 45-48%. The 33% rate is within quite a narrow band of international corporate tax rates, as illustrated in table 6.  Table 6:Company Tax Rates % Sweden 28 France 41 Germany 30\*  United Kingdom 31 New Zealand 33 Canada 38 Australia 30+ United States of America 35 Japan 38\* \*plus local taxes + reducing to We have been able to reduce our company tax rate to within this international norm while still increasing the level of tax collected from the corporate sector. As a percentage of tax revenue, company tax has increased from about 8% of revenue in 1984 to 12-15% now. That reflects a programme of tax concession removal and base maintenance. Nevertheless, our corporate tax base remains susceptible to erosion. That is because it relies heavily on the finance and business services sector as illustrated in table 7. Table 7:Industry distribution of New Zealand�s income tax revenue year ended March 1998  The finance sector, in particular, has the available cash-flow to take advantage of holes in legislation. Hence the ongoing need for active base maintenance. A Stocktake The New Zealand tax reform programme has been orthodox. The New Zealand tax system does not stand out internationally as being abnormal. Reforms have been extensive but within international norms, driven by the objective of raising substantial tax revenue efficiently and fairly. That can be illustrated by comparing the Australian Ralph proposals with reforms that New Zealand has implemented. This comparison is made in tables 8 and 9. Table 8:Business Tax Reform AustraliaNZDateDepreciationCh 1Yes1992Trading stockCh 2Yes1997GoodwillCh 3NoFinancial assets & liabilitiesCh 4-7Yes1986Leases & rightsCh 8-10Yes1982 & 1999Capital gainsCH 11-14, 28,29N/AEntity distributionsCh 15-23Yes19988 & 1992Anti-avoidanceCh 24YesOngoingConsolidationCh 24Yes1992Non-resident investmentsCh 30Yes1992 � 1995Conduit investmentCh 31Yes1998Foreign income of residentsCh 32Yes1988 + 1992Source/Transfer Pricing/Thin CapCh 33Yes1994Life Insurance & SuperCh 34 � 37Yes1988Fringe benefitsCh 38Yes 1984 The Ralph proposals mirror New Zealand reforms but within a more compressed timeframe. Overall, we seem to have been reasonably successful at building an orthodox tax system. OECD studies suggest that our tax system is less economically costly than most other systems, although its measured compliance costs may be relatively high. From what we know (which is very little) about the size of the hidden economy, that seems relatively low, as illustrated in table 9. Table 9:Size of hidden economy as % of GDP  The Global Economic Forum posed the question �Does the tax system in your country enhance business competitiveness?� and ranks the responses from 10 (positive) to 0 (negative). New Zealand scored a surprising level of satisfaction, as shown in table�10. Table 10:Comparison of taxpayer response to statement�The tax system in your country enhances business competitiveness�  The Future The government expects that the McLeod Review will consider whether New Zealand�s basic tax architecture, as outlined above, should be altered. Regardless of the outcome of that review, I do not see a major slackening of the pace of tax changes. That is because of the ongoing requirement for active base maintenance, as well as the two major challenges facing the tax system: simplification and changes in the world economy. Tax Simplification As previously mentioned, some data suggest that New Zealand tax compliance costs are high, although such international comparisons need to be treated with caution. However, the point remains that businesses continue to emphasise their concern with tax compliance costs and this concern needs, as far as possible, to be met with a constructive response. Early next year the Government will release a discussion document covering business simplification. Simplification is not simple, nor is it easy. A constructive simplification programme that achieves something needs to: Combine policy changes with operational changes within IRD. Recognise that as well as taxpayers and the IRD, other intermediaries (such as tax agents and banks) are part of the tax system. Capitalise on the opportunities technology provides to change the way tax questions can be posed and answered. Above all, we need to identify and deal with the main problems businesses face in operating within the tax system. That seems to be much more a matter of minimising risk than minimising the number of forms and payment dates. More forms create more risk of mistakes tying up a business in an expensive dispute process. It is this concern that needs to be addressed. A second aspect of tax simplification is the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Early next year the Government will be releasing an exposure draft on the rewrite of Parts C, D, and E. This will be followed by legislation towards the end of the year. Reaching this stage of the rewrite has taken considerable time and resources. We have in the process considered various approaches to the rewrite, ranging from the quite radical to simply reordering. The proposed approach will lie between these. It will veer towards the conceptually familiar at the cost of retaining some structural tensions. On the other hand, it will be unfamiliar enough to be unsettling for some. For example, the rewrite will not have the wording of section CD 1(2)(a) bringing to gross income an amount: �derived from the sale or other disposition of any land if the land was acquired for the purpose or intention, or for purposes or intentions including the purpose or intention, of selling or otherwise disposing of it�. Finally, the rewrite will not make complex underlying rules simple. However drafted, complex rules remain complex. A Changing World The world economy is changing. The tax system needs to be monitored and modified where necessary to reflect this. As countries become more interdependent, more of this work will be considered at a multi-national level. In tax, the main international body is the OECD�s Committee on Fiscal Affairs. That Committee is structured as per table 11. Table 11:               The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices has been consuming considerable New Zealand resources. It is establishing international standards on acceptable national tax rules and also considering a co-ordinated approach by OECD countries to counter harmful practices. A report on harmful tax competition was released in May 1998 and an update report in mid-2000. OECD countries have agreed that within the OECD, the harmful features of preferential regimes need to be eliminated by April 2003. New Zealand is one of the few countries with no potentially harmful practices. Outside the OECD, 47 potentially unco-operative tax havens have been identified, and commitments are being sought by July 2001 for those countries to commit to remove their harmful practices. Other policy focal points of OECD work are: Working Party 9 (VAT, reverse charging and e-Commerce). Working Party 1 (DTAs). Working Party 6 (Thin capitalisation rules). The work of the OECD is likely to become increasingly important to us. The private sector can provide input through the OECD�s Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC). Conclusion Since 1984 we have had continuous tax reform that seems to have been reasonably successful in building an internationally orthodox and efficient tax system. However, the pace of reform is not likely to reduce. The McLeod Review will consider the architecture of our tax system, and we face many challenges such as simplification and changes in the world economy. At the end of the day, the tax system is too important and too pervasive not to keep it under constant review. Table 12 illustrates its central place in our society. A good tax system raises revenue without unduly damaging the economy. The tax revenue funds a strong public sector that assists the economy. A strong economy leads to strong revenue flows. In other words, a good tax system helps build a strong economy and a strong public sector that reinforces the good tax system.

The New Zealand Tax System: where we have got to, where should we be going? Presentation to PricewaterhouseCoopers TLS Conference By: Robin Oliver General Manager (Policy) Inland Revenue Department Phone:(04) 474 7113 (021) 633 748 Fax:(04) 474 7006 E-mail:robin.oliver@ird.govt.nz 23 November 2000 Page 1 INTRODUCTION Depending upon one’s point of view, New Zealand embarked on a period of major tax reform in 1982 (with the McCaw Report) or 1984 (with the election of the fourth Labour Government). Since that time significant tax legislation has been constantly before our Parliament. Few in our profession can now recall the times when tax change consisted of annual Budget announcements that tinkered with rates or incentives. Changes to fundamental tax rules now seem to be a constant. Over the past year we have seen the introduction of legislation covering: • The increase in the top personal marginal tax rate to 39%. • The tax on superannuation fund withdrawals. • Fringe benefit tax changes. • The taxation of alienated personal services income. • Changes to the tax treatment of income derived by minor beneficiaries. • Tax measures arising from the Finance and Expenditure Committee Inquiry. • The taxation of restraints of trade and inducement payments. • A raft of measures flowing from the GST review. Spanning over 15 years of activity, this level of tax reform amounts to a lot of expended energy. In this address I consider what has been achieved. I also reflect on what it means for the future. Will it ever stop? Right now seems an appropriate time for such reflection. The Government has announced the membership and terms of reference of the McLeod Tax Review. That review has been given the task of considering the architecture of a tax system appropriate for New Zealand into the future. THE TAX SYSTEM SINCE 1984 The relative level of taxation has not altered significantly since 1984. Taxation rose from about 30% of GDP in 1984 to about 35% by the end of the decade. However, that increase largely reflected a more prudent fiscal position. In other words the government started meeting its expenditure from taxation rather than borrowing. Throughout the 1990s, the tax/GDP ratio remained at about 35%. As table 1 illustrates, New Zealand is a middle-level tax burden country in the OECD. Our tax/GDP ratio is lower than those of Denmark or Sweden but higher than those of Japan, USA and Australia. There has been little significant change here.

This is illustrated in table 2.

In addition, a relatively small proportion of tax was collected from the corporate sector. The main change since 1984 has been the increased reliance on consumption tax (from 13% to 25% of tax revenue) as a result of the introduction of GST. The income tax base has been broadened (FBT, accrual rules, international tax rules, and removal or reduction of corporate tax concessions). This has allowed less reliance to be required to be placed on individual income tax. From this being about two-thirds of the tax base, it has reduced to less than half. These changes have also allowed a number of taxes to be removed (land tax, death duties and stamp duties). Other features of tax reform since 1984 have been: • The increased use of withholding taxes (company imputation and resident withholding tax on interest and dividends). • The expansion of the use of the tax system to deliver social programmes: ß Family Support ß Family Plus ß Student loans ß Child Support ß ACC. • Ongoing efforts to simplify the tax system. Achievements here have been more apparent for individuals than for companies. The single most important measure was probably the removal of deductibility for employment-related expenses. This allowed the more recent measures to remove the requirement for most individuals to file tax returns. INCOME TAX ON INDIVIDUALS As previously noted, post-1984 reforms have significantly reduced the reliance the tax system placed on individual income taxes. That enabled a reduction in high individual marginal income tax rates. The top marginal rate was reduced from 66% to 33% until this year, when it was increased to 39%. This is not very high by international standards (although the top rate does cut in at what is in international terms relatively modest income levels, $60,000). This is illustrated in table 3. Page 4 TABLE 3: TOP INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES % New Zealand39 Australia (over 50K)47 United Kingdom40 United States of America40 Japan50\* Germany53\* \*plus local taxes This still leaves New Zealand with an individual income tax scale that is distinctly progressive. As illustrated in table 4, most taxpayers earn under $20,000 a year, but less than 15% of tax is collected from this group. Conversely, a small proportion of taxpayers derive over $100,000 of annual income, but over 15% of income tax is collected from this group.

Quite the reverse is, in fact, true. A key feature of the New Zealand income tax scale is that there is no income threshold before tax is payable. A few rebates aside, income is collected on the first dollar derived. As illustrated in table 5, a high proportion of the tax revenue is collected from the first $10,000 of income derived by everyone (rich and poor), whereas relatively little is collected from marginal income over $100,000 a year. This simply reflects the fact that most adults earn $10,000 a year, but few people earn over $100,000 a year. TABLE 5: ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX COLLECTED FROM INDIVIDUALS BY TAXING THEIR NEXT $10,000 OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 1998 Our lack of income threshold explains why New Zealand can collect reasonably high levels of tax at rates that are relatively low internationally. For a single person on average employment income, New Zealand’s marginal rate of income tax plus social security contributions was in 1998 the second lowest in the OECD. Only Korea was lower. By contrast, New Zealand had relatively high marginal rates (similar to those of Germany and USA) for a married single income earner with two children. That reflects Family Support abatement. COMPANY TAX The New Zealand company tax rate of 33% is well below previous rates of 45-48%. The 33% rate is within quite a narrow band of international corporate tax rates, as illustrated in table 6. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 $0 to $10,000 $10,001 to $20,000 $20,001 to $30,000 $30,001 to $40,000 $40,001 to $50,000 $50,001 to $60,000 $60,001 to $70,000 $70,001 to $80,000 $80,001 to $90,000 $90,001 to $100,000 $100,001 plus Additional Income Earned 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Net Additional Income Tax Collected (LHS) Number of Affected Taxpayers (RHS) Page 6 TABLE 6: COMPANY TAX RATES % Sweden28 France41 Germany30\* United Kingdom31 New Zealand33 Canada38 Australia30+ United States of America35 Japan38\* \*plus local taxes + reducing to We have been able to reduce our company tax rate to within this international norm while still increasing the level of tax collected from the corporate sector. As a percentage of tax revenue, company tax has increased from about 8% of revenue in 1984 to 12-15% now. That reflects a programme of tax concession removal and base maintenance. Nevertheless, our corporate tax base remains susceptible to erosion. That is because it relies heavily on the finance and business services sector as illustrated in table 7. TABLE 7: INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTION OF NEW ZEALAND’S INCOME TAX REVENUE YEAR ENDED MARCH 1998 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% Agriculture Forestry, Fishing and Mining Manufacturing Electricity, Gas and Water Supply Construction Wholesale Trade Retail Trade Accommodation, Cafes and Restaurants Transport, Storage & Communication Finance & Business Services etc Government Services Other Services Percentage contribution Business Income TaxesPAYE Page 7 The finance sector, in particular, has the available cash-flow to take advantage of holes in legislation. Hence the ongoing need for active base maintenance. A STOCKTAKE The New Zealand tax reform programme has been orthodox. The New Zealand tax system does not stand out internationally as being abnormal. Reforms have been extensive but within international norms, driven by the objective of raising substantial tax revenue efficiently and fairly. That can be illustrated by comparing the Australian Ralph proposals with reforms that New Zealand has implemented. This comparison is made in tables 8 and 9.

Overall, we seem to have been reasonably successful at building an orthodox tax system. OECD studies suggest that our tax system is less economically costly than most other systems, although its measured compliance costs may be relatively high. From what we know (which is very little) about the size of the hidden economy, that seems relatively low, as illustrated in table 9.

New Zealand scored a surprising level of satisfaction, as shown in table 10.

Regardless of the outcome of that review, I do not see a major slackening of the pace of tax changes. That is because of the ongoing requirement for active base maintenance, as well as the two major challenges facing the tax system: simplification and changes in the world economy. TAX SIMPLIFICATION As previously mentioned, some data suggest that New Zealand tax compliance costs are high, although such international comparisons need to be treated with caution. However, the point remains that businesses continue to emphasise their concern with tax compliance costs and this concern needs, as far as possible, to be met with a constructive response. Early next year the Government will release a discussion document covering business simplification. Simplification is not simple, nor is it easy. A constructive simplification programme that achieves something needs to: • Combine policy changes with operational changes within IRD. • Recognise that as well as taxpayers and the IRD, other intermediaries (such as tax agents and banks) are part of the tax system. • Capitalise on the opportunities technology provides to change the way tax questions can be posed and answered. Above all, we need to identify and deal with the main problems businesses face in operating within the tax system. That seems to be much more a matter of minimising risk than minimising the number of forms and payment dates. More forms create more risk of mistakes tying up a business in an expensive dispute process. It is this concern that needs to be addressed. A second aspect of tax simplification is the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Early next year the Government will be releasing an exposure draft on the rewrite of Parts C, D, and E. This will be followed by legislation towards the end of the year. Reaching this stage of the rewrite has taken considerable time and resources. We have in the process considered various approaches to the rewrite, ranging from the quite radical to simply reordering. The proposed approach will lie between these. It will veer towards the conceptually familiar at the cost of retaining some structural tensions. On the other hand, it will be unfamiliar enough to be unsettling for some. For example, the rewrite will not have the wording of section CD 1(2)(a) bringing to gross income an amount: “derived from the sale or other disposition of any land if the land was acquired for the purpose or intention, or for purposes or intentions including the purpose or intention, of selling or otherwise disposing of it”. Finally, the rewrite Page 10 will not make complex underlying rules simple. However drafted, complex rules remain complex. A CHANGING WORLD The world economy is changing. The tax system needs to be monitored and modified where necessary to reflect this. As countries become more interdependent, more of this work will be considered at a multi-national level. In tax, the main international body is the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs. That Committee is structured as per table 11. TABLE 11: E-commerce TAGs Forum on Strategic Management Committee on Fiscal Affairs WP1 – Tax Conventions WP2 – Tax Analysis and Statistics WP6 – Multinational Enterprises WP8 – Tax Avoidance and Evasion WP9 – Consumption Taxes Special session on Innovative Financial Transactions Forum on Harmful Tax Practices Page 11 The Forum on Harmful Tax Practices has been consuming considerable New Zealand resources. It is establishing international standards on acceptable national tax rules and also considering a co-ordinated approach by OECD countries to counter harmful practices. A report on harmful tax competition was released in May 1998 and an update report in mid-2000. OECD countries have agreed that within the OECD, the harmful features of preferential regimes need to be eliminated by April 2003. New Zealand is one of the few countries with no potentially harmful practices. Outside the OECD, 47 potentially unco-operative tax havens have been identified, and commitments are being sought by July 2001 for those countries to commit to remove their harmful practices. Other policy focal points of OECD work are: • Working Party 9 (VAT, reverse charging and e-Commerce). • Working Party 1 (DTAs). • Working Party 6 (Thin capitalisation rules). The work of the OECD is likely to become increasingly important to us. The private sector can provide input through the OECD’s Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC). CONCLUSION Since 1984 we have had continuous tax reform that seems to have been reasonably successful in building an internationally orthodox and efficient tax system. However, the pace of reform is not likely to reduce. The McLeod Review will consider the architecture of our tax system, and we face many challenges such as simplification and changes in the world economy. At the end of the day, the tax system is too important and too pervasive not to keep it under constant review. Table 12 illustrates its central place in our society. A good tax system raises revenue without unduly damaging the economy. The tax revenue funds a strong public sector that assists the economy. A strong economy leads to strong revenue flows. In other words, a good tax system helps build a strong economy and a strong public sector that reinforces the good tax system.

Several developments since the introduction of GST made it timely to review the tax. In particular, a number of issues that have arisen suggested the original policy intent of the legislation was either not being achieved, or was ambiguous and needed clarification. The objective of the review was to re-examine GST in light of those developments to determine whether it was possible to achieve further reductions in the costs of paying and collecting GST revenue. Specifically, the review sought to: • reduce compliance and administrative difficulties in the practical application of GST; • limit the scope for obtaining unintended GST advantages; and • generate discussion on the longer-term issues of the GST treatment of imported services and financial services. The review has not been a forum to reconsider the principle of a broad-based, single rate tax with few exceptions, nor the other principles underlying the overall design of GST. These underlying principles remain fundamentally sound, and the changes to the Act are consistent with them. In March 1999 the then Government, as a part of the Generic Tax Policy Process, released the discussion document GST: A Review, outlining proposals for reform of the Act. The proposals in the discussion document covered compliance cost reduction, base maintenance and remedial measures as outlined below: • Compliance cost saving measures These include: - increasing the threshold for compulsory registration and other thresholds; and - easing the compliance costs of making adjustments for private and other non-taxable use. 4 • Base maintenance measures These include: - restricting the second-hand goods input tax credit in transactions between associated persons; - changing the rules affecting deregistration; - removing avoidance opportunities in relation to deferred settlements; and - amending the general anti-avoidance provision (section 76 of the Act). • Remedial There were numerous other proposals of a remedial nature, including changes to the definition of “financial services”, the treatment of going concerns, the definition of “associated persons”, the zero-rating of services in relation to exported goods and exported information services and the treatment of factored debts. In addition, longer-term issues were discussed, namely the treatment of imported services and the future treatment of financial services. These issues are being considered as a part of the next stage of the review. The amendments in this bill are based on the proposals in the discussion document, as modified after submissions and consultation. Issues that have arisen during the consultative process, or that officials have identified, are also included in this bill. Key amendments There are several amendments to key sections in the scheme of the Act to ensure that the policy intent of the legislation is achieved and that the costs of paying and collecting GST revenue are reduced. The registration threshold The threshold over which people are required to register for GST was last adjusted in 1990 as a result of recommendations from the Taxation Simplification Consultative Committee. It is therefore necessary to adjust the level of the threshold to take account of inflation since 1990. The registration threshold will be increased from $30,000 to $40,000, in line with inflation since 1990 and with expected inflation for the next five to ten years. The increased threshold will apply from 1 October 2000. 5 Adjustments to input and output tax Inland Revenue requires adjustments to be made in each taxable period that an asset is owned to reflect continuing changes in use. This can result in high compliance costs for small amounts of revenue. The amendments will give registered persons the option to pay additional output tax for private or exempt use on a one-off or annual basis rather than in each taxable period. If the one-off basis were chosen, further adjustments would be required at the time a change in use of 20 percent or more occurred. Registered persons will also be allowed to make input tax adjustments on an annual rather than a tax-period basis. Several other, more minor amendments will also reduce compliance costs. The input tax credit allowed under the existing section 21(5) for changes from non- taxable to taxable use will be limited to supplies of goods and services which satisfy the requirements for an input tax credit, except for the requirement that the goods and services be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and certain additional requirements in the case of second-hand goods. This will ensure that assets imported into New Zealand (such as ships) without incurring a GST liability will not qualify for an input tax credit. This amendment will apply to transactions entered into from 1 October 1986, unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has agreed in writing to the input tax credit claim before the date the bill is introduced. The second-hand goods input tax credit The input tax credit for second-hand goods acquired from non-registered vendors has enabled registered purchasers to claim large GST refunds in relation to goods (particularly land) on which GST has not been paid by the vendor. This is particularly problematic where assets are held for many years before they are sold. In some cases it appears that second-hand goods are sold to an associated person principally to gain the input tax credit. Allowing input tax credits in such circumstances merely subsidises the purchase price and creates an unintended GST advantage. The amendment limits the credit available in relation to supplies of second-hand goods between associated parties to the GST component (if any) of the purchase price to the vendor to remove the incentive to enter into transactions primarily to gain the input tax credit. Deregistration The current deregistration rule allows scope for avoidance activity and creates a more favourable treatment for assets retained and then sold as opposed to assets sold before deregistration. On deregistration, output tax is payable on the lesser of the cost or open market value of goods and services held by a registered person. However, if that person sold those goods and services while still registered, output tax would be payable on the sale price (usually equivalent to the open market value). Therefore, assuming the lesser cost option is adopted, a lower output tax liability arises in relation to assets held on deregistration that have appreciated in value. Since the requirement to pay GST on deregistration is intended to reflect that the registered person has, in effect, made a supply to themselves in their private capacity, this difference is anomalous. 6 Furthermore, if the deregistered person then sells the goods to a registered person, a second-hand goods input tax credit may be claimed for one-ninth of the purchase price, or if the parties are associated, one-ninth of the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value. If the deregistered person has paid output tax on the basis of the cost of the goods, significant tax advantages may arise from the sale of goods which have increased in value since they were originally acquired. The amendment requires GST to be paid on the open market value of assets retained on deregistration. This will reduce the scope for avoidance activity in this area and the more favourable treatment for assets retained and then sold, as opposed to assets sold before deregistration, ensuring that the output tax payable is the same in both cases. The Government has noted concerns that in relation to assets acquired before the introduction of GST, for which no input tax credits were allowed, taxing increases in value since acquisition could create a significant tax burden for some. The deemed supply on deregistration of pre-GST assets will, therefore, continue to be able to be valued at the lower of cost or open market value. Deferred settlements By substantially deferring the date of settlement, timing advantages can be gained in transactions between registered persons using different bases of accounting for GST. A purchaser on the invoice basis is able to claim an immediate input tax credit but a vendor on the payments basis is able to defer the payment of output tax until payment is received. The amendment requires output tax to be returned on an invoice basis for any supply exceeding $225,000 (including GST) in value. To ensure that cash flow and compliance concerns do not arise for shorter term deferred settlements, agreements where settlement must be made within 93 days will be excluded. The period of 93 days is consistent with the exclusion for short-term agreements in the accrual rules in the Income Tax Act 1994. To prevent registered persons from entering into arrangements to avoid the $225,000 threshold by splitting a supply of goods or services into a number of transactions, the Commissioner will be given a discretion to require the registered person to account for those transactions on an invoice basis. The general anti-avoidance provision The general anti-avoidance provision has a number of possible deficiencies which may limit its potential application. For example, in determining whether there is tax avoidance the section relies on the subjective test of the taxpayer’s intention in entering into an arrangement. A further possible problem is that section 76 applies only where “the application of the Act” is defeated. Many avoidance arrangements are structured so that the specific provisions of the Act do apply, and there is an argument that section 76 does not apply in these circumstances. 7 Section 76 will be amended to follow more closely the general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, sections BG 1 and GB 1. This will achieve consistency between the general anti-avoidance provisions in the GST and Income Tax Acts and will allow a similar analysis to be used when considering the respective provisions. Aligning the provisions would also allow the case law dealing with the income tax provision to be used to interpret the GST provision. Application dates Unless otherwise stated, the amendments will apply from the date of enactment. 8 DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” (Clauses 66(2) and 67) Summary of proposed amendments The amendment addresses several deficiencies in the definition of “associated persons”. The new definition will be based on the broader definition used in section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 for international tax and certain other purposes, with the following main modifications: • The rule for determining whether a company and an individual are associated will use a 25 percent interest threshold. • A new rule will require the aggregation of all interests held directly by a person with those held by associated persons for the purpose of determining whether two companies or a company and an individual are associated. • The “relatives test” will include people in a relationship in the nature of marriage. • A universal test for treating as associated persons those with a common relationship to another person will be introduced. • There will be no “habitually acting in concert” test. Background The current definition of “associated persons” for GST purposes is largely based on that in section OD 8(4), used for the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 relating to land. It is deficient in relation to some trust arrangements and does not apply to relationships in the nature of marriage. It also has inadequate nominee “look through” rules. Furthermore, the definition treats as associated persons individuals who have a minor level of association with a company (a voting or market value interest of 10 percent or more). This percentage is no longer appropriate, given changes to the fringe benefit tax rules some time ago. 1 Key features The new definition of “associated persons” will have the following features: • It will use a 25 percent interest threshold for determining whether a company and an individual are associated. 1 The relevant Income Tax Act 1994 provision was repealed with effect from 1 April 1989. 9 • It will replace the nominee “look through” rules with a rule requiring the aggregation of all interests held directly by a person with those held by associated persons for the purpose of determining whether two companies or a company and an individual are associated. • It will use the more narrow definition of “relatives” contained in paragraph (b) of the definition of “relative” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. • It will extend the “relatives” test to include people in a relationship in the nature of marriage. • It will retain the existing “trustee-beneficiary” test in the GST Act definition. • It will treat as associated a trustee of a trust and a settlor of that trust. • It will treat as associated a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if there is a common settlor of both trusts. • It will use a universal tripartite test to treat as associated any two persons where one of those persons is associated with a third person who is associated with the other of those two persons. 10 IMPORTERS ACTING AS AGENTS FOR NON-RESIDENTS (Clause 69(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment allows importers acting as agents for principals outside New Zealand to claim input tax credits for goods they import. Under the current legislation, as legal title to any goods imported does not pass to the importer, they may be denied input tax credits, even though they have paid GST on the importation of the goods. Background Goods that are imported into New Zealand are subject to GST administered by the New Zealand Customs Service. The importer may claim an input tax credit for the GST if the goods were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The Taxation Review Authority in Case T35 2 held that the word “acquired” meant that legal title to the goods had to pass to the importer. This can have adverse consequences for an importer who acts as agent for an unregistered principal who is outside New Zealand – for example, for the purposes of consumer warranty agreements with a non-resident manufacturer. Key feature The definition of “input tax” will be amended to include the situation where goods are imported into New Zealand and applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 2 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,235. 11 “FINANCIAL SERVICES” (Clauses 68, 73(9) and 76(1) and (6)) Overview If a service falls within the definition of “financial services” it qualifies as an exempt supply under section 14(a). Financial services are exempt from GST because of the practical difficulties involved in identifying the amount of value added by suppliers of financial services, since the margin that is charged by the supplier is hard to separate from the total funds transferred. The broad policy underlying the definition of financial services is to encompass services provided under agreements involving the exchange of money or close substitutes for money, such as shares. In contrast, agreements that involve the supply of a commodity should generally be included in the GST base. The amendments address areas where change is needed to ensure that the intended scope of the definition, and therefore the scope of the exemption, is achieved. The need for such changes is inevitable as there will always be innovations in the financial services area that could not have been contemplated when the definition was enacted. Debt collection services (Clause 68(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The supply of debt collection services other than by the creditor whose debt is being collected will be treated as a taxable supply. Background Debt collection services are currently treated as an exempt supply of financial services. This treatment of debt collection came about unintentionally, as a result of the insertion of section 3(1)(ka) in 1986. Section 3(1)(ka) included the collection of interest, dividends and principal in the financial services definition. This section was intended to clarify that the payment of dividends, principal and interest was exempt. However, as section 3(1)(ka) is within the scope of section 3(1)(l), agreeing to do or arranging the collection of dividends, principal and interest is exempt, so many of the services performed by debt collection agencies are exempt, 3 contrary to the original policy intent. 3 See Public Information Bulletin No. 164, August 1987; Public Information Bulletin No. 168, January 1988; and Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 6, No. 7, December 1994. 12 The supply of debt collection services by third parties should be a taxable supply because more than the mere receipt of money is involved. Thus the rationale for exempting the collection of interest, dividends and principal does not apply. The amendment is aimed at taxing the activity of debt collecting as carried out by debt collection agencies, not internalised collection functions undertaken by the holder or issuer of a financial instrument, such as a bank. Key features Section 3 will be amended by inserting a new provision specifically excluding the activity of debt collection by third party agents from the definition of “financial services”. Debt collection services carried out directly by the creditor whose debt is being collected will remain exempt. Financial options (Clause 68(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will ensure that the supply of a financial option is treated as an exempt supply. Background The buying and selling of options on recognised markets have been treated by taxpayers as an exempt activity under section 3(1)(k), which relates to futures contracts, since all that is being supplied is the right to either buy or sell a given amount of a specified commodity on a specified date. This is an acceptable policy result because an option is comparable to a futures contract. Nevertheless, the technical nature of an option is distinct from a futures contract. Unlike the holder of a futures contract, the option holder is not obliged to exercise the rights or obligations under the contract. This technical distinction between futures contracts and options is recognised under the accrual rules of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key feature The amendment will include financial options in the definition of “financial services”. 13 Deliverable and non-deliverable futures contracts (Clause 68(1)) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will ensure that only futures contracts that in effect trade exempt financial services at arm’s length or in a defined market are treated as exempt financial services. Background Futures contracts fall into two categories: • contracts that provide for the delivery of a commodity (deliverable contracts); and • contracts that do not provide for the delivery of a commodity (non-deliverable contracts). The present definition of “financial services” does not specify any distinction between deliverable and non-deliverable contracts. All that is required under section 3(1)(k) is that a “futures contract” be traded on a “futures exchange”. When a futures contract is non-deliverable, all that is being traded is money, and no underlying commodity is exchanged. A deliverable contract, in comparison, can involve the trade of an underlying commodity and is, therefore, more equivalent to a contract for the supply of goods or services. Non-deliverable contracts will continue to be exempt from GST, since all that is being traded is money or a close substitute for money. On the other hand, deliverable contracts will be exempt only if the supply of the underlying commodity would be exempt. The requirement that a futures contract be traded through a futures exchange ensures that there is a genuine market trading in derivatives, and that there are arm’s length terms of trade. However, the Act does not include a definition of “futures exchange”, and this has created uncertainty as to the meaning of the term. Because arm’s length transactions can occur outside a recognised exchange, the reference to a futures exchange is also arguably too restrictive. The reference to a futures exchange will, therefore, be removed from the Act and replaced with a requirement that the futures contract be traded on a defined market or on arm’s length terms. 14 Key features Section 3(1) will be amended so that: • Non-deliverable futures contracts are exempt from GST. • Deliverable futures contracts will be exempt only if the underlying commodity being traded is exempt. • Futures contracts must be traded on a defined market or on arm’s length terms to be exempt. Subrogation payments (Clause 73(9)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will ensure that the interest component of amounts recovered by insurers as a result of the exercise of rights acquired through subrogation is not taxed. Background An insurer, in settling a claim under a contract of insurance, may make a payment to an insured person and receive under the contract of insurance the insured person’s legal rights in relation to the insured item (for example, the right to sue a third party who has damaged an insured car). If the insurer has claimed an input tax credit for that payment, any amount the insurer recovers from the third party (a subrogation payment) as a result of the exercise of those rights is taxable. Often the amounts received by the insurer contain an interest component, which should not be taxed, to compensate the insurer for the delay between the recovery of any amount (say damages) and the payment to the insured person under the contract of insurance. However, the Act taxes the whole of the payment to the insurer. The Act will, therefore, be amended to ensure that the GST liability of the insurer is limited to the amount of the input tax credit the insurer received for making the payment to the insured person. Key feature The amendment will provide that the interest component of amounts recovered by insurers as a result of the exercise of rights acquired by subrogation does not give rise to GST, by limiting the output tax payable to the amount of the input tax credit originally claimed. 15 Zero-rating of exported “financial services” (Clause 76(1) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment The reference to “subparagraph” in section 14(a)(i) is to be changed to “paragraph” with application to supplies made on or after 19 December 1989. Section 14(a)(i) ensures that the zero-rating of exported financial services takes precedence over the normal exemption of financial services. However, the reference to “subparagraph” in section 14(a)(i) is incorrect and should be changed to “paragraph”. Application date This amendment will have retrospective application to supplies made on or after 19 December 1989, being the application date of the amendment which contained this error. 16 TOKENS, STAMPS AND VOUCHERS (Clauses 70(4), 72(1), 73(8) and (10)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment provides that the supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher redeemable for goods and services will be recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is acquired. However, to reduce the compliance costs that may arise in some cases, there will be an option for the supplier to account for GST when a token, stamp or voucher with a monetary face value is redeemed. Background Under the current legislation the recognition of a supply of a token, stamp or voucher depends on whether or not it has a monetary face value. A voucher with a face value is subject to GST on redemption; other vouchers and postage stamps are subject to GST on acquisition. This distinction creates a number of problems in accounting for GST. First, the existing treatment creates compliance costs in relation to progressively redeemable vouchers with a face value (for example, phone cards). The proposed amendment will provide that the supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher redeemable for goods and services will be recognised both for suppliers and recipients when the token, stamp or voucher is acquired. To reduce compliance costs for suppliers in relation to other vouchers, an exception to the new general rule will apply to vouchers with a face value so that the output tax is recognised on redemption at the supplier’s option. Another issue is the inability of lottery organisers to claim input tax credits on the purchase of vouchers to be used as prizes. The amendment will mean that no further change to ensure that the input tax credit is allowed, as foreshadowed in the discussion document, is required here. This is because the input tax credit will be allowed on acquisition. Key features Sections 10(16), (16A), (17) and 17(A) will be replaced with new provisions so that: • The supply of a token, stamp or voucher will be recognised on its acquisition. • A supplier may choose to recognise the supply of a token, stamp or voucher with a monetary face value when that token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for goods or services. 17 Supplies of postage stamps, or supplies of “exported services” described in existing section 11(2A) in exchange for tokens, stamps or vouchers (whether or not with a face value) will continue to be recognised at the time of acquisition. 18 GENERAL INSURANCE (Clauses 70(5) and 83(2)) Summary of amendments The amendments will ensure that: • An insured party is liable for output tax where payment in accordance with its contract of insurance is made directly to a third party. • Payments to registered recipients for losses incurred in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity are taxed. • General insurers can claim input tax credits for payments made under contingency policies and registered recipients of such payments are correspondingly taxed. For GST purposes, supplies of general insurance services are treated as taxable supplies. The inherent difficulties in valuing such supplies are overcome by taxing the flows of money to and from insurance companies as follows: General insurer:- Charges GST on premiums received; and - Claims input tax credits for insurance payments and costs of providing general insurance services. Insured party:- Claims input tax credits on premiums paid (if GST- registered); and - Returns output tax (if GST-registered) on payments received from general insurers. Payments to third parties If an insurer makes a payment under an insurance contract to a GST registered third party there is an argument that the insurer is entitled to an input tax credit but the third party recipient does not incur a corresponding output tax liability. However, if the payment is made directly to the insured party a corresponding output tax liability does arise. For example, Liable Company (“L Co.”) sells defective goods to Victim Company (“V Co.”). These goods cause damage to V Co.’s factory, which L Co. is liable for. L Co. has an insurance policy covering such liability. L Co.’s insurance company can either make a payment to settle any claim to L Co. (which would be taxed by section 5(13)), or directly to V Co. (which would, following the argument above, not be taxed). Section 5(13) will, therefore, be amended to clarify that the insured party is liable for output tax where payment is made directly to a third party. 19 Use of the term “taxable supply” in section 5(13) The use of the term “taxable supply” in section 5(13) (relating to the receipt of insurance payments by persons registered for GST) may have the unintended effect of narrowing the application of the provision to insurance payments if there is a direct relationship between the insurance payment and a particular supply made by the insured person. For example, if a retailer’s warehouse is destroyed owing to arson there is an argument that the loss is not incurred “in the course of making a taxable supply”, as section 5(13) requires. Although the retailer can claim input tax credits for the cost of the insurance policy, as they are costs incurred in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, it might be argued that there is no corresponding output tax liability on payments received in this situation. The term “taxable supply” in section 5(13) will, therefore, be changed to “taxable activity” to remove the possible narrowing effect of the former term. Indemnity payments According to the legislation, if insurance payments are indemnity payments they give rise to an input tax credit for general insurers and a corresponding output tax liability for registered recipients. On one interpretation, the terms “indemnify” and “indemnity” used in the legislation have a narrow meaning in this context, so that only payments under contracts that reimburse the insured for any loss suffered in the value of an insured item are included. Following this line of argument, contingency insurance such as sickness and personal accident insurance would, therefore, fall outside the ambit of the legislation, meaning that general insurers could not claim input tax credits in relation to these policies, even though they would be charging GST on premiums for them. The potential for a narrow interpretation of “indemnify” and “indemnity” undermines the policy intent of treating general insurance as a taxable supply under the method outlined. The words “indemnify” and “indemnity” will, therefore, be removed to clarify that general insurers may claim input tax credits and to ensure that registered recipients are correspondingly taxed. Key features • Section 5(13) will be amended to clarify that insured parties are liable for output tax where payment in accordance with their contract of insurance is made directly to a third party. • The term “taxable supply” in section 5(13) will be replaced with “taxable activity”. • The word “indemnity” will be removed from section 5(13). • The word “indemnify” will be removed from section 20(3)(d). 20 TERMINATION OF A TAXABLE ACTIVITY (Clauses 71, 77(1), 80(3), 92 and 93(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment alters the definition of “taxable activity” to ensure that section 6(2) applies to both a premature ending of a taxable activity and to a successful completion of a taxable activity. Background Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. This provision ensures that GST applies to supplies made in completing a taxable activity as well as to supplies made as part of normal trading activities. Because the completion of a taxable activity by a registered person is regarded as involving a taxable supply, an output tax liability should arise. In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Drummond and Ors 4 the High Court found that the objectors’ forestry activity had ceased earlier than planned for a number of reasons outside the objectors’ control. By satisfying the conditions of section 51(1)(c) the objectors were not required to register for GST. The court suggested that an activity is terminated only when it has run its intended full course. A supply made because of a premature conclusion of a business would be made on “cessation” of the activity rather than its “termination”. Therefore the application of section 6(2) may be unintentionally limited to the completion of a taxable activity in the ordinary course of events. Key feature Section 6(2) will be amended to include in the definition of taxable activity, anything done in connection with the beginning, ending or premature ending of a taxable activity. The same amendment is made in other provisions which refer to the cessation of a taxable activity. 4 (1998) 18 NZTC 13,745. 21 TIME OF SUPPLY FOR RATES (Clause 72(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies the time of supply for rates so that local authorities using the invoice basis of accounting will pay output tax on the earlier of: • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment; or • the due date for payment; or • the date when payment is received. This clarification is desirable as most local authorities will be required to account for GST on the invoice basis from 1 July 2001. A notice issued at the beginning of the year which merely sets out the amounts due and the dates for each rate payment will not trigger a GST liability. Key features Section 9 will be amended to provide that the time of supply for rates is the earlier of: • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment; or • the due date for payment; or • the date when payment is received. 22 UPLIFT TO MARKET VALUE RULES IN SECTIONS 10(3), 10(3A) (Clause 73(1) and (2)) Summary of proposed amendments Sections 10(3) and 10(3A) will be amended to ensure that supplies made at less than market value to unregistered persons or persons making exempt supplies are valued at market value for GST purposes. There are two problems with the rules in sections 10(3) and 10(3A) that the amendments address: • a gap in section 10(3) whereby the provision would not apply if the only consideration for a supply is non-monetary consideration that is less than the open market value of the supply; • circularity between section 10(3), which requires an uplift to market value for supplies between associated persons (and, therefore, potentially lifts a person above the registration threshold), and section 10(3A), which provides that section 10(3) does not apply if the supply is between registered persons. Key features • The two references in section 10(3) to “consideration in money” will be replaced by references to “consideration”. • The reference to any supply made by a “registered person” in section 10(3A) will be replaced by a reference to any supply made by a “person”. 23 THE USE OF THE TERM “CASH PRICE” IN SECTION 10(5) (Clause 73(4)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will ensure that a supply of goods or services made under a credit contract is correctly valued for GST purposes. Background When a supply is made under a credit contract, the “consideration in money” for that supply is deemed under section 10(5) to be the “cash price” of the goods or services provided under the credit contract. The definition of “cash price” in the Credit Contracts Act 1981 is used for the purposes of section 10(5). The “cash price” is either the lowest price for which anyone could have purchased the goods or services from that vendor on the basis of payment in full when the contract was entered into, or, if there is no such price, the fair market value of the goods or services when the contract was made. There are several problems with using the term “cash price” for GST purposes: • There is uncertainty as to the boundary with respect to determining the vendor – for example, whether it extends to any branch of that vendor in New Zealand, or, depending on the price, branches overseas. • The definition of “cash price” does not distinguish between classes of customers, such as retail and wholesale customers. • Theoretical lowest prices could be used. For example, managers of retail outlets may have a discretion to give a maximum discount of, say, 30 percent. Even though managers may never give this level of discount, it is theoretically the “lowest price.” The use of “cash price” in the GST Act was meant to determine the consideration given by the purchaser for the non-credit portion of the credit contract (for the goods or services). This may not, however, be a suitable measure of consideration for GST purposes, as it can result in an under-valuation of the true consideration given for the supply of a good or service. The consideration in money for goods or services supplied under a credit contract should correctly reflect the consideration provided for those goods or services. The amendment will, therefore, deem the consideration in money for a supply of goods or services made under a credit contract to be the higher of the open market value or the cash price of those goods or services. 24 Key feature Section 10(5) will be amended so that the consideration in money for a supply of goods or services made under a credit contract is deemed to be the higher of the open market value or the cash price of those goods or services. 25 DEREGISTRATION (Clause 73(6) and (7)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment requires GST to be paid on the open market value of assets retained on deregistration, so that supplies on deregistration are valued in the same way as other supplies made before deregistration. Assets acquired before the introduction of GST will be excluded from this change. The reason for deeming a supply of assets held on deregistration to have been made is to reflect that the registered person has, in effect, made a supply to themselves in their private capacity. The problem with the current rule, however, is both the scope for avoidance activity and the fact that it creates a more favourable treatment for assets retained and then sold as opposed to assets sold before deregistration. The amendment ensures that the output tax payable is the same in both cases. Background Registered persons who deregister and retain any assets that were used in their taxable activity are treated as having, in effect, made a supply of those goods and services to themselves in their capacity as a final consumer. On deregistration, output tax is payable on the lesser of the cost or open market value of goods and services held by a registered person. However, if that person sold those goods and services while still registered, output tax would be payable on the sale price (usually equivalent to its open market value). Therefore, assuming the lesser cost option is adopted, a lower output tax liability arises in relation to assets held on deregistration that have appreciated in value. If the deregistered person then on-sells goods to a registered person, a second-hand goods input tax credit may be claimed for one-ninth of the purchase price, or if the parties are associated, one-ninth of the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value. If the deregistered person has paid output tax on the basis of the cost of the goods, significant tax advantages may arise from the sale of goods, such as land, which have increased in value since they were originally acquired by the deregistered person. It is recognised that, in relation to assets acquired before the introduction of GST for which no input tax credits were allowed, taxing increases in value since acquisition could create a significant tax burden for those registered persons holding such assets at deregistration. 26 To address these concerns the deemed supply on deregistration of assets acquired before GST was introduced will continue to be valued at the lower of cost or open market value. Any second-hand goods input tax credit in relation to goods on-sold by the deregistered person to a registered associate would in these circumstances be limited in accordance with the proposal relating to second-hand goods. Key feature Section 10 will be amended so that GST is paid on the open market value of assets retained on deregistration, unless the assets were acquired before GST was introduced, in which case GST will be paid on the lower of the cost or open market value of those assets. 27 EXPORTED GOODS AND SERVICES (Clauses 74, 66(4), 70(7), 73(3), 76(2) & (4), 83(3), 86(2) and 97(1)) Overview Several amendments are being made to section 11, the zero-rating provision of the Act, in line with the principle that GST is a tax on goods and services consumed in New Zealand. Section 11 will also be restructured and split into three separate sections, dealing respectively with zero-rated goods, zero-rated services and the zero- rating of certain supplies by territorial authorities. Services supplied in relation to exported goods Summary of proposed amendment The amendment zero-rates services supplied directly in connection with exported goods if the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. As the goods are to be exported, the services, although performed in New Zealand, can be regarded as being consumed offshore, so should not be subject to GST. The amendment addresses the anomaly of the different tax treatment when services relating to exported goods are supplied separately to a non-resident (not zero-rated) and when the value of the services is incorporated into the price paid by the non- resident for the exported goods (zero-rated). Key feature The amendment inserts a new provision to zero-rate services supplied directly in connection with goods to which any provision of the existing section 11(1)(a) to (ad) (goods that have or will be exported) applies if the services are supplied to a non- resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Zero-rating of exported information services Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will zero-rate exported information services that are directly connected with moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed if the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. In many cases, the connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand is incidental, for example, when pharmaceutical samples are supplied from offshore by a non-resident to a New Zealand tester. In these cases the services should be regarded as being consumed offshore, so should not be subject to New Zealand GST. 28 In addition, anomalous situations could occur without this amendment under the proposal to zero-rate services supplied in relation to exported goods if the goods are not actually exported. For example, a non-resident investigating the purchase of goods from New Zealand contracts a New Zealand business to test or examine the goods in order to ascertain whether they meet the specifications required by the non- resident or claimed by the New Zealand seller. If the goods were not actually exported because the quality testing report showed they were below standard the testing services would not, without this amendment, be zero-rated, even under the proposal to zero-rate services supplied in relation to exported goods. Key features The amendment inserts a new provision to zero-rate services that comprise the supply of information from a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand if supplied directly in connection with movable personal property situated in New Zealand to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Goods destroyed prior to export Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will ensure that goods which have been sold to a non-resident for export but cannot be exported because they die or otherwise cease to exist can still be zero-rated. The Act allows the zero-rating of goods that are physically exported. Therefore if goods otherwise destined for export cease to exist and are not physically exported, the supplies will not currently be zero-rated. Zero-rating will apply to supplies of goods that were to be exported but cease to exist owing to circumstances outside the control of either the supplier or purchaser of the goods. The new rule would apply, for example, to race horses that are sold for export but die before they leave New Zealand, or wine purchased by a non-resident for import that is destroyed in a warehouse by a fire before it is shipped. Key feature The amendment inserts a new provision to zero-rate supplies of goods that were to be exported but which cease to exist owing to circumstances outside the control of either the supplier or purchaser of the goods. 29 Exported aircraft Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will allow the zero-rating of the supply by way of sale of an aircraft which is exported from New Zealand under its own power. Section 11(1)(ag) zero-rates the supply by way of sale of a boat which is exported from New Zealand under its own power. There is no equivalent provision for aircraft which are exported from New Zealand under their own power. The provision will be subject to the time limit rules in existing section 11(1E) and 11(1F), which generally require the craft to be exported within 60 days of the time the recipient takes physical possession of it. Key feature The new provision will allow the zero-rating of the supply by way of sale of an aircraft which is exported from New Zealand under its own power. 30 UPDATING REFERENCES IN SECTION 11 (Clause 74) Shipping and Seamen Act 1952 references Amendments will be made to section 11 to update references to definitions in the now repealed Shipping and Seamen Act 1952: The term “coastal waters” in existing section 11(1)(bb), which zero-rates goods supplied for use as stores for consumption outside New Zealand on aircraft or ships, will be replaced with the term “New Zealand fisheries waters”. This term will be defined as having the same meaning as in the Fisheries Act 1996. The term “fishing vessel” in existing section 11(1)(bb) will be replaced with the term “fishing ship”. This term will be defined as having the same meaning as in the Maritime Transport Act 1994. A new definition of “foreign-going ship” will be inserted for the purpose of existing section 11(1)(bb). This definition will refer to “a ship, other than a pleasure craft (as defined in the Maritime Transport Act 1994) or a fishing ship (as defined in the Maritime Transport Act 1994), going to a destination outside New Zealand”. Civil Aviation Act 1964 reference The reference to the now repealed “Civil Aviation Act 1964” in existing section 11(1A) will be replaced by a reference to the “Civil Aviation Act 1990”. Zero-rating of local authorities petroleum tax New section 11B will be updated by removing references to “regional council” and “united council” to reflect changes made to local government structures and the local authorities petroleum tax scheme in Part XI of the Local Government Act 1974. 31 “GOING CONCERNS” (Clauses 74 and 103) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will remove uncertainties as to when the “going concern” test is to be applied and the meaning of “going concern”. Background Section 11(1)(c) zero-rates the transfer of a taxable activity as a “going concern”. The current wording of section 11(1)(c)(i) creates uncertainty as to when the going concern test is to be applied, by using the phrase “supply to a registered person of a taxable activity, that is, or is to be, transferred”. Cases dealing with the pre-1995 provision, such as Belton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 5 and K R Pine v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 6 , have stated that the test is to be applied at settlement. As stated in the Tax Information Bulletin Volume 6, No 12, 7 whether a taxable activity is supplied as a going concern was intended to be determined at the time of supply – generally the earlier of invoice or payment. The time of settlement or transfer is not relevant to determining the status of the supply, although the taxable activity must continue to be carried on by the vendor until the time of transfer for the supply to be zero-rated. The time of supply is the better time at which to apply the “going concern” test. The time of supply will generally be when the parties enter into an agreement to transfer a taxable activity. It will also be the time at which the parties consider whether the taxable activity is a going concern. The policy intent behind the “going concern” provisions was that the taxable activity must be received as, and capable of being operated as, a going concern by the purchaser for the zero-rating provisions to apply. The taxable activity must be capable of seamless operation during its transfer, although it is not necessary that the purchaser in fact operate the taxable activity as a going concern after its transfer. However, the majority of the Court of Appeal in K R Pine held otherwise. In K R Pine a registered person sold a taxable activity of commercial leasing to another registered person whose partnership had been the tenant of the commercial property. The partnership had, however, been terminated by agreement before the purchase of the lease, and the registered person had become the lessee. 5 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,403. 6 (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570. 7 May 1995, page 31. 32 On purchase of the taxable activity, the purchaser’s legal estates as lessor and lessee merged and, therefore, at law, the purchaser could not carry on the taxable activity as a going concern. The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, held that the transfer of a going concern had still occurred, stating that it did not matter that a taxable activity could not be operated as a going concern. The test was the form of the taxable activity supplied by the vendor, and in K R Pine the vendor had supplied a going concern. The section will, therefore, be amended to ensure that a transferred taxable activity must be capable of operation by the purchaser for the supply to be zero-rated as that of a going concern. Key features The “going concern” test will be amended to ensure that: • The test for a “going concern” is applied at the time of supply. • To qualify for zero-rating the purchaser must be able to continue to carry on the activity as a going concern. 33 TEMPORARY IMPORTS (Clause 74) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment zero-rates all services provided directly in connection with temporary imports. This removes the existing requirement that services provided directly in connection with temporary imports be supplied to a non-resident, and extends the zero-rating to services provided to residents. As the goods have only a temporary connection with New Zealand, the services provided directly in connection with them should be treated as being consumed outside New Zealand and, therefore, not subject to GST. Key feature Subparagraph (ii) of existing section 11(2)(ca) will be repealed. 34 RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATION (Clause 76(3) and (5)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will treat as exempt the supply of a property which is to be used as residential accommodation for lease or rental under a head lease. This will align supplies where the recipient is able to occupy the dwelling (an exempt supply) and those where the recipient cannot (a taxable supply). Background Section 14(c) exempts the supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling. The supply of property to a company by way of lease is arguably a supply of a leasehold interest in residential property rather than the supply of residential accommodation, and on this basis the exemption would not apply. In other words, because a company is unable to occupy a property as residential accommodation it does not receive the supply of accommodation. Key features Section 14 will be amended to ensure that the supply of residential property for lease or rental under a head lease will be an exempt supply if the property is acquired for the purpose of providing residential accommodation. However, both the supplier and recipient will be able to agree that the exemption does not apply. The exclusion is necessary to ensure that any supplies under existing leases of residential property that are currently treated as taxable are not required to be re- characterised as exempt supplies. 35 PENALTY INTEREST (Clause 76(5)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will treat interest in the nature of a penalty imposed under a contract for goods or services as consideration for an exempt supply. Background If a purchaser fails to make payment under a contract the supplier may, if the contract permits, charge the purchaser interest for the use of the money to induce payment. The interest is generally called penalty or default interest. The nature of penalty interest is conceptually indistinguishable from that of other forms of interest, which the Act exempts under section 3(1)(ka). The provision of a credit contract 8 and certain services relating to credit contracts are within the definition of “financial services” and, therefore, exempt from GST. However, penalty interest charged under a contract does not necessarily make the contract a “credit contract”, so penalty interest may be subject to GST when the underlying supply is taxable. Key feature Section 14 will be amended to insert a provision treating penalty interest imposed under a contract for goods or services as consideration for an exempt supply. 8 As defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981. 36 THE SIX-MONTHLY FILING PERIOD (Clause 78) Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers may file six-monthly rather than two-monthly if their turnover does not exceed $250,000 per annum. The amendment gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion on written application to allow taxpayers to file on a six- monthly basis to reduce any excessive compliance costs from more frequent filing. Background The Government recognises that filing on a two-monthly basis once turnover exceeds $250,000 may involve significant compliance costs for taxpayers required to shift to the new basis. These costs can be disproportionately high when balanced against the cost to the Government in cash flow terms. Taxpayers affected in this way are those who have in the past filed on a six-monthly basis but have just started to exceed the $250,000 threshold. Another group affected is taxpayers with seasonal businesses that have a fluctuating turnover and for which accounts are generally prepared at the end of the season. Key features Section 15 will be amended to give the Commissioner the discretion on written application to allow taxpayers to file on a six-monthly basis taking into account: • whether the taxpayer has a history of accurate and timely filing and payment of GST; • whether the taxpayer has good record-keeping practices; • whether the taxpayer has previously been entitled to account for GST on a six- monthly basis; • the nature of the taxable supplies made by the taxpayer; • the volume of taxable supplies made by the taxpayer. 37 THE LAST DAY OF A TAXABLE PERIOD (Clause 77) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment gives the Commissioner the right to reverse an earlier decision to allow registered persons to determine a day in substitution for the last day of their taxable period if they cannot provide sound commercial reasons, other than a tax timing advantage, for maintaining the change. Background Under section 15(7) taxpayers may, with the Commissioner’s approval, use an alternative reporting period close to that used for their internal accounting as the basis for their GST returns if the alternative reporting period ends within seven days of the last day of their taxable period. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers unable to harmonise their internal reporting with the last calendar day of the taxable period because of industry practice or the expense involved. Taxpayers are able to engineer sizeable timing advantages from the existing section 15(7) in combination with their suppliers. However, the Commissioner does not explicitly have the right to reverse a decision to allow a change in the last day of taxable period granted to a taxpayer. Key features The Commissioner will be given the power to revoke approval to determine a day in substitution for the last day of a taxable period if: • there is no longer any sound commercial reason, other than a tax timing advantage, for the taxpayer maintaining a change in the last day of the taxable period; and • the approval has given rise to a tax timing advantage. 38 THE PAYMENTS BASIS THRESHOLD (Clause 80(2) and (5)) Summary of proposed amendment The threshold under which taxpayers can account for GST when payment is received, rather than the earlier of when a payment is due or received, is to be increased to $1.3 million. The change is in line with inflation since 1990 (the date of the last increase) and with expected inflation for the next five to ten years. Application date The increased threshold will apply from 1 October 2000. Background Taxpayers are generally required to account for GST as debts become due – the “invoice basis” of accounting. Widespread application of this rule ensures consistency in the timing of output tax payments by suppliers and input tax credit claims by purchasers. However, for compliance reasons, some exceptions to this rule apply to registered persons with turnover less than $1 million and to certain other taxpayers. These people are able to account for GST as payment is received – the “payments basis” of accounting. Key feature The payments basis threshold in section 19A will be increased from $1 million to $1.3 million. 39 THE ACCOUNTING BASIS FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES (Clauses 80(1) and (4) and 81) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will remove the automatic entitlement of local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis unless their turnover is under the prescribed threshold. 9 Allowing local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis is in most cases no longer appropriate given recent reforms 10 that require local authorities to adopt generally accepted accounting practice. Application date The removal of the automatic entitlement of local authorities to use the payments basis of accounting will apply from 1 July 2001. Background Most registered persons are required to account for GST on the invoice basis of accounting. Some exceptions apply for compliance reasons to registered persons with low turnover and to non-profit bodies, who are able to account for GST as payment is received. Local authorities are also entitled to use the payments basis. Until 1992 government departments were able to use the payments basis, but this ability was removed as part of reforms to move government departments’ financial accounts to the accrual system. The removal of the automatic entitlement of local authorities to use the payments basis of accounting will apply from 1 July 2001 to give local authorities sufficient time to make the transition. It is possible that some local authorities will experience difficulties in complying with an invoice basis of accounting by 1 July 2001 and will require further time to make the adjustment from a payments to an invoice basis. To address these difficulties an Order in Council procedure to allow continued use of the payments basis of accounting for a specified period has been included in the amendment. Key feature The existing unrestricted right for local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis will be removed from 1 July 2001, but provision will be made for specific time-limited extensions to this date to be made. 9 Currently $1 million but to be increased to $1.3 million. 10 The Local Government Amendment Act (No. 3) 1996 requires local authorities to adopt generally accepted accounting practice and allows them greater scope to raise finance. 40 DEFERRED SETTLEMENTS (Clauses 79(1) and 82) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will address a significant base maintenance problem with deferred settlement transactions involving two registered persons using different bases of accounting for GST. The amendment requires output tax to be returned on an invoice basis for any supply for which the consideration exceeds $225,000 (including GST). Background By deferring the date of settlement it is possible to gain a significant timing advantage in relation to transactions involving two registered persons using different bases of accounting for GST. Specifically, a purchaser on the invoice basis is able to claim an immediate input tax credit but a vendor on the payments basis is able to defer the payment of output tax until payment is received. The target of the proposal to require output tax to be returned on an invoice basis for supplies exceeding $225,000 is longer-term deferred settlements. To limit cash flow and compliance concerns for shorter-term deferred settlements, agreements where settlement must be made within 93 days will be excluded. The period of 93 days is consistent with the exclusion for short-term agreements in the accrual rules in the Income Tax Act 1994. To prevent registered persons from entering into arrangements to avoid the $225,000 threshold by splitting a supply of goods or services into a number of transactions, the Commissioner will be given a discretion to require the registered person to account for those transactions on an invoice basis. Key features A new section will be inserted requiring output tax to be returned on an accrual basis for any supply exceeding $225,000 (including GST) in value if settlement is not required within 93 days. The Commissioner will also be given a discretion to require accounting on an invoice basis where a supply of goods or services is split into a number of transactions to avoid the $225,000 threshold. 41 THE SECOND-HAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT (Clauses 83(1), 69(1), 101 and 102) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will limit the input tax credit available in relation to supplies of second-hand goods between associated parties to remove the current tax advantages. Background If a registered person acquires new or second-hand goods from a GST registered person the GST component is shown on the tax invoice 11 and can be claimed as an input tax credit. If a registered person purchases second-hand goods from an unregistered person the supply is not subject to GST. However, the registered person may claim one-ninth of the purchase price as an input tax credit, provided sufficient records of the supply are kept. 12 Allowing a credit is intended to recognise the GST paid when the non-registered supplier acquired the goods and so ensure that only the final consumer incurs the GST cost on the amount of value added by registered persons. The input tax credit for second-hand goods has been used by registered purchasers to claim large GST refunds in relation to goods (particularly land) on which GST has not been paid by the seller. In some cases second-hand goods appear to be sold to an associated person primarily to claim the input tax credit with no real change in ownership. It is likely that the goods would not have been sold if a credit were not available. Therefore in these cases the credits are windfall gains to the registered purchaser rather than refunds of tax previously paid. This issue is particularly problematic when assets are held for many years before they are on-sold. Limiting the input tax credit between associated persons is preferred to the implementation of a “margin scheme”, such as that proposed in Australia for land sales, which defers the input tax credit until the sale of assets. To remove the potential for associated persons to claim windfall input tax credits early by merely interposing another transaction it would be necessary for a margin scheme to require all goods acquired and sold under the scheme to continue to be sold under the scheme. This could cause unreasonably high compliance costs, including requiring a non- associated purchaser to know the “GST status” of an asset (whether margin scheme or non-margin scheme). There could also be significant record-keeping and apportionment issues. 11 Or can be calculated from the “GST inclusive” amount. 12 Section 24(7) specifies the type of information that must be provided (including a description of the goods, the date of the supply, and the name and address of the supplier). 42 The option of excluding land from the GST base is not favoured as it is contrary to the objective of a broad-based tax with minimal exemptions. Key features The amendment limits the input tax credit available in relation to supplies of second- hand goods between associated parties to the lesser of: • the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or • one-ninth of the purchase price; or • one-ninth of the open market value. When a vendor pays GST based on market value on deregistration and subsequently sells second-hand goods to a registered associate, the amount of the input tax credit available to the purchaser will continue to be one-ninth of the lesser of the purchase price or open market value. 43 ADJUSTMENTS TO INPUT AND OUTPUT TAX (Clauses 84, 70(8), 72(2), 73(5), 83(4), 94(2), 95(1), 99 and 106) Summary of proposed amendments Several changes reduce the compliance costs associated with making adjustments for changes in use. The main change is to give registered persons the option to pay additional output tax for private or exempt use on a one-off or annual basis rather than in each taxable period. If the one-off basis is chosen further adjustments will be required at the time a change in use of 20 percent or more occurs. Registered persons will also be allowed to make input tax adjustments on an annual rather than a taxable-period basis. Background A registered person can claim input tax credits in relation to goods and services acquired principally for business purposes. Those goods and services may also be used for a private or exempt purpose. The Act deems such use to be a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. A registered person cannot claim input tax credits in relation to goods and services acquired principally for private or exempt purposes. If those goods or services are also used for business purposes the Act allows an input tax credit to reflect that taxable use. The principal objective of change in use adjustments is to ensure that input tax credits reflect the extent of the taxable use of goods and services. This is achieved by making adjustments to output tax or input tax if the original intended use of the goods and services changes or if the goods and services are acquired for both taxable and non- taxable purposes. The requirement to make output tax adjustments ensures that tax is borne by the final consumer when there is private or exempt use of goods or services. For example, the private use of goods or services acquired by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies represents a supply of goods or services to the registered person in his or her private capacity and, as such, should be subject to GST. Inland Revenue requires adjustments to be made in each taxable period that the asset is owned to reflect the continuing changes in use. This can result in high compliance costs for small amounts of revenue. 44 An alternative to the “adjustments” approach is the “apportionment” approach, which is adopted in a number of other jurisdictions, including Australia. This limits the initial input tax credit to the estimated proportion of taxable use. Therefore in relation to an asset used, say, 60 percent for taxable purposes, an input tax credit of 60 percent of the GST component of the purchase price would be allowed. This amount would be further adjusted to reflect any changes in the asset’s continuing taxable use. The output tax on sale of the asset would also be similarly apportioned. The relative merits of the adjustments and apportionment approaches will be considered in the next stage of the GST review. In the meantime, the changes outlined above will assist in reducing compliance costs. Key features Amendments will be made to: • Legislate the current methods of allocation in the GST Act. Taxpayers will be required to adopt the method that gives the fairest and most reasonable allocation. • Give taxpayers the choice when making adjustments for changes from taxable to non-taxable use to make continuing output tax adjustments either once when the change in use occurs or the asset is acquired, annually, or in each taxable period. If they choose to make a one-off adjustment, additional adjustments will be required if the relative use changes further by 20 percent or more. • Give taxpayers the choice when making adjustments for changes from non- taxable to taxable use to make continuing input tax adjustments annually or in each taxable period. • Limit the input tax credit allowed under the existing section 21(5) for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to supplies of goods and services which satisfy the requirements for an input tax credit except for the requirement that the goods and services be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. There will also be additional requirements in the case of second-hand goods, in particular, that the second-hand goods have always been situated in New Zealand, or had GST levied on them under section 12 when they were imported into New Zealand. This amendment will apply to transactions entered into from 1 October 1986 unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has agreed in writing to this input tax credit claim before the date the bill is introduced. • Increase the $10,000 threshold for one-off input tax adjustments for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to $18,000. (This increase is in line with inflation since 1986 and to keep the threshold current for the next five to ten years.) • Increase the minimum threshold for exempt supplies (over which adjustments must be made) from $48,000 to $90,000. (This increase is in line with inflation since 1986 and to keep the threshold current for the next five to ten years.) 45 • Ensure that output tax adjustments for any non-taxable use apply to goods and services acquired or produced, as well as applied, for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • Ensure that an adjustment is triggered by any dual or multiple use (not just a subsequent change of use). • Ensure that fringe benefits provided to past employees (including associated persons) are subject to GST. 46 ADJUSTMENTS TO INPUT AND OUTPUT TAX: OTHER ISSUES (Clause 84) Summary of proposed amendments The scope and calculation of change in use adjustments are being clarified. Key features The amendments: • Ensure that section 21 does not give rise to an unintended output tax liability for services provided by employees. For example, the services of an employee for which no input tax credit is available may be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. These services may then be used in relation to exempt supplies. The amendment ensures no output tax liability will arise in this situation. • Ensure section 21(1) does not apply if a deemed supply has arisen because of a change in the legislation. For example, changing the status of a particular supply from taxable to exempt. • Clarify that the time of supply of output tax adjustments for non-deductible entertainment expenditure is the same time as when the income tax return is due (or furnished, whichever is the earlier). Currently, the time of supply depends on whether income tax returns are filed early or on time. To minimise compliance costs, the time of supply should be aligned with the filing of an income tax return. • Ensure that section 21 allows an input tax adjustment in relation to goods and services acquired on or after 1 October 1986, rather than after that date. 47 THE ABBREVIATED TAX INVOICE THRESHOLD (Clause 86(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment To reduce compliance costs, the threshold under which an abbreviated tax invoice (under section 24(4)) is acceptable is to be increased from $200 to $1,000. Application date The increased threshold will apply from 1 October 2000. Background Tax invoices are the key means by which Inland Revenue can maintain an audit trail and verify the deduction of input tax credits from output tax. To qualify as a tax invoice, a document must meet certain criteria set out in the Act. However, if the consideration paid for a supply of goods or services is less than $200, an abbreviated tax invoice is acceptable. An abbreviated tax invoice does not require the inclusion of the name and address of the recipient, the quantity or volume of the goods and services or the amount of tax charged if the amount is other than the tax fraction of the consideration. The amendment increases the threshold for an abbreviated invoice from $200 to $1,000. This measure is aimed at further reducing the compliance cost burden of the requirement to hold detailed tax invoices for small items of expenditure. Key feature Section 24(4) will be amended to increase the threshold for simplified tax invoices to $1,000. 48 FACTORED DEBTS (Clauses 87 and 88) Summary of proposed amendments To re-establish parity between the two accounting bases and remove opportunities for recharacterising credit sales, registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis will be required to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. It is also being clarified that when a debt is factored on a recourse basis the assignor can claim a deduction if the debt becomes bad after it is returned to the assignor. Background For assignors of debt on an accrual basis, any output tax liability on the assignment of debt will have arisen before the assignment. The assignment of debt is an exempt supply, but GST is payable on the full value of the underlying supply, irrespective of whether full payment is received. If the assignor is on a payments basis, output tax must be paid on any amount received for that debt before the assignment and any amount received on the assignment. This means that GST is not payable on the discount component of a factoring transaction. In relation to payments basis taxpayers, therefore, it is possible to convert part of a taxable supply of goods and services into an exempt supply. This is possible because the sale of debt is generally an exempt financial service. When a debt is sold back to the assignor and is, or becomes, bad in the assignor’s hands, a bad debt deduction ought to be allowed. Section 26 does not contemplate that the assignor may sell a debt and purchase it back. Arguably, deductibility under the section would not, therefore, be prevented. To achieve certainty, however, an amendment will ensure that recourse debt factoring can give rise to a bad debt deduction if the debt becomes bad after it is returned to the assignor. Key features New section 26A will be inserted to provide that registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis must pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. Section 26 will be amended to clarify that when a debt is factored on a recourse basis the assignor can claim a deduction if the debt becomes bad after it is returned to the assignor. 49 THE REGISTRATION THRESHOLD (Clause 93) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment increases the compulsory registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000, in line with inflation since 1990 and with expected inflation for the next five to ten years. Approximately 25,000 small businesses fall within the $30,000 to $40,000 band. The registration threshold was last adjusted in 1990 as a result of recommendations from the Taxation Simplification Consultative Committee. Application date The increased threshold will apply from 1 October 2000. Background Anyone who makes taxable supplies exceeding $30,000 in value in a 12-month period must register for GST. It is also possible for a person carrying on a taxable activity to register voluntarily if below that threshold. In setting the registration threshold there are two competing considerations: • A high registration threshold reduces compliance costs because it allows many small businesses to fall outside the GST system. • A low threshold reduces the potential for smaller businesses to place significant competitive pressures on businesses operating above the threshold. The proposed adjustment maintains a reasonable balance between these two considerations. Key feature Section 51(1)(a) will be amended to increase the compulsory registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000. 50 UNINCORPORATED BODIES (Clauses 90, 94 and 95) Summary of proposed amendments Minor legislative changes are being made to clarify provisions relating to the recovery of the GST debts of an unincorporated body and the extent of a member’s liability for GST. Background Section 42 makes the Commissioner a preferential creditor in relation to GST that is unpaid at the time of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership. This ranking is appropriate because input tax credits in relation to a supply may be refunded to a purchaser regardless of whether or not the vendor pays output tax. Section 57(3) provides that members of unincorporated bodies are liable jointly and severally for all tax payable by the body while they are members. The estate of a deceased member is severally liable for any unpaid liabilities of the member. In some areas there is a lack of clarity or an unintentional limitation of the scope of the provisions, and the amendments address these problems. Key features • The preferential status of GST debts recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body will be confirmed. • The preferential status for unpaid GST debts of an unincorporated body will apply if a receiver is appointed other than by court order. • The liability of a member of an unincorporated body for GST payable will extend beyond the period of membership, but only in respect of liabilities arising during the period the person was a member. • The existing requirement to provide written notification to the Commissioner will involve actual receipt of the notice by the Commissioner, and the change in membership will take effect from this date. 51 SPECIFIED AGENTS (Clauses 91, 94(1) and 96) Summary of proposed amendments These legislative changes will clarify the scope of section 58 relating to specified agents carrying out a taxable activity in the place of an incapacitated registered person. Background Section 58 provides that the “specified agent” of an “incapacitated person” personally carries on the taxable activity of the incapacitated person during an “agency period”, so has all the obligations and liabilities of a registered person carrying on the taxable activity. If the section did not exist, persons making taxable supplies on behalf of others might not be liable to account for GST. An incapacitated person is defined “as a registered person who dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated”. A specified agent is defined as “a person carrying on the taxable activity as the agent, personal representative, liquidator or receiver of an incapacitated person”. In some areas there is a lack of clarity or an unintentional limitation of the scope of the provisions, and the amendments address these problems. Key features • Section 58(1A) will be amended to include appointments of receivers to control only part of a taxable activity. • It will be clarified that an agency period terminates when the taxable activity is no longer carried on by a specified agent whether by a liquidator, receiver or both. • Section 58 will be amended to ensure that input tax credits available to an incapacitated person but not claimed by that person in relation to pre-agency supplies can be claimed by the person’s specified agent. This will be subject to new sections 46(7)-(9). This new provision will ensure that the Commissioner can set off pre-agency period tax debt against pre-agency period input tax credits claimed by specified agents. • It will be clarified that section 58(1A) overrides section 5(2). • It will be clarified that a specified agent is not personally liable for any liability incurred on (as well as before) the date of commencement of the agency period. • It will be clarified that the appointment of a specified agent does not affect the membership of a group of registered persons. 52 GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION (Clause 100) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment adopts the general anti-avoidance provision of the Income Tax Act 1994 (sections BG 1 and GB 1) as a model for an amended section 76, the general anti-avoidance rule, of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background Section 76 has a number of possible deficiencies which may limit its potential application. In determining whether there is tax avoidance the section relies on the subjective test of the taxpayer’s intention in entering into an arrangement. In many circumstances this is difficult to determine. A further possible problem is that section 76 applies only where “the application of the Act” is defeated. Many avoidance arrangements are structured so that the specific provisions of the Act do apply, and it is arguable that section 76 does not apply in these circumstances. It is desirable to achieve consistency between the general anti-avoidance provisions in the GST and Income Tax Acts as this would allow a similar analysis to be used when considering the application of these provisions. Aligning the provisions would also allow the case law dealing with the income tax provision to be used to interpret the GST provision. Key features The new anti-avoidance provision will apply if an arrangement is entered into and directly or indirectly: • has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or • has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects, whether or not another purpose or effect relates to business or family dealings, if the purpose or effect is not merely incidental. Tax avoidance will be defined to include: • a reduction in the liability to pay tax; • a postponement in the liability to pay tax; • an increase in an entitlement to a refund; • an earlier entitlement to a refund; and • a reduction in consideration payable for a supply. 53 MINOR ISSUES, REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS AND CORRECTIONS Redundant provisions and references repealed (Clauses 66(3), 70(1), 70(2), 70(3) and (11), 70(6), 73(11) and (14), 83(5), 83(7), 84, 85, 89, 104 and 105) The following redundant provisions are repealed: • section 5(3A) • section 10(20) • section 20(3)(ea) • section 20(3A) • section 20(3AB) • section 20(3B) • section 23(2) • section 27(1)(ea) • section 82 • section 83 The following redundant references are repealed or replaced: • The references to sections 23(2), 27(4) and 41(2) in the definition of “due date” in section 2. • The reference to section 533 of the Local Government Act 1974 in the proviso to section 5(7)(a). • The references to the “Chatham Islands County Council”, “County Council” and “county dues” in section 5(7)(b) will be replaced with references to the “Chatham Islands Council” and “council dues” (as defined in section 2 of the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995) respectively. The application date for these amendments will be 1 November 1995, being the application date of the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995. • The reference in section 5(13A) to a registered person’s taxable activity is corrected. • The references in section 21(3B) to section FB 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. References to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the Tariff Act 1988 (Clause 75) Section 12 will be amended to update incorrect references to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the Tariff Act 1988. The updated references to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 will have retrospective application, applying on and after 1 October 1996. 54 Calculation of output tax (Clause 83(6)) The reference to “a supply” in section 20(4)(a) will be changed to “the supply” to be consistent with the reference to “a supply” in the wording preceding paragraph (a). The reference to “that supply” in section 20(4)(b)(i) is also inconsistent with other wording in section 20(4)(b) and will be changed to “the supply”. No change in meaning is intended by these changes. Shareholder and director liability (Clause 98) Section 61 will be amended to have the same section heading as section HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which section 61 incorporates into the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The section heading will be changed to: “Liability for tax payable by company left with insufficient assets”. Other policy changes 57 GROUP INVESTMENT FUND MANAGEMENT FEES (Clauses 7, 20, 21, 44 and 109) Summary of proposed amendment Group investment funds (GIFs) will be allowed to claim deductions for management fees paid to trustee companies on behalf of GIF investors, which will reduce compliance and administrative costs. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 1993. Background Under section 32 of the Trustee Companies Act 1967, trustees of GIFs are prohibited from charging management fees to GIFs. Consequently, it has become industry practice for the GIFs’ trust deeds to allow the trustee companies to charge the management fees directly to investors. GIFs deduct these fees from amounts due to investors and pay the management fees to the trustee companies on behalf of the investors. GIFs then distribute the net amount owed to investors. This can be depicted simply as follows: As it is the investors who incur the management fees, under current law, the investors should claim a deduction for those fees. However, that approach would impose significant compliance and administrative costs, on the GIFs, their investors, and Inland Revenue. GIF INVESTOR TRUSTEE Income $98 Income $100 $2 Management Fees 58 In order to reduce those costs, the law is being amended to allow GIFs to claim a deduction for the management fees involved. This is an interim measure. The Trustee Companies Act 1967 will be amended to allow trustee companies to charge management fees to GIFs. Until that amendment can be made, the deduction provision in this bill will ensure that GIFs are not disadvantaged for tax purposes by the current practice. Key features A new section, section DI 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, provides that management fees paid by GIFs to trustee companies on behalf of GIF investors will now be able to be claimed as a deduction by the GIF. An equivalent provision is being added to section 211A of the Income Tax Act 1976, to deal with the period from 1 April 1993 to 31 March 1995, before the Income Tax Act 1994 came into force. 59 DEDUCTIONS FOR 1998-1999 ACCIDENT INSURANCE BASE PREMIUMS (Clauses 9 and 11) Summary of proposed amendments To ensure that deductions for the 1998-1999 accident insurance base premiums are not deferred beyond the year in which they are paid, the amendment provides that if the base premium is paid on or before a discount date, the deduction may be claimed on the discount date. An exception is when an employer and the ACC have reached an agreement on a due date which is before the discount date. In these cases the deduction can be claimed on the due date. Two minor amendments clarify that: • Section ED 1A(3) does not apply to base premiums. • Interest paid under an instalment plan for payment of a base premium is deductible on the date when the interest is applied, according to the relevant instalment plan. Application date All of the amendments apply to 1998-1999 accident insurance base premiums. Background Under current law, base premiums payable under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 are deductible in the year in which the premium is due and payable. However, under the Accident Insurance (Payments of Base Premiums) Regulations 1999, some 1998-1999 base premiums may be due and payable on 30 June 2000, but the regulations contain an incentive (by way of a discount) for payment within 30 days from the date of the invoice. The effect is that, under current law, tax deductions for many of these payments would have been deferred until the year ending 31 March 2001 – the year in which the date 30 June 2000 falls. This would have been the case even if payment was made before 31 March 2000. To solve this problem the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to provide that, generally, if the payments are made on or before the discount date a deduction can be claimed in the year in which the discount date falls. If payment is not made by the discount date, the deduction will be allowed on the due date. 60 Key features Section ED 1A of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to provide that: • If payment of a 1998-1999 base premium is made on or before a discount date, and the discount date is before the due date, the deduction for the base premium can be claimed in the income year in which the discount date falls. • Subsection (3) does not apply to base premiums. A new section ED 6A provides that interest paid under an instalment plan for payment of a base premium is deductible on the date when the interest is applied, according to the relevant instalment plan. Detailed analysis Example – general case In the general case, payment will be made by the discount date and the due date will be 30 June 2000. Under the amendment, deductions for these payments may be claimed on the discount date. As shown in the following example, the deduction can be claimed on 15 October 1999 instead of 30 June 2000. An employer who has a balance date of 31 March will be able to claim the deduction in the 1999-2000 income year, the year in which it is paid. However, if payment is not made by the discount date, a deduction would be allowed on the due date, 30 June 2000. Although the general rule for some payments is for the due date to be 30 June 2000 with an earlier discount date, there is a provision for the ACC and an employer to agree on a due date other than 30 June. Some employers have requested that the due date be changed so that the deduction can be claimed in the income year in which the payment is made. If a due date earlier than the discount date has been set, a deduction can be claimed on the due date. due date (30/6/00) 31/3/99 30/6/0015/9/9915/10/99 date of invoice (15/9/99) discount date (15/10/99) 31/3/00 61 Example – ACC and employer set a new due date In the following example, because the due date is before the discount date, the deduction is claimed on the due date. For an employer with a 30 June balance date, this ensures that payment can be claimed during the 1998-1999 income year, and not deferred until the 1999-2000 income year, as would have happened if the discount date had been treated as the due date. Minor ancillary amendments Levies and premiums due on terminal tax date ACC levies and premiums for self-employed persons are paid on the terminal tax date for income tax payments. Although the terminal tax date has been extended for taxpayers with tax agents, who have an extension of time for filing their income tax returns, the extension does not apply for payment of ACC levies. Section ED 1A(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ensures that those ACC levies and premiums are due on 7 February each year. Theoretically, section ED 1A(3) is irrelevant to base premiums, because they are never payable on the terminal tax date. Payments of premiums due 30 days after an invoice is issued could, nevertheless, be caught by the words of the provision. A new subsection (3A) is being added to section ED 1A providing that subsection (3) does not apply to base premiums. Interest on instalment plans A further issue relates to daily interest paid under an instalment plan for 1998-1999 base premiums of $2,000 or more. Interest is calculated on the basis of 10 per cent of the amount of premium remaining unpaid after 30 June 2000. The interest is applied at each relevant instalment date. It is not entirely clear when the interest is deductible for tax purposes. For the sake of clarity the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to provide that interest is deemed to be due and payable on the relevant instalment date when the interest is applied. A new section, ED 6A, is being inserted to provide for this. due date (30/6/99) 15/6/9915/7/99 date of invoice (15/6/99) discount date (15/7/99) 30/6/99 62 GIFTS OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS (Clauses 13, 15, 108, 111 and 112) Summary of proposed amendment Financial arrangements transferred for nil or inadequate consideration will be deemed to have been transferred at market value. This amendment will ensure that the transferor of a financial arrangement that is gifted will not receive a deduction under the accrual rules for the value of the financial arrangement. Application date The amendment will apply to all financial arrangements gifted since the implementation of the accrual rules (1986), unless a transferor has claimed a deduction in relation to the transfer in a tax return filed by the date of introduction of the bill. If the transferor has already claimed a deduction, the existing provisions will apply for both the transferor and the transferee. Background Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Auckland Harbour Board v CIR in September 1999, the transferor of a financial arrangement that is gifted is able to receive a deduction under the accrual rules for the value of the financial arrangement. This result was unintended and is undesirable for two reasons: • Such a deduction is inconsistent with the monetary limit placed on rebates and deductions for cash gifts. • A deduction for gifts is inconsistent with the function of the base price adjustment mechanism and allows tax-planning opportunities. To address this problem, and prevent the transferor from receiving a deduction, a financial arrangement transferred for nil or inadequate consideration will be deemed to be transferred at market value. Key features Section EH 16(3) (Division 1) and section EH 49(1) (Division 2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 are to be amended to provide that all financial arrangements transferred for inadequate consideration are deemed to be transferred at market value. At present, the transfer is deemed to be at market value only when the transferor purchases the financial arrangement to sell or dispose of it, or the transferor’s business includes dealing in financial arrangements. 63 The amendment will prevent the transferor of a financial arrangement that is gifted from receiving a deduction under the accrual rules for the value of the financial arrangement. Section 64J(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 is to be amended in the same way. Consequentially, sections 75BA, 75BB and 75BC will be added to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 to ensure that gift duty will not be levied when the market value rule is applied. 64 FOREIGN TAX CREDITS (Clauses 17, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29) Summary of proposed amendments Anti-avoidance amendments are being made to: • put beyond doubt that foreign tax credits can be reconstructed in a tax avoidance arrangement; • deny a foreign tax credit, and require disclosure, when an equivalent benefit is provided to the taxpayer or an associate; and • allow the schedule of countries with abusive tax practices for which New Zealand provides only limited recognition of taxes paid to be updated through an Order in Council. Application date The amendments apply from 5 April 2000, the date of the Government’s announcement on this legislation. Background On 2 June 1994 the Taxation Reform (Companies and Other Matters) Bill was introduced and referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The bill contained anti-avoidance measures to prevent the abuse of foreign tax credits by denying taxpayers credits for foreign tax when, in substance, the tax has not been paid. In particular, the measures were aimed at situations where a taxpayer seeks a credit in New Zealand for tax paid in a foreign country, but the taxpayer or an associated person receives, in effect, a refund of the foreign tax. These measures were to apply to tax credit benefits received from 2 June 1994. The bill also included an amendment to the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act 1994. Although it was always the Government’s view that the current anti-avoidance provisions would apply, the amendment was to put beyond doubt that this provision can be used against tax avoidance schemes that involve the use of tax credits. There was also an amendment to allow the use of an Order in Council rather than legislative change to update the list of countries with abusive tax practices for which there is a blanket denial of foreign tax credits for taxes paid. This was to expedite the process by which countries could be added and taken off the list. 65 Consideration of these provisions was deferred by the Finance and Expenditure Committee until the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation (commonly referred to as the “wine-box inquiry”) had reported. The Commission of Inquiry has reported. Consistent with its recommendations, the Government considers it remains desirable for the foreign tax credit anti-avoidance measures to be enacted. However, rather than have the Finance and Expenditure committee report back to the House on the original bill, the amendments have been included in the present bill. This will give interested parties the opportunity to comment further on the amendments before they are enacted. The amendments, as originally introduced, were to take effect from 2 June 1994. However, it is now proposed that they apply from 5 April 2000. This later application date avoids the need to make complicated retrospective amendments to the now repealed Income Tax Act 1976. Key features • New subsections GB 1(2A) to (2C) of the Income Tax Act 1994 enable Inland Revenue to disallow tax credits in whole or in part if the credits are part of an avoidance arrangement. • New subsections LC 1(3A) to (3B) ensure that when a refund of foreign tax has been received either by taxpayers or their associates, a tax credit will not be allowed against New Zealand tax. • Section LC 13(b) is being amended to oblige taxpayers who are claiming tax credits for foreign tax paid to disclose to Inland Revenue any refunds of foreign tax paid to them or an associate. • Section LC 3 is being amended to enable full recovery of any foreign tax credit allowed in New Zealand when the underlying foreign tax has been refunded. • New Section LC 1A allows amendment to Schedule 6 by Order in Council. New Zealand does not allow tax credits for foreign taxes paid in countries listed in Schedule 6, as these countries have abusive tax practices. 66 ALIENATION OF INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT (Clauses 5, 6, 8, 18 and 40) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces an anti-avoidance rule broadly aimed at employees who circumvent the top personal tax rate of 39 percent by interposing a company, trust or partnership between themselves and their employer in order to have their income taxed at a lower rate. The rule will attribute what generally is, in substance, employment income to the employee. It supports the general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. The attribution rule will apply for income tax purposes only, and will not have any impact on the commercial and/or legal consequences of transactions entered into by the interposed entity. Application date The attribution rule will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 2000, to coincide with the date on which the 39 percent top personal tax rate took effect. Arrangements made before 1 April 2000 will be subject to the rule. Background The attribution rule addresses the need to protect the PAYE tax base following the increase in the top personal tax rate, from 1 April 2000, to 39 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that simple avoidance schemes are being targeted at employees. Income tax legislation already contains general anti-avoidance rules that can be used to counter such avoidance activity. Experience has shown, however, that they are time-consuming and costly to apply. Relying on these rules to counter the expected rise in cases of alienation of income by employees would mean that the results would most likely not become public through the courts for several years. Such delays could seriously erode the additional tax revenue intended by raising the top personal tax rate to 39 percent. The proposed legislation addresses this problem by providing explicit rules. This legislation closely follows the detail of the proposal announced by the Government on 30 March 2000. 67 Performs Services $120,000 Performs Services $120,000 salary HOW THE AVOIDANCE SCHEMES WORK In this simple example, Andrea is employed by Paul. Paul pays Andrea an annual salary of $120,000. Before 1 April 2000, Andrea’s annual tax liability would be $34,470. However, with the top tax rate increasing to 39%, her annual tax liability after 1 April 2000 would increase to $38,070: $38,000 @ 19.5% = $7,410 $22,000 @ 33% = $7,260 $60,000 @ 39% =$23,400 $38,070 Andrea, therefore, now has a greater incentive to structure her employment arrangement to reduce her tax liability. By forming and interposing a company, A&MCo Ltd, between herself and Paul, and drawing only $60,000 income from the company, the 39% tax rate could be avoided, and the total tax levied on the $120,000 income would remain at $34,470: Andrea: $38,000 @ 19.5% = $7,410 $22,000 @ 33% = $7,260 $14,670 A&MCo Ltd: $60,000 @ 33% = $19,800 Total: $34,470 The attribution rule will operate to ensure that the full $120,000 income is attributed to Andrea, as the person who has performed the personal services giving rise to the income. Key features The main legislation proposed is new sections GC 14B to GC 14D of the Income Tax Act 1994. The attribution rule is generally intended to apply when: • an employee (person C) has structured his or her employment relationship; • to interpose an entity (person B) between themselves; $60,000 Paul Andrea tax $14,670 A&MCo Ltd tax $19,800 Paul (employer) Andrea (employee) tax $38,070 68 • and their employer (person A); if the result is that income is diverted, or alienated, to an associated person to take advantage of the associated person’s lower marginal tax rate. The effect of the attribution rule will be to attribute person B’s net income from services to person C, the one who personally provided the services. The use of net income means that any deductible expenses incurred by person B will still be deductible. The rule will apply only when four key criteria are met: • The “employee”, person C, and the interposed entity, person B, must be associated persons. • Eighty percent of the gross income from the services of person B must be derived from a single source, person A, or persons associated with A. • Eighty percent of the gross income from the services of person B must relate to the services personally provided by person C, and related persons. • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from services. Substantial business assets are defined as being depreciable assets whose cost is the lesser of $75,000 or 25 percent or more of gross income from services. Generally, the assets must not be privately used, although if the asset is a vehicle, up to 20 percent private use is allowed. The amount to be attributed is the lesser of the net income from services or the net income of person B, with allowance being made to reduce the amount by income distributed by person B to person C in the form of beneficiary or partner income or as dividends. If the amount that would otherwise be attributed under this rule is less than $5,000, the rule does not apply. The amount attributed will be deemed to be gross income of person C and a deductible expense of person B. Detailed analysis The main provisions are new sections GC 14B to GC 14D: • Section GC 14B defines the circumstances in which the rule will apply. • Section GC 14C quantifies the amount to be attributed. • Section GC 14D provides for the $5,000 minimum threshold. Section GC 14B – the application Subsection (1) sets out the general proposition that when person B provides services personally performed by person C and persons B and C are associated, the attribution rule could apply. 69 The words “services personally performed” indicate that a natural person performs the services. Criteria to apply the rule Subsection (2) sets out the criteria to be met before the rule applies: • Eighty percent of the gross income from services of person B must be derived from a single source, person A, or persons associated with A. • Eighty percent of the gross income from services of person B must relate to the services personally provided by the “employee”, person C, and related persons. • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the income from services. The 80 percent level is arbitrary, but has been set to provide a suitable balance between what might or might not otherwise be a genuine employer/employee situation. Subsection (3) provides that persons are associated for the purposes of the attribution rule if they meet the criteria of sections OD 7 or OD 8(3). Substantial business assets Subsections (4) to (6) provide a definition of “substantial business assets” as being depreciable property whose cost is the lesser of: • $75,000; or • 25 percent or more of gross income from services; so long as the property is not used privately. Vehicles are excepted from this private use prohibition if their private use is 20 percent or less of total use. This recognises that in most small enterprises there will usually be some private use of vehicles. Private use is measured as appropriate, as either: • days in which fringe benefit tax is payable as a percentage of days the vehicle is leased or owned; or • the proportion of expenditure that is non-deductible in relation to the total expenditure on the vehicle. The substantial business assets test is designed to recognise that when substantial business assets are used there should also be a return on capital that does not relate to the services personally performed by person C. For example, the owner/driver of a petrol tanker should receive a return based on both assets employed and on labour provided. 70 Structures involving multiple entities In relation to one person C there may be more than one person B. In this case the rule still works, however, because it considers each person B separately and focuses on those persons B that have net income. Each such person B will have to consider the rule to see whether it needs to attribute income. Section CG 14C – the calculations Person B may have more than one source of income. For example, the one entity may have a share dealing business and, as well, be providing professional accounting services to one user. On the assumption that the qualifying criteria are met in relation to the accounting services income, the issue then becomes a question of how much to attribute. Clearly, one of the relevant amounts is the determination of the net income from services. Equally clearly, it is appropriate to ignore any net income from the share dealing activity. However, if the share dealing activity makes a loss for any one year, it seems reasonable to allow the loss to reduce the services income for that year as in many cases this loss would be accessed and used anyway. Therefore section GC 14C(1) requires that the amount to be attributed is the lesser of: • person B’s net income from services; or • person B’s net income. Subsection (2) qualifies this when person B is the trustee of a trust or a partnership. If person B is a trust, the calculations for person B are required to be completed as if it had not distributed any of its income to beneficiaries. If it is a partnership, person B is to be regarded as a taxpayer – ordinarily partnerships do not have net income; rather their income and expenditure are attributed to the partners. It is intended that the “net income from services” is after allowing for what are loosely termed “head office expenses” – the expenses of running the business, such as accounting and company office fees. Furthermore, person B’s net income from services allows that the monetary remuneration package paid to or on behalf of person C is an expense of deriving its “net income from services”. This package includes wages and salary, directors fees, attributable fringe benefits provided and fringe benefit tax. So long as person C receives the net service income as gross income, the rule does not seek to attribute anything more. Subsection (3) provides that any salary paid or fringe benefits provided by person B to person C will, for the purposes of determining person B’s net income from services, be regarded as an expense. 71 In a similar fashion, subsection (4) provides any amount to be attributed by person B is reduced if: • person B is a trust, the amount of any beneficiary income distributed to person C; • person B is a partnership, the amount of any partnership income received by person C; • person B is a company, the amount of dividends paid to person C during the year, or within six months afterwards, in respect of the year’s income. Although it is not possible to trace income through a company to a dividend paid to its owners, it will be acceptable, so long as the facts do not otherwise indicate, that the resolution declaring the dividend refers to the year’s income to which it relates. Any dividends paid by person B to persons other than person C from the income before it was attributed will not be “reversed” as a result of applying this attribution rule, since it would be difficult to deal with the myriad of situations that could arise. Subsection (5) provides that if the amount paid by person B to person C by way of beneficiary or partnership income or by dividend is greater than the subsection (1) amount to be attributed, the attribution rule does not apply. Subsection (6) provides that if there is more than one person C in relation to a person B (for example, husband and wife have both provided services) the amount to be attributed must be fairly divided between them, based on the relative value of work they have performed. Although this is not likely to apply very often, any reasonable basis of apportionment will be acceptable. Section GC 14D This section provides the $5,000 minimum threshold. If the amount calculated under section GC 14C is less than $5,000, no attribution need be made. Where, in relation to any one service provider (person C) there is more than one person B, the $5,000 threshold applies only once. Other changes Sections CD 8 and DJ 19 are inserted to provide that any amount attributed is gross income of person C and an allowable deduction to person B respectively. This has the effect of reducing person B’s income by the amount attributed and should generally prevent double taxation of the one amount of income. The section OB 2 definition of “source deduction payment” is being amended to ensure that amounts attributed are not source deductions, so they will not be subject to tax at source. Rather, person C will have to account for the income tax. Section CF 6(1) is being amended to require that dividend amounts for ascertaining the amount to be attributed include imputation credits. 72 TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS Summary of proposed amendments The bill makes a number of small policy changes and remedial amendments aimed at supporting the tax simplification measures enacted in 1998. The policy changes include removing the need for certain applicants for family support to provide tax file numbers or evidence of employment, and allowing some taxpayers to claim rebates early. Application date The amendments support processes that began with the start of the 1999-2000 income year, and apply from that time. Background Major tax simplification initiatives were enacted by the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998, which removed the need for wage and salary taxpayers to file IR 5 returns. A number of minor amendments in this bill either improve the processes that underlie those reforms or are remedial in nature. Key features Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994: • remove the need for applicants for family assistance to provide tax file numbers or evidence of employment in certain circumstances; • extend the time tax agents have to return income statements; • allow rebates to be claimed early in certain circumstances; and • give taxpayers who receive an income statement issued after terminal tax date two months to review it before it becomes an assessment. Detailed analysis Family assistance (Clauses 22, 23 and 24) Families with low employment income are entitled to tax credits. Three amendments will make it simpler for families to apply for the credits and increase the efficiency with which the credits are administered. 73 Children for whom family assistance is claimed must have tax file numbers. This is a compliance measure designed to reduce the amount of information that taxpayers need to provide and to mitigate the risk of multiple claims being made for the same child. In circumstances where the child has been given up for adoption or has died, those compliance issues may be outweighed by the stress of payments being delayed until tax file numbers are provided. In those situations other methods of identification may be more appropriate, such as the child’s birth certificate. Birth certificates and similar documentation are used as identification in the administration of the child support rules. Sections KD 4 (2A) and KD 5 (2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 are being replaced and a new section KD 5 (2AB) is inserted to allow evidence other than tax file numbers to verify the existence of a child for whom family assistance is being claimed. Applicants for interim instalments of family assistance are required to provide evidence of their income from employment for a specified period. This information is necessary to verify their entitlement. Changes to the way wage and salary information is collected by Inland Revenue have made it unnecessary for applicants with only wage and salary income to provide this information. A new section KD 5(2)(2AA) is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to provide an exemption to subsection (2)(a) of the same section if an applicant for family assistance has income only from employment. Inland Revenue is required to provide a certificate showing the amount of interim payments of family assistance paid to IR 3 taxpayers by 20 April following the end of the year in which the payments are made. The information is intended to help taxpayers self-assess their tax liability. Administrative processes have been designed to provide that information to taxpayers, with other related documents within a month of the certificate being due. Delaying the requirement on Inland Revenue to provide information about the interim payments until 20 May will make administering the system more efficient, prevent confusion that may result from duplicating the information and give taxpayers the information at an appropriate time to help them meet their tax obligations. The requirement in section KD 7(2A)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 that Inland Revenue provide a summary of interim payments by 20 April is being amended to 20 May following the year in which the payments are made. Terminal tax date (Clauses 37, 50, 51, 53 and 54) The terminal tax date for taxpayers with agents is generally two months later than for other taxpayers. When the tax simplification reforms were legislated, this extended terminal tax date was inadvertently omitted for taxpayers who receive an income statement. 74 Section NC 17(2)(b) is being replaced with a provision that includes taxpayers who receive an income statement and who also have a tax agent within the group entitled to an extended terminal tax date, to restore consistency of treatment for all taxpayers with agents. Consequential amendments are made to sections 80B, 80C, 80F and 80H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that processes supporting income statements are consistent with the extended terminal tax date. Procedure to claim rebates (Clauses 39, 41 and 64) Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows rebates to be claimed only after 1 April following the end of the income year in which donations or housekeeper and childcare expenses are incurred. Standard balance date taxpayers must claim these rebates by 30 September. Not allowing rebates to be claimed before the end of the income year may significantly disadvantage certain taxpayers, such as those who intend to leave the country before the end of the year, or a trustee of an estate who is unable to wind up the estate until a rebate is claimed. New sections 41A (6AA) and (6AB) in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being inserted to allow rebates to be claimed early in prescribed circumstances. A redundant reference is being removed from the definition of “refundable rebate” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 184A (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being replaced with a new definition of tax that includes refunds allowed under section 41A. This means that rebates, like refunds of tax, levies, and duties will be direct credited. Income statements (Clause 54) Income statements are expected to be issued well before the terminal tax date, at which time they become assessments of tax liability. An unintended exception to this rule is an income statement issued after the terminal tax date. Because these income statements are deemed to be assessments from the terminal tax date, taxpayers lose the ability to review and correct them before they become assessments. A new section 80H (6) in the Tax Administration Act 1994 deems income statements issued on or after terminal tax date to be assessments two months after they are issued. The two-month period gives taxpayers time to review and correct the statement before it becomes an assessment and, therefore, increases the certainty with which taxpayers self-assess. 75 RWT ON INTEREST PAID BY INLAND REVENUE (Clause 38) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment prevents over-deduction of resident withholding tax on interest paid by Inland Revenue. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1999-2000 income year. Background Resident withholding tax must be deducted from interest paid by Inland Revenue. If the underlying overpayment of tax is revised upwards, interest paid with respect to that overpayment is recalculated. At present, it is uncertain whether the resident withholding tax rules require tax to be deducted from both interest payments. Deduction from both interest payments can lead to over-deduction of resident withholding tax. Key feature A new section NF1(3A) requires Inland Revenue to take into account interest that has previously been calculated in relation to the same underlying overpayment. 76 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 113) Summary of proposed amendment The bill confirms the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2000-2001 income year. The annual rates to be confirmed include: • The 39 percent rate applying to individuals and unincorporated bodies with income exceeding $60,000; and • The proposed specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) rate of 39 percent that will apply to employer’s contributions to a superannuation fund if the employer elects to pay specified superannuation contribution withholding tax at this rate. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2000-2001 income year. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in the First Schedule of the Act to be confirmed each year. The new 39 percent income tax rate was enacted in December 1999. The proposed 39 percent SSCWT rate is part of the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill, currently before Parliament. Key features The rates listed in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be confirmed for the 2000-2001 income year. 77 INCREMENTAL PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT OF TAX (Clause 57) Summary of proposed amendment The incremental penalty for late payment of tax is to be reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent each month that tax is overdue. This is a simplification measure designed to support penalties without creating a preference for paying trade creditors. Application date The amendment applies from the 2001-2002 income year. Background The discussion document Less Taxing Tax, released in September last year, considered a number of tax simplification proposals aimed at small businesses. Measures it proposed to increase the leniency and flexibility of treatment given to those with overdue tax received wide support. Those measures also had earlier formed part of the recommendations made by the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s inquiry into the powers and operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The incremental late payment penalty is designed to provide a clear, continuing incentive to pay overdue tax. Although the penalty must be significant enough to create a preference for paying Inland Revenue over trade creditors, and so that complying taxpayers can see that non-compliance is punished, reducing it to one percent achieves those objectives while increasing the fairness and integrity of the tax system. Penalties should not exceed the levels necessary to achieve their objectives. The reduction will also prevent penalties accumulating to the extent they are perceived to be out of proportion to the underlying overdue tax and reduce pressure on processes used to mitigate imposition of the penalty. The measure is, therefore, expected to reduce both compliance and administrative costs. Key feature Section 139B(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which sets the rate of the penalty, is being amended to reduce that rate to 1 percent a month. 78 GRACE PERIOD FOR USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST (Clause 63) Summary of proposed amendment The grace period from use-of-money interest given to taxpayers who receive a statement of account for overdue tax is being increased from fifteen days to thirty days. This is a simplification measure designed to make it easier for taxpayers to meet their obligations to pay overdue tax. Application date The amendment applies from the 2001-2002 income year. Background This simplification measure also arises from the Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry and is discussed in Less Taxing Tax. Use-of-money interest is applied on overdue tax payments to compensate the Government for the tax deferral. However, interest applicable to the period between the issue of a statement of account and when the payment is made is eligible to be cancelled if the payment is made within fifteen days of the statement being issued. This is a measure designed to provide certainty by creating a period for payment in which daily interest calculations do not need to be made to determine the total amount of tax and interest payable. In practice, the grace period has proved too short to be effective, particularly for taxpayers with agents. By extending the grace period to thirty days, taxpayers and their agents will have considerably longer in which to make payments without the need to make additional interest calculations. The extended period of certainty reduces the cost of meeting tax obligations. Key feature Section 183C (4)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which sets the grace period, is being amended to increase that period to thirty days. 79 SERIOUS HARDSHIP AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY (Clauses 48, 60, 61 and 62) Summary of proposed amendments The types of taxes that are eligible to be cancelled, remitted or the subject of an instalment arrangement will be extended from income tax and fringe benefit tax to include all taxes. It will be unnecessary for Inland Revenue to obtain the approval of the Minister of Finance to remit tax, refund it or enter instalment arrangements for amounts in excess of $50,000. These are simplification measures designed to reduce the costs and stress associated with overdue tax payments by increasing certainty in, and the speed, of the processes that grant relief in relation to that debt. Applications to Inland Revenue to pay overdue tax by instalments no longer need to be in writing. Application date The extension of the relief provisions to all tax types applies to tax that is payable on or after the 2001-2002 income year. The requirement that applicants for instalment arrangements be in writing is removed from the date of enactment. Background This is a further initiative arising from the Finance and Expenditure Committee inquiry and is discussed in Less Taxing Tax. The serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply only to income tax and fringe benefit tax. In practice, however, taxpayers can face serious hardship and financial difficulties in meeting other tax obligations. In such cases Inland Revenue has been using care and management authority to provide a measure of relief. Extending the relief provisions to all tax types is expected to provide greater clarity and transparency of processes that deal with taxpayers whose circumstances are stressful. Applying the extension to the instalment arrangement provisions creates a more coherent package of relief provisions. 80 Awaiting ministerial approval of relief arrangements can be a time-consuming procedure that causes stress and anxiety for taxpayers. The delay may often affect the taxpayer’s economic circumstances and may act to reduce revenue collection. The need for approval is also inconsistent with the separation of the Commissioner’s statutory role of day-to-day tax administration from the Minister’s role of political oversight. Removing both that requirement and the requirement that applications for instalment arrangements in cases of financial difficulty be in writing have the advantage of streamlining the relief process. It will result in administrative cost savings for Inland Revenue and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, particularly by reducing the stress associated with waiting for approval. Key features Four key amendments are being made to the remission and relief rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994: • A new definition of “tax” for the purposes of sections 176 and 177 is inserted into section 3. • The subsections in section 176 that impose the requirement for ministerial approval and define the taxes eligible for relief are repealed. • Section 177 is amended for the current year, making it clear that applications for remission still need to be in writing. • Section 177 is replaced from the 2001-2002 income year. Remedial amendments 83 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT TERMINOLOGY (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment Section EH 18 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to clarify its intended effect. The amendment to section EH 18(1) will ensure that provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 that were amended by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 to reflect terminology changes in the accrual rules continue to apply to Division 1 financial arrangements. Section EH 18(2) and (3) is being amended to provide that where there is duplication of provisions in Division 1 and elsewhere in the Act, the Division 1 provisions apply to Division 1 financial arrangements. Application date These amendments will apply from 20 May 1999, the date that section EH 18 came into effect. Inland Revenue indicated to taxpayers in a Tax Information Bulletin in October 1999 that it would recommend to the Government that the section be clarified, with retrospective effect. 84 CONSOLIDATED GROUPS AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS (Clauses 16 and 19) Summary of proposed amendment The consolidated filing rules are being amended to ensure that dividends resulting from the remission of certain debt between members of a consolidated group are not inappropriately excluded from the gross income of the consolidated group. The concern arises from the remission of debt that was in place before the election to form the consolidated group became effective. This remission can, depending on the facts, be dealt with as a base price adjustment or as a dividend. If it is a base price adjustment it is currently brought to account. If it is a dividend, however, it is currently excluded from income. Application date The amendment applies from the date of introduction of the bill. Background The recent reform of the accrual rules identified a deficiency concerning debt remission within a consolidated group. This concerns the situation where debt is remitted by a member of a consolidated group to another member of the consolidated group. If the debt was in place before the companies became members of the consolidated group, any remission is intended to result in gross income being derived. If a remission results in income under the accrual rules, the outcome is appropriate. However, frequently the result will be a dividend under section CF 2(1)(b) and, depending on the corporate structure, section CF 2(1)(k). Such a dividend would generally not qualify for the wholly owned group companies intra-group dividend exemption. Section HB 2(1)(a)(i) and (ii) results in such dividends not being gross income. Key features New sub-paragraph HB 2(1)(a)(vi) of the Income Tax Act 1994 now includes dividends resulting from the remission of debt between members of a consolidated group if that debt was in place before the consolidation became effective in the gross income of the consolidated group. As well, the interaction of sub-paragraphs HB 2(1)(a)(iv) and HB 2(1)(a)(v) is clarified so that they act independently, not conjunctively. 85 PARENTAL TAX CREDIT (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendment A new section, KB 5(1BA), is being introduced into the Income Tax Act 1994. It ensures that when the three-month application period for the parental tax credit spans two income years and the family chooses to apply for the credit in the second income year, the credit will be abated against income earned in the second year. This is in keeping with the original policy intent and merely legislates for current administrative practice. Application date The amendment will be backdated to apply from 1 October 1999, the date from which the parental tax credit first applied. 86 FOREIGN INVESTOR TAX CREDIT RULES (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment Section LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended to address an anomaly in the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. Section LE 3 allows the FITC rules to be used when a New Zealand holding company is interposed between the paying company and the non-resident shareholder. The rules were amended in 1998 to prevent section LE 3 applying when the holding company is a member of a consolidated group. That amendment, however, was too broadly worded, and inadvertently prevents the mechanism applying in some cases when the FITC rules should legitimately apply. Application date The amendment will apply to dividends paid on or after 12 December 1995, to match the date on which the 1998 amendment took effect. 87 HOUSING NEW ZEALAND (Clauses 46 and 110) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments to Schedule 18 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 1976 confirm that Housing New Zealand Ltd (HNZ) is to be taxed as if it were a state enterprise from the date of its inception in 1992 to 4 June 1999. The policy intention was for HNZ to be taxed as if it were a state enterprise, but an Order in Council providing for that status was overlooked until 4 June 1999. Application date The amendment applies for the period 1 July 1992 to 4 June 1999. 88 DEFINITION OF “TAX” (Clause 48) Summary of proposed amendment This remedial amendment will have the effect of restoring the scope of the definition of “tax” for the purpose of the care and management provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. When those provisions were originally enacted they applied to all revenues and entitlements covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. Application date Because the earlier amendment that limited the scope was effective from 1 0ctober 1996, the amendment will be retrospective to that date. Background The Commissioner is expressly charged with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with any other functions conferred on him or her. A 1995 amendment, however, inadvertently excluded particular references such as the approved issuer levy, use-of-money interest, student loan repayments and financial support from the scope of the care and management provisions. Key feature A new paragraph is included in the definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The effect is that for the purposes of the care and management provisions (sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994) “tax” will include all revenues, repayments and entitlements covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. 89 PROVISIONAL TAX FOR THOSE CHANGING BALANCE DATES Minor remedial amendments are required to the rules introduced in the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997, which established provisional tax rules for those who change their balance date. The complexity of these rules and their interaction with subsequent legislation has raised potential for uncertainty in their application. All the amendments in the bill act to confirm the policy underlying the rules that came into effect from the 1998-1999 income year. Calculation of residual income tax in a transitional year (Clause 34) Summary of proposed amendment Residual income tax of the preceding year is used to calculate the provisional tax liability for the current year. If the preceding year was a transitional year, residual income tax for that year needs to be adjusted to take into account the length of the transitional year. An amendment to section MB 2(6) and (7) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being made to ensure that it does so. The amendment also clarifies that the relevant base year is the year before the immediately preceding income year. Application date The amendment applies to payments of provisional tax for the 1998-1999 income year that are due on or after 7 July 1998. Election to become a provisional taxpayer (Clause 35) Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers can elect to become provisional taxpayers if they have paid $2,500 of provisional tax by the third instalment date for provisional tax. Taxpayers with a transitional year may have their tax payments spread over six instalment dates, with only half being paid by the third instalment date, and therefore find that they are ineligible to elect to become provisional taxpayers. An amendment to section MB 2A(1) in the Income Tax Act 1994 will allow taxpayers who have paid provisional tax of $2,500 by their final instalment date to elect to become provisional taxpayers. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year. 90 Provisional tax obligations during the transitional year (Clause 36) Summary of proposed amendment Applications for non-standard balance dates can be approved in the period after the end of the income year in which the application is made, but before the end of the transitional year. An amendment is being made to section MB 5A(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 to confirm that the transitional provisional tax rules apply in that period. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year. Calculation of transitional year provisional tax (Clause 36) Summary of proposed amendments A new section MB 5A(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1994 clarifies that the total amount of provisional tax that is payable is the total of all instalments due in the transitional year. It removes inconsistencies that can arise in the calculations undertaken to monitor and inform taxpayers of their liability. Consequential changes are made to sections MB 5A(5), MB 5A(6) and MB 5A(7), which calculate the amount of individual instalments due in a transitional year. Application date The amendments apply from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year. Interest on transitional year provisional tax (Clauses 36 and 56) Summary of proposed amendments Use-of-money interest is charged on underpaid provisional tax. The provisional tax rules are prevented from applying before a new provisional taxpayer starts up a business. Amendments to sections MB 5A(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being made to prevent use-of-money interest from applying before the business starts up. Application date The amendments apply from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year. 91 Definition of “provisional taxpayer” in section OB 1 (Clause 39) Summary of proposed amendment The provisional tax rules inappropriately apply to all taxpayers entitled to become provisional taxpayers. An amendment is being made to the definition of “provisional taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to exclude taxpayers from the application of the provisional tax rules if they have not elected to become provisional taxpayers. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 1999-2000 income year. Definition of “new provisional taxpayer” (Clauses 39 and 48) Summary of proposed amendment The existence of separate definitions of “new provisional taxpayer” in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Tax Administration Act 1994 have the potential to create confusion. The definition in section 3(1) of Tax Administration Act 1994 is being repealed, leaving the broader definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to apply to both Acts. Because the Income Tax Act 1994 definition covers natural persons, a number of consequential amendments are being made to rules that apply use-of- money interest to new provisional taxpayers who are natural persons. The definition of “new provisional taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended at the same time to correct a previous omission that excludes natural persons acting in their capacity as a trustee. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2000-2001 income year. Payments due after new provisional taxpayer starts business (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendment The method of calculating the number of provisional tax instalments in a transitional year can result in a provisional tax liability for new taxpayers before they start up business. An amendment is proposed to Schedule 13 Part B of the Income Tax Act 1994 to prevent such a liability from arising. 92 Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year. Late payment penalty for unpaid provisional tax during a transitional year (Clause 58) Summary of proposed amendment Late payment penalties are payable on unpaid provisional tax during a transitional year. Section 139C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being re-enacted to confirm that that the penalty should be calculated on a basis that includes provisional tax payable during a transitional year. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 1998-1999 income year.

This amendment ensures that stake money won in an overseas race is treated in the same manner as stake money won in a race held in New Zealand. Application date The amendment applies from the income year beginning on 1 April 2001. Key features Section CB 9(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to ensure stake money won by bloodstock and greyhounds in overseas races is exempt from income tax. The exemption of overseas stake money under CB 9(c) will mean that expenditure relating to deriving that stake money will be non-deductible under section BD 2(b). Background In August the Government announced that race stakes won overseas would become exempt from income tax. Stake money is the prize money paid to the owner of a horse or greyhound that wins a race. Stake money paid in respect of a race held in New Zealand has been exempt from income tax since 1965. Stake money won in an overseas race is taxable if the owner participates in the race as part of a business. However, expenses incurred in racing, whether in New Zealand or overseas, are generally not deductible. Overseas racing was not considered when the tax exemption for stake money won domestically was introduced in 1965. This was probably because sending horses overseas to race at this time was not as common as it is today. A key tax principle is that business activities are subject to income tax, whereas hobbies are not. Racing can be undertaken to increase the value of bloodstock (breeding related racing) or for the personal entertainment of the owner (non-breeding related racing). As owners can generally expect that the expenses incurred in racing will exceed the stake money won, racing not related to breeding whether undertaken domestically or internationally, is more in the nature of a hobby than a business activity and should thus not be subject to income tax. 4 Although breeding-related racing may be closely associated with a breeding business, to limit avoidance opportunities and tax-driven behaviour, stake money won in breeding-related racing, whether undertaken domestically or internationally, should also not be subject to income tax. 5 SERVICES-RELATED PAYMENTS: RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND EXIT INDUCEMENTS (Clauses 7, 8, 9, 12 and 24) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces amendments to tax certain services-related payments which represent a risk to the tax base. These payments are referred to as “restrictive covenant” and “exit inducement” payments. A “restrictive covenant” payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. An “exit inducement” payment is the consideration given to a person to give up a particular status or position in the context of personal services. These payments pose a risk to the personal services income tax base because they are non-taxable to the recipient and can be paid in substitution for taxable personal services income (including salary or wages), and they may be deductible in some cases to the payer. In addition to the amendments making restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments taxable, there are a number of associated amendments. These include excluding restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business from the charging provision, excluding expenditure on restrictive covenants and exit inducements from the capital prohibition rule, and including restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees within the PAYE rules. Application date The amendments will apply to amounts derived on and after the date of enactment. This will include such amounts derived in respect of arrangements made before the date of enactment. Key features The amendments addressing the revenue risk posed by these services-related payments relate to the restrictive covenant charging provision (new sections CHA 1 and GC 14F of the Income Tax Act 1994), the exit inducement charging provision (new section CHA 2), deductibility matters (new sections DJ 20, DJ 21 and EO 6) and the PAYE rules (section OB 1). Under the restrictive covenant-related amendments (new sections CHA 1 and GC 14F): • If a person gives an undertaking which has the effect of restricting the person’s ability to perform services as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any amount derived by that person or any other person in respect of the undertaking will be taxable to that person. 6 • Restrictive covenant payments received on the sale of a business as a going concern will be excluded from the restrictive covenant charging provision. (This exclusion only applies if a number of conditions are satisfied.) • A specific anti-avoidance provision is intended to ensure that the charging provision cannot be circumvented by an arrangement such as an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. The charging provision for exit inducements (new section CHA 2) will tax any amount derived by a person for a loss of a vocation, position or status, or for leaving a position. Under the deductibility-related amendments (new sections DJ 20, DJ 21 and EO 6): • Express relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure will be provided for persons who incur expenditure on making restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments. This will facilitate their being able to deduct such payments, thereby maintaining consistency with the treatment of expenditure on salary and wages and other payments for services. • Restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments will be non-deductible to the extent that they relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by the recipient employee. (Salary and wages are similarly non-deductible in such a situation.) • Recipients of restrictive covenant payments who have been taxed on them will be allowed a deduction to the extent that they have to refund the payment because they do not comply with the covenant for its full term. Restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees will be included within the PAYE rules (section OB 1). The ordinary tax accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 will apply to determine the time at which services-related payments are included in gross income or allowed as a deduction. No special amendments are being made in this regard. Background The New Zealand tax system generally maintains a capital-revenue boundary: capital receipts are generally not taxed, whereas revenue receipts are taxed. Boundaries in the tax system give scope for amounts that may lie on one side of the boundary to be legally recharacterised to lie on the other side of the boundary. This boundary becomes problematic in the context of certain services-related payments. Payments that would generally be taxable in the same manner as wages and salary may be capable of being characterised as non-taxable capital payments. This creates a risk to the personal services income tax base. 7 There are two components to the services-related payments problem that are addressed by the amendments in the bill. The identified problem areas are “restrictive covenant” and “exit inducement” payments. A “restrictive covenant” payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. An “exit inducement” payment is the consideration given to a person to give up a particular status or position in the context of personal services. The New Zealand courts have held that payments for restrictive covenants 1 and exit inducements 2 are non-taxable capital receipts. These services-related payments are, therefore, non-taxable in the hands of the recipients, but may be deductible in some cases to the persons making the payments. The risk to the tax base results from the potential for these non-taxable capital receipts to be substituted for taxable personal services income. 3 Such arrangements have been increasing in recent years and are likely to continue to increase as a result of the recent increase in the top personal income tax rate to 39%. There is also an associated risk to the integrity of the tax system in that the payment of large, tax-free amounts to some individuals may give rise to the perception that the tax system is unfair. This would undermine voluntary compliance. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) reviewed the treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments and recommended that the Government consider legislation to make them taxable. On 30 June 2000, the Government released an issues paper containing proposals to address the revenue risk posed by these services-related payments by making them taxable. In line with the generic tax policy process, submissions were invited on these proposals. After further consideration and in the light of submissions, the Government has made two modifications to the proposals contained in the issues paper. These modifications are an exclusion for restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business and the limitation of the application of the PAYE rules to payments made to employees. With these exceptions, the design of the proposed reform follows that set out in the issues paper. 1 Henwood v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser (1996) 17 NZTC 12,607. 2 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser, Case U8 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,068. 3 Personal services income includes payments made under both contracts of service (employment contracts) and contracts for services. It also includes payments made to office holders. References in this commentary to “services” or “personal services” generally include employment, and being an independent contractor and office holder. Also, examples of employment situations in this commentary generally include independent contracting and office holding. 8 Detailed analysis Restrictive covenant charging provision New section CHA 1 will provide that if a person gives an undertaking which has the effect of restricting the person’s ability to perform services as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any amount derived by that person or any other person in respect of the undertaking is taxable to that person. This charging provision is quite broad in that the contract to provide services and the restrictive covenant undertaking can be with different persons. It should cover any combination of payment and agreement between multiple entities by focusing on the restrictive covenant payment itself. This would include, for example, an arrangement such as that in the Fraser case, in which four entities were involved in the transaction. The charging provision applies to any undertaking (not just a contract), whether or not the undertaking is legally valid. The reference to “amount” in new section CHA 1 uses the definition of “amount” in section OB 1 which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision is, therefore, sufficiently broad to cover in-kind consideration, not just monetary payments. The drafting of this charging provision is based on section 313 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (United Kingdom), which treats any payments made under restrictive covenant agreements relating to employees or office holders as taxable emoluments from employment. Sale of business exclusion from restrictive covenant charging provision New section CHA 1 will contain a specific exclusion for restrictive covenant payments made in connection with the sale of a business. This exclusion has been made because the main focus of the amendment is to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for taxable income from services. Restrictive covenant payments received on the sale of a business are part of a larger capital receipt (the purchase price of a business) and are less likely to be substituted for taxable income from services. Taxing restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business could also impose significant compliance costs on taxpayers by forcing them to value restrictive covenants separately, when the consideration for a restrictive covenant is incorporated in a single payment for goodwill. The exclusion for restrictive covenant payments made on the sale of a business applies only if a number of conditions are satisfied. These conditions are designed to prevent the exclusion being exploited so as to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. These conditions are that: 9 • The restrictive covenant amount is derived as part of the consideration for the sale of a taxable activity as a going concern by the person who gives the undertaking. • The restrictive covenant amount is consideration for an undertaking by the vendor of the taxable activity not to provide goods or services in competition with the goods or services provided by the purchaser. • The restrictive covenant amount is paid by the purchaser to the vendor. • The person who gives the restrictive covenant undertaking must not provide any services to the purchaser following the sale of the taxable activity, other than services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature. • The vendor and purchaser agree in writing that the transaction is a sale of a taxable activity as a going concern. The sale of a taxable activity as a going concern includes the sale of part of a taxable activity as a going concern and also includes the sale of all of the shares in a company that is carrying on a taxable activity as a going concern. The terms “going concern” and “taxable activity” have the meanings given to those terms under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act), subject to certain modifications. The references in the “going concern” definition to “supplier” and “recipient” refer to the vendor and purchaser of the taxable activity respectively. The “going concern” definition is also modified to apply to the sale of shares in a company. The definition of “taxable activity” applying for the purpose of section CHA 1 does not include the exclusion for exempt activities contained in section 6(3)(d) of the GST Act. Restrictive covenant anti-avoidance provision New section GC 14F is a specific anti-avoidance provision which is designed to buttress the restrictive covenant charging provision in new section CHA 1. Under this specific anti-avoidance provision, if an arrangement has been entered into which has an effect of avoiding the application of section CHA 1, the Commissioner may treat an amount under the arrangement as an amount to which section CHA 1 applies. The Commissioner may also treat any person affected by the arrangement as the person liable under section CHA 1. This anti-avoidance provision is designed to address, in particular, the situation of an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. This arrangement transforms a payment for a restrictive covenant into a payment for shares and the payment received by the employee from the sale of the shares may not be taxed under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. This arrangement could be enough to break the link between the payment and the restrictive covenant. Section GC 14F would ensure that an amount derived under such an arrangement would be taxable under new section CHA 1. 10 The enactment of section GC 14F would not preclude the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. Exit inducement charging provision New section CHA 2 is the specific charging provision for exit inducements. The provision will tax any amount derived by a person for a loss of a vocation, position or status, or for leaving a position. The new section focuses on payments for vacating a position. This is consistent with the nature of an exit inducement payment as compensation for giving something up in the course of starting a new position. It is not necessary for the provision to apply to inducements to take up a position because these are generally taxable as monetary remuneration to an employee or as business income to an independent contractor. New section CHA 2 will cover an exit inducement payment made to compensate the payee for leaving a position of employment. The provision is also broad enough to cover the situation where the position being vacated is not an employment one – for example, a position as an independent contractor or an office such as a board membership. The exit inducement cases of Vaughan-Neil 4 and Pritchard v Arundale 5 involved a barrister and a partner in a firm of chartered accountants respectively, both being positions where the payee was a non-employee. The Fraser and Case U8 cases involved taxpayers leaving positions of employment. New section CHA 2 will cover a situation like that in the Fraser case, where the emphasis in the judgments was that the taxpayer was being compensated for the loss of his career as a television presenter, as well as the traditional type of exit inducement case which involves a loss of status. 6 The provision also encompasses a situation like that in Case U8, which represents an extension over previous exit inducement cases. That situation did not involve a distinct change of career or loss of social status, but only a change of employment or position within the same industry. It is necessary, therefore, for the charging provision to include compensation for a simple loss of a particular contract of services or contract for services. The charging provision will also include an amount derived as consideration for simply leaving a position as it may be argued that in some cases there is no loss as such. The ordering of the words “vocation”, “position” and “status” in the charging provision helps to indicate its services-related nature and thus its scope (sometimes referred to as the ejusdem generis rule of statutory interpretation). 4 Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1979) STC 644. 5 Pritchard v Arundale (1971) 47 TC 680. 6 For example, Jarrold v Boustead (1964) 41 TC 701, Pritchard v Arundale and Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners. In these cases, a consequence of the taxpayers changing their occupations was a loss of valued social status. 11 The reference to “amount” in new section CHA 2 uses the definition of “amount” in section OB 1 which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision is, therefore, sufficiently broad to cover in-kind consideration, not just monetary payments. Deductibility of services-related payments New section DJ 20 will ensure that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments are deductible to the payer in the same circumstances as salary and wages and other payments for services. This deductibility provision, in conjunction with the charging provisions for restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments, provides for symmetry in the tax treatment of these payments. New section DJ 20 follows the model of providing express relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure, which is used in other places in the income tax legislation, such as section DJ 13. This means that, in order to be deductible, a payment will still need to have the connection with gross income required by the general deductibility rule in section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii). New section DJ 20 also ensures that the deductibility treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments is not concessionary in comparison with salary and wages. Salary and wages are non-deductible capital expenditure to the extent they relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by recipient employees, as in Christchurch Press Company Ltd. 7 If outright relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure was provided for restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments, these payments could never be characterised as capital expenditure, even when the work was of a capital nature. Employers could, therefore, prefer to make these payments instead of salary and wage payments if capital works were involved. To prevent such different treatment, new section DJ 20 provides that the relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure does not apply to the extent that: • services are performed for the payer by the employee, office holder or independent contractor who derives the restrictive covenant or exit inducement amount; and • any expenditure would have been incurred in respect of those services but for the payment of the restrictive covenant or exit inducement amount; and • that expenditure would have been of a capital nature. New section DJ 21 will allow a deduction to persons who have been taxed on a restrictive covenant payment if they have to refund part or all of that payment because they do not comply with the terms of the restrictive covenant. 7 Christchurch Press Company Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. 12 The deduction allowed under new section DJ 21 is limited to the lesser of the amount that is refunded and the amount that was taxed to the person under the restrictive covenant charging provision. Also, no deduction is allowed for any payment in respect of punitive or exemplary damages, interest or the legal costs or other expenses of the person who paid the restrictive covenant amount to the person claiming the deduction. New section EO 6 provides that the deduction under new section DJ 21 is allowed in the income year that the refund is paid. PAYE amendments The definition of “extra emolument” in section OB 1 will be amended to ensure that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees are subject to withholding at source under the PAYE rules. This will include payments made to previous, current or prospective employees. Because of the inclusion of these payments in the definition of “extra emolument”, along with their consequent inclusion in the definition of “income from employment”, an employee recipient of a restrictive covenant or exit inducement payment will not be allowed a deduction for any related expenditure (sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1). Timing of income and expenditure The ordinary tax accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 will apply to determine the time at which services-related payments are included in gross income or allowed as a deduction. No special amendments are being made in this regard. The particular tax accounting principles that apply to determine when a restrictive covenant or exit inducement payment is included in a recipient’s gross income depend on the type of taxpayer involved. In the case of cash method taxpayers, derivation of income is based on the actual receipt of income. 8 So if a payment for a restrictive covenant with a three-year term is paid to an employee as a lump sum in year one, the entire amount is derived and, therefore, taxed in that year of receipt. In the case of most taxpayers carrying on a business, the accrual or earnings method applies to determine when an amount is derived. This method is based on the right to receive income (an entitlement to bill) rather than actual receipt. 9 An up-front restrictive covenant payment received by an independent contractor could be spread over the term of the covenant. 8 Bowcock v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062. 9 Arthur Murray v Commissioner of Taxes (1965) 114 CIR 314. 13 The ordinary statutory rules will apply to determine the timing of deductibility of these services-related payments. In particular, section EF 1 effectively requires a deduction for expenditure to be spread over the term to which the expenditure relates. 10 For example, in respect of an up-front $30,000 payment made under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term, the allowable deduction for each of the three years would be $10,000. In the case of exit inducement payments, payment is likely to be deducted in full in the year of payment. That is because section EF 1, which requires expenditure to be spread over the contract term, would not be applicable. 11 There is usually no enduring aspect to an exit inducement beyond the requirement that the payee start a service relationship. 10 Section BD 4 of the core provisions governs the timing of allowable deductions. Section BD 4(2) provides that if an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the deduction must be allocated to an income year in accordance with that regime. “Timing regime” is defined in section OB 1 to include a regime for allocating allowable deductions to an income year other than the income year to which the allowable deduction would have been allocated in the absence of the regime. In the absence of a timing regime, the payments under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term would be incurred in year one when the agreement is entered into and, therefore, would have been deductible in that year. However, the timing regime in section EF 1, relating to “accrual expenditure”, would require the expenditure on the restraint to be spread over its three-year term. “Accrual expenditure” is defined very broadly in section OB 1 to mean any expenditure that is allowed as a deduction other than expenditure covered by other specific timing regimes, such as the trading stock or accrual rules. Section EF 1(5)(d), applying to choses in action, would be used to determine the unexpired portion of any amount of accrual expenditure relating to restrictive covenants that would need to be added back into the recipient's income, by reference to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the restraint is enforceable. This mechanism achieves the spread of income. 11 Once the payment is made there is generally no unexpired portion to be added back to income in future years in terms of section EF 1. 14 TAXING BENEFICIARY INCOME OF MINORS AT 33% RATE (Clauses 13 and 24) Summary of proposed amendment Certain distributions of beneficiary income to a child under the age of 16 years will be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. This minor beneficiary rule is aimed at ensuring that families with a trust do not gain a tax advantage over families without a trust. Application date This measure will apply from the start of the 2001-2002 income year. Key features • Beneficiary income distributed to a minor will be taxed at a final rate of 33% when that income is derived from property which was settled on that trust by a relative or guardian of that minor or a person associated with a relative or guardian. (Section HH 3A-3B of the Income Tax Act 1994) • A minor for the purposes of this rule is defined as a person under the age of 16 years. (Section HH 3A) • Beneficiary income will be excluded from the rule in certain circumstances. (Section HH 3B) • The rule will not apply if beneficiary income is $200 or less in an income year. (Section HH 3A) • Beneficiary income subject to this rule will be taxed at the trust level (on behalf of the beneficiary). (Section HH 3A) Background The Government announced in the 2000 Budget that it would introduce legislation this year to require distributions of beneficiary income to minors to be taxed at a rate of 33%. These distributions are currently taxed at the marginal rate of the minor beneficiary, which may be as low as 19.5%. The Government has consulted on this proposal by means of an issues paper outlining the proposal in more detail and seeking public submissions. The purpose of the minor beneficiary rule is to support the Government’s objective of distributing the tax burden equitably through a progressive tax system. Family expenses are normally met from income earned by the parents which has been taxed at their marginal tax rates. However, by placing income-earning assets in a trust and distributing the income to the children as beneficiary income, some families are able to meet their costs out of income taxed at the marginal tax rates of the children. 15 Although this situation undermines the progressiveness of the taxation system, it will often not be within the ambit of the existing anti-avoidance legislation. The incentive to place income-earning assets in a trust has increased since the current trust taxation rules were introduced, in 1988. The difference between the lowest marginal tax rate and the highest has increased, especially with the introduction of the 39% tax rate earlier this year. The example illustrates how trusts can be used to achieve a lower tax rate on family income. Income that would have been earned by the parents and taxed at their marginal tax rates is instead distributed to a child as beneficiary income and is consequently taxed at the child’s marginal tax rate. EXAMPLE 1 – THE TAX LIABILITY OF A FAMILY WITHOUT A TRUST Mum Tax liability $80,000 $40,000$8,070$0-38,000 taxed at 19.5% (income from salary/wages)$38,001-40,000 taxed at 33% $40,000 $14,399$40,000-60,000 taxed at 33% (income from rental properties and dividends)$60,001-80,000 taxed at 39% DadTax liability Income from salary/wages before tax $70,000 $18,569$0-38,000 taxed at 19.5% $38,001-60,000 taxed at 33% $60,001-70,000 taxed at 39% The after-tax income of the family from salary and wages and from rental properties and dividends equals $108,962 16 EXAMPLE 2 – THE TAX LIABILITY OF A FAMILY WITH A TRUST A family with exactly the same income places the income-earning assets of rental properties and shares in a family trust of which their two children are the beneficiaries. MumTax liability Income from salary/wages before tax $40,000$ 8,070$0-38,000 taxed at 19.5% $38,001-40,000 taxed at 33% DadTax liability Income from salary/wages before tax $70,000 $18,569$0-38,000 taxed at 19.5% $38,001-60,000 taxed at 33% $60,001-70,000 taxed at 39% ChildrenTax liability Income from rental properties and dividends distributed to the children as beneficiary income $20,000 child 1$3,900$0-20,000 taxed at 19.5% $20,000 child 2$3,900$0-20,000 taxed at 19.5% The after-tax income of the family from salary and wages and rental properties and dividends amounts to $115,561. Detailed analysis Therefore the family with a trust has an extra $6,599 with which to meet the family’s expenses, even though it has identical income from identical sources as the family without a trust. The scope of the minor beneficiary rule The minor beneficiary rule is not aimed at all situations in which a minor receives beneficiary income, but rather at the particular situation where families can gain a tax advantage by use of a trust. Consequently, the rule will only apply when the beneficiary income of a minor is derived from property which was settled on that trust by a relative or a guardian of that minor or a person associated with a relative or guardian. The existing definition of a “relative” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be adopted for this purpose. Under this section, individuals are regarded as relatives when they are connected by: • blood relationship (which includes persons within the fourth degree of relationship); 17 • marriage (which includes not only persons married to each other but also those with a blood relationship to their spouse); and • adoption. Including settlements made by a person associated with a relative or guardian ensures that settlements made by a family company, for example, are included within the rule. For the purposes of this rule, the existing definition of “settlor” in section OB1 is being amended to ensure that a relative, guardian or his or her associate who provides services to the trust is not deemed to be a settlor. An example would be where damages for the benefit of the child are settled on a trust and the parent of the child provides free accounting services. The minor beneficiary rule will apply to beneficiary income distributed from both discretionary and fixed trusts. It will also apply to beneficiary income distributed from a qualifying, non-qualifying or foreign trust. The definition of a minor The rule will apply only to children under the age of 16 years. In determining whether the rule applies the trustee will look at the child’s age as at the balance date of the trust. If the minor is under the age of 16 throughout the income year, the rule will apply to all income derived in that year. If the minor turns 16 in that income year, the rule will not apply to any income derived in that income year. Distributions of beneficiary income which will be excepted from the rule There are a number of exceptions from the ambit of the rule to ensure that the rule focuses on particular situations where a family can gain a tax advantage by having income distributed as beneficiary income to a child. These include: • beneficiary income derived from property if the settlor received that property as agent for the beneficiary from someone other than a relative, guardian or his or her associate; • beneficiary income derived from property when the settlor has been ordered by a court to pay damages or compensation to the child; • beneficiary income derived from property settled on the trust under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or any variation of these by a court, if the minor was alive within twelve months after the date of the settlor’s death; • beneficiary income from a group investment fund; • beneficiary income distributed to a non-resident minor; • beneficiary income distributed to a disabled minor for whom the Child Disability Allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 1964; and • beneficiary income distributed to minors from the Maori Trustee and Maori authorities. 18 Minimum threshold If beneficiary income would otherwise be subject to this rule but is $200 or less in an income year, the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. If that income is over $200, all of that beneficiary income will be subject to the rule. Operational aspects Beneficiary income subject to this rule will be taxed at the trust level at a final tax rate of 33%, on behalf of the beneficiary. Consequently, beneficiary income subject to this rule will not be included when calculating the minor’s final tax liability. The trustee is required to take all reasonable steps to ascertain whether the minor beneficiary rule applies. If it clearly does apply, or if doubt exists, the trustee must withhold tax on the beneficiary income of that minor at 33% on behalf of the beneficiary. The trustee is required to include the tax withheld on this income in his or her provisional tax payments. If a trustee fails to deduct at 33% from beneficiary income that is subject to the rule, the trustee will be liable for this tax, and penalties will potentially lie with the trustee. If the minor is mistakenly taxed at 33% when he or she should have been taxed at 19.5%, the minor can claim a refund for this additional tax in his or her return. 19 TREATY OF WAITANGI FISHERIES COMMISSION (Clauses 14) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendment treats the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission to be “in the course of termination” when the Commission allocates the fisheries settlement assets to iwi. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that distributions made from tax paid income will not be a distribution subject to resident withholding tax. This amendment will remove the potential for double taxation under the Maori authority rules. Application date The amendment will apply from the date the bill is introduced into the House. Key features A new section, HI 1A, is added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to treat the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission to be “in the course of termination”, on or after the date on which the Commission allocates the settlement assets to iwi, for the purposes of section HI 1(2). Background The role of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission is to administer the fisheries assets that were returned to iwi by the Crown, and to arrange for their eventual allocation to iwi. The Commission was concerned that the “tax paid” income that it intends to distribute to iwi as part of the allocation of fisheries assets would be treated as a distribution by a Maori authority and, therefore, subject to resident withholding tax. The Commission is treated as a Maori authority for tax purposes. The potential for double taxation of Maori authority income is a known problem under Maori authority rules. Double taxation arises because any income that a Maori authority retains for more than four years is subject to tax at the rate of 25%, and when that income is ultimately distributed it would almost always be subject to resident withholding tax at the rate of 33%. The problem of double taxation was inevitable for the Commission because it has been prevented from distributing the fisheries assets until an agreed allocation model for determining how the fisheries assets should be distributed among iwi has been finalised. 20 The proposed amendment resolves the potential for double taxation problem by treating the Commission as being “in the course of termination” when it allocates its fisheries assets to iwi. Under the current Maori authority rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can determine to the extent that distributions made “in the course of termination of a Maori authority” are sourced from income that has previously been taxed to the Commission. Such distributions are not treated as distributions subject to resident withholding tax. This discretion ensures that Maori authority income is not subject to double taxation when a Maori authority is “in the course of termination”. Treating the Commission as being in the course of termination would ensure that distributions that have been previously taxed would not be distributions subject to resident withholding tax. 21 INTERNATIONAL TAX – REMEDIAL ISSUES (Clauses 16, 23, 24 and 25) Summary of proposed amendments Clarifying amendments to the international tax rules are being made to: • Correctly allocate imputation credits between resident and non-resident partners when shares are owned by a partnership. • Ensure that the correct rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) is required to be paid for conduit tax relief credited non-cash dividends. • Allow conduit tax relief to arise when a non-resident holds an interest in a New Zealand company through a wholly owned chain of holding companies. Application date The correction to the conduit relief rules will apply retrospectively from 1 October 1997, the date of the inception of the conduit rules. The other amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features • New sections LB 1(4A) and 4B of the Income Tax Act 1994 ensures that imputation credits are correctly allocated between resident and non-resident partners by recognising the effect of supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit rules. • Sections NG 9(1) and OB 1 are amended to ensure that the 15% rate of NRWT applies to fully conduit tax relief credited non-cash dividends. New section NG 9(1A) confirms that the NRWT required to be paid on the dividend is treated as part of the dividend when determining the extent to which a dividend is fully conduit tax relief credited and for credit allocation purposes • Section OE 8(1) is being amended to treat conduit tax relief holding companies as non-resident companies for section OE 7(1)(b) purposes. Background Tax practitioners have identified the following aspects of the international tax rules when the law is not consistent with its underlying policy intent. 22 • The formula in section LB 1(4) allocates imputation credits between partners when shares are owned by a partnership. However, the formula only allocates credits correctly if all partners are either resident or non-resident, as it does not adequately deal with the effect of supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit rules when there is a mixture of resident and non- resident partners. • Dividends with full conduit tax relief credits are subject to NRWT at a rate of 15%. However, the rules in section NG 9 for determining the amount of NRWT to be deducted in respect of non-cash dividends do not currently reflect this rate. • The conduit tax relief rules relieve a company from New Zealand tax on certain foreign income to the extent that it is derived on behalf of non-resident shareholders. When the rules were introduced, New Zealand holding companies wholly owned by a non-resident were allowed to be treated as non-resident shareholders, to allow the companies they invest in to receive conduit tax relief. It was intended that relief would also be allowed when a non-resident holds an interest in a company through a wholly owned chain of companies. Current legislation does not, however, achieve this effect. Amendments are being made to correct these deficiencies. 23 REQUIREMENT ON COMPANIES TO ADOPT MINIMUM 33% WITHHOLDING TAX RATE (Clauses 20 and 26) Summary of proposed amendment Companies will no longer be able to elect the 19.5 percent resident withholding tax (RWT) rate. The change will remove the timing advantage gained by companies that choose this rate, rather than a 33 percent withholding rate matching the corporate tax rate, before making good the discrepancy by way of provisional or terminal tax. It does not apply to companies that are trustees. Application date This measure applies from 1 April 2001. Key features • A new section NF 2B is inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 providing that companies begin receiving interest on or after 1 April 2001 must notify the interest payer that they are a company. This notification must be made on becoming entitled to receive interest. • Interest payers must deduct RWT at the appropriate rate on or after receiving a notice. The appropriate rate is dependent on the election made by the company and whether it has provided a tax file number. • The current treatment continues to apply until a company notifies interest payers of its status. To minimise compliance costs, the onus of notification lies on the company receiving the interest to determine its status, not the interest payer. • A new section NF 2C provides that those with an entitlement to receive interest as at 31 March 2001 have until 31 May 2001 to notify their company status. Interest payers have one month after the date on which the notice is received to apply that notice. However, provision is made for the interest payer to apply a 33% or 39% withholding rate any time from receipt of the notice. This provision is intended to provide a transitional period during which interest payers can process notifications. • Section NF 2D provides that a company entitled to receive interest payments may elect the 33% and 39% withholding rates. A non-declaration rate of 39% applies to those companies that have not provided a tax file number. The election rules mirror those applying currently, although the 19.5% RWT rate option is excluded. 24 • Companies that are trustees are not required to notify their company status and may continue to use the 19.5% rate. This reflects the obligation on trustees to have regard to the tax position of the trust’s beneficiaries. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 allows a person receiving an interest payment to elect, in the manner proscribed by the interest payer, to make that payment subject to withholding tax at 19.5, 33 or 39 percent. The 2000 Budget included an announcement that the Government would legislate to remove the ability of companies to adopt the 19.5% RWT rate. Choosing this rate gives companies a short-term timing advantage before they make good the discrepancy upon payment of provisional or terminal tax. 25 DEFINITION OF “QUALIFYING PERSON” FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE (Clause 24) Summary of proposed amendment A potential problem in the legislation is being addressed by ensuring that family assistance is provided only to families who have been in New Zealand for 12 months at any time and are resident here for tax purposes at the time of claiming an entitlement to family assistance. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 1992-93 income year. A savings provision has been inserted to ensure that families who have claimed a credit before the date of introduction of the bill are not disadvantaged. Key features The definition of “qualifying person” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be amended to ensure that for family assistance purposes a qualifying person is someone who has been in New Zealand for 12 months at any time and is resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes at the time of claiming an entitlement to family assistance. Background Family assistance consists of family support, the family tax credit, the child tax credit and the parental tax credit and is provided to families who fulfil the eligibility criteria. The definition of “qualifying person” in the family assistance tax credit rules ensures that families who go overseas and are still resident in New Zealand can continue to claim family assistance credits. Examples are armed service personnel in overseas operational areas or peacekeeping roles or volunteer service abroad, or families overseas on business. This definition is too wide, however, and has the effect of potentially providing assistance to families who were once resident in New Zealand and who are now permanently overseas and have no connection to New Zealand. This amendment ensures that family assistance is provided only to those who are resident in New Zealand for tax purposes at the time of claiming an entitlement to family assistance. Families who go overseas and remain resident in New Zealand for tax purposes, such as people serving in the armed services, will remain eligible for these credits. 26 TAX SIMPLIFICATION – MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 4, 5, 17, 24, 29, 31 and 34) Summary of proposed amendments Minor remedial amendments relating to the tax simplification reforms for wage and salary earners implemented from 1 April 1999 are being made to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. They do not involve policy changes. The amendments are intended to clarify the responsibilities of non-filing taxpayers and Inland Revenue’s obligations to those taxpayers by: • ensuring that the legislation does not require non-filing taxpayers to calculate and meet their tax liability; • confirming that the liability to deduct income tax rests with employers, not with employees who are non-filing taxpayers; • confirming that the definition of “non-filing taxpayers” includes those to whom Inland Revenue is not required to, or to whom Inland Revenue is prohibited from sending an income statement; and • clarifying Inland Revenue’s role in relation to non-filing taxpayers who will not receive an income statement. Application date The amendments are intended to work in conjunction with the tax simplification reforms for wage and salary earners and will apply from when those reforms took effect, the 1999-2000 income year. Key features The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 are: • Sections BB 2 and BC 2 are being clarified so that obligations under the core provisions are consistent with the tax simplification reforms. • Section LD 1 is being clarified so that it deals appropriately with credits of tax in relation to non-filers. • “Filing taxpayer” becomes a defined term. • The definition of “non-filing taxpayer” is being amended to spell out Inland Revenue’s role in relation to the income statement process. 27 The amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are: • Section 15B is being expanded to clarify that non-filing taxpayers are not obliged to calculate their tax. • Section 33A is being corrected to reflect Inland Revenue’s role in relation to the income statement process. • A new section 141JA is being inserted to ensure that penalties for non-payment of tax do not apply to non-filing taxpayers. Background The Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 removed the need for individuals to fill out yearly income tax returns if their only income is from wages, salary or New Zealand interest and dividends. Instead, employers were required to supply monthly returns to Inland Revenue on the PAYE deducted for each employee. Over a million taxpayers were affected by the reforms. The remedial amendment in the bill merely finetune that legislation. Changes to Tax Administration Act 1994 31 TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR BUSINESS (Clauses 28, 33, 40, 41 and 42) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to improve voluntary compliance by preventing small failures from creating significant compliance costs. The proposed amendments will: • provide substantial relief from the initial late payment penalty for those who pay a few days late; • cancel incremental late payment penalties where obligations under an instalment arrangements are being met; and • move the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits from GST returns to FBT returns. Application dates The amendments will take effect from 1 April 2002. In particular: • The initial late payment penalty will be applied in two stages for payments that become overdue on or after 1 April 2002. • The incremental late payment penalty cancellation criteria will apply to instalment arrangements entered into on or after 1 April 2002. • FBT returns due after 1 April 2002 will include calculations and payments for GST adjustments for fringe benefits. Key features • Late payment penalties are imposed by section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. That section is being amended to apply the initial late payment penalty in two stages, 1% the day after the due date and a further 4% seven days after the due date. • Section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is also being amended to cancel incremental late payment penalties each month taxpayers comply with their obligations under instalment arrangements. • Three amendments are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to move the return of the GST adjustment for fringe benefits to FBT returns: -Section 20 is being amended so that the output tax associated with the adjustment is no longer part of the calculation of tax payable. 32 -Section 21I is being amended so that where goods and services are supplied or deemed to be supplied in relation to fringe benefits, that supply takes place at the time the fringe benefits are provided or granted to employees. -Section 23A is being amended to require that the GST adjustment is paid with the associated FBT. Background The Less Taxing Tax discussion document, released in September 1999, outlined potential tax simplification measures for businesses. Some of those measures were included in the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill and the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced earlier this year. The initiatives proposed in this bill continue the programme of tax simplification for businesses. Detailed analysis Phased application of the initial late payment penalty An initial late payment penalty of 5% applies when the due date for payment passes. The penalty reinforces a fundamental obligation of the tax system – the requirement to pay taxes by the due date. The penalty will apply: • as a 1% penalty the day after the due date; and • if the amount outstanding is not paid within a week of the due date, as a further 4% penalty of the total outstanding amount. The initiative is in response to the concerns expressed during the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s 1999 inquiry into the powers and operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The penalty was seen as harsh when applied to basically honest taxpayers who have failed to comply by only a few days. The 1999 Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance also expressed similar concerns. Less Taxing Tax outlined a number of initiatives aimed at reducing compliance costs for businesses. In submissions on the discussion document, the initiative to phase the application of the initial late payment penalty received the most support among options to reduce the impact of the penalty. The 1% penalty supports the original due date while not overly penalising those who pay just a few days late. If overdue payments are not paid within a week after the due date, the taxpayer will be in nearly the same position as arises under the current rules. Providing some relief to those who pay just a few days late prevents the penalty becoming disproportionate to the underlying omission. It also reduces the costs associated with applications for remission. 33 Cancelling incremental late payment penalties during instalment arrangements The incremental late payment penalty continues to accrue on outstanding tax even if the taxpayer has entered into an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue to meet the debt. On the successful completion of the arrangement, those penalties are cancelled. If a taxpayer defaults on the terms of the arrangement, however, the whole arrangement is cancelled and all the accumulated incremental penalties that would otherwise have been cancelled are reinstated. As discussed in Less Taxing Tax, the effect of this policy is that a partial, possibly small, failure to comply with the provisions of an instalment arrangement could result in a disproportionate penalty. Removing incremental penalties as taxpayers meet the terms of their instalment arrangements will reduce compliance costs by helping to create a more simple and certain tax treatment for those with overdue tax. It will also reward compliance and prevent the imposition of penalties disproportionate to the underlying failure. Obligations that taxpayers will need to meet in order to have the incremental late payment penalties cancelled include: • paying the agreed instalments by the due date; • paying future payments by the due date; • filing future returns by the due date; and • informing Inland Revenue if their financial circumstances change. GST on the value of fringe benefits Employers are required to account for GST on some fringe benefits they provide because the provision of the benefit is regarded as a supply for GST purposes. This GST adjustment is calculated and returned with the GST return. In order to calculate the adjustment, employers must refer to the value of benefits provided in their FBT return and determine the value of output tax associated with the fringe benefits. As outlined in Less Taxing Tax, the omission to make this adjustment is a common discrepancy identified in GST audits. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that while the omission may be the taxpayer’s fault, the tax system should be designed to minimise the likelihood of its occurrence. Including the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits into FBT returns should reduce compliance costs. While eliminating the risk of an employer forgetting to include the payment in a GST return and thereby incurring penalties for the oversight, it will also reduce the need for employers to keep records to ensure that they correctly account for GST on the fringe benefits that they provide. It should also simplify accounting procedures, because, like fringe benefit tax itself, GST on fringe benefits is an expense. 34 Some taxpayers may be required to make a transitional payment with their first FBT return after 1 April 2002. This will realign the payment of the adjustment with FBT returns from GST returns. Therefore the first FBT return due after 1 April 2002 will include payment for GST adjustments in relation to: • fringe benefits accounted for in that return; and • fringe benefits provided earlier for which an adjustment has not been made in a prior GST return. 35 OFFSETTING USE OF MONEY INTEREST AGAINST UNPAID TAX (Clause 32) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue will be allowed to offset use of money interest payable to a taxpayer (credit interest) against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax before the terminal tax due date. This amendment will reduce a taxpayer’s exposure to debit use of money interest and penalties. Application date Because the rules relating to offsetting credit interest applied from 1 April 1998, this amendment will be retrospective from that date. Key features Section 120F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to allow Inland Revenue to offset credit interest against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax liability at the time an initial assessment is able to be made, that is the date a tax return is filed. This amendment will not prevent taxpayers from requesting that credit use of money interest be paid out directly. Background Under current legislation, Inland Revenue is entitled to apply credit interest against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax only if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax by the due date. This means the tax must first become overdue, exposing the taxpayer to penalties. 36 CANCELLATION OF INTEREST – REMEDIAL AMENDMENT (Clause 35) Summary of proposed amendment A remedial amendment clarifies the period for which taxpayers who receive both a notice of assessment and a statement of account are eligible for a cancellation of use of money interest. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features Section 183C(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to clarify the period for which taxpayers will be eligible for a cancellation of interest when taxpayers make payments of unpaid tax within overlapping grace periods. The period for which interest can be cancelled will begin the day after the date that the first notice or statement is issued and will end on the day that the payment is made, providing the payment is made within the overlapping grace period. Background Taxpayers with unpaid tax who receive either a notice of assessment or a statement of account may be eligible for a cancellation of use of money interest if they pay the full amount outstanding within a defined grace period. In some instances taxpayers may be issued with both a notice of assessment and a statement of account which results in the grace periods overlapping. Current legislation is unclear as to the period for which a taxpayer in this situation is eligible for an interest cancellation. Changes to Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 39 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY (Clauses 21, 28, 36 and 43-49) Summary of proposed amendments To improve the equity of the approved issuer levy (AIL) rules and to ensure more consistent administration with other revenues, amendments are being made to: • apply the compliance and penalty rules to any late payment of AIL, instead of currently imposing non-resident withholding tax (NRWT); • clarify that persons other than the approved issuer may make payments of AIL, and still have NRWT zero-rated; and • allow taxpayers with annual AIL liabilities of less than $500 to make payments six-monthly instead of monthly as at present. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment except: • The amendment to allow persons other than the approved issuer to make payments of AIL and still be zero-rated for NRWT is retrospective to the inception of the AIL rules, 1 August 1991. • A provision in the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that excluded AIL from hardship provisions of the compliance and penalty legislation is being repealed. As the original amendment had an application date of the first day of the 2001-2002 income year, its repeal has the same prospective application date. Key features Sections 86I and 86K(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 are being amended retrospectively to allow persons other than the approved issuer to make payments of AIL, and still be zero-rated for NRWT. Sections 86I and 86M of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, section NG 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and subsections (a)(vii) and (d)(vii) of the definition of “Tax” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being repealed. New sections 86H(2) and 86IA of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 are also being added. These changes will enable the application of the compliance and penalty rules for late payment, rather than the imposition of NRWT. Section 86KA of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 is being added to allow taxpayers with an expected annual AIL liability of $500 or less to make payments every six months, rather every month at present. 40 41 Background Non-resident lenders are liable for tax on interest sourced in New Zealand. This, typically, requires NRWT to be deducted at 10%, consistent with New Zealand’s double tax agreements. Alternatively, the rate of NRWT can be set at zero if resident borrowers choose to pay the approved issuer levy (AIL) at 2% themselves. Before AIL was introduced, in 1991, it was common for New Zealand banks and major corporates borrowing money internationally to have to pay a world interest rate, net of all New Zealand taxes. Although NRWT was meant to be a tax on non- residents on their New Zealand-sourced income, it had essentially become an additional cost, borne by the New Zealand borrower, of raising capital offshore. The approved issuer levy was introduced to minimise this effect. As AIL is applied at a concessionary rate, the policy intent was that it apply only if the borrower complied with strict conditions, including payment on time. Although there was limited scope for late payments to stay within the AIL rules, a late payment of AIL usually meant a reversion to NRWT. A reversion to NRWT was not originally considered a penalty, as in 1991 NRWT was the norm and AIL was a concession. Over time, however, as the payment of AIL has become the norm, the imposition of NRWT has become to be seen as a penalty for late payment out of line with other penalties for late payment. Thus for consistency with all other revenues administered by Inland Revenue, an amendment is being made to incorporate AIL within the compliance and penalty rules. It was always envisaged at the time AIL was introduced that persons other than the approved issuer (borrower) should be able to make payments of AIL, and still comply with the conditions for NRWT to be zero-rated. Tax practitioners have, however, recently highlighted that this is not in fact the case. Consistent with the original policy, an amendment is being made, retrospectively to the inception of AIL, to allow zero-rating of NRWT when a person other than the approved issuer makes the payment of AIL. As a simplification measure consistent with the resident and non-resident withholding tax rules, an additional amendment is being made to allow taxpayers with expected annual liabilities of under $500 to make payments of AIL six-monthly rather than monthly at present.
