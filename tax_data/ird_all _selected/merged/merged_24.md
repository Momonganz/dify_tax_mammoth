The main change is to provide an exemption from income tax for certain non-residents that sell shares in certain unlisted New Zealand companies. Profits from the sale of such shares may currently be taxable if the non- resident has purchased them with the purpose of resale or the proceeds from the shares are a part of the non-resident’s business income. Non-residents will generally be eligible for the exemption if they are resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement and would not be eligible for a credit in their home jurisdiction if the income were taxable in New Zealand – which would generally apply to residents that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction. The new rules also provide that certain foreign funds of funds (FFOFs) will qualify as eligible investors. In a venture capital context, a FFOF pools funds on behalf of a number of international investors and invests the capital in local venture capital funds. The changes will also see the repeal of section HC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This section currently prohibits special partners of special partnerships from offsetting special partnership tax losses against their other income. Section 57 of the Partnership Act 1908, which requires a special partnership to re- register every seven years, is being repealed. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2004. Key features A new exemption is being inserted into section CB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 that removes income tax for certain non-resident venture capital investors that invest in New Zealand. The rules target certain foreign investors that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction and foreign funds of funds. The new exemption applies to the proceeds from the sale of shares in New Zealand-resident, unlisted companies that do not have a number of prohibited activities as their main activity. The current dividend rules will continue to apply to dividends that non-residents derive from eligible investments. 4 The provision that prevents special partners of special partnerships from offsetting partnership losses against their other income (section HC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) will be repealed. Background The term “venture capital” is typically used to describe a variety of private equity investments from funding of new companies and early stage expansion capital to management buy-in and buy-out transactions for established companies. As a rule, venture capital investment concerns investments into unlisted companies. At present, there are no special tax rules for venture capital investment. Therefore a venture capital investor that purchases shares in an unlisted New Zealand company will be taxed on any gains according to ordinary tax concepts. Under these principles, dividends will be taxed as gross income when they are derived, and profits derived on the sale of shares will be taxed if the shares were held on revenue account. Broadly, shares are held on revenue account if they were purchased with the dominant purpose of resale, or if the profits from sale form part of the investor’s business income. The application of these rules to non-resident investors is subject to the provisions of a double tax agreement (DTA) if the non-resident is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. In the context of venture capital investment, our DTAs will not generally remove New Zealand’s ability to tax revenue account share profits. In other words, non-resident venture capital investors investing in New Zealand will be taxed on share profits if they hold the shares on revenue account. The nature of venture capital investing, combined with the capital/revenue distinction, results in complexity and uncertainty for non-residents contemplating venture capital investment in New Zealand. The changes proposed in the bill target non-resident venture capital investors that are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. Non-resident investors will generally be sensitive to such tax if they are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction, since their tax-exempt status will mean that they will not be able to claim, or make use of, a credit for New Zealand tax paid. In the venture capital context this is an important issue because a number of institutional investors that invest in venture capital internationally (such as United States pension funds) are tax-exempt in their home jurisdiction. The new rules use the availability of a tax credit (or other similar compensation) for New Zealand tax paid as a proxy for whether an entity is exempt from tax in its own jurisdiction. This is because of the difficulty in defining entities that are exempt, or effectively exempt, from income tax. 5 It is very common for tax-exempt institutional investors to invest in venture capital opportunities via FFOFs. In a venture capital context, FFOFs pool funds from a number of different investors and invest the capital in a number of different local fund managers. Therefore, to be effective, the new rules accommodate FFOFs that are established and resident in countries that represent the majority of our main investment partners. The preferred method of venture capital investment internationally is through the use of limited liability vehicles that are “flow-through” for tax purposes. This means that any income of the entity is borne by the partners and not taxed at the entity level. To properly facilitate the flow of international venture capital into New Zealand it is necessary to ensure that the special partnership rules that provide limited liability and flow-through treatment properly reflect the way international venture capital is carried out. Therefore section HC 1 of the Income Tax Act is being repealed. This is the provision that currently prevents special partners of a special partnership from offsetting their special partnership tax losses against their other income. The rule was introduced to counter a number of aggressive tax schemes that occurred in the 1980s. It is being repealed because the recently enacted deferred deduction rules (contained in sections ES 1 – ES 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994) should provide the necessary protection against abusive tax schemes. This will be helpful for venture capital investment in New Zealand because it will remove a barrier to local entities investing alongside international venture capital investors. Detailed analysis The venture capital exemption is provided by the addition of new paragraphs (g) and (h) to section CB 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. It provides that the proceeds from the sale of shares by an eligible investor in certain unlisted New Zealand companies will be exempt from income tax if a number of criteria are met. The new provisions do not change the current treatment of dividends that non-residents derive from these companies. Eligible investments (section CB 2(1)(g) and (h)) New section CB 2(1)(g) lists the new criteria under which an amount may qualify as “non-residents’ exempt income” under this provision. To be exempt, an amount must be derived by a qualifying foreign equity investor from the sale of shares in a New Zealand-resident company. The shares in that company must be held for a period of at least 12 months. In addition, the company may not be listed on a recognised exchange for 12 months after the acquisition of the shares, and if listed at the time of acquisition must be de- listed within 12 months. A recognised exchange is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Broadly, it can be described as an exchange market established in New Zealand or anywhere else in the world that exhibits certain criteria that are likely to produce genuine market values for the stock that is traded. 6 The New Zealand resident company must not have a main activity that is one of the activities listed in new section CB 2(1)(g)(iii) or a combination of those activities. This includes a main activity of investing if that investing has as its main aim the derivation of interest, dividends, royalties or lease payments. New section CB 2(1)(h) allows investments into New Zealand-resident companies that invest into companies that meet the criteria outlined above and themselves meet these criteria but for the fact that their main activity is providing capital to other companies (potentially a financial service under the list in section CB 2(1)(g)(iii)). To qualify, the company providing the capital must be in the same wholly owned group as the companies to which it provides the capital and must have as its main activity the provision of capital in the form of debt and equity funding to other companies. All members of the wholly owned group except the company providing the capital must satisfy the criteria of section CB 2(1)(g)(ii) and (iii). Eligible investor (section CB 2(4)) The exemption is available only to certain non-resident investors. A qualifying investor is defined as a “qualifying foreign equity investor”, of which there are two categories. The first targets non-residents that invest directly into New Zealand venture capital opportunities, while the second category targets FFOFs. Investment directly in New Zealand The rules concerning this category of investor are contained in paragraph (a) of the new definition of “qualifying foreign equity investor”. There are two criteria that a person must satisfy in order to qualify as an eligible investor under this category. The first is that the person must be a resident of a country that is listed on a Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1994 (List A). With the exception of Switzerland, this list will contain all countries with which New Zealand currently has a DTA in force. The new rules in section CB 2(7) contain the provisions for including countries on List A. The list will be amendable by Order in Council. The presence of a DTA will allow Inland Revenue to invoke the exchange of information article of the DTA in order to receive information on particular investors and transactions. This will assist Inland Revenue in the administration of the new rules. To be included on the list it will also be necessary for the DTA country to engage in effective exchange of information. It is for this reason that Switzerland will not be included on the list. The second criterion that must be satisfied is that the non-resident investor must be unable to claim a tax credit or other compensation for any income tax that New Zealand tax laws may, but for the exemption in the new section CB 2(1)(g) and (h), have levied on the income. This inability must result from the investor’s special status under the tax laws of its home jurisdiction. This formulation targets investors that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction owing to their special status under the tax laws in their home jurisdiction, rather than their particular circumstances at any point in time. 7 FFOFs The rules concerning this category of investor are contained in paragraph (b) and (c) of the new definition of “qualifying foreign equity investor”. There are two types of FFOFs that can qualify as eligible investors under the new rules. The first is FFOFs that are structured as limited partnerships. To qualify, a limited partnership established in another country must be similar in nature to special partnerships in New Zealand. In other words, it is not a separate legal entity, it provides limited liability status to its limited partners and is flow- through for tax purposes. In addition, the limited partnership must be established under the laws of a country listed on another Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1994 (List B), and all the general partners of the limited partnership must be resident in one of these countries. The countries that will be included on this list are the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Singapore, France, Germany or Canada. The new rules in section CB 2(7) contain the provisions for including countries on List B. The list will be amendable by Order in Council. Furthermore, a limited partnership that meets these qualifications will not qualify as an eligible investor if partners holding 10 percent or more of the limited partnership’s capital are not resident in a country that is on List A. A limited partnership will also not qualify if a limited partner that holds 10 percent or more of the capital does not have the status under the tax laws of its home jurisdiction that makes it unable to claim a tax credit or other compensation for any income tax that New Zealand tax laws may, but for the exemption in the new section CB 2(1)(g) and (h), have levied on the income. This formulation targets investors that are not tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction. The second category of FFOFs consists of entities that have a separate legal status in their home jurisdiction but have the other key characteristics of a limited partnership. These entities can be described as “foreign hybrids”. An example of a foreign hybrid is the limited liability company vehicle established under the United States law. The criteria for a foreign hybrid qualifying as an FFOF are similar to those that apply to qualifying foreign limited partnerships. The main difference concerns the residence of the foreign hybrid. The new rules require a foreign hybrid to be established under the laws of a country specified on List B. The entity may, however, be resident in another List B country, provided that the country of residence treats that entity as being flow-through for tax purposes. Special partnerships At present, section HC 1 prevents special partners of special partnerships from offsetting their special partnership losses against their other income. Instead, it requires that these losses be carried forward and offset against future income of the special partnership. This provision is being repealed. The section will, however, continue to apply to special partnership losses incurred before 1 April 2004. 8 A new rule will permit only special partners to carry forward tax losses related to special partnerships if they earn New Zealand gross income during the year in which the loss is incurred. This new rule will be contained in section IE 1(2B). Amendment to the Partnership Act 1908 Section 57 of the Partnership Act 1908, which requires special partnerships to re- register every seven years, is being repealed. The seven-year re-registration requirement does not reflect the normal life of venture capital funds (which generally exist for 10 to 15 years). The change is of a minor nature and will update the legislation to ensure that special partnerships reflect the way that venture capital investment is carried out internationally. 9 DEDUCTIBILITY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT CONSENT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT GRANTED OR ARE WITHDRAWN (Clauses 10 and 11) Summary of proposed amendment Costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn are to be made deductible. At present, these costs cannot be claimed under the general deductibility rules because they are regarded as a capital expense. Nor can they be depreciated as there is no depreciable asset. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2004-05 income year for applications that are not granted or are withdrawn in that or a subsequent income year. Key features A new section DG 6(1A) is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow deductibility for costs associated with patent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn. Similarly, a new section DJ 14B is being added to allow deductibility for costs associated with resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn. Background Patents and certain consents issued under the Resource Management Act 1991 are depreciable intangible property. To the extent expenditure incurred in applying for a patent or resource management consent results in an application being granted, the costs must be capitalised and depreciated. However, if an application is unsuccessful or is withdrawn, any costs incurred up to that point are not depreciable as there is no depreciable asset. Nor can this expenditure be expensed under the general deductibility rules because it is capital in nature. Under the proposed change, the costs that would have been depreciable if a patent or resource management consent was granted (such as the cost of filing the patent or resource management consent application) would become deductible if the application is unsuccessful or is withdrawn. 10 HORTICULTURAL PLANTS – AMORTISATION AND REPLACEMENTS (Clauses 5, 12, 13, 14, 21, 65(4),(5),(7),(14),(16),(18),(19),(22),(23), 68 and 90) Summary of proposed amendment The Commissioner will be able to determine different amortisation rates for different plants, reflecting their estimated useful lives. Plants listed for this purpose will also qualify under rules for deducting a limited proportion of replacement plants. These new rules provide for greater certainty in law and flexibility for the treatment of replacement plants. The Commissioner will be able to set more accurate amortisation rates, in preference to the current single rate applied to all vines and trees. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2003-04 income year. Key features More accurate amortisation rates: new section DO 4C of the Income Tax Act 1994 will provide for the amortisation of plants at rates determined by the Commissioner, based on the estimated useful lives of plants. Deductible replacement plantings: new section DO 4D will allow replacement planting expenditure as a current-year deduction. In effect, replacements in relation to a maximum of 15 percent of an orchard or vineyard over a three-year period will be treated as repairs and maintenance. Within this limit, replacements in any one year in relation to up to 7.5 percent of an orchard or vineyard will be allowed to be deducted in a current year. This is designed to average out at allowing up to 5 percent of an orchard or vineyard to replaced and deducted in a year. Any other replacements must be capitalised and amortised. Commissioner to list plants and determine amortisation rates: amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 will provide for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to specify the plants that the new replacement and amortisation rules will apply to. Current provisions retained: section DO 4 will continue for vines, trees and other similar plants not covered by the new rules. It will be clarified that plants such as bushes and canes are included in these rules. Background At present, a current-year deduction is allowed only in relation to a vine or tree of the same species and variety that replaces one that has died or been destroyed. The Fruitgrowers Federation raised concerns about this, seeking both a more certain position in law and more flexibility to manage replanting activities using the most commercially desirable varieties without producing different tax effects. 11 SALE AND LEASEBACK OF INTANGIBLES (Clauses 19 and 65) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to ensure that taxpayers entering into transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles such as trademarks do not get deductions for what are, in substance, repayments of loan principal. The proposed amendments are designed to protect the tax base. The tax rules for finance leases, which prevent deductions being taken for the principal amount of a deemed loan, will be amended to ensure that the transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles that cause concern are caught by these rules. Application date The amendments will apply to arrangements entered into on or after the date of introduction of the bill. Key features Amendments to the finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 are being made to ensure that taxpayers entering into transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles do not get deductions for what are, in effect, repayments of loan principal. They: • Clarify that the finance lease rules in sections FC 8A to FC 8I apply to the granting of a licence to use intangible property. This will be achieved by amending paragraph (f) of the definition of “lease” in section OB 1, which applies for the purposes of the finance lease rules. The result of this amendment flows through to the other definitions that use the term “lease” such as “finance lease”, “lease asset”, “lease term”, “lessee” and “lessor”. In the definition of “lease asset”, the personal property that is subject to the licence to use intangible property is the intangible property itself such as a trademark. • Widen the application of paragraph (a) of the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 to include a lease under which ownership of the lease asset is transferred to the lessee or an associate of the lessee at or by the end of the lease term rather than only at the end of the lease term. Consequential amendments will also be made to section FC 8B(2) and (3) to refer to ownership of the lease asset being acquired on or by the date that the lease term ends. 12 • Expand the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 to include a sale and leaseback arrangement under which the lessor has no substantive rights and obligations of ownership, other that those relating to enforcement of the lease agreement. An example of this would be where the lessee or an associate of the lessee had always retained the ability, since the period of previous ownership, to reacquire or control the disposition of the lease asset directly or indirectly. • Clarify that the finance lease rules apply if a feature referred to in the finance lease definition – such as a transfer of ownership to the lessee or an associate or an option granted to a lessee or an associate – is part of the lease arrangement but is not specified in the lease agreement itself. The definition of “lessee” will also be amended by omitting the reference to “hires, or bails”. This reference and a reference to licensing intangible property are unnecessary because reliance can be placed on the reference to “leases”. Section 32 of the Interpretation Act 1999 means that this latter reference has a corresponding meaning to the paragraph (f) definition of “lease”, which will include a hire, bailment or a licence to use intangible property. This amendment will also make the definitions of “lessee” and “lessor” consistent because the latter does not use hire or bailment terminology. Background The government announced in May 2003 that it was concerned about a scheme involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles under which tax deductions are claimed for what are, in substance, repayments of principal under a loan. The government said that it would propose remedial legislation to ensure that such deductions could not be taken. An issues paper was sent to interested parties in October 2003 proposing amendments to the tax rules for finance leases, which limit deductions for leasing arrangements that are essentially financing transactions, to ensure that the transactions causing concern are covered by these rules. Schemes that may allow deductions for repayment of loan principal Described below are the simplified features of a transaction that may allow deductions for what are, in substance, loan principal repayments. A Co, B Co and C Co are associated. A Co sells its trademarks or brand names to a non-resident bank for, say, $20 million (which is non-taxable as any profit is a capital gain). The bank immediately grants to B Co an exclusive licence to use the trademarks for a fixed term in return for annual royalty payments totalling, say, $12 million that are deductible to B Co. B Co grants a sublicence to A Co on the same terms. The bank grants to C Co an option to purchase the trade marks, subject to the bank retaining the right to receive the licence payments from B Co. The exercise price under the option is, say, $11 million, the reduction in value of the trademarks from $20 million reflecting the bank’s right to continue to receive the royalty income from B Co during the licence period. The option is exercised on the date that the bank buys the trademarks and the licence begins, so that the bank pays A Co $20 million 13 for the trademarks and immediately sells them to C Co for $11 million. The bank’s net outgoing is $9 million, which it pays in return for future payments of $12 million. In substance, the transaction is a loan of $9 million from the bank to the group and the bank treats the transaction for tax, regulatory and accounting purposes accordingly. By structuring the loan as a licence, a deduction may be available to B Co for what are, in substance, repayments of the $9 million principal, instead of only the $3 million interest that would be allowed if the transaction were in the form of a loan. This outcome is contrary to the policy intent underlying the tax treatment of debt transactions (and it may be that the tax avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 apply to it). Finance lease rules The Income Tax Act 1994 contains provisions called finance lease rules that, in certain circumstances, recharacterise lease transactions as the purchase of the leased asset by the lessee, with the purchase funded by a loan from the lessor to the lessee. The lessee can depreciate the leased asset (if it is depreciable property) and, instead of obtaining a deduction for lease payments, obtains a deduction under the accrual rules for the interest component of the deemed loan. The treatment of the lessor mirrors that of the lessee – the lessor cannot depreciate the leased asset, and returns as income the interest component of the deemed loan. These rules were introduced in 1982 and revised in 1999. They recognise that certain lease transactions are, in substance, financing arrangements, under which the lessor finances the purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. Broadly, they are triggered when the lease arrangement provides for the transfer of the asset to the lessee or an associate of the lessee, or when the asset is leased for most of its effective life. C Co B Co A Co Associated Companies Annual royalty payment Sublicence Non-resident bank $20m (non-taxable) Sale of trademarks A n n u a l r o y a l t y p a y m e n t s T o t a l : $ 1 2 m i l l i o n L i c e n c e t o u s e $ 1 1 m i l l i o n S a l e o f t r a d e m a r k s C Co B Co A Co Associated Companies Annual royalty payment Sublicence Non-resident bank $20m (non-taxable) Sale of trademarks A n n u a l r o y a l t y p a y m e n t s T o t a l : $ 1 2 m i l l i o n L i c e n c e t o u s e $ 1 1 m i l l i o n S a l e o f t r a d e m a r k s 14 Application of finance lease rules The finance lease rules should, in principle, apply to the transaction described in the example because on the day the lease begins the trademarks are sold to an associate of the lessee – the bank, in fact, owns them only momentarily. The amended finance lease rules would apply in the following way to the transaction in the example. The trademarks are treated as sold from the bank to B Co on the day the lease starts. The bank is treated as giving B Co a loan of $9 million, and B Co is treated as using the loan to purchase the trademark. The interest component of the deemed loan is $3 million (being $9 million consideration payable to B Co less $12 million consideration payable by B Co). This amount is deductible to B Co and spread under the accrual rules. B Co is treated as owning the lease asset (the trademarks) but as trademarks are not depreciable property, there is no depreciation deduction. This treatment accords with the correct policy outcome. 15 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 32) Summary of proposed amendment Medicine Mondiale, the New Zealand Jesuits in India Trust and the Operation Vanuatu Charitable Trust are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2004-05 income year. Key features The following organisations are being added to section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Medicine Mondiale; • New Zealand Jesuits in India Trust; and • Operation Vanuatu Charitable Trust. Background Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1 / 3 percent of the amount donated, to a maximum of $630 a year. Donations by non- closely held companies, and closely held companies which are listed on a recognised stock exchange, qualify for a deduction to a maximum of 5 percent of their net income. Medicine Mondiale This organisation has been established to provide healthcare in developing countries in Africa and Asia. New Zealand Jesuits in India Trust This organisation is engaged in providing healthcare, rural development and education in India. Operation Vanuatu Charitable Trust This organisation provides healthcare in Vanuatu. 16 REBATE FOR EARLY PAYMENT OF INCOME TAX (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces a 6.7% rebate of tax, or “discount”, to encourage individuals who begin receiving self-employed or partnership income to pay tax voluntarily in the year before they begin paying provisional tax. This will relieve the financial strain faced by these taxpayers when they begin paying provisional tax and have two years’ worth of tax payments to make, namely, income tax for the prior year and provisional tax for the current year. Application date The amendment applies from the income year beginning 1 April 2005. Key features A new section MBC is being added to the Income Tax Act 1994 to provide a 6.7% rebate of tax, or “discount”, to individuals who begin receiving self-employed or partnership income, to encourage them to pay tax voluntarily in the year before they become liable for provisional tax. Individuals will be able to choose whether to receive the rebate in their first year of business or in a subsequent year, but they must claim the rebate before they begin paying provisional tax, when qualification ceases. Those who are provisional taxpayers before they begin receiving self-employed or partnership income will not be entitled to the rebate, since they do not face two years’ tax payments in their second year in business. The following example illustrates these points. A taxpayer derives solely business income for a four-year period. The business grows, and in the third year her residual income tax liability (tax not deducted at source) exceeds $2,500 and therefore she becomes a provisional taxpayer. She is required to pay provisional tax in her fourth year in business. Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Income $3,000 $12,000 $25,000 $30,000 Residual income tax liability $450 $1,950 $4,680 $5,730 Become a provisional taxpayer No No Yes Yes Liable to pay provisional tax No No No Yes Entitled to rebate Yes Yes Yes No 17 Taxpayers can claim the rebate once in either of the first three years, as they are not required to pay provisional tax. However, they would maximise the benefit of the rebate by claiming it in the third year in business. If the rebate has not been claimed before the fourth year, entitlement ceases. The rebate will be calculated at the rate of 6.7% of the amount paid during the year or 6.7% of 105 percent of the individual’s end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser. The rebate will be applied against the taxpayer’s end-of-year tax liability for each dollar of tax paid during the year, regardless of the date of payment. If their voluntary payments exceed their end-of-year tax liability, taxpayers will still qualify for the rebate up to a maximum of 105 percent of their end-of-year residual income tax liability. The overpaid amount plus the rebate will be refunded to them or can be offset against other tax owing. The rebate can be claimed only once for a business. However, taxpayers who cease deriving partnership and self-employed income for a period of four years will again qualify for the rebate if they begin a new business. Background The policy intent is to reduce the financial strain that individuals in business face in their first three years in business. Income tax can contribute to this as individuals who begin in business are not required to pay provisional tax in their first year and can end up paying two years’ tax in their second year in business. As part of the government’s growth and innovation strategy, proposals were considered to reduce the compliance costs for small businesses. One such proposal involved providing a rebate of tax to individuals who voluntarily pay tax in the year before that in which they are required to pay provisional tax, thereby aligning the payment of tax with when income is earned. The proposal was included in the government discussion document Making tax easier for small businesses released in September 2003. It received significant support from submissions and from market research undertaken with small and medium-sized businesses. 18 IMPUTATION CREDITS AND TRANSFERS (Clause 36) Summary of proposed amendment Taxpayers will be able to elect that a credit arises to the imputation credit account (ICA) or dividend withholding credit account (DWPA) in certain circumstances when overpaid tax was transferred before the transfer rules came into effect. The amendment provides relief for taxpayers who could have been disadvantaged under the law as it applied before the transfer rules became effective. Application date The amendment will have effect from the start of the 1997-98 year (when the now repealed section MD 4 was introduced) to the date when the section MD 4 was repealed (1 April 2003). Key features The now repealed section MD 4 provided that a credit did not arise to the ICA or DWPA if overpaid tax was transferred. New subsections (2) and (3) are being added to section MD 4. Section MD 4(2) provides that section MD 4(1) does not prevent a credit (called a permitted credit) arising to the ICA or DWPA if: • the transferred tax could have been refunded instead of transferred; and • between the time when the tax which gave rise to the overpayment was paid and the date of the request for the transfer was made, the company suffered a breach in shareholder continuity and a debit arose accordingly to the ICA or DWPA; and • the taxpayer elects that the permitted credit arises. The permitted credit will arise under section ME 4(1)(a) or section MG 4(1)(a) as tax or dividend withholding payment “paid”. For the purposes of those sections, “paid” includes “distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interest of” and, therefore, includes an amount transferred. New subsection (3) provides that the amount of the permitted credit is the amount transferred less the amount of the debit that would have arisen under section ME 5(1)(e) if the overpayment had been refunded. 19 Background The company imputation system ensures that company shareholders are not taxed twice on company income – once in the hands of the company, and again when profits are distributed as dividends. Briefly, companies keep an ICA which records the tax payments made by the company as credits and amounts allocated to dividends as debits. If a company’s ICA has a debit balance at 31 March in any year, the company is liable to pay further income tax. This ensures that imputation credits attached to dividends do not exceed the net amount of tax paid by the company. To ensure that imputation credits are associated with whoever owns the company when the tax is paid, there is a “continuity debit” to the ICA whenever there is a significant change in ownership (direct or indirect) of the company. If a company that has suffered a continuity debit is also due a tax refund for a tax overpayment that arose before the continuity debit, this refund (to the extent of the debit) can still be paid without further affecting the ICA balance. Similar rules apply to dividend withholding payments. The problem that the amendment seeks to resolve is in relation to the now repealed section MD 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. That section ensured that a taxpayer could not take undue advantage of the imputation or dividend withholding payment rules when transferring overpaid income tax or dividend withholding payment to another year or to another tax type (such as PAYE or GST) or to another taxpayer. However, where there had been a prior breach in shareholder continuity, section MD 4 did not work appropriately. 20 Example Company A makes an income tax payment of $100, taking the ICA balance to $100. Subsequently there is a breach of shareholder continuity, leading to a debit in the ICA. Later, it is determined that the $100 is an overpayment and a refund is sought. After the overpaid tax is refunded, the company pays the amount back to Inland Revenue (say, in satisfaction of the next provisional tax payment due). For the purposes of determining whether a refund can be made, the balance in the ICA can be increased by the breach of continuity debit of $100 under section MD 2(4). Therefore the refund could be made in this case. A second debit relating to the refund is recorded only if the refund is greater than the breach in continuity debit (section ME 5(1)(e)(iii)). Therefore no further debit would arise to the ICA when the refund is made. When the refund had been subsequently paid back to Inland Revenue for offset against the next provisional tax liability, a credit would arise in the ICA for the payment: Imputation credit account Transaction Debit Credit Balance Payment $100.00 $100.00Cr Breach in shareholder continuity $100.00 Nil Refund Nil Nil Payment of provisional tax $100.00 $100.00Cr Under current law, section MD 4 denies the second imputation credit if a transfer was made instead of a refund and repayment. Generic transfer rules introduced in 2002 produce a better result than section MD 4, so section MD 4 was repealed by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Detailed analysis Section MD 4(2) will be satisfied if: • a company was entitled to a refund of overpaid income tax (section MD 2(4)); and • a company requested a transfer of that overpaid tax; and • a breach of shareholder continuity occurred between the time when the tax that led to the overpayment was paid and the time the transfer was requested; and 21 • a credit would have arisen to the ICA if the: – overpayment had been refunded; and – the refunded amount had been repaid in satisfaction of a tax liability that would have caused a credit to apply to the ICA; and • the company requests that section MD 4(2) and (3) apply to the transfer. New subsection (3) provides that the amount of the permitted credit is the amount transferred less the amount of the debit that would have arisen under section ME 5(1)(e) if the overpayment had been refunded. Example Company B’s ICA balance at 31 March 2000 is $100. A breach in shareholder continuity occurs on 30 June 2000. As a result, a debit arises to the ICA of $100, and the ICA balance is now nil. Company B pays tax of $50 on 7 July 2000, bringing the ICA balance to $50. On 30 April 2001 an income tax overpayment of $150, which arose before the breach in shareholder continuity, is identified. Company B applied to have $150 transferred to 2002 provisional tax. This was done, but under section MD 4, as it applied in 2001, no credit arose to the ICA for the transfer. At that stage there was no provision that allowed a debit to arise relating to a transfer of overpaid tax. In 2004 Company B requests that subsections MD 4(2) and (3) be applied. Under section MD 4(3) the permitted credit will be the amount transferred less the debit that would have arisen if the amount transferred had been refunded instead of transferred. Section ME 5(1)(e)(iii) provides that a debit arises to the ICA when a refund is made, except to the extent of a debit that arose upon a previous breach in continuity. In the example, a previous debt of $100 arose upon a breach of continuity. Therefore, had $150 been refunded, the debit that would have arisen to the ICA would have been $50. Accordingly, the permitted credit will be the amount transferred ($150) less the debit that would have arisen under section ME 5(1)(e)(iii) if the transferred tax had been refunded ($50). The permitted credit is, therefore, $100. Entries to the ICA would be: Imputation credit account Transaction Debit Credit Balance Balance 31 March 2000 $100 Breach in shareholder continuity $100 Nil Payment 7 July 2000 $50 $50 Transfer nil $50 Permitted credit $100 $150 This is the result that would have occurred had the overpaid tax been refunded and repaid. 22 “PAYE BY INTERMEDIARIES” RULES – FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS (Clauses 54, 55, 56, 57, 65(17), 65(37), 101, 111, 112, 113 and 114) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces amendments to the recently enacted “PAYE by intermediaries” rules to further improve their operability. The rules allow accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employer’s obligations under the PAYE rules (calculate PAYE, pay it to Inland Revenue and file PAYE returns). The changes: • allow PAYE intermediaries to make payments of net salary and wages directly to employees’ bank accounts (from an employer’s account) provided the associated PAYE is simultaneously transferred, or is transferred before the payment to employees is made, into an intermediary’s trust account; • clarify that “officer” in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules means a director, secretary or statutory officer; and • require PAYE intermediaries to represent at least ten employers. Application date The amendments will become effective from the application date of the “PAYE by intermediaries rules” – pay periods beginning on and after 1 April 2004. Key features Sections NBB 2(1)(c) and 2(4)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 are being amended to clarify that an “officer” means a director, secretary or statutory officer. Section NBB 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being replaced and new section NBB 5(1B) added to give greater flexibility to PAYE intermediaries in how they can make payments to employees. When the gross pay of employees is not transacted through a PAYE intermediary’s trust account, replacement section NBB 4(1)(a) requires employers to make available sufficient funds to a PAYE intermediary to cover both employees’ net salary and wages and the PAYE. New section NBB 5(1B) then requires a PAYE intermediary, when making payments of net salary and wages directly to employees, to transfer the associated PAYE into the trust account simultaneously (or transfer the PAYE before the payment to employees is made). As a result, a number of consequential amendments are required, including the addition of a new section NBB 4(1B), changes to sections NBB 4(2), NBB 4(3), NBB 4(4)(c) and (d), NBB 5(1), NBB 5(2B) and NBB 6(2) and changes to sections 120OB(1), 141JB(1), 167(2B), 168(4) and 169(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 23 The definition of “PAYE intermediary” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to require PAYE intermediaries to represent at least ten employers. Background An amendment is required to provide greater flexibility to PAYE intermediaries in how they make payments to employees. At present, the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules require employers to deposit the gross salary or wages of employees into a trust account operated by the intermediary. The intermediary is then responsible for disbursing the deposited funds – for example, net pay to employees and PAYE to Inland Revenue. However, the current model could result in a number of unnecessary risks and transactions costs being incurred by prospective intermediaries. To address those concerns, an amendment is proposed to allow PAYE intermediaries to make payments of net salary and wages directly into employees’ bank accounts (from an employer’s account) provided the associated PAYE is simultaneously transferred, or is transferred before the payment to employees is made, into an intermediary’s trust account. The amendment will also cover third party deductions from employees’ net salary and wages (such as health insurance premiums and social club fees). Employers and PAYE intermediaries will, however, still have the option of using the trust account for gross salary and wages, if so desired. An amendment is also needed to clarify the term “officer” in the context of the accreditation requirements in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules. The intent of the rules is to ensure that directors and other statutory officers of entities wanting to be accredited as PAYE intermediaries are of suitable character for the role (such as not having been convicted of offences involving fraud) rather than the requirement applying to all employees, many of whom will have no direct role in the PAYE intermediary function. However, with the current lack of a definition for “officer” in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules, the potential exists for employees, generally, to be classified as “officers” for the purposes of accreditation. An amendment is therefore proposed to define the term “officer” in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules to have the same meaning as the definition of that term in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “officer” is defined in section 3 as being a director, secretary, or other statutory officer of a corporate body. Finally, an amendment is needed to reduce the risk of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules being abused by entities registering as intermediaries who do not intend to represent any employers. The rules, as currently drafted, have created incentives to do so. An amendment is therefore proposed requiring PAYE intermediaries to act on behalf of a minimum of ten employers. 24 REDUCTION OF NON-DECLARATION RATE FOR NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE COMPANIES (Clause 59) Summary of proposed amendment Employers who make withholding payments to non-resident contractors are required to withhold tax from the payments. This amount is increased if the contractor makes no declaration. An amendment reduces this non-declaration rate to a more reasonable rate for companies. Application date The amendment will apply to withholding payments made on or after 1 April 2005. Key features Section NC 7(2) provides if a person who is making a withholding payment has not received a withholding declaration from the contractor that person must increase the amount withheld by 15%. Section NC 7(2) is being amended to change the non-declaration rate for companies. A special provision will apply to non-resident contractors, as that term is defined in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, that are companies. The extra amount that needs to be withheld in the absence of a withholding declaration is being reduced to 5%. A specific anti-avoidance rule is being added to the provision. It is intended to prevent abuse of the reduction in the rate applicable to non-resident contractor companies by individuals re-characterising themselves as companies. Background Withholding payments made to non-resident contractors are subject to the non- resident contractors’ withholding tax. Non-resident contractors are required to make a withholding declaration under the Income Tax Act 1994. If no declaration is made an extra withholding payment is imposed. The amendment reduces the amount that has to be withheld if the non-resident contractor is a company and it does not make a declaration. The reason for lowering the rate is that companies will have overheads while carrying out contract activities in New Zealand. Consequently, the net amount earned by non- resident companies in most cases will be significantly lower than their gross earnings, to which non-resident contractors’ withholding tax applies. A lower total withholding tax rate of 20%, if no tax code declaration is made, is more appropriate for non- resident contractors that are companies, to reflect the typical difference between net and gross earnings. 25 RWT ON USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST (Clause 62) Summary of proposed amendment Provisions are being introduced to remove the Commissioner’s obligation to deduct resident withholding tax (“RWT”) from use-of-money interest (“UOMI”) paid to a taxpayer in respect of overpaid tax. Deducting RWT from UOMI paid by the Commissioner has proved overly complex for taxpayers, especially in relation to RWT credits. The proposed amendment will reduce these compliance costs faced by taxpayers and will also result in a small administrative saving to Inland Revenue. Application date The amendment will apply to interest payable as of 1 April 2005. Key features An amendment is being made to section NF 1(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994, excluding UOMI paid by the Commissioner from being subject to the RWT rules. Sections NF 1(2)(a)(x), NF 1(3) and (3A) are being repealed, as they will become unnecessary as a result of this amendment Under the proposed amendment, UOMI paid by the Commissioner will no longer be subject to withholding at source, although it will still be gross income for tax purposes. It will become part of the taxpayer’s residual income tax calculation and will either be added to the taxpayer’s provisional tax payments or paid at the terminal tax date. Background When UOMI paid by the Commissioner was introduced, it was considered appropriate that it should be assessable and subject to the RWT rules. This ensured that from the taxpayer’s perspective, UOMI paid by the Commissioner was treated, as much as possible, like interest received from a bank. In practice, however, it has resulted in an overly complex system with significant compliance costs for taxpayers and increased administrative costs to Inland Revenue. 26 INCORPORATED SOCIETIES (Clauses 65(26), 65(29), 65(30), 67 and 142) Summary of proposed amendments Incorporated societies will be allowed to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group. They will also be allowed, for a limited period, to offset income and losses against those of their commonly owned incorporated societies. The amendments ensure that incorporated societies that are treated as companies for tax purposes can avail themselves of the same rules that allow other corporate entities to carry forward losses and offset them against those of companies in the same group. Application date The amendment allowing incorporated societies to carry forward losses and offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group will have two application dates. In relation to the carry forward of tax losses, the amendment will apply from the 1992-93 income year. In relation to the offsetting of income and losses by incorporated societies and companies that are in the same group, the amendment will apply from the 1992-93 income year, but only if the relevant assessment for tax is not affected by the time bar under sections 107A(1) or 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendment relating to the offsetting of income and losses between commonly owned incorporated societies will apply from the 1997-98 income year to the 2002-03 income year if the incorporated societies have taken this tax position in relation to tax returns filed for those years. Key features The definition of “special corporate entity” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to include any body incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 that has no shares on issue to the members of the society. This will allow incorporated societies to be treated as “special corporate entities” and, therefore, able to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses, against those of companies in the same group, despite the fact that they do not issue shares. New section OD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 will allow incorporated societies to offset income and losses against those of their commonly owned incorporated societies. Although the application of this provision will be limited to the income years 1997-98 to 2002-03, it will provide that if shares have been issued by the incorporated society, it will be deemed to have issued shares to its members and those shares will carry all the shareholding decision-making rights. The result is that a voting interest is created that can be used for the purposes of subpart IG of the Act. 27 Background Under current legislation, incorporated societies, cannot carry forward tax losses or offset their income or losses against the income or losses of companies in the same group. Incorporated societies that do not issue shares cannot satisfy the ordinary shareholder continuity test, and they cannot be exempted from this requirement because they do not fall within the definition of “special corporate entity”. Including these incorporated societies within the definition is seen as the most practical solution. Extending the definition of “special corporate entity” to include these incorporated societies will not allow commonly owned incorporated societies to offset their income and losses. Special corporate entities are treated as “notional persons” and are, therefore, unable to group with commonly owned entities. A separate provision is required, therefore, to allow commonly owned incorporated societies to offset their income and losses within a group structure. 28 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendments The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2004-05 income year. In the 2004-05 income year, new tax rates will apply to the income of Maori authorities and to some specified superannuation contributions. Application date The provision will apply for the 2004-05 income year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2004-05 income year will be set at the rates specified in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The rates in Schedule 1 that apply for the 2004-05 year vary from those that applied for the 2003-04 year in the following ways: • A rate of 19.5% now applies to Maori authorities. • Two new progressive rates of specified superannuation contribution withholding tax apply if an employer has made an election under section NE 2AB of the Income Tax Act 1994. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax to be fixed by an Act of Parliament from time to time. It has been a long-standing practice of Parliament to confirm for each income year that the rates of income tax are the basic rates specified in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The new Maori authorities rate was inserted into Schedule 1 by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The new rates of specified superannuation contribution withholding tax were inserted into Schedule 1 by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 29 INFORMATION-MATCHING (Clauses 70(7), 70(8), 72, 73 and 74) Summary of proposed amendment Student allowance recipients (or the partner of a student receiving the married student allowance rate) will be included in the data exchanges which currently take place between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development to identify those in employment and/or to locate those who have an amount payable to the Ministry. In addition, the information which Inland Revenue may supply to the Ministry regarding beneficiaries or student allowance recipients in employment will be increased. The purpose of the information-matching is to identify any overpayments of student allowances. Application date The amendments will apply from the date on which the bill is enacted. Key features The secrecy provisions in sections 81, 82 and 85 of the Tax Administration Act are to be amended to include student allowance recipients (or the partner of a student receiving the married student allowance rate) in data matches between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development to establish whether they have been working while in receipt of an allowance. That information will be used by the Ministry to establish whether entitlement to the allowance had ceased due to the level of the recipient’s (or partner’s) income. A further change to the Tax Administration Act increases the information which Inland Revenue may supply to the Ministry regarding beneficiaries or student allowance recipients in employment to include their: • employer’s telephone number and/or e-mail address; • tax code; and • name and date of birth. This additional information will enhance the accuracy of the match and thus reduce unnecessary contact with beneficiaries, students and their employers. 30 Background Student allowances are paid by the Ministry of Social Development. There is a cap on the amount of income that recipients (or their partner) may earn while in receipt of an allowance. This is similar to the position of beneficiaries who may only earn a set amount before their benefit begins to abate. A data exchange already takes place between the Ministry and Inland Revenue to identify beneficiaries in the work force. The Ministry uses this information to carry out further checks to ensure that the benefit is being paid at the correct level. Another data match takes place to locate people who have an amount payable to the Ministry. 31 DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCESS (Clauses 9, 34, 70, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 95, 97, 99, 102, 104, 129, 134, 141, 143 and 144) Summary of proposed amendments The environment within which tax disputes are resolved is critical to maintaining an efficient tax administration. The current process for resolving disputes, introduced in 1996, followed recommendations made by Sir Ivor Richardson as part of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department. 1 The main objective of the disputes process is to have legislation and administrative practices which encourage disputes to be dealt with fairly, efficiently and quickly before they get to court. As part of the generic tax policy process, a post-implementation review of the disputes process was undertaken. Following the July 2003 discussion document Resolving Tax Disputes: A legislative Review, the amendments proposed in the bill further improve the framework within which tax disputes are resolved, to ensure that the process is meeting its objectives. To provide greater certainty and consistency for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers in relation to their returns, the amendments clarify the timeframes for claiming refunds in relation to goods and services tax and income tax. Application date The amendments to the disputes procedure will apply to disputes commenced under Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on or after 1 April 2005, the time of commencement usually being the issue of a notice of proposed adjustment by either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer. Amendments to timeframes within the process (the response periods) will apply to notices issued on or after 1 April 2005. If that response period relates to a GST return, the amendments apply to notices issued in relation to GST return periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. Amendments relating to income tax refunds and the Commissioner’s statute bar period for amending assessments will apply from the 2004-05 income tax year. The amendment relating to GST refunds will apply for GST return periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. Amendments relating to situations where an assessment can be issued without starting the disputes process apply to assessments for which notices are issued on or after 1 April 2005. Amendments to the challenge procedures apply from the date of enactment. 1 Organisational Review of the Inland revenue Department; Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994. 32 Key features Completing the process Proposed amendments which ensure that the various steps required to facilitate the resolution of a dispute are completed as the legislation intended include: • clarifying that the Commissioner must, other than in prescribed circumstances, apply all the legislated steps of a dispute (proposed new section 89N Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)); • replacing the current six-month period within which the parties may agree to extend the time available for a dispute with a 12-month period (section 108B); and • expanding the circumstances in which a document that is provided late by the taxpayer will be accepted by the Commissioner (amending section 89K). Ensuring the process is efficient and cost-effective To ensure that the disputes resolution process is accessible to taxpayers, the costs incurred in preparing the various documents should be no greater than is necessary for each particular case to meet this objective, proposed amendments include: • simplifying the documentation required by both parties to progress a dispute (amended sections 89F and 89G); • extending the time for taxpayers to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment from two months to four months (amendment to the definition of “response period” in the TAA); • introducing an accessible small claims process which includes raising the threshold for such cases from $15,000 to $30,000 and clarifying that a “precedent” case is one that has wider implications for other taxpayers (sections 13B of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, 89E of the TAA and regulation 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998); and • allowing the disputes process to be stayed pending the outcome of a test case if both parties agree (proposed new section 89O). The provision of clear, consistent timeframes in the context of tax administration is necessary to achieve certainty and finality in respect of a taxpayer’s tax affairs. To achieve this, the timeframes within which tax refunds are allowed (sections MD 1(1), MD1(2) and MD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 45 of the GST Act) are being amended to provide for a four-year refund period, unless the taxpayer has made a clear mistake or oversight, when the period will remain eight years. Refunds arising in other circumstances will be limited to four years. If a taxpayer is retrospectively claiming a GST input tax deduction in circumstances where the issue may be more complex and/or disputable – for example, one arising from new case law or a new interpretation that the taxpayer had not previously considered – a period of two years will be allowed. The taxpayer’s ability to claim an input tax credit in a current period return relating to a past transaction will be retained for straightforward cases, such as those involving a clear mistake or simple oversight. 33 Background Over the last decade a broad package of tax administration reforms has been introduced in response to developments such as increased technology and self- assessment. The areas of reform included: • compliance and penalties legislation; • binding rulings; • a progressive rewrite of the income tax legislation; • the introduction of legislation supporting taxpayer self-assessment; and • tax simplification, including removal of the requirement for most wage and salary earners to file returns. It was within this environment of tax administration reform that the disputes resolution process was introduced, in 1996, in response to the recommendations of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, which was chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson. The disputes procedures at that time were perceived as deficient in that they did not adequately support the early identification and prompt resolution of issues leading to tax disputes. A new disputes resolution process was subsequently introduced to address these concerns. The objective of the disputes process is, therefore, to deal with any disputes over tax liability fairly, efficiently and quickly. The early resolution of disputes is intended to be achieved through a series of steps prescribed in legislation, the main elements of which are: • A notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). This is a notice by either the Commissioner or a taxpayer to the other that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s self-assessment. • A notice of response (NOR). The NOR is a notice of response issued by the party receiving the NOPA if they disagree with the NOPA. • A disclosure notice and statement of position (SOP). A disclosure notice triggers the issue of a SOP. A SOP contains the detailed facts and legal arguments to support the position taken and again is issued by both parties. It is an important document because it limits the parties to their respective facts and arguments if the case goes to court – this is referred to as the “evidence exclusion rule”. The prescribed documents are intended to encourage an all “cards on the table” approach to dispute resolution that ensures that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court. There are also two administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. The conference is a relatively formal meeting between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer which aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. Adjudication involves the independent consideration of the dispute by Inland Revenue and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer’s assessment is amended. 34 Commissioner-initiated dispute Taxpayer who is required to file return must make an assessment CIR issues NOPA? s 89B(1) May elect small claims jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authority Taxpayer issues NOR rejecting NOPA s 89G(1)?

The purpose of the discussion document was to ensure that the government’s objective of making the dispute resolution procedure fairer, faster and generally more efficient was being supported by the legislation. The review therefore focused on particular ways in which the legislative process could be improved for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. It recognised, however, that the process for resolving disputes is dependent on efficient administrative practices and noted that Inland Revenue is undertaking a separate review of these practices. The document covered five broad subject areas: • the need for the Commissioner to follow the full process set out in the legislation; • the content and the level of detail of the various documents required by the Commissioner and the taxpayer during the dispute; • the increasing incidence of taxpayers seeking to adjust their own returns in relation to issues that are likely to be disputed; • providing certainty regarding timeframes, including timeframes for GST; and • miscellaneous issues. The measures proposed in this bill aim to ensure that the administration is operating efficiently at the lowest possible cost and to promote voluntary compliance as a result of disputes being handled fairly and resolved promptly. Detailed analysis Completing the process – new section 89N The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which to amend a taxpayer’s assessment following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. The assessment is amended following the disputes process and the intention at the time the legislation was introduced was, therefore, that the various steps involved in the process would be undertaken within the four-year period. Owing to the manner in which it has been possible to apply the disputes process the various steps in the process have not been completed as the legislation intended in all cases. To address this, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be required to follow the legislated steps of the disputes process, other than in specific circumstances. These circumstances are where: • the dispute involves alleged criminal matters; • a taxpayer involved in a dispute, or an associated person of the taxpayer, may take steps as to the location of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax; 37 • the taxpayer has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute or an associated person of the taxpayer involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings; • the taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory obligation or a request for information relating to the dispute; • the taxpayer elects to have the dispute heard by the Taxation Review Authority acting in its small claims jurisdiction; • the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or the Taxation Review Authority without the completion of the disputes process; • the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case; and • the Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time for completion of the dispute, or to allow the disputes process not be completed. If any of the excepted circumstances apply the Commissioner will be entitled to issue an assessment without completing the disputes process. The exception relating to the location of the taxpayer’s assets is designed to address situations where a taxpayer or associated person of the taxpayer may seek to dispose of assets which may be required to meet an outstanding tax liability, and the issue of an assessment becomes urgent. The exception for judicial review proceedings reflects that the parties’ resources may be directed away from progressing the dispute through the process towards addressing the facts and issues in the judicial review application. Failure by a taxpayer to comply with a request for information if that information is necessary to resolve the dispute or to comply with another matter relating to the dispute may, similarly, delay the progression of the dispute within the four-year time bar. An order from the High Court may be sought if the Commissioner considers that there are reasonable grounds, other than those specifically prescribed, for not following the full statutory process. Whether or not there were reasonable grounds could depend, for example, on the complexity of the issues, whether the taxpayer had caused prolonged delays and whether there were significant matters that were unforeseen by either party that provided a justification for delay. The remaining exceptions in section 89N are relatively self-explanatory: alleged criminal activities may mean the Commissioner needs to act quickly; the small claims process is a simpler separate process; and an agreement between the parties not to follow the full process, either when there is a test case or for other reasons, allows the parties to reduce compliance and administrative costs in smaller or more straightforward disputes. 38 The new section will not affect the Commissioner’s ability to agree to make an adjustment to an assessment in cases of clear mistake or oversight, for example. Therefore the Commissioner will still be able to amend an assessment under section 113 (which contains the general power to amend assessments) subject to new section 89N. Disclosure notices – section 89M A disclosure notice is a simple document which triggers the application of the “evidence exclusion” rule. The rule restricts what the Commissioner and the disputant may raise in a court challenge to matters raised in their respective statements of position. The policy behind the introduction of the evidence exclusion rule into the disputes process was to ensure that the parties to the dispute had all the information necessary to facilitate resolution before the case got to court. To protect witnesses in sensitive cases, the Commissioner was therefore given the discretion not to issue a disclosure notice so that the evidence exclusion rule would not apply. However, the application of this discretion is uncertain. An amendment to section 89M will require that disclosure notices must be issued, except in situations where the Commissioner does not have to complete the disputes process. To address the consequential issue with regard to the protection of witnesses, new subsection 89M(6B) will clarify that “evidence” when referring to the evidence exclusion rule will refer to the available documentary evidence and does not include a list of witnesses or types of witnesses. Therefore witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. The amendment will also provide more flexibility at the stage where cases need to be prepared before they go to court. The documentation required as part of the disputes process – sections 89F and 89G The content of the notice of proposed adjustment is prescribed in section 89F. The amended section 89F requires that both documents issued by the taxpayer or the Commissioner must contain sufficient detail to identify the issues arising and be in the prescribed form. The section then details what further requirements are necessary, depending on whether the document is issued by the Commissioner or the taxpayer. Subsection 2 requires the Commissioner to identify the adjustments and state concisely the facts and law relevant to the adjustment and how the law applies to the facts. The term “concisely” is intended to convey a document that is relatively brief but at the same time covers all the issues relevant to the dispute. One of the main reasons taxpayers may choose to initiate a NOPA is to eliminate their exposure to shortfall penalties. At present, a taxpayer can file a return on a conservative basis and then file a NOPA on a less conservative basis. As penalties are calculated by reference to the tax position taken in a self-assessment, rather than in a NOPA, the risk of shortfall penalties applying is reduced. Subsection 3 requires the taxpayer NOPA to contain a clear and detailed statement of the facts and law and copies of all material documentary evidence that the taxpayer is aware of at the time the notice is issued in support of the claim. 39 The need for the taxpayer to provide more detail than the Commissioner in a NOPA was highlighted in chapter 5 of the July 2003 discussion document. The main advantage of the proposal is that, because of the greater level of detail that will be required, potential disputes may be resolved at an earlier stage – ideally, without the need for further investigation. The document issued in response to a NOPA by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer will require that the parties state concisely the facts, law and arguments the issuer of the notice of response considers to be wrong in the NOPA and the reasons for this. They must also state any facts and legal arguments relied on by the issuer of the response notice and how those arguments apply to the facts. These amendments will ensure that there is a balance between allowing some flexibility for taxpayers and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in preparing the documents, so that costs are reduced, and ensuring that both parties have all the information required to adequately address the issues raised in the dispute. The requirement that the legal arguments are applied to the facts will ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement which appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document but is, rather, a logical conclusion. Timeframe for taxpayer-initiated notice of proposed adjustment – definition of “response period” In recognition of the requirement on taxpayers to provide detailed information to the Commissioner when they initiate a dispute, the definition of “response period” is being amended to give taxpayers four months, instead of the current two months, to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment. The period will apply from the date a taxpayer’s notice of assessment is received at an office of Inland Revenue. In the definition of “response period”, the provision of a two-month period starting on the date of issue of a notice from the disputant rejecting an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner is being removed because it is redundant. Four-year time bar waiver period – section 108B The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which to amend a taxpayer’s assessment following an investigation of the taxpayer or in certain other circumstances. Currently, taxpayers may agree to extend this four-year time bar by up to six months if more time is required to complete the disputes process. The extension takes the form of a waiver, which must be in the prescribed form and signed and delivered to the Commissioner by a taxpayer before the expiry of the relevant four-year period. The existing time bar waiver period of six months is problematic because in some cases six months is insufficient to complete the process, and taxpayers are reluctant to grant the waiver because of the risk that Inland Revenue may identify new issues during the waiver period. 40 The amendment extends this six-month period to 12 months to provide sufficient time to complete the disputes process in cases where this time is needed. Again, the extension will apply only when the parties agree. In addition, the Commissioner will not be able to raise new issues during the waiver period that are not identified and known to both parties before the start of the period. The statute bar override – section 108(2) The four-year time restriction for the Commissioner to amend a taxpayer’s assessment does not apply if the taxpayer has acted fraudulently or has omitted to include income of a particular nature or source in a tax return. For the provision relating to the omission of gross income to operate effectively, the amount of tax at stake would need to be taken into account, as was suggested in the case of Babington v CIR. 2 This limitation is not, however, expressly provided for in the legislation. If a taxpayer overstates an expense claim or tax deduction in a tax return, however, an exception to the four-year period may not apply, even though the overstatement is material and might, in certain situations, be classed as tax avoidance. To clarify the application of this provision, the omission of income will need to be material. A further exclusion to the statute bar will be added to cover instances of the taxpayer materially overstating deductions. An exception for overstated deductions was not seen in the past as necessary because taxpayers would file full information on deductions claimed in their returns which would then be audited by Inland Revenue. This is no longer the case, since taxpayers must now self-assess their own income tax liability. Taxpayers are now charged with the responsibility to ensure their assessment is correct and that they have complied with all obligations imposed on them by the tax laws. The amendment in relation to materially overstated deduction is consistent with these responsibilities. Timeframes for refunds of excess tax and GST input credits If tax has been paid in excess, the excess amount is refunded to the taxpayer. The refund cannot be made after eight years from the year in which the original assessment was made. The long period for refunds was established in the 1950s, in an era when the administrative environment was based on assessments made by the Commissioner. Taxpayers are able to claim in a current period return GST input tax credits which have not been previously deducted. The time within which these claims may be made is unspecified but is practically limited by the seven-year statutory period for which business records must be retained. 2 \[1957\] NZLR 861 (CA). 41 Neither the general refund period nor the timeframe for claiming GST input tax credits differentiates clearly between cases of obvious mistake or error. Nor do they differentiate clearly cases where the refund or claim may be more disputable, such as those where the taxpayer seeks to apply an argument based on new case law or a new interpretation. The current position in relation to GST input tax claims and the long period for refunds of overpaid GST and income tax is not appropriate because the government is exposed to a significant but unquantifiable revenue risk from large, backdated refund claims. Nor do the current rules provide the certainty for taxpayers and the government that is consistent with a modern tax administration. Importantly, also, an eight-year period is inconsistent with the Commissioner’s four-year statute bar period and, as a result, can cause confusion. Therefore the refund provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 (sections MD1(1), MD1(2) and MD1(3)) and section 45 Goods and Services Act 1985 are being amended to limit the eight year refund period to four years, with the Commissioner being able, in the case of clear mistakes and simple oversights, and for rebate claims, to extend the period to eight years. Retaining the eight-year period in cases of clear mistake and simple oversight protects existing taxpayer rights to refunds. The proviso to section 20(3) of Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is being amended to limit the circumstances in which a GST input credit can be claimed in the current period return to those situations where a tax invoice has not been obtainable or where there has been a clear mistake or simple oversight. Allowing these kinds of adjustments to be made in the current year return prevents the compliance costs that taxpayers might otherwise face if they continually had to amend past returns. The amendment limits to its intended scope the existing taxpayer right to claim GST input credits in current period returns. When there is a disputable GST input credit claim – for example, when the taxpayer’s ability to claim is backdated following arguments based on new case law or a new interpretation – section 89DA(1) of the TAA 1994 is being amended to provide for a two-year period within which the taxpayer must initiate a dispute to the GST return. The adjustment must be made in the return to which the transaction relates – not the current period return. This restriction will not apply to cases of clear mistake or simple oversight referred to in the proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act. This two-year period for GST input tax claims can be compared with other instances where taxpayers initiate a dispute to their GST return, or to their income tax return when the taxpayer NOPA period is four months. The difference is justified as it takes into account the need for taxpayers to reconcile GST against their financial accounts annually and the fact that claiming GST input tax credits may depend on a taxpayer’s ability to obtain a GST invoice. These measures will protect the government’s fiscal position from large, backdated refund claims and further provide greater certainty for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers in relation to their tax returns. 42 Exceptional circumstances – section 89K The exceptional circumstances provision allows the Commissioner to accept a late document within the response period if exceptional circumstances apply. The current definition of “exceptional circumstance” is too restrictive and is, therefore, being extended. Section 89K is being amended to give the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late document outside of the applicable response period if the lateness is minimal – for example, if the document is filed one or two days late or the document is late owing to one or more statutory holidays falling within the response period. Test cases – new section 89O New section 89O is being inserted into the TAA to allow for the suspension of a dispute as the result of the outcome of a test case. The section will apply if a dispute between a taxpayer and the Commissioner has been identified and the Commissioner has designated a case involving another taxpayer as a test case. If the section does apply, the taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement if there is similarity between the facts and questions of law in the dispute and the case that has been designated as a test case. In such a case, any time bars affecting the dispute are stayed until the earliest of the date of the court’s decision, the date on which the test case is otherwise resolved, or the date on which the dispute is otherwise resolved. Enabling the Commissioner to designate a case as a test case earlier in the disputes process will reduce administrative and compliance costs that might otherwise arise if the case involves, say, a taxpayer who is one of a number involved in a single scheme or in a series of similar transactions. Small claims process The cost of the disputes process should not be a deterrent to using the disputes process, especially for smaller taxpayers for whom the cost of progressing the dispute may far outweigh the amount of tax in dispute. An amendment to section 89E and consequential amendments to the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 make the small claims process more accessible to taxpayers by: • raising the threshold of the amount of tax in dispute from $15,000 to $30,000; and • clarifying that “precedent” means the case will be of precedence for taxpayers other than the taxpayer in question. 43 Disputable decision A clarification to the definition of “disputable decision” in the interpretation section of the TAA excludes from the definition particular sections of the disputes process that are left to the discretion of the Commissioner. The decisions left to the Commissioner’s discretion that will not be disputable decisions include: • section 89K, relating to late actions occurring within the response period; • section 89L, which allows the Commissioner to apply for a High Court order to issue a notice rejecting an adjustment proposed by a taxpayer that the Commissioner has accepted or is deemed to have accepted; • section 89M(8), which allows the Commissioner to provide additional information to the Commissioner’s statement of position in response to the disputant’s statement of position; • section 89M(10), which allows the Commissioner to apply for a time extension to reply to a disputant’s statement of position; and • section 89N(3), which allows the Commissioner to apply to the High Court for an order allowing more time to complete the process, or that completion is not required. The amendments ensure that only substantive issues are disputed and that mechanical sections of the disputes process do not in themselves give rise to disputes. When assessments can be issued without a NOPA – section 89C Section 89C lists the circumstances when the Commissioner may make an assessment without issuing a NOPA. They include when the assessment reflects an agreement between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or when the Commissioner believes a notice may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand. Two new subsections are being added to the list of circumstances when the Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. New section 89C(db) enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment when that assessment is made in relation to a matter that is identical to an assessment of the taxpayer for another income year that is at the time subject to court proceedings. In this situation the disputes process would have been completed in relation to the earlier assessment, and the purpose of the amendment is to reduce compliance costs. New section 89C(eb) provides that an assessment can be issued if the taxpayer has left New Zealand and may have been involved in fraudulent activity. The new subsection is a natural extension to existing subsection (e), which allows the Commissioner to issue the assessment if the Commissioner believes a NOPA may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand. 44 Minor amendments to the challenge procedures – sections 138B(3)(b) and 138F(2) Section 138B(3) provides taxpayers with the ability to challenge an assessment when the Commissioner has rejected (by issuing a notice of response) a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer and the Commissioner does not subsequently issue an amended assessment. The taxpayer must file proceedings within the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner, which may include another form of written correspondence by the Commissioner. Some confusion has arisen for taxpayers in respect of the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner provided for in section 138B(3)(b). Taxpayers can challenge an assessment if they file proceedings within that response period. This written disputable decision was not intended to be restricted to the notice of response referred to in section 138B(3)(a). Therefore, the amendment clarifies this point by providing that the reference to “within the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner” is not restricted to the notice of response issued by the Commissioner. The effect of the proposed amendment is that the full disputes process will more clearly be provided for in the case of a taxpayer-initiated dispute as the time for challenging the Commissioner’s decision will not be limited to the two months after the Commissioner’s notice of response. Section 138F gives taxpayers the right to challenge an assessment made by the Commissioner that takes account of a disputable decision. This section does not then provide for a response period within which the challenge must be commenced because there is no cross-reference to sections 138B and 138C, which do provide a response period. The amendment clarifies that for a challenge made under the section to be effective, the taxpayer must commence the challenge within the response period from the date of the Commissioner’s notice of assessment. 45 SELF-ASSESSMENT OF GST (Clauses 69, 77, 78, 91, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 130, 132, 133, 134 and 136) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to confirm that GST is a self-assessed tax. GST, like income tax, relies on taxpayers making the initial assessment of their own tax liability. The amendments aligning the GST legislation with the practice of self-assessment follow the legislative approach used for income tax. Although not involving significant policy change, the introduction of self-assessment into the GST legislation will add to and enhance other improvements being made to simplify tax administration. The proposed GST self-assessment provisions will also achieve a better interface between the GST Act and the TAA. Application date The amendments will apply to GST return periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. Key features Part IV of the GST Act, relating to the assessment of GST, will be repealed, with its main effect being achieved by new section 92B of the TAA. A taxpayer (as defined in section 3 of the TAA) who is required to provide a return under the GST Act for a taxable period must make an assessment of the tax payable for the period. The self- assessment provision will also apply to any person required to provide a special return under section 17 of the GST Act or a return under section 19B of the GST Act for a change in accounting basis. The Commissioner will retain specific powers to amend a taxpayer’s assessment under section 113 of the TAA or make an assessment under section 106 if a taxpayer fails to self-assess. Consequential amendments are being made to the time bar provision for amending GST assessments in section 108A of the TAA, reflecting the move to self assessment. This will be based on the model used in the income tax time bar provision in section 108. A number of provisions in the GST Act are being repealed because their effect is replicated by existing provisions in the TAA. For example, the effect of section 29 of the GST Act (assessments deemed correct except in challenge proceedings) is replicated in section 109 of the TAA, so section 29 can be repealed. 46 Background Tax administration practices currently recognise that taxpayers have the best information about their own activities. As such, taxpayers are better placed than the Commissioner to assess their tax liabilities by making the appropriate calculations and furnishing their returns. Despite current practice, self-assessment for GST is not fully provided for in the legislation. Legislating for self-assessment for GST will provide a more consistent framework by aligning the legislation with practice, thus allowing taxpayers’ obligations to be provided for more clearly and directly in the GST Act. 47 PENALTIES APPLICABLE TO NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTOR IF TOTAL DOUBLE TAX RELIEF APPLIES (Clauses 106, 107, 118 and 119) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment imposes a penalty of $250 per employer monthly schedule if an employer fails to make a required deduction from the withholding payment to a non- resident contractor. This penalty is capped at $1000 per employer monthly schedule. The amendment applies only in cases where the non-resident contractor that the withholding payment is made to is totally relieved from paying tax in New Zealand. The amendment replaces the present shortfall penalty because that penalty is not appropriate in these circumstances. Application date The amendment will apply to withholding payments made on or after 1 April 2005. Key features New section 141AA imposes a penalty on an employer who makes a withholding payment to a non-resident contractor for the purposes of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 if that employer does not withhold the correct amount of tax. The penalty applies only if a double tax agreement relieves the non-resident contractor from all liability to pay tax on the withholding payment. The employer is liable for a shortfall penalty of $250 for each return period for which the employer failed to make a required tax deduction from a withholding payment. The amendment provides that in these circumstances the employer will not be subject to the normal shortfall penalty provisions. The penalty is capped at $1000 per employer monthly schedule. The new section requires a consequential amendment to section 141(2). This is to ensure no tax shortfall calculation is required if the new penalty applies. Section 183A(1) is also being amended to ensure that the “remission for reasonable cause” section of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to the new penalty. Section 183D(1)(b) is being amended to ensure that the new provision is applied consistently with the requirement for the collection of the highest net revenue over time. 48 Background New Zealand employers are required to withhold non-resident contractors’ withholding tax from contract payments to non-resident contractors. This is regardless of whether the non-resident qualifies for total tax relief under a double tax agreement. There is a provision that allows the Commissioner to issue an exemption certificate in these situations, but in some situations, obtaining the certificate may be overlooked. If the contractor qualifies for total double tax relief the contractor will be refunded the tax paid when a tax return is filed at the end of the year. However, if the New Zealand employer does not withhold tax, a shortfall penalty will become payable. The shortfall penalty will be imposed on the New Zealand employer even if no New Zealand tax is payable by the non-resident contractor. The new section changes this by providing for a different penalty to apply. A penalty is needed because it ensures that non-resident contractors apply for a certificate of exemption, which in turn provides useful information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 49 TAX SHORTFALLS – LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES (Clauses 109 and 110) Summary of proposed amendments To the extent an adjustment reduces a net loss of a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC), any penalties will be charged to the shareholder, not the company. If the shareholder has not claimed a deduction for the attributed loss, no penalty will be charged. The change provides a better mechanism for providing relief from the double incidence of penalties if an LAQC and its shareholders are each penalised for what is virtually the same shortfall. Application date The amendment will apply to shortfalls that relate to periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. Key features New section 141FD applies if a loss attributing qualifying company attributes a net loss to a shareholder, and that loss is subsequently reduced or reversed. Only the shareholder will be charged a shortfall penalty in these circumstances. If the shareholder has not claimed a deduction for the attributed loss, no penalty will be charged. If an adjustment results in net income to the loss attributing qualifying company, however, existing law will apply and the company will be charged the shortfall penalty. Section 141FC, which allows a shareholder in a loss attributing qualifying company to apply for an offset of a shortfall penalty if a penalty is charged to both the shareholder and the company, is being consequentially repealed. Background Net losses of an LAQC are attributed to shareholders. Before the enactment of the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, the law allowed shortfall penalties to be charged to both the LAQC and the shareholders if a loss claimed by an LAQC was adjusted and caused a shortfall for the shareholder as well. 50 The Act was retrospectively amended last year to add section 141FC, allowing a shareholder in an LAQC to receive an offset to his or her penalty if the LAQC paid its penalty in full. This approach was adopted because it did not cut across Chapman v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (HC M402-SD02). At the time the Amendment Act was passed, the case was under appeal. The problem with the offset provision is that it relies on taxpayer application. Further, if a former shareholder applied for remission on the understanding that the LAQC had paid its penalty, Inland Revenue would be unable to inform the applicant if the company had or had not paid its penalty, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality. Thus, the offset mechanism is clumsy from both a taxpayer’s and Inland Revenue’s perspective. Remedial issues 53 TRANS-TASMAN IMPUTATION (Clauses 22, 37-41, 65 and 105) A number of clarifying or minor corrective amendments are being made to the recently enacted trans-Tasman imputation rules. • Section FDB 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being repealed and section FDB 1(2)(ab) is being added to clarify that an imputation group must include all members of a consolidated group or no members of a consolidated group. • Section FDB 1(2)(b) is being amended to clarify that it is only when members of more than one consolidated group form or join an imputation group that the credits in a consolidated group imputation credit account must have the same shareholder continuity profile. • The formula in section ME 1C is being clarified that it is a x b - dividend times the exchange rate (rather than a + b as at present). This will come into force on 1 October 2003, the date Australian companies can pay imputed dividends. • Section ME 10(1D)(b) is being clarified to ensure that all entries to the imputation account from the New Zealand members of a trans-Tasman imputation group go to the resident imputation group, whether or not they could be considered to be “transactions”. This clarification will come into force on 1 April 2003, the date that imputation grouping came into force. • Section ME 12(1)(b)(i) is being removed and sections ME 18(1)(a), ME 18(3)(b)(i) and (ii), ME 19(3)(a), and (b) are being amended to ensure that, for companies within an consolidated or imputation group, transfers can still be made between the individual company’s imputation credit account and policy holder credit account. These amendments also come in to force on the 1 April 2003, the application date for imputation grouping. • The definition of “resident in Australia” in section OB 1, paragraph (a), is being omitted. This is to ensure companies which are also resident in New Zealand, dual resident companies, are eligible to elect to become imputation credit account companies. This amendment comes in to force on 1 April 2003, the date Australian companies became eligible to elect to be imputation credit account companies. • Section 139A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to omit annual imputation returns from this provision. This is to ensure consistent treatment of the late filing penalty rules. This amendment also applies from 1 April 2003. 54 MAORI AUTHORITIES (Clauses 26, 27, 28, 29, 35, 53 and 117) Summary of proposed amendments The recently enacted Maori authority rules are being amended to align them with the recently amended company imputation rules, resolve minor technical problems and provide greater certainty with respect to the election start date for entities that wish to be taxed as a Maori authority. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2004-05 income year, the application date of the new Maori authority rules. Key features • Row 4 of Table HI 8 is being amended so that when a Maori authority elects to be taxed as a trust the income under the Maori authority rules which is still to be distributed is treated as trustee income and, therefore, can be distributed tax- free. • Section HI 5 is being amended so that a taxable bonus issue made by a Maori authority that is a company is included in the definition of “taxable Maori authority distribution”. • Section HI 3(3), which provides for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine the effective start date of an election to become a Maori authority, is being replaced with a provision that sets an explicit start date for an election. The amendment will require that elections start from the beginning of the income year in which the election notice is provided to the Commissioner unless the authority wishes to start the election from the immediately following income year. • New section MD 2B(1B) clarifies that a Maori authority can be refunded income tax if there is a credit balance in its Maori authority credit account at the end of the relevant imputation year, without the need for multiple returns to be filed by the authority. The amendment is relevant to Maori authorities that have an extension of time for filing returns. • New section MD 2B(4B) clarifies that any excess tax paid by a Maori authority can be credited as at a date on which there is no liability to pay provisional tax but from which use-of-money interest applies in relation to underpaid provisional tax. 55 • Section MK 8(5) is being replaced by new subsections, MK 8(5) and (5B). New subsection (5) provides that payments of further income tax may be credited to an income tax liability (including provisional tax) that arises at any time when the Maori authority is required to establish and maintain a Maori authority credit account. New subsection (5B) provides that payments of income tax may be credited against the further income tax liability as long as the payment was made after 31 March in the year when the Maori authority credit account debit caused the further income tax liability. • New section 181D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the remission of use-of-money interest and late payment penalties on further income tax liabilities when income tax liabilities are outstanding at the same time. The remission will apply to the extent that the amount of further income tax charged is equal to or less than the amount of the unpaid income tax liability. Background The proposed amendments are required because: • The company imputation rules, on which the Maori authority rules were based, have recently been amended by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 and the Taxation (Relief, Refund and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, but no corresponding amendments were made to the Maori authority rules. • There were two unintended omissions from the Maori authority rules when these rules were originally drafted. • There is a need to provide greater certainty with respect to the election start date for entities wishing to be taxed as a Maori authority. While the Commissioner’s current ability to determine the start date provides flexibility, it does not give adequate certainty of tax treatment. 56 BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS AND LOSSES (Clauses 43-46) A number of clarifying or minor corrective amendments are being made to the recently amended branch equivalent tax account rules. • Sections MF 4(2)(a) and MF 8(3)(a) are being amended to omit paragraph (b) because this paragraph in MF 4(1) and MF 8(2) no longer exists following the simplification of the branch equivalent tax account credit rules. • Sections MF 5(6B) and MF 10(5B) are being amended to clarify that the excess is grossed up into a loss, rather than the excess being the amount that becomes a loss. • Section MF 8(2)(a) is being amended to ensure that item d in the formula also includes the foreign tax credits of consolidated group members in section LC 16. Item e in the formula is also being amended to ensure that it includes all branch equivalent tax debits used to offset the income tax liability of the consolidated group. The branch equivalent tax account amendments apply to the 1997-98 and subsequent income years, unless a taxpayer has filed before 26 June 2003 a return of income for the income year; and the return of income relies on the sections before the enactment of the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 57 ALLOCATION DEFICIT DEBIT RULES FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES (Clauses 40, 42, 47-49, 51-52, 64 and 65) Summary of proposed amendments The allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies are being amended to prevent the inappropriate results that can arise under the current rules. The new rules are designed to ensure that the ratio by which dividend withholding payment (DWP) credits are attached to shareholder dividends does not exceed the equivalent ratio for policyholders. To the extent that the shareholder ratio exceeds the policyholder ratio, an allocation deficit debit will arise in the life insurer’s DWP account. This debit, in appropriate circumstances, will result in a corresponding credit to the policyholder credit account (PCA) of the life insurer. The general policy approach in section MG 8(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which is to discourage refundable DWP credits from being streamed to shareholders so they are advantaged relative to policyholders, will remain unchanged. Application date The new allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies will apply generally for the 2004-05 and subsequent imputation years. Taxpayers will also be able to elect to apply the new rules retrospectively. It is expected that only taxpayers that have previously incurred allocation deficit debits under the current rules will do so. If a taxpayer makes such an election, the new rules will apply to the imputation year specified in the election and subsequent imputation years. An amalgamated company will also be entitled to make an election on behalf of an amalgamating company (which has ceased to exist on amalgamation) for the latter to apply the new rules retrospectively up to the date of amalgamation. Key features The current formula used in section MG 8(5) can give rise to distorted and inappropriate results, including the imposition of excessive allocation deficit debits. For example, it is possible for a life insurance company to incur a large allocation deficit debit even when it has not paid a dividend to its shareholders and, therefore, by definition, could not have streamed any DWP credits to its shareholders. The bill proposes a new basis for the allocation deficit debit rules in section MG 8 to address the rules’ current deficiencies. The new rules should prevent the distorted and unintended results produced under the current allocation deficit debit rules. 58 The new allocation deficit debit rules will no longer compare the fraction of DWP credits transferred to the PCA to the fraction of imputation credits transferred to the PCA. Instead, the DWP crediting ratio for shareholders (measured by DWP credits attached to dividends / amount of dividends) will be compared against the equivalent ratio for policyholders (measured by DWP credit transfers to PCA / policyholder base income). The new rules will apply only to an imputation year in which a dividend payment (with DWP credits attached) is made. However, for the purposes of the allocation deficit debit calculation, the relevant period of time to be considered will be from the end of that imputation year back to the start of the imputation year following the imputation year in which a shareholder dividend was last paid – the DWP reference period. The first DWP reference period will start no earlier than 1 April 2004 unless a taxpayer elects to apply the new rules from an earlier date. Specifically, the proposed changes are: • Sections MG 8(5) to (7) are being repealed. • New section MG 8B is being added to replace the repealed provisions. Under this new section an allocation deficit debit arises when the shareholder DWP ratio exceeds the policyholder DWP ratio in a DWP reference period. • “Shareholder DWP ratio” is defined as total DWP credits/total dividends paid. • “Policyholder DWP ratio” is defined as DWP credits transferred to the policyholder credit account/ net policyholder income. • “DWP reference period” is defined as the current imputation year plus previous years if no dividend was paid with DWP credits attached. Therefore the proposed method is based on ensuring that the ratio by which DWP credits are attached to shareholder dividends does not exceed the equivalent ratio for policyholders. If an allocation deficit debit arises in the DWP account under the new rules, a corresponding credit will be recorded in the PCA to the extent the DWP account has a closing credit balance. If the allocation deficit debit exceeds the DWP account closing credit balance, that excess will not be creditable to the PCA. The legislative proposals are as follows: • New sections ME 18(1)(bb) and ME 26(2)(d) allow a credit to the policyholder credit account of the allocation deficit debit if it is less than or equal to the closing credit balance of the DWP account. • New sections ME 18(1)(bc) and ME 26(2)(e) allow a credit to the policyholder credit account equal to the closing balance of the DWP account if the allocation deficit debit exceeds the closing credit balance of the DWP account. 59 Background The current section MG 8(5) is intended to operate as an anti-avoidance rule to discourage life insurance companies streaming refundable DWP credits to their shareholders in preference to their policyholders. It works by recording a debit, called an allocation deficit debit, to a life insurer’s DWP account when the fraction of DWP credits transferred to the PCA in an imputation year is less than the fraction of imputation credits transferred to the PCA in the same imputation year. The provision was enacted as part of the new rules for the taxation of life insurance companies in 1990. It is intended to operate as an anti-avoidance provision to prevent a life insurer streaming refundable DWP credits to its shareholders and non- refundable imputation credits to its policyholders. At the time the rules were enacted, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue stated in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 2, No 3, October 1990 (Appendix C) at paragraph 17.4: “. . . The life insurer is able to elect to make transfers to its PCA from its WPA \[DWP account\]. However, as dividend withholding payments are refundable if not fully utilised by the person who ultimately receives them, there are provisions to ensure that a life insurer is unable to stream these credits to its shareholders as opposed to its policyholders . . .” Some of the larger distortions under the current rules arise because the current calculation focuses on credits and debits arising to the memorandum accounts in one imputation year. It does not take into account opening and closing balances and, therefore, does not recognise that some life insurers may not clear out their DWP and imputation credit accounts each year by either transferring credits to the PCA or attaching them to dividends. If, for example, a life insurer has a substantial opening credit balance in its imputation credit account (ICA) and it elects to transfer a large proportion of these credits to the PCA, the imputation credit transfer fraction may well be significantly higher than the DWP transfer fraction, even if the company has transferred all available DWP credits to the PCA. The following policy issues were taken into account when developing the proposed new allocation deficit debit rules: • The application of the legislation should be limited to potential streaming events. Potential streaming events would arise in years when DWP credits are attached to dividend payments to shareholders. • Once the threshold event has occurred, the penalty calculation should take a cumulative approach rather than focusing on memorandum entries in separate imputation years. • The calculation should not rely solely on memorandum account entries but should have regard to distributions to both shareholders and policyholders. • The deemed DWP account debit should, when appropriate, result in a corresponding credit to the PCA. 60 The calculation should not result in inappropriate or disproportionate penalty amounts. Detailed analysis The basis for the proposed new allocation deficit debit rules is to regard policyholders and shareholders as equity participants in a life insurance company. Shareholders receive rewards by way of dividends, and policyholders receive rewards by way of deemed distributions measured using the policyholder base. To the extent that the shareholder DWP ratio is greater than the policyholder DWP ratio, a debit will arise in the DWP account. These ratios will have specific DWP reference period rules for the purpose of calculating the numerator and denominator. The DWP reference period will be from the end of the imputation year in which a dividend (with DWP credits attached) was paid, back to the start of the imputation year following the year in which the previous shareholder dividend (with DWP credits attached) was paid. For example, if DWP credits are attached to dividends paid on 15 March 2008, and the previous dividend with DWP credits attached was paid on 15 March 2005, the DWP reference period concerned would be 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2008. The first DWP reference period will start no earlier than the date the new rules first apply to a taxpayer. This will be 1 April 2004 unless the taxpayer elects to apply the new rules from an earlier date. The proposed rules will require each life insurer to make the following calculations in the year that DWP credits are attached to dividends paid to shareholders: Step 1: Determine DWP reference period This will include the current imputation year plus any imputation years immediately before the current imputation year in which no dividends with DWP credits attached were paid. Step 2: Determine whether policy holder income is positive If the total of the policyholder income and net loss for the DWP reference period is zero or a net loss, the following allocation deficit debit rules do not apply – section MG 8B(2)(a). 61 Step 3: Determine shareholder DWP ratio The formula for determining the shareholder DWP ratio will be: g f Where: f = total DWP credits attached to the dividend(s) in the DWP reference period g = total amount of dividends paid in the DWP reference period Step 4: Determine policyholder DWP ratio The formula for determining the policyholder DWP ratio will be: r)-(1 d c × Where: c = total net transfers from the DWP account to the PCA in the DWP reference period d = policyholder base income in the DWP reference period r = the rate of tax Policyholder base income in the denominator will be the aggregate of policyholder base income in respect of the income years the PCA has been debited to meet the company’s policyholder base liability in the DWP reference period. This definition is consistent with the PCA debit timing rules in sections ME 18(3)(a) and ME 18(4)(a). For example, if a life insurer has a 30 September balance date and attached DWP credits to dividends paid on 15 March 2004, the policyholder base income would include the 30 September 2003 income year results, but not the 30 September 2004 income year results. This is because the DWP reference period rule would only include the 31 March 2004 imputation year. The debit to the PCA in that imputation year would be made on 30 September 2003 in respect of the 2003 income year income tax liability. For the purposes of calculating item “d”, if the policyholder base has recorded a loss then this loss can be offset against other policyholder base income in the DWP reference period. Item “d” will, therefore, be the net amount of policyholder income in respect of the DWP reference period. As the policyholder base income is the pre-tax amount in the current section CM 15 formula, the factor (1-r) is needed to make policyholder base income net of tax, in the same way that shareholder dividends are net of tax. 62 Step 5: Determine whether an allocation deficit debit is required in the DWP account If the shareholder DWP ratio f/g is greater than the policyholder DWP ratio c/d(1-r), streaming is deemed to have occurred and the DWP account must be debited. This debit may result in a corresponding credit to the PCA, an allocation deficit debit solely in the DWP account, or a combination of both (as calculated in steps 6 and 7, below). If the shareholder ratio f/g is smaller than the policyholder ratio c/d(1-r), no adjustment is required as new section MG 8B(2)(b) would not apply. Step 6: Allocation deficit debit when the DWP account balance remains in credit The amount to be debited to the DWP account depends on whether the DWP account will be in debit or credit after the debit is made. The first step will require calculation of the potential DWP allocation deficit debit or “maximum deficit debit”, as set out in new section MG 8B, which is calculated as follows: Maximum deficit debit = (shareholder DWP ratio – policyholder DWP ratio) × d (1-r) Then the maximum deficit debit is compared with the balance of the DWP account at year end (before any allocation deficit debit is imposed). If the DWP account balance is greater than or equal to the maximum deficit debit – that is, if it will remain in credit or be zero after the allocation deficit debit is imposed – the amount of the maximum deficit debit is debited to the DWP account and credited to the PCA – refer new sections ME 18(1)(bb) and ME 26(2)(d). This places the accounts in the same position as if the transfer had been made at the time the dividend was paid and no streaming would be involved. Step 7: Reduced allocation deficit debit when the DWP account balance goes into debit If the DWP account balance is less than the “maximum deficit debit” (before any allocation deficit debit is imposed), the allocation deficit debit would leave the DWP account in debit. In this case, a reduced allocation deficit debit is calculated. The purpose of this further formula is to ensure that the credit ratio is the same for both policyholders and shareholders. It is designed to ensure that inappropriate or disproportionate debits do not arise. While the reduced deficit debit is one formula, in substance, it consists of two parts. The first part takes into account that for both parties (shareholders and policyholders) the maximum DWP credit ratio that can be supported is: 63 income baseer policyhold (net) dividendr Shareholde balance closing DWP PCAaccount to DWPfrom ersnet transf Total dividends toattached credits P DW +         + + Expressed algebraically, this reads: r)-d(1 g balance closing DWP c f + ++ The DWP closing balance is the DWP closing balance before the initial allocation deficit debit is imposed and is represented by “e” in the reduced deficit debit formula in section MG 8B. The maximum credits that can be attached to dividends is, therefore, the maximum DWP ratio, f + c + e multiplied by the dividends paid g divided by g + d(1-r). On this basis, the reduced allocation deficit debit would be: The closing DWP balance before any allocation deficit debit is made, e, plus DWP credits attached to dividends, f, minus: g × r))-(1 (d g e) c (f ×+ ++ which makes the complete formula for the reduced deficit debit as: e + f - g × r))-(1 (d g e) c (f ×+ ++ After the reduced deficit debit is imposed, the closing debit balance in the DWP account will be subject to a 10% dividend withholding payment penalty tax under section 140C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Although the PCA will receive a credit equal to the amount of the DWP account closing credit balance before the initial allocation deficit debit is imposed – new sections ME 18(1)(bc) and ME 26(2)(e) – it will not be credited with any other part of the reduced deficit debit. The reason for not crediting the PCA with the full amount of the reduced deficit debit is linked to the nature of this debit. The DWP account closing debit balance indicates shareholders have received more DWP credits than were available (if streaming had not occurred). The payment required from the company to clear the balance, therefore, represents DWP credits which have been used by the shareholders inappropriately and so must be repaid. The repayment would leave the tax base in a neutral position. However, if the payment was also creditable to the PCA the tax position would no longer be neutral. Effectively, the shareholders would continue to receive a benefit because fewer imputation credits and DWP credits would need to be transferred to the PCA in the future. 64 Consequential amendments New sections ME 18(2)(bb) and ME 26(3)(d) ensure that the credits to the PCA are made on the last day of the imputation year in which an allocation deficit debit arises. Section MG 5(1)(f) is being clarified that it applies only to allocation deficit debits arising under section MG 8(4)and that sections MG 5(1)(g) and MG 15(1)(g) apply to debits arising under new section MG 8B. Section MG 16A(1) is being amended to ensure that any dividends paid within a consolidated group do not form part of the calculation in new section MG 8B. Examples The following examples illustrate the calculations: (a) Suppose one year is involved and, during that year, a (net) dividend of $10m is paid with $4m DWP credits attached. The (net) policyholder base income is $50m and, during the year, net credits of $15m were transferred from the DWP account to the PCA. At year-end the closing balance in the DWP account was a credit of $8m (before any allocation deficit debit). The DWP reference period in this case is the imputation year. The shareholder DWP ratio (f/g) is: 4/10 = 40 % The policyholder DWP ratio (c/d(1-r)) is: 15/50 = 30 % As the ratio for shareholders is greater, section MG 8B(2)(b) streaming has occurred and an allocation deficit debit must be recorded. The maximum deficit debit is: (Shareholder DWP ratio – policyholder DWP ratio) × (net) policyholder base income $5m. is which$50m, % 10 m50$ 50 15 10 4 ×=×− This $5m maximum deficit debit is less than the $8m DWP account credit balance, so $5m is transferred from the DWP account to the PCA. After the transfer, $3m credit remains in the DWP account. This places the insurer in the same position as if it had transferred net credits of $20m from the DWP account to the PCA during the imputation year. The crediting ratio would then have been 40% for both shareholders and policyholders. 65 (b) The facts are the same as in the preceding example but at year-end only $2m remains in the DWP account (before any allocation deficit debit). Now the maximum deficit debit of $5m exceeds the $2m credit balance in the DWP account. In order to prevent an inappropriate or disproportionate penalty amount, the allocation deficit debit will need to be capped at the level of the reduced deficit debit. The first step is to calculate the maximum DWP ratio used in this calculation. 3 Expressed algebraically, this reads: r)-d(1 g e c f + ++ = $50m $10m $2m $15m $4m + ++ = 35% The reduced deficit debit is: e + f – (35% × g) = $2m +$4m – (35% × $10m) = $2.5m A debit is made to the DWP account of this amount and a credit is made to the PCA of the DWP closing balance – section ME 18(1)(bc). After this transfer, the DWP account will be $0.5m in debit and must be cleared by a cash payment which will not get credited to the PCA. 3 These figures are the DWP account transfers to the PCA and the DWP closing balance before the initial allocation deficit debit is imposed. income baseer policyhold (net) dividendr Shareholde balance closing DWP PCAaccount to DWPfrom ersnet transf Total dividends toattached credits P DW +         + + 66 FUND WITHDRAWAL TAX (Clauses 7 and 8) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the fund withdrawal tax rules clarify that these rules do not apply to superannuation fund members who have made an election that a higher rate (39%) of specified superannuation contribution withholding tax apply, or that the specified superannuation contribution made by their employer be treated as salary or wages. The amendments also clarify the cessation of employment exemption, which is an exemption for withdrawals on or after, or shortly before, cessation of employment. Application date The amendments clarifying that the fund withdrawal tax rules contained in section CL 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 do not apply to fund members who have made an election under section NE 2AA(1) or section NE 2A(1) will apply from 14 September 2000, the date the fund withdrawal tax rules came into effect. The amendments to clarify the cessation of employment exemption in section CL 8(2) will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The main amendment relates to employees that have elected to have all or part of their employer specified superannuation contribution taxed either at a higher rate of 39% (section NE 2AA (1)) or treated as salary or wages (section NE 2A (1)). It is not the policy intent of the legislation that the fund withdrawal tax rules apply to the withdrawal of these amounts from superannuation funds. The fund withdrawal tax is intended to remove an avoidance concern that is not present when such an election is made. This exclusion is not sufficiently clear in the existing rules, and the amendment will ensure that employer contributions that are subject to the 39% rate or treated as salary or wages are not subject to fund withdrawal tax. The remaining amendments concern the exception for withdrawal when a member ceases employment, contained in section CL 8. The fund withdrawal tax should not apply to funds that are withdrawn on or shortly before, or after an employee ceases employment, except in limited circumstances. In some circumstances, a literal interpretation of this section conflicts with its intended application, the practical application being that the fund withdrawal tax has applied when it is the policy intent that it should not. 67 An amendment will enable previous employment to be counted for the “two years or more” employment test in section CL 8(2)(a) when the employer changes as part of a business restructuring, such as a company buy-out, the employees join the new employer’s scheme and the existing scheme funds are transferred to the new scheme. The contribution tests in section CL 8(2)(b) and (c), which provide that contributions in the year of ceasing employment and the two previous years should not exceed 150 percent or more of the previous year’s contribution, will be relaxed. If this test is not met together with the employment test, the contributions withdrawn are subject to fund withdrawal tax. The amendment will provide that fund withdrawal tax will not be payable if the employer’s contributions have begun during the year of cessation and the two previous income years, the amount of the employer’s contribution is what is prescribed by the superannuation fund’s documentation, and the reason for joining the fund was not to avoid the top personal tax rate. Background The top rate of specified superannuation contribution withholding tax for most employees is set at 33%. When the top personal tax rate was increased to 39% an avoidance opportunity was created. The fund withdrawal tax rules were introduced to counter this avoidance opportunity. The rules aim to remove the tax benefit for those earning over $60,000 a year from substituting employer contributions to a superannuation fund for salary and wages and subsequently withdrawing the increased contribution and thus avoiding the 39% rate. The rules provide that in certain circumstances, a 5% withdrawal tax will apply to withdrawals from superannuation funds. 68 DEFERRED DEDUCTION RULE (Clauses 16, 17 and 18) Summary of proposed amendments The recently enacted deferred deduction rule will not apply if 70 percent of an arrangement’s assets consist of foreign shares held on capital account. The criteria for defining limited recourse loans have been restated to clarify that loans from associated persons are generally excluded, and separately, arm’s-length loans from New Zealand financial institutions are excluded from the definition. Two other changes ensure consistency or make the rule work as it was designed to do. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2004-05 income year, but will not apply to arrangements entered into before the start of the 2004-05 income year, unless: • at the time of entering into the arrangement, the investor could have reasonably have expected that ten or more people would acquire an interest in the arrangement; and • 70 percent or more of the allowable deductions of the investors from the arrangement for the income year arise from an interest in fixed life intangible property or software. This is the general application date for the deferred deduction rule. Key features Foreign shares Section ES 1(1)(e) is being amended to restrict the deferred deduction rule from applying to companies where 70 percent or more of the arrangement assets consist of foreign shares, if the proceeds upon any disposition of the shares is not gross income, other than under the foreign investment fund rules. Comprehensive tax rules surround such investments, and the deferred deduction rule should not impose further potential tax obligations. Other changes The section ES 2(3)(d) criteria for a limited recourse loan are being amended to reflect the original intent. Loans will be caught if: • they are from an associated person who in turn has borrowed on a limited recourse basis; or 69 • they are not provided on an arm’s-length basis; and • they are not provided by a lender who regularly lends money and is resident or situated in New Zealand. Section ES 1(1)(e) is being amended to ensure that the rule will not apply where either: • limited recourse amounts constitute less than 50 percent of net arrangement assets; or • 70 percent or more of the arrangement assets are assets of the kind listed in section ES 1(1)(e)(ii). Sections ES 1 and ES 3 are amended to ensure that references to losses attributed by loss attributed qualifying companies are treated in the same way. Background The deferred deduction rule was introduced in the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The general purpose of the deferred deduction rule is to combat aggressive tax arrangements which provide taxpayers with excessive tax advantages. The tax savings occur regardless of the success of the arrangement. These changes further target the rule and clarify aspects of it. 70 DATE OF TAXPAYER SELF-ASSESSMENT (Clause 92) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment provides that the date of a taxpayer’s self-assessment is the date of receipt at an office of the department. This aligns the date with current practice and removes any residual uncertainty for taxpayers and the Commissioner. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2004-05 income year. Key feature Section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to reflect current practice that the date of assessment is the date on which the taxpayer’s return of income is received at an Inland Revenue office. Background Following the introduction of self-assessment into tax legislation in 2001, taxpayers are required to assess their taxable income and income tax liability. Self-assessment also includes an assessment of any net loss, terminal tax or refund due. Provision was made for taxpayers to be able to fix a date that would create certainty as to the date of their self-assessment. The date needed to be within a time period prescribed by the Commissioner. This period would be determined by reference to the last date on which a taxpayer is required to furnish a return of income. However, the discretionary provision that allows the Commissioner to fix a period within which a taxpayer can elect the self-assessment date is not being used by Inland Revenue. In practice, the date of notice of assessment is being treated as the date of receipt of the return by Inland Revenue. Therefore the provision is redundant. 71 ASSESSMENTS IN DISPUTED CASES (Clause 100) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment confirms the validity of assessments made at the direction of an authorised officer, and those that follow practice and current policy approved by the Commissioner. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key feature A new provision is being inserted into section 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to confirm that assessments made at the direction of an authorised officer and assessments made following current policy or practice directed by the Commissioner are valid. Background As part of the disputes resolution process, the documents that comprise each party’s arguments are forwarded to Inland Revenue’s adjudication service for review. The function of the service, as described by Sir Ivor Richardson, is to consider the dispute impartially and independently of the audit function. 4 An amended assessment, if required, is then issued, based on this review. Depending on the outcome of the Adjudication process a taxpayer’s assessment may be amended by Inland Revenue. This involves the adjudication officer directing another officer (usually the investigating officer) to amend the assessment on the grounds specified by the adjudication officer. Administratively, it is more efficient that the investigating officer makes and issues the amended notice of assessment (if required) after the adjudication unit has considered the issue, rather than the adjudicator. In general terms all officers of the department should follow current practice directed by the Commissioner when considering the issues relating to the assessment. The amendment confirms that assessments issued by one Inland Revenue officer at the direction of another remain valid. This is necessary following a draft Crown Law opinion which raised an issue as to whether the assessing officer’s function could be fettered in such circumstances. 4 Organisational review of the Inland Revenue Department; Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee April 1994, page 67. 72 WRITE-OFF – DATE OF MEASUREMENT OF NET LOSS (Clause 116) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is required to section 177C(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow net losses to be measured as at the time the last return was filed rather than according to the taxpayer’s return of income for the income year immediately before the income year in which the outstanding tax is written off. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features An amendment is being made to section 177C(6) to allow net losses to be measured as at the time the last return was filed. Background The Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 introduced the new taxpayer financial relief rules. Under section 177C(5), if the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has net losses, the net losses are reduced, in whole or in part, in proportion to the amount written off. Section 177C(6) provides that the net losses are measured “according to the taxpayer’s return of income for the income year immediately before the income year in which the outstanding tax is written off”. In applying the legislation, Inland Revenue is encountering two practical problems. Firstly, where there are returns outstanding the outstanding returns are then requested, which can lead to delays in finalising cases. Secondly, where a case is being considered just after a balance date but before the due date for the return, any decision made in relation to write-off has to be followed up after the return has been filed, to ensure that any losses have been properly extinguished. The amendment will allow net losses to be measured as at the time the last return was filed. 73 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS A number of miscellaneous technical amendments are being made to the tax Acts. Unless otherwise indicated, the amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Income Tax Act 1994 Removal of references to “assessable” (Clauses 6, 23 and 25) The references to “assessable” in the headings of sections CG 25 (cases where assessable income calculation cannot be undertaken), GC 14 (income assessable to beneficiaries) and HH 3 (gross income assessable to beneficiaries) will be removed because they are redundant. This is consistent with the removal of references to “assessable” by the self-assessment amendments enacted in 2001. Expenditure on leases of personal property (Clause 15) Section EO 2 provides a straight line spreading rule for expenditure on leases of personal property. It is intended that finance leases be excluded from the ambit of this provision because the timing of finance lease expenditure is governed by the accrual rules. A clarifying amendment is necessary to achieve this policy intent. This amendment will apply from 1999, when the finance lease rules were implemented. Further dividend withholding payment provision correction (Clause 50) Section MG 9(5C), relating to further dividend withholding payment payable by a company, was enacted recently by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The reference to “income tax” in this provision is a drafting error and will be replaced by a reference to “dividend withholding payment”, with the same application date as new section MG 9(5C). Amounts of PAYE tax deductions (Clauses 58 and 60) Section NC 6, which relates to amounts of PAYE tax deductions, refers to tax deductions fixed by an annual taxing Act. These references are redundant because the annual taxing Act is not used to fix amounts of PAYE deductions. Instead, the amounts of PAYE deductions are generally the amounts of the basic tax deductions specified in Schedule 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Accordingly, the annual taxing Act references in section NC 6 will be omitted, which will simplify the wording of the provision and assist in highlighting the central role played by the basic tax deductions specified in Schedule 19. Section NC 12 will be consequentially amended to remove its reference to amounts of PAYE deductions being changed by annual taxing Act. 74 Omitted section reference in fringe benefit tax rules (Clause 61) Employers who use the multi-rate method for calculating their fringe benefit tax liability and cease to employ staff in the first three quarters of the income year must treat the quarter in which employment ceases as the final quarter of the year and undertake the multi-rate calculation in relation to that quarter. Section ND 12 is intended to modify the return filing and payment dates for that quarter. However, owing to the omission of a section reference, only those provisions relating to the payment of the fringe benefit liability have been modified, not the return filing date provision. Accordingly, section ND 12 will be amended by insertion of a reference to section ND 10(3). The amendment will apply with application to a fringe benefit provided or granted by an employer on or after 1 April 2000 (the application date of the multi-rate FBT rules), unless the employer has filed such a return based on application of the current law before the date of enactment and has relied upon the current law. Dividend withholding payments by local authorities (Clause 63) From the date of enactment, local authorities are to be exempted from their current liability, under section NH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, to pay 33% dividend withholding payments on dividends from foreign companies. The proposed amendment is expected to result in a small decrease in compliance and administrative costs, as local authorities will not be required to file returns. In principle, dividend withholding payments are paid on behalf of shareholders, but local authorities have no shareholders. Local authorities are not liable to tax on any other investment income, although they do pay tax on income derived from their trading enterprises. In 2002, the legislation was amended to exempt charities from this same obligation, their liability having been due to an oversight in the original legislation. Definition of “lessee’s acquisition cost” (Clauses 20 and 65) The drafting of the definition of “lessee’s acquisition cost” in sections FC 10(8)(a) and OB 1 will be clarified by following the approach used in the definition of “lessor’s disposition value” in section OB 1. In particular, it will be made clear in the definition of “lessee’s acquisition cost” that the consideration is provided to the lessee under the finance lease or the hire purchase agreement. Timing of expenditure on leases of land and buildings (Clause 65) A drafting error at the time the finance lease rules were enacted in 1999 resulted in expenditure on leases of land and buildings being excluded inadvertently from the definition of “accrual expenditure” in section OB 1, which in turn means that such expenditure is not covered by the timing rule in section EF 1. An unintended consequence is that a taxpayer may claim an upfront deduction for the entire amount of a lease prepayment, instead of spreading the prepayment over the term of the lease as intended. Before the finance lease rules were implemented the timing of expenditure on leases of land and buildings was covered by the timing rule in section EF 1. An amendment is therefore necessary to ensure that expenditure on leases of real property continues to be covered by section EF 1. This will be achieved by including the term “operating lease” in the list of provisions to which paragraph (f) of 75 the definition of “lease” in section OB 1 applies. This amendment will apply from the inception of the new finance lease rules in 1999 as it could never have been intended by Parliament that expenditure on leases of land and buildings would not be subject to the timing rule in section EF 1. Definition of “land tax” (Clause 65) The definition of “land tax” in section OB 1 is redundant and will be repealed. Definition of “premium” (Clause 65) The definition of “premium” in section OB 1 was amended in 1999 as part of amendments to ensure that guarantee fees paid to non-residents are subject to an effective tax rate of 3.3% on the gross amount under section CN 4. However, some of the wording of the 1999 amendment may have inadvertently taken certain insurance premia outside the ambit of section CN 4. In particular, the addition of a reference to a premium being payable “to an insurer” may have made it more difficult to apply section CN 4 in the situation where a non-resident parent of a New Zealand company enters into a contract of insurance with a non-resident insurer to cover risks faced by the New Zealand company and the New Zealand company reimburses its non-resident parent for premiums paid on the contract of insurance. These reimbursing payments should come within the section OB 1 definition of “premium” and therefore be subject to section CN 4. The removal of the insurer reference in the definition of “premium” will facilitate this. The lists of provisions to which the insurance-related definitions apply will also be corrected. Tax Administration Act 1994 Requisition of information held by offshore entities (Clause 71) Section 17(1C), which relates to the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers, was amended recently by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The amendment involved replacing “held by” with “in the knowledge, possession or control of”. However, because this provision refers essentially to ownership-type interests, it will be amended to revert to references to “held by” as it is not accurate to refer to ownership interests being “in the knowledge of” a person. The use of “held by” is also consistent with the approach used in similar associated person and nominee provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. Secrecy of restricted information (Clause 75) When section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act was last amended to authorise Inland Revenue’s disclosure of information to the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health, a corresponding amendment was not made to section 87 to require the officers of the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health to maintain the secrecy of that restricted information. 76 Section 87 is being amended to require the officers of the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health to maintain the secrecy of all restricted information communicated to them. This is the same requirement that is imposed on Inland Revenue officials. Matters that cannot be challenged (Clause 103) Former section 40(c) of the GST Act listed certain decisions of the Commissioner under the GST Act that could not be disputed under the former objection provisions in that Act. These provisions were replaced in 1996 by the current challenge provisions in the Tax Administration Act. However, the effect of former section 40(c) of the GST Act was not replicated in section 138E of the Tax Administration Act, which lists certain matters that cannot be challenged. A remedial amendment to section 138E is therefore necessary to correct this oversight and restore the previous position. Reduction of penalties for good behaviour (Clause 108) Section 141FB, which allows shortfall penalty rates to be halved if a taxpayer has a past record of good behaviour, is being rewritten to improve its comprehensibility. The only significant policy change is that offences under sections 143 to 145 are now taken into account in determining whether a taxpayer has a sufficient track record of good behaviour. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Change-in-use deductions (Clause 131) Section 21E(4) facilitates the obtaining of a change-in-use deduction in respect of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies which are then applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. This provision is intended to replicate the effect of the first proviso to former section 21(5) and former section 21(6) of the GST Act. Two minor clarifying amendments will be made to section 21E(4) to ensure that the effect of the previous provisions is continued as was intended. In particular, the reference to “if” will be replaced with “to the extent that” and the reference to “sections 21 and 21I” will be replaced with “sections 21 or 21I”. The amendments will have the same application date as sections 21 and 21I, meaning they will apply to goods and services treated as being supplied on and after 10 October 2000. Improving interface with Tax Administration Act (Clauses 120, 121, 122, 135, 138 and 139) The general approach to tax administration provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts is that if they apply generically to a number of different taxes then such provisions should be aggregated and contained in the Tax Administration Act rather than replicated in the various other Inland Revenue Acts. Consistent with this approach, sections 50 (appropriation authority for refunds), 80 (authorising the making of regulations to extend statutory deadlines) and 81 (concerning general regulation- making powers) of the GST Act will be repealed as their functions can be performed by sections 185, 226 and 225 respectively of the Tax Administration Act. These Tax 77 Administration Act provisions will be consequentially amended to include references to the GST Act. Transitional provision for supplies of imported services (Clause 140) The transitional provision in new section 84B for supplies of imported services will be amended to refer to the time of performance of the services, with the same application date as that provision. Determinations in relation to financial arrangements (Clauses 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89) The determinations rules are to be amended retrospectively to allow the Commissioner to cancel a determination before issuing a replacement determination. It has become apparent that, contrary to the intent of the legislation, this is not allowed under current rules. Sections 90(6), 90AC(6) and 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allow the Commissioner to “vary, rescind, restrict, or extend a determination” made under sections 90(1) and 90AC(1) by replacing the determination or by making a new determination. The determination does not have to be used for a financial arrangement which was entered into before the new determination was published until four years after the date of publication of the new determination.

As the government announced in September, the changes are expected to result in these banks paying around $360 million more a year in New Zealand tax. Foreign-owned banks have taken tax deductions for interest arising from excessive debt to reduce income that is subject to New Zealand tax. New thin capitalisation rules will deny foreign-owned banks interest deductions if they do not have sufficient capital in New Zealand to support their New Zealand business and their offshore investments made through New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 July 2005. This means that banks will need to measure the capital they have in New Zealand at the end of the measurement period beginning 1 July 2005, which generally will be as at 30 September 2005. Key features The Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended as follows: • The current thin capitalisation rules in subpart FG will be amended to include rules specifically for foreign-owned registered banks and their groups operating in New Zealand. • A “registered bank” is defined in section OB 1 as having the same meaning as in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989. • An amended section FG 2(1) will determine whether the bank has sufficient foreign ownership to be covered by the thin capitalisation rules. • Section FG 3 of the current rules will be replaced with a new section FG 3 that requires a reporting bank, as defined in section FG 8D, to calculate annual total deductions based on a calculation in section FG 8B. This annual total deduction is the deduction that the reporting bank can make after an adjustment for any interest denial as a result of the new thin capitalisation rules. • The adjustment to the annual total deduction calculation in section FG 8B will be required when the reporting bank’s New Zealand banking group (“NZ banking group”) has less net equity supporting its New Zealand business than the net equity threshold determined under section FG 8H of the new rules. The actual net equity of the bank is determined under section FG 8G. 4 • The interest adjustment calculation in section FG 8B takes any shortfall between the net equity and the net equity threshold of the NZ banking group and applies an interest rate to that shortfall. • The interest rate applied to the shortfall is determined in section FG 8B by dividing the interest expense of the banking group by the average interest- bearing debt held by the NZ banking group over the income year. Financial accounts will be the basis for the interest and debt values. • The NZ banking group is defined in section FG 8C, and includes any registered bank and any companies or fixed establishments operating in New Zealand that would be required under New Zealand’s generally accepted accounting principles to be consolidated into the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank. • The reporting bank has the option in section FG 8C to exclude life insurance companies and their associated groups from the NZ banking group. • Net equity under section FG 8G and net equity threshold under section FG 8H must be calculated by the reporting bank for the NZ banking group as at the last day of each measurement period. The measurement period is defined in section FG 8E. A reporting bank can choose a quarterly, monthly or daily measurement period. • The calculation of net equity for the NZ banking group under section FG 8G starts with accounting values of shareholder and branch equity drawn from the financial statements of the members of the group. The aggregation of equity will be done in accordance with accounting rules that apply to consolidations. Any amounts that are considered to be equity for tax rules but not for accounting purposes will be added to the aggregated accounting amount of shareholders and branch equity. Interest-free loans to the NZ banking group from non-resident associates will also be included in net equity. In calculating net equity, equity for accounting purposes that is considered debt for tax purposes is deducted under section FG 8G. • A number of other deductions from equity are then required. These are provided for in section FG 8G. The effect of these deductions from the adjusted accounting equity described above is that the NZ banking group will be required to have sufficient equity to fully equity fund each of the assets represented by these deductions. • The deductions in section FG 8G are: – capital gain amounts that arise from the sale of intangible assets to associates (from the start of the 2005 year); – certain intangible assets; – policyholder liabilities; – revaluation reserves; – future tax benefits; – credit enhancements; – capital advances to connected persons; – equity in the NZ banking group that is held by a life company or by a life group that has opted to be excluded from the banking group under section FG 8C; 5 – equity held by the banking group in any life business that has chosen the section FG 8C exclusion; and – offshore investments. • Offshore investments under section FG 8G will include all equity investments in non-residents except for: – interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs) for which the FIF income or loss is calculated using the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method; – shares in a “grey list” company 1 that are listed on the official list of a recognised exchange and revenue account property. • Offshore investments will also include any notional offshore investment amount as calculated under section FG 8G(3). This calculation will use foreign tax credits claimed by the NZ banking group against an income tax liability as the basis of calculating a notional amount that represents the offshore investment by the group that would be required to generate the foreign tax credits. • Section FG 8G(3) allows a banking group to claim up to $5 million of foreign tax credits before it will have a notional offshore investment amount. • The calculation of net equity threshold for the NZ banking group is provided for under section FG 8H. This is based on 4% of the NZ banking group’s risk weighted exposures. • “Risk-weighted exposure” is a regulatory term. Section FG 8F defines “regulatory value”, which will be relevant when determining the risk-weighted exposures for the NZ banking group. To determine a regulatory value of the risk-weighted exposures of the NZ banking group, the Capital Adequacy Framework that is issued by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is applied to the value of the banking group’s assets and exposures. Background Foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are using interest deductions arising from an excessive level of debt to reduce the portion of their income that is subject to tax in New Zealand. The policy issues giving rise to the excessive debt can be separated into those arising as a result of the banks’ outbound investment and those arising from the banks’ level of inbound investment into New Zealand to support their New Zealand business. On the outbound investment side, cross-border financing arrangements generate income that is effectively not subject to New Zealand tax through the use of various features of our international tax rules. As these outbound investments have generally been funded by debt, the associated interest expenses have been used to reduce the New Zealand portion of their income that is subject to New Zealand tax. 1 A grey list company is one that is resident in a country specified in Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004. These countries – which include Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States – have tax systems that are similar to New Zealand’s. 6 On the inbound side, there is potential for banks to substitute debt for equity in the financing of their New Zealand businesses through the use of holding companies and bank branches. This results in their New Zealand groups being more thinly capitalised, for tax purposes, relative to their businesses worldwide. The proposed thin capitalisation rules for banks are a systemic response to the problem of excessive debt funding by banks. The fundamental objective of this approach is to measure more accurately the income associated with the New Zealand activities of banks, ensuring that excessive debt cannot be allocated to the New Zealand operations of a multinational bank. The new thin capitalisation rules for banks compare the equity associated with the New Zealand banking business (net of certain outbound investments) with a prescribed level of required equity based on 4% of the banks’ New Zealand risk- weighted exposures, and deny interest expenses to the extent that there is a deficiency. The measurement of equity is based on accounting and regulatory concepts of equity, which allows for verifiability and minimises compliance costs. The objective of the new rules is not the regulation of the amount of equity in New Zealand per se, but the use of equity as the basis for a benchmark for achieving an appropriate allocation of interest expenses. The effect of the proposal on outbound investment is that banks will be prevented from using the expenses associated with this income as a deduction against the New Zealand-sourced income. For inbound investment issues, the proposed approach requires a significant level of equity is available to support the New Zealand business. This is determined on the basis of 4% of the NZ banking group’s New Zealand risk-weighted exposures. Our current thin capitalisation rules do not effectively apply to banks, primarily because of the on-lending concession. The proposed rules will apply specifically to banks and their New Zealand groups. These thin capitalisation rules differ from the thin capitalisation rules applying to other taxpayers in three main ways. They are based on a minimum level of equity rather than a maximum level of debt, equity is measured net of offshore assets, and they require banks to have at least a 4% level of capital rather than, effectively, a 25% level of capital. A comparatively lower level of capital is appropriate for banking businesses. Australia has applied special thin capitalisation rules to banks since July 2001, comparing the net equity of banks in Australia to a benchmark to determine if any interest deductions should be disallowed. While that approach is conceptually similar to the New Zealand proposal, there are important technical differences between the rules to take account of the different circumstances between the two countries. The proposed thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are summarised in figure 1. 7 Figure 1: Thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks Compare this equity with a required level of equity based on 4% of the banking group’s New Zealand risk-weighted exposures Determine equity of the New Zealand banking group If actual equity < required equity interest deductions will be denied to the extent of the shortfall Determine the New Zealand banking group Detailed analysis Application of the rules The new rules will apply to foreign-owned registered banks. A “registered bank” is defined in section OB 1 as having the same meaning as in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989. Section FG 2(1) will determine whether the registered bank has sufficient non-resident ownership to make it subject to the New Zealand thin capitalisation rules under new section FG 8B. A foreign-owned registered bank will be required to determine its “NZ banking group” under section FG 8C. This group will include all resident entities and fixed establishments (generally branches) operating in New Zealand that would be required to consolidate with the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank for financial reporting purposes. Section FG 8C also provides an option to exclude life insurance companies from the NZ banking group. Entities that are part of a life insurance company’s group can likewise be carved out, provided that they do not have a main activity that is banking, financing or leasing and they are not holding companies of banking, financing or leasing companies. In respect of other “non-banking business” in the NZ banking group, goodwill associated with this business is not required to be taken as a deduction against the equity of the banking group (that is, it is not required to be fully equity funded) under section FG 8G. This covers goodwill acquired by a member of the banking group that is not in relation to banking, financing, leasing or life insurance businesses. 8 Companies carved out of the banking group will continue to be subject to the existing thin capitalisation rules in section FG 8 and interest allocation rules in section FH. Under new section FG 3, the reporting bank will make any adjustments in its income tax return for an annual total deduction for interest based on the calculation in section FG 8B. “Reporting bank” is defined in section FG 8D. The registered bank will be referred to as the reporting bank. If there are two or more registered banks in the NZ banking group, the banks must elect a reporting bank, under section FG 8D, which will be responsible for performing the NZ banking group’s thin capitalisation calculation. An example of a NZ banking group is shown in figure 2. Figure 2: Example of a NZ banking group Ultimate Foreign Parent Ultimate Foreign Parent Branch NZ Holding Company 1 NZ Holding Company 2 NZ Holding Company 3 NZ Registered Bank Company Leasing Company Life Insurance Company Bank Subsidiary Company Life Insurance Subsidiary Australia New Zealand In the example in figure 2, the NZ banking group would include: • Ultimate Foreign Parent Branch, • New Zealand Holding Company 1, • New Zealand Holding Company 2, • New Zealand Registered Bank Company, • Bank Subsidiary Company, and • Leasing Company. In the example, New Zealand Holding Company 3, Life Insurance Company and Life Insurance Subsidiary have elected the carve-out option, so are not part of the NZ banking group. The reporting bank will be New Zealand Registered Bank Company. 9 Under section FG 8C, if the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank does not include in an accounting consolidation any New Zealand resident entity or fixed establishment on the basis that its inclusion is not material in the context of its worldwide consolidation, that entity or fixed establishment will still be included in the NZ banking group. Measurement of the NZ banking group’s net equity The NZ banking group’s net equity is calculated under section FG 8G. The starting point will be the accounting values of shareholders’ equity and branch equity included in the financial statements of the members of the NZ banking group, based on accounting consolidation principles. The consolidation of the NZ banking group may or may not actually be required for accounting purposes. If there is no requirement to consolidate the NZ banking group for financial reporting purposes a “notional” accounting consolidation of the NZ banking group for the purposes of the tax rules is effectively needed. This may be based on an aggregation of consolidations of sibling groups. This means that where two or more sibling consolidated groups are aggregated, inter-group transactions will need to be eliminated. In the example given in figure 2, the Ultimate Foreign Parent Branch, the consolidated New Zealand Holding Company 1 group (includes New Zealand Registered Bank Company and Bank Subsidiary Company) and the consolidated New Zealand Holding Company 2 group (includes Leasing Company) would aggregate their shareholder equity and branch equity, ensuring that any inter-group transactions were eliminated. Furthermore, accounting equity in section FG 8G will be the accounting value of items considered to be equity for tax purposes but treated as debt for accounting purposes. Interest-free debt from a parent (in the main applying to smaller branch banks) will also be considered as equity in section FG 8G when it is not of a temporary nature. Items that are treated as equity for accounting purposes, but are debt for tax purposes, will be deducted from equity in the section FG 8G calculation. Section FG 8G also requires a number of additional deductions from the aggregated accounting equity described above. These deductions, summarised below, essentially follow the prudential deductions required by the regulator (the Reserve Bank of New Zealand). The requirement to make these deductions from equity is based on the premise that the NZ banking group must have enough equity to fully fund certain assets of the group. Deductions will be made from equity for: • Capital gain amounts: the accounting value of capital gains on the sale or disposal of intangible assets made from the start of the 2005 tax year when those gains arise from transactions between members of the NZ banking group and non-members that are associated with the NZ banking group. • Intangibles: the accounting value of intangible assets other than: (a) goodwill that relates to a business that is not banking, financing, leasing, or life insurance; and is acquired from a person who is not associated or relates to an entity that is acquired from an associated person \[as discussed under “carve-out”, above\]; (b) films or film rights; and (c) property that is depreciable property or is expected to become depreciable property. 10 • Policyholder liabilities: The accounting value of policyholder benefit liabilities and policyholder retained profits that contribute to equity. • Revaluation reserves: the accounting value of asset revaluation reserves included in equity. • Future tax benefits: the accounting value of future tax benefits that arise from tax losses or from timing or temporary differences that would result in tax losses if the item that gave rise to the timing or temporary difference was deductible in the current year. • Credit enhancements: credit enhancements (such as guarantee interests) provided to associated funds management and securitisation schemes, as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Capital Adequacy Framework. • Capital advances to connected persons: advances of a capital nature to a connected person, as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Capital Adequacy Framework. • Equity in the registered bank (or banks) held by carved out life companies and their carved out group • Equity in a carved out life group held by the registered bank (or banks) • Offshore investments: (a) Equity investments in non-residents, except: a. interests in foreign investment funds (FIF) for which the FIF income or loss is calculated using the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method; and b. shares in a grey list company that are listed on the official list of a recognised exchange and held on revenue account. (b) Notional offshore investment amounts: The deduction for offshore investments includes a calculation of the value of investments generating foreign tax credits in excess of a de minimis based on $5 million of foreign tax credits. This de minimis allows for a reasonable level of offshore lending that would not be subject to the proposed rules, while capturing significant lending that does not result in tax payable in New Zealand. Transitional rules will cover foreign tax credits on income after 1 July 2005. Correspondingly, the de minimis applying to foreign tax credits will be pro rated for the first year the rules apply. Measurement of net equity threshold using risk-weighted exposures Section FG 8H provides for the measurement of net equity threshold based on 4% of the NZ banking group’s risk-weighted exposures. Risk-weighted exposures, a regulatory concept, include the on and off-balance sheet assets of the NZ banking group adjusted for risk. Under section FG 8F, regulatory values are determined by applying the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Capital Adequacy Framework, which sets out the methodology and rates for risk-weighting assets. Resident entities and fixed establishments that are members of the NZ banking group that do not currently risk-weight their assets for the regulator will need to carry out this risk-weighting exercise for the new thin capitalisation calculation. 11 Measurement period The reporting bank will be required to measure the NZ banking group’s (the group determined at the measurement date) net equity and net equity threshold at least four times a year. These four measurement dates will match up with the reporting bank’s reporting quarters to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. If a bank is purchased by another bank, separate calculations will be made for any measurement periods before the acquisition, and then a joint calculation will be made for measurement periods after acquisition. Each bank will return its respective calculation pre-takeover. The joint calculation is made and returned by the bank designated to be the “reporting bank” for that latter period. The reporting bank will have the option, under section FG 8E, to measure the NZ banking group’s net equity and net equity threshold on a daily or monthly basis, rather than on the standard quarterly basis. Interest denial on shortfall between actual and required equity If for any quarter (or more frequent measurement date that the bank chooses) net equity is less than the net equity threshold based on 4% of risk-weighted exposures, there will be an adjustment under section FG 8B to the reporting bank’s annual total deductions in respect of that measurement period. Any adjustments in respect of measurement periods will be required in the reporting bank’s tax return for the income year in which the adjustments arise. The adjustment amount will be calculated under section FG 8B, using an average cost of funds interest rate which is based on the total interest expense of the NZ banking group divided by average quarterly interest-bearing debt for the group. The interest expense and total debt amounts will be based on financial reporting amounts after consolidation and, therefore, elimination of intra-group and inter-group transactions. The accounting policies of the group must be consistent with those of the reporting bank. Transitional arrangements Transitional rules will be available for the first income year, to take account of part- year application of the new rules for some banks. Transitional rules will also apply when a foreign-owned company registers as a bank in New Zealand and when a company ceases to operate as a registered bank in New Zealand. The new bank thin capitalisation rules will apply from 1 July 2005. For banks with a September financial year this will mean that the rules have application for part of their 2004-2005 income year, specifically in the last quarter of this year. This has implications, in particular, for the notional offshore investment calculation. 12 In the case of part-year application for the 2004-2005 income year, the rules allow for the notional offshore investment amount to be based on foreign tax credits claimed against income tax for the part year. The transitional rule in section FG 8G(3) allows for a calculation based only on the credits received in the part of the income year in which the new rules apply. The de minimis threshold of $5 million has also been adjusted accordingly. When there is a change in the bank treated as the reporting bank, a transitional rule also requires calculations to be made for all measurement periods since the last measurement period included by the former reporting bank in its previous income tax return. This is required when the two banks have different balance dates, which would otherwise cause a gap or an overlap. Exclusion from thin capitalisation rules and excess interest allocation rules Any taxpayer included in a NZ banking group will be excluded from the existing interest apportionment rule in section FG 8 as that taxpayer will now be subject to the new banking thin capitalisation rules. Members of the NZ banking group will also be excluded from the interest allocation rules currently in section FH 1. This is to ensure there is no doubling up in respect of adjustments resulting from excess debt levels. Specific anti-avoidance provisions The current thin capitalisation rules include a specific anti-avoidance provision in respect of temporary reductions in financial arrangements (liabilities) or increases in assets when the reduction or increase has the purpose or effect of defeating the intent of the thin capitalisation rules. Section FG 8I contains a similar rule for the specific bank thin capitalisation rules. However, given that these new rules applying to banks are based on minimum equity supporting the New Zealand assets rather than maximum debt supporting the New Zealand assets under the current rules, a different rule is applied. When there is a temporary reduction in assets or an increase in equity so as to defeat the intent and application of the new rules, that temporary reduction or increase will be excluded from the thin capitalisation calculations. 13 Changes to the tax depreciation rules 14 15 CHANGES TO THE TAX DEPRECIATION RULES (Clauses 5, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 60(21),(22),(23), 63, 93 and 94) Summary of the proposed amendments A number of amendments are being made to the tax depreciation rules to improve their operation. They include changes to the tax depreciation treatment of patents, the special tax depreciation rate rules, additions to the list of depreciable intangible property and extending deductibility for losses on buildings. The changes are intended to reduce compliance costs by clarifying and improving the application of various depreciation provisions and make the special depreciation rules more accessible to taxpayers. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2005-06 income year. Key features Patents New section EE 27B is being added to the Income Tax Act 2004. Its purpose is to better align the depreciation treatment of patents with useful life by ensuring that when a patent is granted, the first allowable depreciation deduction includes depreciation for the period from the date the patent application was lodged to the date the patent was granted. Special tax depreciation rate rules The operation of the special tax depreciation rules is being improved by increasing the flexibility available to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to consider special tax depreciation rate applications. Changes are to: • section EE 28 of the Income Tax Act 2004, to extend the special tax depreciation rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property; • section 91AE(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to clarify that the Commissioner may have regard to a range of factors in determining the estimated useful life of an asset; • section 91AE(3), to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special tax depreciation rate using a straight-line formula in addition to the currently legislated diminishing value formula; and • section 91AK(2), to allow the Commissioner to prescribe a special tax depreciation rate outside the six-month time limit if the taxpayer involved agrees to this. 16 Plant variety rights Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to add plant variety rights (granted under the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987) and the right to use plant variety rights to the list of depreciable intangible property. Losses on buildings Section EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act is being amended to allow deductions for losses resulting from buildings that are destroyed or rendered useless for the purposes of deriving gross income as the result of an event that is outside the control of a taxpayer (a “qualifying event”). Background An officials’ issues paper released in July, Repairs and maintenance to the tax depreciation rules, invited consultation on how to improve the tax rules on depreciation of assets. It suggested ways of reducing possible tax biases, a matter still under consideration, and resolving practical problems with the application of the rules, the focus of the changes in this bill, which are in response to specific concerns raised by taxpayers. Detailed analysis Patents (Clauses 20, 21, 25 and 60(21)) Under current tax law, a patent is fixed-life intangible property, which means that depreciation of a patent is over its legal life – a period of twenty years (or 240 months). Depreciation is allowed when a patent is used or is available for use. Therefore the earliest time at which a patent can be depreciated is in the year it is granted. However, the time taken for a patent to be granted from the date a complete application is lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand can be significant. When granted legal life a patent applies from the date of the application, which will result in its life being less than twenty years from the date of grant. The tax rules accommodate this by reducing the legal life by the time taken for a patent to be granted. This allows higher annual depreciation deductions over the remaining life of the patent than would otherwise be the case. A more economically correct approach, which improves the net present value of the depreciation deductions, is to allow depreciation relating to the portion of a patent’s life that is expended in the period that the patent is pending to be claimed in the first income year in which depreciation is allowed. An amendment to allow this is being made via the addition of new section EE 27B of the Income Tax Act 2004. The new section contains a rule for calculating depreciation in respect of the first income year the patent is used or is available to be used. In that first year, a taxpayer will be able to claim the annual deduction for the year (calculated using the formula in section EE 27B(3)) as well as an “uplift” amount relating to the period (in months) the patent was pending. The formula for calculating the uplift is provided in section EE 27B(4)(a). In every other year, the taxpayer will be able to claim an annual deduction calculated 17 in accordance with the formula in section EE 27B(3). How these new rules would work in practice is outlined in example 1. Example 1: Patent depreciation deductions when patent is granted to original applicant – current and proposed rules A complete application for a patent is lodged on 1 April 2005. The application is granted on 1 April 2008. The legal life of the patent, once granted, begins on 1 April 2005 which means that at the time of grant the patent has a remaining legal life of 17 years under the current rules. The table outlines the deductions under the current rules and under the proposed changes: Year Current (Rate = 1/17) Proposed (Rate = 1/20) Application lodged 1/4/05 $0 $0 1/4/06 $0 $0 1/4/07 $0 $0 Patent granted 1/4/08 $588 $2,000 1/4/09 $588 $500 1/4/10 $588 $500 1/4/11 $588 $500 1/4/12 $588 $500 1/4/13 $588 $500 1/4/14 $588 $500 1/4/15 $588 $500 1/4/16 $588 $500 1/4/17 $588 $500 1/4/18 $588 $500 1/4/19 $588 $500 1/4/20 $588 $500 1/4/21 $588 $500 1/4/22 $588 $500 1/4/23 $588 $500 1/4/24 $588 $500 Total cost $10,000 $10,000 Under the proposed changes there may be instances, however, when ownership of a patent application changes during the patenting process such that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who made the original application. In this circumstance, under section EE 27B(5), the amount of the uplift will be amended so that the depreciation for the period the patent is pending is limited to the date that ownership of the application changed (and not the date the application was lodged). This is the correct result as the person to whom the patent is granted will have held the “Uplift” of $1,500 for yrs 1-3 plus $500 annual deduction for yr 4 (yr of grant) 18 application only for a certain period of time and should, therefore, not be entitled to a depreciation uplift, in the first year, for the period the application was held by the person who originally applied for the patent. The annual depreciation deduction for such a taxpayer (the formula in section EE 27B(3)) will be based on legal life of twenty years (240 months), less the time that the patent application was held by the original applicant (again, in months). Example 2 demonstrates this. Example 2: Patent depreciation deductions when patent is not granted to original applicant – current and proposed rules A lodges a complete application for a patent on 1 April 2005. The application is sold to B on 1 April 2006 and the patent is granted on 1 April 2008. B is the holder of the patent. The legal life of the patent, once granted, begins on 1 April 2005. B has held the application for a period of two years prior to grant. A has held the application for one year. The life to B should, therefore, be discounted by one year (to 19 years or 228 months) when applying the formulas in section EE 27B. The depreciation uplift B will receive is 2/19 (or 24/228) of the cost. The annual deduction in each year will be 1/19 (12/228) of the cost. The table outlines the deductions under the current rules and under the proposed changes: Year Current (Rate = 1/17) Proposed (Rate = 1/19) Application lodged by A 1/4/05 $0 $0 B acquires application 1/4/06 $0 $0 1/4/07 $0 $0 Patent granted to B 1/4/08 $588 $1,579 1/4/09 $588 $526 1/4/10 $588 $526 1/4/11 $588 $526 1/4/12 $588 $526 1/4/13 $588 $526 1/4/14 $588 $526 1/4/15 $588 $526 1/4/16 $588 $526 1/4/17 $588 $526 1/4/18 $588 $526 1/4/19 $588 $526 1/4/20 $588 $526 1/4/21 $588 $526 1/4/22 $588 $526 1/4/23 $588 $526 1/4/24 $588 $526 Total cost $10,000 $10,000 “Uplift” of $1,053 for 2 yrs application is held by B plus $526 annual deduction in year of grant 19 The amendments will apply only to new grants of patents in New Zealand, in the 2005-06 and later income years. The changes will not apply when, for example, a patent is acquired in the 2005-06 income year but has been used previously, because the intent of the changes is to mirror the loss of economic life during the patenting process. For those taxpayers the existing formula of depreciating over the remaining legal life (in section EE 27(2)) will continue to apply. Special tax depreciation rate rules (Clauses 19, 22, 93 and 94) Under the special tax depreciation rules, taxpayers can apply for depreciation rates that are higher (or lower) than those prescribed by Inland Revenue if they consider the prescribed general depreciation rate is substantially different from the rate that should apply. This may arise, for example, if depreciable property is being used in a way that is different from that considered by Inland Revenue when determining a general economic depreciation rate for the property. A special rate may also be applicable if the actual economic life of depreciable property is dependent on certain factors, such as the length of a taxpayer’s income-earning process or business (and cannot be salvaged at the end of it). At present, the basis on which the Commissioner will issue special tax depreciation rates requires taxpayers to identify, for example, the actual economic life of depreciable property with a high degree of certainty. This has led to concerns that this basis is too rigid. That is, if actual economic life cannot be clearly ascertained, a special tax depreciation rate will generally not be allowed. The changes will allow the Commissioner greater flexibility in considering special tax depreciation rate applications if he is reasonably satisfied that, in the circumstances, the actual economic life of depreciable property differs significantly to the estimate of economic life used to prescribe the general tax depreciation rate (estimated useful life). This would include taking into account assessments of economic life based on valuers’ reports and other available best estimates (for example, from different depreciation methods). However, the current legislation guiding the Commissioner on the factors that he may have regard to in this area is unclear. The changes are intended to clarify this. At present, in section 91AE(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the formula in section EE 25(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the rate of depreciation (if any) that the person uses for financial reporting purposes. How this provision is meant to be interpreted is unclear because financial reporting depreciation rates can differ significantly from tax depreciation rates, simply because of the differences in the underlying formula used or even the method – for example, diminishing value versus straight-line. In such cases the more important piece of information is likely to be the estimate of useful life and how this is calculated. To that effect, section 91AE(2) is being amended to explicitly allow the Commissioner to have regard to any factors that are relevant in determining estimated useful life. This will include, as noted above, estimates from independent valuers. 20 Another concern is whether, under section 91AE(3), the Commissioner can prescribe a special tax depreciation rate that is not determined using the legislated diminishing value formula (the formula in EE 25(4)). This has implications when, for example, a taxpayer requests a straight-line rate to be calculated without reference to the diminishing value formula. Changes are therefore proposed to section 91AE(3) to allow the Commissioner to prescribe special tax depreciation rates using a straight- line method from the outset, instead of setting a diminishing value rate and then prescribing a straight-line equivalent. The Commissioner will also be allowed greater flexibility to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rates outside the current six-month time bar, if an applicant agrees to such an extension. Owing to the potentially complex nature of some special and provisional tax depreciation rate determinations, the six-month deadline can be breached. It is currently unclear whether determinations issued after the time limit has lapsed are valid under current legislation. Section 91AK(2) is being amended to enable the Commissioner, in legislation, to exceed the six-month time limit with the approval of the taxpayer concerned. Finally, section EE 28 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is being amended to extend the special tax depreciation rules to fixed-life intangible property (property whose economic life is equated with legal life, for tax purposes) if a taxpayer is able to prove that the economic life of the property will be significantly less than its legal life. This is in response to taxpayer concerns that in the case of fixed-life intangible property such as patents, the economic life of the patent may be different from its legal life, owing to factors such as competitors finding ways to work around the patent. The proposed amendment will allow the Commissioner to consider special tax depreciation rate applications in respect of fixed-life intangible property. However, the onus will remain on the taxpayer to prove that such a determination is warranted. The amendments will apply to applications for special tax depreciation rates that are made in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. Plant variety rights (Clauses 5, 60(22) and 63) A grant of plant variety rights, under the Plant Varieties Act 1987, gives the holder the exclusive right to produce for sale and to sell propagated material of the plant variety for a period of twenty or twenty-three years, depending on the plant material. Currently, plant variety rights and the right to use plant variety rights are not listed on Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and are, therefore, not depreciable, even though they offer similar protection over intellectual property to a patent, which is depreciable. Therefore plant variety rights and the right to use plant variety rights are being included in Schedule 17 as depreciable intangible property. Plant variety rights will be fixed-life intangible property with depreciation over the property’s legal life. The inclusion of plant variety rights as depreciable intangible property will result in any royalties from the use of such property being taxable. This is consistent with the tax treatment of other types of intangible property listed in Schedule 17. Consequently, the “royalty” definition in section CC 9(2)(a) is being amended to include a reference to plant variety rights. 21 The proposed amendments will apply to plant variety rights granted, and rights to use plant variety rights acquired, in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. Losses on buildings (Clauses 24 and 60(23)) Currently, under section EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004, if a building is destroyed, demolished or otherwise disposed of for a loss, no deduction is allowed in respect of the depreciation loss under the tax depreciation rules. This section is being amended to allow a deduction for losses on buildings where a building has been destroyed or rendered useless for the purpose of deriving gross income owing to an event that is outside the control of a taxpayer – a “qualifying event”. A definition of “qualifying event” is to be inserted into section OB 1. The definition of “qualifying event” will encompass any unexpected event that either results in, or brings about, the destruction of a person’s building or renders it useless and where the destruction or damage is not caused by the action or failure to act of the person, or their agent, or an associated person. This will include events such as earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters. The proposed amendments will apply to losses on buildings arising from a “qualifying event” (under the preceding definition) in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was before Parliament when the present bill was introduced, contains amendments allowing deductibility for losses arising from the destruction of certain farming land improvements (under sections DO 4, DO 5 and DP 3) as a result of the February and July storms. At a later stage those provisions will be extended to losses arising from a qualifying event, as defined above, with application from the 2005-06 income year. 22 23 Death and asset transfers 24 25 DEATH AND ASSET TRANSFERS (Clauses 11, 18, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 47, 48, 60(5) & (12), and 100) Summary of proposed amendments The law is being clarified by the introduction of generic rules for the income tax treatment of “in kind” or “in specie” distributions and gifts, including transfers of assets and liabilities on a taxpayer’s death. Such distributions, gifts and transfers will be treated as disposals and acquisitions at market value. The measure will have tax implications only to the extent the property is inside the tax base to start with. The effect of the new rules on the estates of deceased individuals is that there will generally be two market value transfers: one at the time of a taxpayer’s death, and one on the subsequent distribution of the estate to beneficiaries. Exclusions will apply to estates left to spouses and close relatives of the deceased. “Roll-over” relief will also be available for forestry assets in an estate when the forest is left to a close relative. Application date The provisions will apply from the beginning of the 2004-05 income year. Past transactions will not be disturbed when the tax base is not at risk and the tax law is uncertain. Key features A new subpart FI of the Income Tax Act 2004 will provide generic rules for the tax treatment of “in kind” or “in specie” distributions and gifts, including transfers of assets following a taxpayer’s death. The core proposal is that assets and liabilities distributed or transferred will be deemed to be disposed of and acquired at market value. Thus, unless an exception applies, there will be two valuation points in respect of each deceased individual’s estate: one on the date of death, and the other when the estate is distributed. The exceptions proposed are: • Section FI 5 provides that when the beneficiary of an estate is the spouse or de facto partner of the deceased, assets and liabilities are transferred at the book values that they have for tax purposes. (This approach to valuation is known as roll-over relief.) • Section FI 6 provides that for simple estates when the assets are left either to charity or to close relations of the deceased, roll-over relief will apply on the distribution of the estate. The transfer of the assets from the deceased to the administrator or executor of the estate will be the market value, unless any of the other exceptions apply. 26 • Section FI 7 provides roll-over relief both on the date of death and when the estate is distributed for forestry assets where the beneficiaries of the estate are close relations of the deceased. The first two exceptions will also apply when there are specific legacies to third persons of assets that are not in the tax base. Generally, a taxpayer’s death will not, in itself, lead to an asset being brought into the tax base. While the rule applies to all assets, it has relevance only to the extent the assets are in the tax base, or enter the tax base later. A particular example of this is the treatment of land held on capital account, the proceeds of which would be assessable if the property was sold within ten years of acquisition. Special provisions will ensure that death by itself does not trigger this ten-year rule. Unexpired accrual expenditure will not be required to be valued at market value. It can continue to be valued at cost less the amount amortised. Use-of-money interest will not be imposed in relation to a deceased individual’s tax liability in the year of death, so long as all tax due is paid by the due dates. A savings provision will ensure that the tax treatment of past deaths and distributions from trusts and estates will not be disturbed when: • the tax base is protected by the position that was taken, either because the tax book values of the assets and liabilities were rolled over, or because a market value exercise was done; and • the beneficiaries of the trust or estate are limited to persons that are New Zealand-resident for taxation purposes and who are not exempt from income tax; and • the underlying tax law was not clear. Background The tax law in the area of “in kind” distributions, gifts and transfers on the death of a taxpayer is currently neither clear nor consistent. Cases in recent years have highlighted this lack of clarity, and there have been repeated calls to clarify the tax treatment of assets and liabilities on the death of a taxpayer and their subsequent distribution to the beneficiaries. For example, it seems reasonably clear that a beneficiary has no depreciation cost base for assets distributed by a trust, although the trustees are required to treat the distribution of the assets as a disposal at market value. These issues were also raised by the Valabh Committee in its 1992 report, Tax Accounting Issues. An officials’ issues paper, Tax Implications of Certain Asset Transfers, was published in April 2003, and the proposals in that paper were modified as a result of submissions received. The paper did not discuss GST issues, which are being considered in a separate policy project. 27 At present, a number of specific statutory rules address the tax consequences of distributions and asset transfers resulting from death but, as a group, they are not coherent or comprehensive. Some were introduced as ad hoc responses to specific base maintenance concerns. Detailed analysis Section FI 1 Disposals and resulting acquisitions to which subpart FI applies To ensure comprehensive and generic rules, the new subpart will provide a disposal value and an acquisition cost price of property (defined to include liabilities) that are: • distributions from a trustee to a beneficiary of a trust; • “in kind” or “in specie” distributions from a company to a shareholder; • gifts; • transfers to an administrator or executor of a deceased estate; and • distributions by an administrator, executor or trustee of a deceased estate to a beneficiary, including an obligation to make a payment under a credit contract. Section FI 2 Disposal and resulting acquisition of property treated as occurring at market value The general rule is that the disposal value and the acquisition cost price of the distributions and transfers to which subpart FI refers are at market value. The law already provides that some transfers and distributions are valued at market – for example, depreciable property distributed by a trust is a market value disposal, and extending this concept to all such transactions will provide consistency. Section FI 3 Market value of property to recipient The value that is used for the disposal must also be used for the acquisition. Section FI 4 Date on which disposal and resulting acquisition treated as occurring The date of the disposal and acquisition for tax purposes will generally be the date a person disposes of the property. Subsection (2) provides that transfers upon death are treated as occurring immediately before to death. Section FI 5 Disposal and resulting acquisition of property by spouse or de facto partner and others on death of person Relief is introduced for simple estates in order to reduce compliance costs. 28 When the only beneficiary of an estate is the spouse or de facto partner of the deceased, the transfer of assets and liabilities to the administrator or executor and the subsequent transfer to the beneficiaries will be treated as if they were matrimonial property settlements to which subpart FF applies. In other words, the assets and liabilities will be treated as if they had belonged to the surviving spouse or de facto partner since they were acquired by the deceased taxpayer. This will have the effect of “rolling over” the property at the tax book value. The exclusion from the market rule will continue to apply even when there are other beneficiaries, so long as they receive property that is not in the tax base. Section FI 6 Special rules for distributions from estates of certain deceased persons When certain conditions are met, a distribution from the administrator or executor to the beneficiaries is treated as if it were a matrimonial property settlement to which subpart FF applies. In other words, the assets and liabilities will be treated as if they had belonged to the beneficiary from the date when they were transferred at market value to the administrator or executor. This will have the effect of “rolling over” the property at the tax book value. The conditions for this exception applying are: • the only beneficiaries of an estate are persons related to the deceased to the second degree or are charities; and • the estate does not establish any life interests; and • the terms of the will or intestacy require that no property of the deceased taxpayer be held in trust; and • in a tax year during which the property is subject to administration or executorship or in which the property is held in trust for this purpose, the net income of the estate is distributed beneficially to the maximum extent possible. The exclusion from the market rule will continue to apply when there are other beneficiaries, so long as they receive property that is not in the tax base. Again, the rationale for this exclusion is to reduce compliance costs. Section FI 7 Disposal and resulting acquisition of property that is standing timber When standing timber owned by the deceased is left either specifically or generally to a person who is related to the second degree, the transfer of the forest to the administrator or executor of an estate and the subsequent transfer to the beneficiary will be treated as if they were matrimonial property settlements to which subpart FF applies. In other words, the assets and liabilities will be treated as if they had belonged to the beneficiary since they were acquired by the deceased taxpayer. This will have the effect of “rolling over” the property at the tax book value. This exclusion recognises that immature forests, in particular, are difficult to value. 29 Section FI 8 Relationship of section FI 3 to subpart CB It is not the intention that a taxpayer’s death should result in an asset being brought into the tax base merely because the ten-year period for land held on capital account has not elapsed. Relief will apply when land owned by the deceased, which if sold would be caught by any of the subpart CB ten-year “tainting” rules (sections CB 7, CB 8, CB 9 and CB 12), is left either specifically or generally to a person who is related to the second degree. Both the transfer of assets and liabilities to the administrator or executor of an estate (section FI 1(2)(d)) and the subsequent transfer to the beneficiaries (section FI 1(2)(e)) will be treated as if they were matrimonial property settlements under subpart FF if the land is then disposed of within ten years of its acquisition by the relative in a fashion that triggers any of the ten-year tainting rules. Section FI 9 Special rules for in kind distribution of property by company Section FI 9 applies when a company distributes assets “in kind” or “in specie” to shareholders, whether or not by way of a dividend. Such a distribution is treated as a disposal and acquisition on the day it occurs, at the market value on that day. This provision is a clarification of the existing law. There is currently doubt that current law provides a tax cost base for the shareholder when assets are distributed in specie. This can, for example, cause difficulties when the asset is used by the shareholder in a business, and the shareholder wishes to claim depreciation on it. Section FI 10 Relationship of subpart FI to unexpired prepayments Section EA 3 provides that the unexpired portions of certain prepayments are added to income at the end of the year. The unexpired portions are allowed as deductions in the following year. Section FI 10 provides that when the taxpayer who claimed a deduction for these types of expenditure dies, the unexpired portions do not need to be revalued at market value under sections FI 1 and FI 2. The adjustments should continue to be made on the basis of cost, less the amount amortised. The tax return of the deceased adds these amounts back as income and the estate receives a corresponding deduction. Again, the provision is inserted for compliance cost reasons. Section FI 11-13 Death or trust distributions occurring before beginning of 2005- 06 income year Sections FI 11 to 13, when read together with the general savings rule in the Income Tax Act 2004 (section YA 3), provide that certain past tax treatments are saved. These are generally when the past treatment was uncertain and the tax base is not at risk. 30 Section FI 11 applies when the following criteria are met: • The Income Tax Act does not explicitly specify a treatment for both the deceased and the executor or trustee. • The death occurred before the beginning of the deceased’s 2005-06 income year. • The beneficiaries are New Zealand resident taxpayers. If the same valuation method was used for both the disposal by the deceased taxpayer and the acquisition by the administrators or executors, and that valuation was either at market value or a roll-over, those valuations will be accepted as appropriate. Section FI 12 provides the same rules for distributions from trusts when the distribution occurred before the date of introduction of this legislation. Section FI 13 provides similar rules for the period between the date of introduction of this legislation and the beginning of the trust’s 2005-06 income year, but when the Tax Act specifies a treatment by the trustees on the distribution, that treatment will also apply to beneficiaries. The particular issues here concern depreciable property, which the Tax Act specifies is disposed of at market value, but does not provide a value for the beneficiary’s acquisition. Use-of-money interest The definition of “date interest starts” in section 120C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to ensure that use-of-money interest will not be imposed in relation to a deceased individual’s tax liability in the year of death, as long as provisional and terminal tax payments are made by due date. This is a concessionary measure which ensures that estates will not incur unexpected use-of-money interest liabilities when a taxpayer’s death triggers a tax liability. Consequential amendments Subpart FI is a comprehensive set of rules which provide for the tax treatment of “in kind” or “in specie” distributions, including the transfers of assets upon a taxpayer’s death. Accordingly, a number of specific provisions which address specific transactions are being repealed. Other sections are being amended to make them consistent with the new rules. Sections CZ 6(3), EC 4, EE 40(7), EW 29(13), EW 36(1)(b)(i), EW 39, EW 41(1)(b)(i), EW 44, EX 55 and GD 2 are repealed. Sections EH 5(4), EH 19(2), EH 67(4), EH 50(2), FB 3 and GD 14(3)(c) are amended. 31 Imputation credit shopping 32 33 IMPUTATION CREDIT SHOPPING (Clauses 6, 46, 54, 55, 56, 60, 75, 76, 77, 78 and 80) Summary of proposed amendments The dividend and imputation rules are being amended to ensure that, in certain circumstances, when a company is sold the benefits of any prepaid tax will stay with the original group that paid the tax and cannot be refunded. The changes have been designed as a revenue protection measure. Although the transactions targeted by the proposed legislation arguably fall foul of the current anti-avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act, the amendments ensure that imputation credits earned by one group of companies cannot effectively be paid to a different group’s shareholders. Tax policy officials have described these transactions as “imputation credit shopping”. Companies that leave wholly owned groups that have available net losses in excess of $1 million may elect that a debit balance in their imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax in excess of their imputation credit account’s credit balance be transferred to another New Zealand group company immediately before leaving the group. If such an election is not made and the company then joins another wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders, a final tax will be payable that cannot be creditable against other tax liabilities of the company or group. Other amendments: • modify the imputation credit anti-streaming rule; • clarify that share splits cannot be treated as dividends; and • as a remedial measure, clarify that all payments of income tax can create imputation credits. Application date The revenue base protection amendments, once enacted, will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. The remedial measure will to apply from 1 April 1995. Key features New section ME 9B applies to companies leaving wholly owned groups that have available net losses in excess of $1 million at the end of the previous tax year. Immediately before leaving the group, a company may elect that a debit balance in its imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax, to the extent the amount exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account, may be transferred to another company in its original group. Alternatively, the company that leaves may 34 elect to pay further income tax of an amount equal to the debit balance or excess amount of prepaid tax. This further income tax will be a final tax and cannot be credited against other tax liabilities, as it can under section ME 9. The reason is that, in this case, the further income tax is to offset the tax benefit that has already been received by the leaving group’s shareholders in the form of imputation credits. New section ME 9C applies to the companies that did not elect to transfer the debit balance or excess prepaid tax and did not make a payment of further income tax. If such a company then joins a new wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders it will be required to make a payment of further income tax equal to the debit balance in its imputation credit account, or the amount of prepaid tax to the extent it exceeds its credit balance in its imputation credit account. Again, as in section ME 9B, further income tax will not be creditable against other tax liabilities because this further income tax is to offset the tax benefit received by the leaving group’s shareholders in the form of imputation credits. Section CD 7 is being amended to prevent share splits under section 48(b) or (c) of the Companies Act 1993 from being treated as a dividend. Section GC 22(4)(b) is being amended to ensure that the anti-imputation credit streaming rules apply when there is an account advantage that may not also be accompanied by a tax credit advantage. Section ME 4(1)(l) is added to include any payment to an account with Inland Revenue that has not created a credit otherwise under section ME 4. This is to include payments made to offset a debit created by the attachment of imputation credits to dividends by a company that is not a provisional taxpayer. Background Under the classical dividend system that applied in New Zealand until 1988, two amounts of tax were levied on company profits: first, as they were earned, by way of company tax, and again when they were distributed as dividends to the shareholders. The imputation rules have the effect of relieving this double taxation. A New Zealand company can attach imputation credits to dividends paid to shareholders representing the tax paid by it. Shareholders can use these imputation credits to alleviate the taxation obligations in respect of the dividend. There are detailed provisions within the imputation rules to ensure that, among other things, the shareholders who were the ones at the time the tax was paid are the same shareholders who receive the imputation credits. Obviously, this is in general terms only, since it is not always practicable to track individual shareholders, particularly of widely held companies. Companies are required to maintain a record of the payments of tax and the tax passed on to shareholders through an imputation credit account. 35 There are also specific provisions within the imputation rules that govern tax refunds. Essentially, a refund may not be claimed unless the company concerned has an equivalent level of imputation credits. 2 This is to ensure the tax paid by a company is not refunded when the imputation credits created by the original payment have already been attached to dividends paid to shareholders. The imputation rules do not prevent a company prepaying its income tax in order to create imputation credits that it can attach to its dividends. Typically, this happens when the company is in a loss situation. Several companies have done this in the past, presumably in order to enhance the value of their shares, as dividends with imputation credits are worth more than dividends with no credits. They have also done it, presumably, in circumstances where they anticipate paying income tax in the reasonable future. When tax has been prepaid in this fashion, use-of-money interest is not payable, on the basis that the shareholders have actually used the imputation credits to reduce their tax liability. There is no policy objection to these prepayments. Transactions that are contrary to policy intent It had always been the intention that a tax overpayment not matched by an equivalent credit balance in the imputation credit account would not be refunded but used to offset a tax liability of the company owned by the shareholders that had received the imputation credits. There are two types of transactions, however, that run contrary to the underlying policy intent of the imputation rules. They involve the use of a special purpose subsidiary. The first type involves a special purpose subsidiary with a prepaid tax amount and imputation credit account with no imputation credits. It is sold to a consolidated group with surplus imputation credits. 3 The special purpose subsidiary then joins the consolidated group and as the group has imputation credits in excess of the prepaid tax amount, a refund of the tax is made. For example, Company A, owned by Company X, has prepaid tax of $300 and no imputation credits in its imputation credit account. Company A is sold to Company Y, which is part of a consolidated group with a credit balance of $500. Company A joins Company Y’s consolidated group. 2 When a refund is made, a debit arises to the imputation credit account. 3 As there is prepaid tax and no imputation credits in the imputation credit account, this would indicate that tax prepayment was made to square up an imputation credit account. The square-up would have been necessary because imputation credits had been attached to dividends and yet no underlying tax had been paid previously. Company X Company Y A A 36 A comparison is made between the amount of prepaid tax in Company A, $300, with the credit balance of the imputation credit account of the consolidated group – $500. As the credit balance exceeds the prepaid tax, a refund is released and the consolidated group’s imputation credit account debited by the amount of the refund. A’s Tax Account Consolidated group’s ICA 333 500 Refund 333 Refund 333 The second type of transaction is more complicated. Here a special purpose subsidiary of the company with a prepaid tax amount and an empty imputation credit account is created. The special purpose subsidiary pays a fully imputed taxable bonus issue in the form of a share split to its parent company. The parent company’s imputation credit account now has sufficient imputation credits so that the prepayment of tax can be refunded. While the special purpose subsidiary has an equivalent debit balance in its imputation credit account, the final step is that the company is sold to and amalgamated with a company with surplus imputation credits. For example, Company A, with prepaid tax of $300, no imputation credits and owned by Company X, now incorporates a special purpose subsidiary Z. Special purpose subsidiary Z makes a share split, electing it to be a taxable bonus issue 4 with a value of $609 and so attaching imputation credits of $300. This causes a debit to Z’s imputation credit account of $300 with a corresponding credit to A’s imputation credit account. Now that A has a credit balance of $300 in its imputation credit account, it can receive a refund of its prepaid tax. 4 There is an argument, however, under current law, that a share split is not a bonus issue and therefore cannot be a taxable bonus issue. Company X Company X A A Z 37 Z, with a debit balance in its imputation credit account of $300, is sold to Company Y, which, as before, has a credit balance of $500 in its imputation credit account. Company Y and Company Z then amalgamate, and Company Y, as the amalgamated company, puts its debit balance into its imputation credit account. Detailed analysis The amendments are aimed primarily at companies that have no immediate expectation of being liable to income tax but prepay tax to impute dividends to shareholders and then engage in transactions to have the prepaid tax refunded to them in some way. The mechanisms, to date, have involved the sale of a company having either a debit balance in its imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account to another company that has imputation credits surplus to its immediate needs. The end result is that, in effect, imputation credits are transferred from the shareholders of the imputation-rich company to the shareholders of the imputation- poor company. This is contrary to the intent of the imputation rules, that imputation credits should be of benefit only to the shareholders of the company that paid the tax in the first place. It is for this reason that, under present law, breaches in excess of 66% in shareholder continuity trigger losses in imputation credits. Because of the need for an explicit buttress for the shareholder continuity rules but balanced by the concern that non-tax driven transactions should not be disturbed, the amendments are targeted at wholly owned groups that have group losses in excess of $1 million. Loss-making groups are the most likely to be at risk of entering into such transactions because they are more likely to impute dividends without an expectation of having taxable income. Therefore section ME 9B is being inserted to give companies that leave wholly owned groups with accumulated losses in excess of $1 million in the last tax year the ability to transfer immediately, before sale, any debit balance in their imputation credit account or an amount of prepaid tax in excess of their imputation credit account’s credit balance to another company within the original wholly owned group. Company A Company Y Z Z 38 This is to allow the original group’s shareholders to retain the benefit of the amount of prepaid tax that enabled their dividends to be imputed. Similarly, with any debit balance, they retain the obligation to pay tax by 31 March, since this obligation arose because the group has utilised the imputation credits. A “leaving company” may instead choose to pay further income tax equal to the amount of the debit balance or the excess prepaid tax. It is not expected this will be the preferred option as further income tax will be a final tax and not creditable against other tax liabilities. As the prepayment would otherwise have value to the vendor group, this is unlikely to happen in practice. Section ME 4(1)(cb) and (cc) are being added to allow the transfer of the debit balance or the payment of further income tax to clear the debit balance to create an imputation credit to the account of the leaving company. Section ME 4(2)(bb) is also being added to make the creation of the imputation credit effective from the date the leaving company ceases to be a member of a wholly owned group in the case of a transfer or the date the payment of further income tax is made, as applicable. To buttress section ME 9B, section ME 9C provides that imputation credit companies that leave wholly owned groups that have available net losses in excess of $1 million and join another wholly owned group with different ultimate shareholders will be required to make a payment of further income tax equal to any debit balance in the joining company’s imputation credit account or any amount of prepaid tax that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account. The further income tax will not be creditable to other tax liabilities. Given that there will be an option to transfer the debit balance or excess prepaid tax immediately before the company leaves the “former group” and joins the “new group” it is expected that a liability to further tax will arise only in exceptional cases. Sections 101 and 140B are being amended to include sections ME 9B and ME 9C within their scope. Tax pooling accounts Entitlements to funds in a tax pooling account are included in the quantification of an “excess entitlement” in ME 9B (3) and ME 9C (4). This is because deposits to a tax pooling account create imputation credits in the same way as voluntary or prepayments of tax. To prevent the imposition of further income tax, however, if any amounts of excess entitlement are held by a company that leaves a wholly owned group with $1 million available net losses in a previous tax year and then joins a wholly owned group with different ultimate owners, a transfer in the tax pool by the leaving company will be necessary. As the operation of tax pooling accounts are outside the direct control of Inland Revenue, this transfer will need to be initiated by the leaving company to ensure there is no liability to further income tax when joining a wholly owned group with different ultimate owners. 39 Clarification that a share split cannot be a dividend In the transactions discussed in the background, a common feature is the use of a share split which, when an election is made for it to be a taxable bonus issue, can have imputation credits attached. This is because taxable bonus issues are treated as dividends for income tax purposes. From the commentary accompanying the changes to the Income Tax Act as a result of the Companies Act 1993, it is clear that it was always envisaged that a share split be a non-taxable bonus issue. The 1993 discussion document Taxation Implications of Company Law Reform commented on the amendment of the “bonus issue” definition: With the elimination of company law distinctions between capital reserves and retained earnings, there is no need to maintain a tax distinction between share splits and non-taxable bonus issues. Therefore, Income Tax Act references to non-taxable bonus issues will also be applicable to share splits. 5 Further, the discussion document states that: The definition of “non-taxable bonus issue” will be retained, but will in future be synonymous with a share split. 6 Thus it appears that it was not anticipated that a share split should be treated as a taxable bonus issue and, therefore, a dividend to which imputation credits could be attached. Instead it appears that share splits were intended to be a non-taxable bonus issue, which are not treated as dividends. Contrary to the original intention, it appears that there is at least an arguable case that a share split can be a bonus issue which, on election, can become a taxable bonus issue and then can have imputation credits attached. For this reason, section CD 7(1) is being amended to ensure that share splits under section 48(b) or (c) of the Companies Act 1993, or similar subdivision of shares by companies not registered under the Companies Act 1993, such as foreign companies or unit trusts, cannot be treated as dividends. Strengthening the anti-imputation credit streaming rule It appears that the current anti-imputation credit streaming rule may not apply to imputation credit shopping transactions. The rules appear not to envisage a situation where an arrangement could create an advantage to an imputation credit account – an “account advantage” – without also creating a credit for use against an income tax liability – a “tax credit advantage”. 5 Part 1 – para 4.2.4 6 Part 2 – Explanatory Notes to section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 40 In the transactions discussed earlier in the background, the taxable bonus issue to which imputation credits are attached is paid to a wholly owned group member and is therefore exempt from income tax. As there is no tax credit advantage, the anti- streaming rules appear not to apply, even though there is an account advantage. To buttress the other proposed amendments, section GC 22(4)(b) is being amended to apply where there is an account advantage, regardless of whether there is also a tax credit advantage. Clarification that all payments of income tax create imputation credits A subsidiary issue that has arisen during the review of these transactions is that the legislation may not allow all payments of income tax to create imputation credits. In particular, according to the current provisional tax rules, tax payments made by companies that are not provisional taxpayers are not considered payments of provisional tax. Therefore, under the current provisions, no equivalent imputation credit arises. The companies most likely to be affected by this would be ones that have no tax liability because of accumulated losses, but impute dividends to shareholders. The voluntary prepayments of tax are made with the expectation that this would square up the imputation credit account after attaching imputation credits to dividends. In other words, the prepaid tax amount is intended to pay for the tax benefit the shareholders receive. It appears, however, that this is not the case and that voluntary payments of tax do not create imputation credits, contrary to the original policy intent. Section ME 4(1)(l) and ME 4(2)(j) are therefore being added to ensure that all payments of income tax made can create imputation credits, regardless of whether the company was a provisional taxpayer or not. The date of the credit is to arise is the date the payment is made to Inland Revenue. Such amendments are retrospective in application to 1 April 1995, to ensure that no imputation credits can be disallowed, contrary to the original policy intent. 41 Privilege – right of non-disclosure for tax advice 42 43 PRIVILEGE – RIGHT OF NON-DISCLOSURE FOR TAX ADVICE (Clauses 82, 83, 84 and 89) Summary of proposed amendments A statutory “privilege” or a right not to disclose certain documents, will apply for tax advice provided by tax advisors. It will apply to communications between advisors and their clients for the main purpose of providing or receiving tax advice. The non-disclosure right will be subject to a number of exclusions such as for factual information, debt collection advice, accounting and tax work papers and matters of fraud. Tax advice is not expected to include such matters as valuation and investment advice. The amendments do not affect legal professional privilege. Application date The new non-disclosure right will apply to requests for information made after the date of enactment. Key features New section 20B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 introduces a non-disclosure right for certain communications between tax advisors and their clients. Such communications (referred to as “tax advice documents”) will be privileged if they are brought into existence for the main purpose of giving or receiving advice on tax laws. A document that is created for the purpose of committing or promoting an illegal or wrongful act will not qualify for the privilege. The right of non-disclosure will belong to the affected taxpayer. This means that taxpayers may withdraw the non-disclosure claim if they choose to provide the relevant advice to Inland Revenue. When tax advice is given to more than one person, a non-disclosure claim will apply only for the taxpayer in respect of whom the claim is made. To qualify for the right, the taxpayer’s advisor will need to be a member of an organisation, or group of persons (an approved advisor group), that has been approved by Inland Revenue and meets certain other criteria. New section 20D sets out the rules for claiming the right of non-disclosure. It must be claimed in writing and must include a brief description of the document, the name of the author and the date the document was created. The taxpayer (or the tax advisor on the taxpayer’s behalf) will need to make the claim and a statutory declaration will need to be provided by the tax advisor within a specific time (generally within 28 days of a request for information having been made under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act). 44 New section 20F provides that certain information (“tax contextual information”) must be disclosed, even if it is contained in a tax advice document. Examples of tax contextual information are: • factual information relating to transactions entered into by the taxpayer, including information about the purpose of the transaction; • accounting and tax work papers that contain information which supports the financial statements and/or the tax return; • matters concerning debt recovery. This information will need to be disclosed by way of a statutory declaration by the tax advisor in a form prescribed by Inland Revenue. A number of existing remedies are available if the progress of an investigation is deliberately impeded through abuse of the privilege rules. If a tax advisor is convicted of any of these offences, a court may order that the advisor be barred from making statutory declarations of tax contextual information. The secrecy provisions are being amended to allow Inland Revenue to advise the approved advisor group if a recognised tax agent breaches the rules relating to non- disclosure – for example, by making a false statutory declaration. Background Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, professional privilege is available to lawyers in respect of confidential communications with their clients in relation to tax matters. This means that information that is subject to privilege is not required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. The same right of non-disclosure is not currently available to chartered accountants and other tax advisors who have a similar tax advice function to that of lawyers. There are administrative protocols that govern the means by which Inland Revenue should seek to gain access to information held by tax agents but no statutory right of non-disclosure. Inland Revenue needs to be able to access sufficient information to be able to administer the Revenue Acts properly. Much relevant and useful documentation about taxpayers’ affairs is held by accountants because of the role that they play in preparing financial statements and tax returns. They are the largest single group of tax agents and advisors and are responsible for a very large percentage of the tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. Because of this central role in the administration of the tax system, a blanket extension of legal professional privilege to accountants is not appropriate. Accountants should, however, also be able to give candid and independent advice to their clients, as lawyers do, without the need to disclose that advice to Inland Revenue. The benefit of enabling this to occur is that the advice can promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers with the tax system and give rise to a consequent reduction in compliance and administrative costs. 45 In May 2002 a government discussion document, Tax and Privilege: a proposed new structure, was released for public consultation, but there was significant resistance to the proposals it set out. The amendments included in the bill, while aiming to achieve the same objectives, differ from the earlier proposals. Detailed analysis The non-disclosure right is introduced in new sections 20B to 20F of the Tax Administration Act: • Section 20B states the circumstances in which tax advice documents are not required to be disclosed. • Section 20C provides for the status of the document after an Inland Revenue request for information is made. • Section 20D contains the requirements for making a claim for the non- disclosure right. • Section 20E deals with attachments to tax advice documents. • Section 20F defines “tax contextual information” in a tax advice document that must be disclosed by way of a statutory declaration. Section 20B – No requirement to disclose tax advice document This section introduces a non-disclosure right for certain communications between tax advisors and their clients. If a valid claim of non-disclosure is made, a “tax advice document” is not required to be disclosed under Inland Revenue’s information gathering provisions (sections 16 to 19 of the Tax Administration Act). Under subsection (2) a document is eligible to be a “tax advice document” if it is created: • by a person for the main purpose of instructing a tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group; and • by a tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group, if the document was brought into existence for the main purpose of giving tax advice on tax laws to a taxpayer about the taxpayer’s own affairs. Advice given for the furtherance of illegal or wrongful acts, or in relation to impending or future illegal or wrongful acts, is specifically excluded from the non- disclosure right by section 20B(2)(b)(ii). This will include fraud. The term “tax advisor” is defined in subsection (4) as a natural person who is part of an approved advisor group, has a significant function of giving tax advice, and is subject to the code of conduct and disciplinary procedures of the approved advisor group. The approved advisor group must be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the purpose of the non-disclosure right. 46 Section 20C – Treatment of document Documents that may be eligible for the non-disclosure right will be treated as tax advice documents from the time a request for information is made. If no claim for the right is made, this status will cease when the taxpayer informs Inland Revenue that no claim is to be made, or on the date the information is required to be supplied. If a claim is made for the non-disclosure right, the status as a tax advice document will cease when: • a court or the Taxation Review Authority rules that the document is not a tax advice document; or • the taxpayer agrees in writing that the document is not a tax advice document; or • the taxpayer withdraws the claim; or • the approved advisor group advises that the tax advisor was not a member of the approved advisor group at the relevant time. While a document is treated as a tax advice document, it must be held by the tax advisor in a secure place. Section 20D – Claim that document is a tax advice document Consistent with the fact that the non-disclosure right belongs to the taxpayer, a claim for the right must be made by the taxpayer or the tax advisor on the taxpayer’s behalf. If the tax advisor makes the claim it must be accompanied by written confirmation from the taxpayer that the tax advisor is authorised to act on his or her behalf, and a statutory declaration by the tax advisor that he or she is authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer. If the tax advice document was prepared by the taxpayer for the main purpose of instructing the tax advisor to provide tax advice, the claim for the right must include a brief description of the form and contents of the document, the name of the tax advisor and the date of the document. If the tax advice document was prepared by the tax advisor for the purpose of providing advice to the taxpayer, the claim must include a brief description of the form and content of the document, the name of the tax advisor, the name of the approved advisor group, the areas of law to which the advice relates, and the date of the document. A claim relating to information that is requested under section 16 (Commissioner may access premises to obtain information) or section 16B (Power to remove and copy documents) must be made by the day on which Inland Revenue exercises the right of inspection or removal, or a later date that has been agreed. If the information is requested under section 17 (Information to be furnished on request of Commissioner) the claim must be made by the later of the date when the information is required to be provided, or 28 days after the request for information is made. 47 If the information is requested under section 17A (Court orders for production of information or return), section 18 (Inquiry before a District Court Judge) or section 19 (Inquiry by Commissioner) the claim for the non-disclosure right must be made by the date when the information is required to be produced. Section 20E – Document or part of document included in tax advice document Attachments that exist independently of the privileged document (created for a different purpose than the privileged tax advice) will not be privileged, unless they qualify for privilege in their own right. For example, a sale and purchase agreement attached to a privileged document would not be privileged. However, attachments that form part of the privileged advice (and do not have separate existence) will themselves be privileged. This will include “wiring” diagrams, although Inland Revenue will be able to prescribe that factual information contained in a diagram be provided in a diagrammatic form. Section 20F – Person must disclose tax contextual information from tax advice document Even though the tax advice document is protected from disclosure, tax contextual information included in such a document will need to be disclosed by way of a statutory declaration. Disclosure of this information must be made by the date when the claim for the non- disclosure right is required. Therefore if the information is requested under section 16 (Commissioner may access premises to obtain information) or section 16B (Power to remove and copy documents) the disclosure must be made by the date determined by the Commissioner. If the information is requested under section 17 (Information to be furnished on request of Commissioner) the disclosure must be made by the later of the date when the information is required to be provided, or 28 days after the request for information is made. If the information is requested under section 17A (Court orders for production of information or return), section 18 (Inquiry before a District Court Judge) or section 19 (Inquiry by Commissioner) the disclosure must be made by the date when the information is required to be produced. “Tax contextual information” means: • facts or assumptions which are provided to a taxpayer in contemplation of an actual transaction entered into by the taxpayer, or a similar transaction being investigated by Inland Revenue; • steps involved in the performance of a transaction actually entered into by the taxpayer, or a similar transaction being investigated by Inland Revenue; • advice that does not concern the operation and effect of tax laws (for example, valuation and investment advice); • advice on recovery of tax debts; • facts or assumptions relating to non-tax advice; and 48 • accounting and tax work papers that contain information which supports the financial statements and/or a tax return of a taxpayer. The statutory declaration must be made by a tax advisor who has authority to act on behalf of the taxpayer, and has not been barred from making statutory declarations. A court could bar the advisor if he or she is convicted of an offence under: • section 111 of the Crimes Act 1961 (false statements or declarations); • section 143(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (not supplying information when required to do so by a tax law); • section 143A(1)(b) or (c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (knowingly not supplying information when required to do so by a tax law, or providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information); • section 143B(1)(b) or (c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (knowingly not supplying information for the purpose of evading tax, or providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information); • section 143H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (obstruction). Secrecy New section 81B provides that Inland Revenue may divulge information to an approved advisor group about a member who breaches the non-disclosure rules. This will allow disciplinary action to be taken, if appropriate. Consequential amendments Section 17A, which relates to court orders for production of information or returns, is being amended. Currently, under subsection (7), a court may order that information should be produced and reviewed in order to determine whether an order should be made for the information to be provided to Inland Revenue, and whether the information is subject to legal professional privilege. Subsection (7) is being amended to provide a similar rule in relation to the accountant’s non-disclosure right. 49 Other policy matters 50 51 TAX EXEMPTION FOR PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT (Clauses 8 and 66) Summary of proposed amendment Income earned from drilling exploratory or development wells and from undertaking seismic survey work relating to petroleum exploration in New Zealand will be exempted for a period of six years. The activities must be carried out by non-resident companies and confined to offshore petroleum fields. The measure is intended to remove a tax obstacle to gas exploration in New Zealand, as part of a package of measures to boost gas exploration over the next five years. Application date The amendment will apply to income from drilling activities and seismic survey activities in New Zealand from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009. Key features The exemption is contained in a new section CW 45B of the Income Tax Act 2004 (CB 16 of the 1994 Act), and further definitions have been included in section OB 1 of both Acts. The exemption will apply to certain income of non-resident rig operators – specifically, income from the drilling of wells to explore or develop offshore petroleum fields in New Zealand. It will also apply to income of non-residents from ships providing seismic survey readings in order to identify petroleum in New Zealand. The exemption will apply for six years. Background Current domestic rules tax non-resident drilling rig operators and seismic ship operators from the first day of their presence in New Zealand. Under some of our double tax agreements, however, New Zealand may tax a non-resident rig or seismic ship operator only if the period of presence in New Zealand is longer than 183 days. When it is, the non-resident will generally be taxed from the first day of its presence in New Zealand. 52 This rule creates an incentive for seismic ship operators and drilling rig operators to leave New Zealand before 183 days have elapsed to avoid any New Zealand tax liability. Drilling rigs and seismic ships are large pieces of equipment and moving them to and from New Zealand is very expensive. In addition to this cost, other costs caused by delays in drilling operations result from the rigs or ships leaving New Zealand and different rigs or ships taking their place. Taxes are inefficient if they bias firms or individuals into more costly activities. The most obvious problem is when taxes lead to more costly activities being undertaken without raising revenue. The exemption from tax for seismic ships and drilling rigs is aimed at removing this inefficiency. The government announced in August that it would introduce legislation to remove a tax obstacle to gas exploration by temporarily lifting the “183-day rule” for offshore rig operators. In September the government announced it would extend the measure to cover drilling rigs to cover gas field development work and to seismic survey ships involved in gas exploration. The period of application of the exemption is set to coincide with other measures in the government’s gas exploration package announced on 14 June. 53 COOK ISLAND NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION FUND (Clauses 9 and 65) Summary of proposed amendments The Cook Island National Superannuation Fund is a compulsory national superannuation fund established by Cook Islands legislation. The Fund is governed by a trust deed, and New Zealand’s Public Trust has been appointed as trustee. Under New Zealand’s tax law, therefore, the Fund may be treated as a New Zealand-resident for tax purposes and therefore subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. An amendment will treat the Fund as a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes and it will be liable for New Zealand tax only on New Zealand-sourced investments. This is consistent with how other non-resident entities are taxed. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2001, the date on which the Fund started. Key features New section CW 49B of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that the Cook Island National Superannuation Fund is exempt from income tax on its foreign-sourced income. A similar amendment will be made to the Income Tax Act 1994 and apply retrospectively, from 1 July 2001. Background In November 2000 the Cook Islands Parliament passed an Act to establish a fund to provide all employees and self-employed people with a pension in retirement. Contributions to the Fund are compulsory for employers and employees unless contributions are made to a New Zealand superannuation fund. The current governance structure of the Fund, with the Public Trust being trustee, may give rise to unintended consequences under New Zealand’s tax legislation. It is likely that the Fund will be deemed to be a New Zealand resident company and, therefore, subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. Consequently, the Fund has sought a legislative solution to deal with the unintended tax effect. 54 TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURE (Clauses 4, 10, 13-17, 30, 68, 86 and 95) Summary of proposed amendments The rules covering tax deductions for business environmental expenditure to avoid, remedy or mitigate the discharge of contaminants in section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (section DJ 10 of the 1994 Act) will be clarified and expanded by: • specifying categories of qualifying environmental expenditure and default amortisation rates; • giving the Commissioner of the Inland Revenue the power to issue amortisation rates for other categories of environmental expenditure; • removing the current distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste; and • introducing a matching mechanism so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income. These changes are being made to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental issues, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. Application date The proposed amendments to section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (section DJ 10 of the 1994 Act) will apply for income years beginning and environmental expenditure incurred after the date the amending legislation is enacted. The removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste will be retrospective, to protect taxpayers who have taken a wide interpretation of the term “industrial waste”, either in filing their tax returns or in raising a dispute with Inland Revenue. Taxpayers who have not taken a wide interpretation of the legislation will not be able to take advantage of the retrospective change. Key features Section DB 37 is being revised so that it sets out categories of deductible environmental expenditure and the rate at which an amortisation deduction is available to business taxpayers when no other tax deduction is available. The default categories of expenditure and amortisation rates will be as follows: 55 Expenditure categories and amortisation rates General description of expenditure Amortisation rate Testing and feasibility expenditure – Expenditure incurred in testing and determining the feasibility of different options for avoiding, remedying or mitigating the discharge of contaminants until the time the taxpayer commits to one particular option. 100% Construction/improvement expenditure – Expenditure incurred constructing in New Zealand, an improvement for the purposes of avoiding or mitigating the discharge of a contaminant, including riparian or screen planting. A default amortisation rate based on the lesser of 35 years (1/35) or the length of the applicable resource consent granted (1/life of resource consent). Restoration expenditure – Expenditure incurred in remedying the effects of contaminants. 100% Monitoring expenditure – Expenditure incurred in monitoring the effects of contaminants. 100% The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will also be able to set amortisation rates for individual categories of construction/improvement expenditure. In determining the appropriate amortisation rate, the Commissioner will have regard to the fact that for environmental expenditure, estimated useful life for tax purposes may be less than physical life. Estimated useful life may also be less than the life of the applicable resource consent. A matching mechanism will be introduced so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income. Taxpayers will be able to choose to establish a restoration account with Inland Revenue. Over the life of a business, if the discharge of contaminants results from operations, a cash deposit equivalent to the tax effect of the accounting restoration provision can be made into the account. This deposit will give rise to a tax deduction so that the taxpayer’s cash position is unchanged. Interest will be paid on deposits at 3% per annum. Business taxpayers will be able to obtain a refund from the account if they incur restoration and monitoring expenditure or if the anticipated liability for restoration (as evidenced by their audited financial statements) decreases. This refund will give rise to taxable income which will be offset by tax deductions for restoration and monitoring expenditure. This is consistent with the objective of matching restoration and monitoring costs against prior business income. If a taxpayer transfers liability for site restoration/monitoring to another taxpayer (for example, on the sale of a site) or to the government (on death, liquidation or bankruptcy), the balance of the restoration account will be transferred to the new taxpayer/Ministry for the Environment to be used for future site restoration. Finally, section DJ 10 of the 1994 Act will be amended retrospectively to remove the word “industrial”. This will eliminate the current distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste. 56 Background At present, there is uncertainty regarding the existing scope of tax deductions available for environmental expenditure, and it appears that some environmental costs may not be deductible. This results in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities. Business taxpayers are currently able to claim a tax deduction for environmental expenditure in three ways: 7 • a deduction for normal operating (revenue) expenditure; • a deduction under the depreciation rules for certain types of capital expenditure, such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumping machinery and screens; and • a deduction under section DB 37 (DJ 10) for other capital environmental expenditure. Section DJ 10 was introduced to permit business taxpayers a deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of treating industrial waste when no other allowance might otherwise be possible. It allows business taxpayers to claim a deduction for the cost of constructing on land in New Zealand any earthworks, ponds, settling tanks, or other similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste in order to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. When a deduction is available, it must be spread evenly over five years, beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred. Despite the existence of a specific section to provide for environmental costs, there are certain expenses which may not be deductible. Section DJ 10 pre-dates the Resource Management Act 1991, so does not provide a deduction for costs incurred in complying with new health and environmental standards, such as site restoration. It is also unclear as to what is covered by the term “industrial waste”. The inability to claim tax deductions for site restoration and uncertainty around the meaning of “industrial waste” result in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities. This has led to taxpayer submissions calling for a change to the rules, including allowing environmental costs, particularly in relation to site restoration, to be matched against related business income. 7 Excluding industry-specific provisions (such as for mineral and petroleum mining). 57 TAX RECOVERY PROVISION: APPLICATION TO CIVIL PENALTIES AND INTEREST (Clause 49) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment will clarify that the tax recovery provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 – section HK 11 – applies to civil penalties and use-of-money interest. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The tax recovery provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 – section HK 11 – makes the directors and shareholders of a company liable in certain circumstances for income tax payable by the company if it is left with insufficient assets to meet its liability. This provision also applies to a company’s GST liabilities. A clarifying amendment is being made to section HK 11 to ensure that it applies to civil penalties and use-of-money interest. This clarifying amendment is in line with the policy intent of the tax recovery provision. Background Section HK 11 is directed at arrangements which deplete a company’s assets so that it is unable to meet its tax liabilities. The company itself is often liquidated as part of the arrangement, or simply because the company serves no useful purpose after a transaction is completed. Under section HK 11, the directors and shareholders of a company can be made liable, in certain circumstances, for the unsatisfied income tax and GST liabilities of the company. Broadly, these circumstances are when: • an arrangement has been entered into by the company which has the effect of leaving it unable to meet its income tax liability; • a director making reasonable enquiries would have been aware of this effect; and • a purpose of the arrangement was to have that effect. 58 It is the policy intent of section HK 11 that it should apply to allow Inland Revenue to collect unpaid civil penalties and use-of-money interest imposed on companies from their directors and shareholders if the requirements of that provision are satisfied. However, there is some uncertainty that the current law achieves this policy intent. A clarifying amendment is therefore desirable to remove this uncertainty. 59 EXCESS IMPUTATION CREDITS OF INDIVIDUALS (Clauses 50, 51, 85 and 104) Summary of proposed amendments New rules will require excess imputation credits received by individuals (natural persons) and unincorporated bodies to be carried forward instead of being converted into a net loss. This will ensure that the benefit of the credits is equal to the tax paid. Application date The provision will apply from the 2005-06 tax year. Key features Excess imputation credits received by an individual will be carried forward to the next tax year, rather than converted to a deemed net loss, as provided in section LB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004. The change is intended to apply to taxpayers who would currently convert excess imputation credits to a deemed net loss at a rate of 1/0.21, so it will also apply to, for example, an unincorporated society. Taxpayers with excess imputation credits will be required to file a tax return to ensure that Inland Revenue has an accurate record of these credits. The Commissioner will extinguish excess credits if writing off an outstanding amount of tax. If both a net loss and excess credits carried forward are available, the Commissioner will determine the order in which they are extinguished. In determining this apportionment, the Commissioner must consider any preference of the taxpayer that the Commissioner is aware of. Background Conversion of excess imputation credits to a net loss All imputation credits received by taxpayers in excess of those required to meet their tax liability for the tax year are currently converted to a deemed net loss. Taxpayers may carry forward this net loss to the next tax year. Companies also have the option of using the net loss to offset income derived by another company in the same group in the year the credits are received. The rate of conversion depends on the type of taxpayer. For example, a company divides the number of excess credits by 33% (the company tax rate) to determine its deemed net loss. Individuals and unincorporated bodies divide the number of excess credits by 21%. 60 The rate of conversion is intended to ensure that the benefit of the net loss is equal to the value of the imputation credit. A single rate of conversion achieves this for taxpayers such as companies, who always have the same tax rate. For taxpayers such as individuals, whose marginal tax rate can vary, no single rate of conversion to a deemed net loss can achieve the desired policy outcome. Any rate of conversion will benefit taxpayers differently, relative to the value of their excess credits, according to their income in the year the loss is applied. Currently, individual taxpayers with excess imputation credits are obtaining an average benefit from deemed net losses in excess of the value of the excess credits. The current conversion rate for these taxpayers is a compromise. It was originally based on what was considered a “middle” effective marginal tax rate of 28%. The position of this rate relative to the bottom of the personal tax scale is now occupied by the 21% rate, and the top marginal tax rate has increased from 33% to 39%. This has increased the disparity between the original value of imputation credits and their potential value if converted to a deemed net loss. The proposed amendment will ensure that the benefit of excess imputation credits equals the tax paid. Extinguishing of carried-forward imputation credits Currently, when writing off an amount of outstanding tax, the Commissioner is required to extinguish any net loss of the taxpayer based on the amount of the tax written off, divided by 33%. A similar (but “dollar-for-dollar”) requirement is proposed in relation to excess imputation credits carried forward, which are currently converted to a net loss. 61 PAID PARENTAL LEAVE – INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR (Clauses 88, 90, 91 and 112) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the secrecy provisions will allow Inland Revenue to use taxpayer- specific information to identify applicants who may be ineligible to receive paid parental leave (PPL) or a parental tax credit, or may have received an overpayment. The amendments will also allow Inland Revenue to communicate taxpayer-specific information to the Department of Labour so any discrepancies can be investigated and resolved. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section 85H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will allow Inland Revenue to compare taxpayer-specific information with information provided by an applicant, to identify applicants who may be ineligible to receive PPL or may have received an overpayment. When these checks reveal a possible discrepancy, Inland Revenue can communicate taxpayer-specific information relating to the applicant to the Department of Labour for further investigation. New section 85I will allow Inland Revenue to compare taxpayer-specific information with information provided by an applicant, to identify applicants who have applied for the parental tax credit and PPL in respect of the same child. When someone has applied for both payments, Inland Revenue will decline the application for either PPL or the parental tax credit. New section 81(4)(q) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a specific exemption from the requirement that Inland Revenue maintain the secrecy of taxpayer information, for the purposes of section 85H of the Act. Background As part of the implementation of the PPL scheme in 2002, certain validation checks were developed using information collected as part of the administration of the tax system, to ensure that the scheme was not subject to misuse. The checks were designed to indicate whether: 62 • an employment relationship exists between the PPL applicant and the employer from whom the applicant claims to be taking leave; • an applicant returned to work for the employer from whom she claimed to be taking leave during the PPL payment period; • an applicant claimed, or made an application for, both PPL and the parental tax credit in respect of the same child. It transpired that Inland Revenue does not have the legislative authority to use information collected or obtained as part of the administration of the Revenue Acts, for PPL purposes. The Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987, which provides for the payment of PPL, is not a Revenue Act, and Inland Revenue acts as the payment agency under a delegation in this Act. 63 PUBLICATION OF TAX OFFENDERS’ NAMES (Clause 103) Summary of proposed amendment The requirement for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish the names of serious tax offenders is being removed. The current name publishing rules are inflexible, excessively harsh on some taxpayers, and potentially ineffective, and are therefore being removed. Name publication will still occur through the Commissioner seeking publicity, when appropriate, after court imposed sanctions. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively to taxpayers whose names are currently due for publication, but have not yet been published. Key features An amendment is being made repealing section 146 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background The current name publishing rules were intended to act as a deterrent to tax offending, thereby improving taxpayer compliance. Empirical evidence, however, is inconclusive about the effectiveness of such rules. The rules also tend to be excessively harsh on some taxpayers – for example, those who evade for small sums, or one-off offenders. This is as a result of the inflexibility of the rules in both their scope and application. Name publication has only one level of punishment, irrespective of the magnitude of the offence, and it applies to various offences with potentially differing levels of culpability. As a result, there is no ability to tailor the punishment to either the type or the magnitude of the offence. Nevertheless, some benefits are still seen in publishing names of offenders. These benefits are the greatest in cases where a court has imposed a sanction. As such, the Commissioner will, when appropriate, seek publicity after court imposed sanctions. Having an independent body determine a taxpayer’s wrongdoing adds to the credibility of the process, while creating a threshold to ensure that the punishment is not disproportionate to the offence. 64 GST AND THE FIRE SERVICE LEVY (Clause 106) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment clarifies that GST is payable on amounts paid to the New Zealand Fire Service Commission by way of the fire service levy. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 October 1986, the date that GST first applied to the supply of goods and services in New Zealand. Key features The amendment to section 5 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 confirms that payment of the fire service levy is consideration for a supply of goods and services by the New Zealand Fire Service Commission. To prevent any possible risk of backdated claims for refunds of overpaid GST relating to earlier taxable periods, the amendment applies retrospectively to 1 October 1986, the date that GST first applied to the supply of goods and services in New Zealand. Background GST is designed to tax the consumption of goods and services by final consumers. This is achieved by applying GST to the widest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand, so that consumer patterns are not affected. To ensure that only final consumers face the full burden of the GST, businesses receive a credit to offset the tax paid on purchases that are used to make supplies on which GST is imposed. Under the GST Act and relevant case law, GST is imposed according to whether there is a sufficient connection between a payment and any supply of goods and services made in return for the payment. This creates a boundary that makes it difficult at times to determine whether certain payments should or should not be classified as being for taxable goods and services and hence subject to GST. The fire service levy is payable on all contracts of fire insurance covering New Zealand property and is used to fund the Fire Service Commission. The Commission has been collecting the levy since 1 July 1986. Although the levy is used to fund the activities of the Fire Service Commission, it is unclear whether the levy is a premium for a contract of insurance. It is also unclear to what extent the provision of services by the Fire Service is the result of a statutory obligation rather than a contractual one. 65 When Parliament gives an entity the right to collect amounts from the public (other than as a fine or interest penalty) in order to fund its activities, GST should apply. The amendment is consistent with this policy intent and clarifies that the New Zealand Fire Service Commission provides goods and services to both the Crown and the general public in consideration for amounts received by way of the fire service levy. 66 GST DEREGISTRATION FOR NON-RESIDENTS (Clause 110) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a discretion to deregister non-residents who do not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand, to prevent the inappropriate refund of GST on their purchases in New Zealand. Application date The amendment will apply to persons who register for GST on or after the date of enactment. Key features The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, under section 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, will be able to cancel the registration of a non-resident who does not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand. The effect of this deregistration is that the non-resident will not be able to claim back the GST incurred on the goods and services it purchases in New Zealand. Consistent with existing deregistration provisions, this deregistration could have effect back to the date on which the non-resident was registered for GST in New Zealand if a taxable activity was never carried on in New Zealand from that date. The amendment is directed at non-residents who have only a passing or temporary connection with New Zealand and who should be treated as final consumers of the goods and services they purchase in New Zealand and, therefore, not entitled to a GST refund. The Commissioner will prepare guidelines explaining the circumstances when the discretion to deregister a non-resident will be exercised and when it will not. For example, the discretion will be exercised to prevent non-residents who are temporarily in New Zealand and who do not carry on or intend to carry on any taxable activity in New Zealand, and whose only supplies in New Zealand are made for nil consideration, from having the GST on their purchases in New Zealand refunded. The discretion will not be exercised if the non-resident intends to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand and registers before beginning operations in New Zealand. 67 Background The GST Act allows non-residents to register in New Zealand for GST purposes without carrying on any taxable activity in New Zealand if they carry on a taxable activity overseas. They do this so they can get input tax credits for their expenditure in New Zealand, which may be an appropriate treatment. For example, when a person intends to carry on a business activity in New Zealand in the next 12 months, but is in the process of getting ready for that activity, GST refunds should be allowed. When non-residents have only a passing or temporary presence in New Zealand, however, it is not desirable, from a policy perspective, to allow them a refund of the GST on their purchases in New Zealand. An example of this kind of situation is when an entity not resident in New Zealand performs services in New Zealand for which it charges nil consideration. The entity carries on no “taxable activity” in New Zealand, but can register for GST purposes in New Zealand because it is carrying on a “taxable activity” overseas. It is problematic that a non-resident can make supplies in New Zealand for which it does not charge anyone, but it can still claim a GST refund for making those supplies. The entity’s profile is the same as a final consumer, yet, for GST it is treated as a business and can currently claim back the GST on its purchases – often of an entertainment or accommodation nature – in New Zealand. The amendment will give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to deregister the taxpayer in these cases. New Zealand already collects GST from non-resident businesses that have only a passing connection with New Zealand. The proposed amendment will buttress this power as it will discourage non-residents who are in New Zealand temporarily and have no intention to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand from registering for GST for the sole purpose of claiming the GST back on their purchases in New Zealand. 68 69 Remedial amendments 70 71 MISCELLANEOUS REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS A number of miscellaneous technical amendments are being made to the tax Acts. Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 Disclosure provision for premiums paid to non-resident insurers (Clause 38) The double tax agreement between New Zealand and the Netherlands was recently amended to close a tax avoidance opportunity involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums. A special disclosure provision in section FC 17 of the Income Tax Act 2004 requiring the disclosure to the Commissioner of premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands is now unnecessary. This provision will therefore be repealed with effect from 1 April 2005, the same application date as the related amendment to the double tax agreement. Redundant foreign tax credit provision (Clause 52) The dividends Article in the double tax agreement between New Zealand and the United Kingdom was recently replaced with application from the 2005-06 income year. Section LC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to the claiming of foreign tax credits from the United Kingdom, is relevant only for the purposes of the previous dividends Article. Section LC 15 is therefore redundant and will be repealed with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. Redundant provisional tax provisions (Clause 53) Section MB 2(1)(aa) and (ab) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relate to provisional tax payments, are redundant and will be repealed with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. These provisions were originally enacted in 1998 with application to provisional tax payments for the 1998-99 income year only, and should not have been re-enacted as part of the Income Tax Act 2004. Dividend withholding payment credit cross-references (Clauses 55 and 57) Sections ME 5(1)(h) and MG 5(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relate to debiting imputation credit and dividend withholding payment accounts, contain an incorrect cross-reference. The reference to “section LD 8(1)(a)” will be replaced with “section LD 8(1)(c)”, with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. 72 Resident withholding tax exemption for community trusts (Clauses 58 and 79) An income tax exemption for trustees of community trusts – section CB 4(1)(m) of the Income Tax Act 1994 – was enacted by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 with application from the 2004- 05 income year. An amendment allowing a resident withholding tax exemption certificate to be issued to a trustee of a community trust will be made to the Income Tax Act 1994 to match this income tax exemption. This amendment will apply from the 2004-05 income year. An equivalent amendment will also be made to the Income Tax Act 2004. Late payment penalty cross-reference (Clause 59) Section NH 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004, relating to the disallowance by the Commissioner of an election by a company to satisfy a dividend withholding payment liability by reducing a net loss, contains a reference to an additional tax penalty imposed under section 150 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This reference is redundant and will be replaced by a reference to late payment penalty imposed under section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. Definition of “net loss” (Clauses 60 and 80) The definition of “net loss” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 contains two drafting errors. First, the cross-reference to “section 177C(4)” of the Tax Administration Act is incorrect and will be replaced with “section 177C(5)”. Second, the reference to the amount “written off” by the Commissioner will be replaced by a reference to the amount “extinguished” by the Commissioner, in order to align the definition with the correct terminology used in section 177C. These amendments will apply from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. An equivalent amendment to this second amendment will be made to the definition of “net loss” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, with application from 1 July 2002. Superannuation fund expense transfers (Clause 67) A master superannuation fund will be allowed to elect in which year (2000-01 or 2001-02) it will deduct certain expenses of a member fund. The amendment deals with a timing anomaly that arose from an amendment to section DI 3 in 2001. Master funds previously deducted the expenses on the day they were incurred but, after the change, deducted the expenses in the income year in which they were incurred. Master funds could not deduct 2000-01 member fund expenditure incurred after the master fund’s 2000-01 balance date. 73 Tax Administration Act 1994 Small claims jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authority (Clause 92) Section 89E allows taxpayers to elect in their notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to have their dispute heard in the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority in certain circumstances. Section 89E refers to a NOPA issued under section 89D (a taxpayer NOPA to a Commissioner assessment) but not section 89DA (a taxpayer NOPA to their self-assessment). Section 89E will therefore be amended to include a cross-reference to section 89DA to ensure that taxpayers can elect to use the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority in self-assessment situations. This amendment will apply to disputes that are begun under Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act on or after 1 April 2005. Redundant binding rulings provision (Clause 96) Section 91E(6) contains a definition of “assessment” for the purposes of the Commissioner making a private ruling. This definition is redundant, because of the general definition of “assessment” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act, and will therefore be repealed with application from the date of enactment. Non-filing taxpayers (Clauses 97 and 99) Sections 92(4) and 108(1B) were enacted as part of the self-assessment amendments in 2001 and were intended to ensure that the tax position of a non-filing taxpayer for an income year becomes certain and final in the same way as for filing taxpayers. These provisions will become unnecessary under section BC 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which provides that the income tax liability of a non-filing taxpayer is the total tax withheld in respect of the taxpayer; this ensures that the tax position of a non- filing taxpayer becomes certain and final. Accordingly, sections 92(4) and 108(1B) will be repealed, with application from the 2005-06 income year. Updating unacceptable tax position provisions (Clause 102) Section 141B is concerned with the imposition of shortfall penalties in relation to unacceptable tax positions. Before 1 April 2003 the provision was concerned with unacceptable interpretations of tax laws. Section 141B(5) and (6) should be updated to take into account this change of approach in section 141B from unacceptable interpretation to unacceptable tax position. These amendments will apply from the date of enactment. 74 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on imports (Clause 107) Section 12, which relates to the imposition of GST on imports, requires a minor clarifying amendment to be made to it. This involves making the input tax terminology in section 12(4)(d)(ii) consistent with the approach used in section 12(4)(c) by referring to an input tax deduction under section 20(3). This amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Adjustment provision (Clause 108) Section 25(2)(a) refers to “tax charged by the supplier”, which is incorrect because it is the GST Act itself that charges tax on supplies. A clarifying amendment will be made to correct this by adopting the approach used in section 25(4), with application from the date of enactment. Factored debts provision (Clause 109) Section 26A requires registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. This provision will be restructured to integrate it with the calculation of tax payable in section 20 of the GST Act, with application from the date of enactment. Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 Meaning of “precedent” (Clause 111) A definition of “precedent” is being included in the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 to clarify that a “precedent” case is one that has wider implications for other taxpayers. For consistency a similar amendment will be included in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 where “precedent” is referred to in section 13B(1)(b). This amendment will apply to disputes that are commenced on or after 1 April 2005.
Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 Exposure Draft Part I Rewrite Project Team First published in September 2004 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994: Exposure Draft - Part I ISBN 0-478-27119-0 Draft legislation for Part I 1 INTRODUCTION This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Part I of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to the permitted uses of tax losses. Rewritten Parts A to E of the Act were enacted in May 2004, with effect from the 2005-06 tax year. The key objective of rewriting the Act is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, ultimately saving them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten draft legislation in this document does not necessarily indicate any future change in tax policy. We invite submissions on any aspect of this work. The closing date for submissions is 30 November 2004. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Electronic submissions should be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. Draft legislation for Part I 2 COMMENTARY ON REWRITTEN PART I This commentary on the draft legislation for rewritten Part I outlines current policy on tax losses, the structural changes proposed in the rewrite of Part I, and proposed policy changes emerging from the process. The proposed changes to structure and policy are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into four main types: • changes in the structural approach; • changes to the law to improve its clarity; • drafting changes to modernise the style and language; and • removal of redundant material and relocations to subpart IZ. BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts relating to the use of tax losses, the drafting of Part I in the rewrite must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers will come to the legislation without knowledge of how tax losses arise and the ways in which they are used. By listing all ways in which various amounts fall within the “tax loss” rules, the draft legislation assists the reader understand the scope of the loss rules without needing to search through the entire Act. EXISTING POLICY The policy intention of the loss rules in Part I is that the taxpayer who bears the economic burden of a “tax loss” is ultimately able to gain the benefit of those losses for tax purposes. The benefit provided for is the reduction in the income tax liability in a future tax year. This policy is expressed in section IE 1(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the 2004 Act). The section also highlights that the corporate veil for companies is set aside to ensure that there is at least a 49% continuity in shareholding in order for the benefit of the tax losses to be realised. The policy has been modified over time, however, to deal with particular types of tax losses and taxpayers and to extend the application of the loss rules to various forms of tax credits and tax payments. The current structure of Part I and its relationship with subpart BC does not reflect the total picture relating to tax losses. These structural problems are described here. Draft legislation for Part I 3 PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE Relationship between section BC 4 and Part I Under Part I, a person may use a “net loss” calculated under section BC 4 in ways other than those mentioned in section BC 4(4). This means that the structural relationship between section BC 4 and Part I does not adequately reflect the scheme and purpose of the use of tax losses. Therefore the draft legislation proposes a clarification of the relationship between section BC 4 in the core provisions and Part I. This proposed clarification involves broadening section BC 4(4) to reflect the total uses of a “net loss”. “Standard” rule for use of “tax losses” The draft legislation proposes in draft subpart IA a standard, core rule for the use of “tax losses”. Under the concepts presented in the draft legislation, in any tax year, a person has a general pool of “tax losses”. The general pool of “tax losses” for a tax year is the sum of the “net loss” for that tax year, the amount of the balance of unused “tax losses” from the prior tax year (if any) and other amounts that must be added to the pool (for example, converted imputation credits under section LB 2). At the end of a tax year, the person must carry forward the balance of the pool of tax losses to the next tax year, unless they elect to apply all or part of the balance of this pool to a range of uses in each tax year. As companies are a significant group of taxpayers, a clear signal is given in draft subpart IA that a company must satisfy shareholding continuity requirements in order to carry forward its tax losses. Similarly, for a company to transfer its tax losses to another company, it must satisfy the commonality of shareholding requirements. Draft subpart IA clarifies that an adjustment to the balance of the general pool of tax losses is necessary when an assessment is made for an earlier tax year by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It may affect any number of prior tax years whenever such an assessment adjusts the amount of net loss for any of those tax years or otherwise adjusts the balance of available tax losses. Tax-year basis The core provisions permit a carried forward loss and other amounts treated as a “net loss” to be subtracted from net income in calculating taxable income for a tax year. Therefore the concept of “tax loss” and “loss balance” apply to all taxpayers and are generally related to a tax year. However, in some of the rules relating to companies (continuity, grouping Draft legislation for Part I 4 and part-year issues) these concepts are related to balance dates of the companies, so the term “income year” is used. Additions to the general pool of “tax losses” There are a variety of amounts that a person must add to the general pool of “tax losses” in a tax year. This list applies to specific classes of taxpayer and consists of the following amounts (section references being to the 2004 Act): • for a person who includes imputation credits in their annual gross income for a tax year, the amount calculated under section LB 2(3) and (3A) relating to their unused imputation credits at the end of that income year; • for a person who has unused deductions in relation to payments of supplementary dividends at the end of a tax year, the amount determined under section LE 4(5); • for an Australian imputation credit account company that has paid further income tax that is not creditable against an income tax liability in the future, the amount determined under section ME 9(5B); • for a person with an unused foreign tax credit in relation to attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income at the end of a tax year, the amount calculated under section LC 4(6); • for a person with an unused attributed CFC net loss at the end of a tax year, the amount determined under section IE 3(5); • for a person who has an unused foreign investment fund (FIF) net loss at the end of a tax year, the amount determined under section IE 4(6); • for an investment fund with excess expenditure, the amount under either section DV 5(4) or the amount under section DV 7(2); • in any tax year, for a person who has carried forward tax losses from the prior tax year that relate to certain farming and horticultural activities, the amount determined under section IE 2. As a company must satisfy the continuity or grouping requirements for each component of a loss balance, a generic concept of “tax loss component” is used to refer to each net loss and the other amounts listed earlier that are included in a company’s “loss balance”. Draft legislation for Part I 5 Ring-fenced losses The draft legislation identifies a number of classes of “net loss” that are calculated either under the core provisions or are determined under specific provisions in Parts C, D, or E: • a “net loss” determined under section BC 4 for a loss attributing qualifying company (use determined under section HG 16); • a partnership loss determined under section BC 4 for a special partnership (use determined under section HC 1); • a life insurer’s policyholder net loss under section EY 42(10) (use determined under subpart II); • excess expenditure of investment funds (unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) (use determined under sections DV 5 and DV 7(1)); • an attributed CFC net loss under section DN 4(3) (use determined under section IE 3); • a FIF net loss under sections DN 8(3) and DN 9(3) (use determined under section IE 4); • the net loss of a mining company, a resident mining operator and a non-resident mining operator to the extent it relates to mining activities (use determined under section IH 1); and • the net loss of a petroleum mining company to the extent it relates to mining activities before the 1990-91 tax year (use determined under sections IH 1(2) and IH 2). The use of tax losses The draft legislation sets out how all or part of the balance of the general pool of “tax losses” and “ring-fenced tax losses” may be used. However, there are restrictions on the use of any class of “net loss” in calculating the schedular income tax liability for the classes of schedular income referred to in section ID 1. This structure is intended to provide a complete picture of permitted uses of “tax losses” and provide signposts to the relevant operative provisions. The draft legislation does not propose to consolidate into Part I loss provisions that are currently located outside Part I. Because these types of loss rules tend to be regime-based, these provisions are more sensibly situated within their body of rules as, for example, the treatment in section HG 16 of a “net Draft legislation for Part I 6 loss” calculated under section BC 4 (relating to the “net loss” of a loss attributing qualifying company). Compulsory application of balance of pool of “tax losses” In each tax year, each person uses the balance of the general pool of “tax losses” they have in the following ways: • Unless they elect to apply all or part of that balance to an elective use in that tax year, they must carry forward the balance of the general pool of “tax losses” from that year to the next succeeding tax year and subtract it from their net income (if any) for that subsequent year. • If they have a “net loss” in that succeeding tax year, the carried forward “tax losses” are aggregated with that “net loss” and then used in the manner set out in (1) above. Elective uses of the general pool of “tax losses” (all elective) • In any tax year, any person may elect to use an amount from the general pool to pay a shortfall penalty assessed in relation to their income tax liability (Draft section IW 1). • Trustees may elect to use an amount from the general pool to adjust the amount of a taxable distribution under section HH 3(4). • Companies (including consolidated groups of companies) may use the pool of “tax losses” in a tax year to: – pay a dividend withholding payment liability; or – obtain a dividend withholding refund. The amount of a “tax loss” put to an elective use is subtracted from the general pool of tax losses before determining the balance of “tax losses” that may be carried forward under the standard rule. Provisions overriding the standard “tax loss” rule for companies To be able to carry forward any class of “tax loss” from one tax year to the next, a company must satisfy the continuity rules in draft subpart IB. In addition, this carry-forward may be subject to rules applying to ring-fenced “tax losses. Draft legislation for Part I 7 A company in a group of companies may choose to transfer or group a class of “net loss” to another company in that group, under the conditions set out in draft subpart IC. This transfer may be further restricted by “tax loss” rules relating to: • amalgamated and amalgamating companies; • consolidated groups; and • ring-fenced “tax losses”, such as those of mining companies. Unique “tax loss” rules Under section IH 3, a petroleum miner must carry its “net loss” for a tax year to preceding tax years to the extent that “net loss” relates to removal or restoration expenditure or deferred deductions under section EJ 12 in relation to a relinquished permit. Ring-fenced “tax losses” Ring-fenced “tax losses” are listed within draft subpart IA, along with signposts to their relevant operative provisions, some of which are not located in Part I. It is not proposed to relocate such provisions to Part I. The various ring-fencing rules generally restrict the way in which a person may apply that class of “tax loss”. Generally, a ring-fenced “net loss” is not included in the general pool of “tax losses”, although there are exceptions to this for attributed CFC net losses (section IE 3(5)), FIF net losses (section IE 4(6)) and excess expenditure of an investment fund (sections DV 5(4) and DV 7(2)). Changes in law to clarify the policy intent Submissions are invited on the following policy clarifications. Compulsory use of carried forward tax losses In draft section IA 4(1), the legislation clarifies that carried forward tax losses must be subtracted from net income before other permitting other uses. This ordering rule is implied in sections IE 1(1)(a), IE 1(2), and IG 2(2)(f) of the 2004 Act. We recognise that a specific use rule may override this general concept, a conflict which can be resolved in the drafting. This style of drafting is demonstrated in the 2004 Act in the linkages between specific deductions rules in Part D and the general permission (section DA 1) and general limitations (section DA 2), as, for example, in section DB 6(3). Draft legislation for Part I 8 Submissions Comments are invited on the appropriateness of the proposed relationship between the compulsory and elective uses of “tax losses”, as are comments on the detail of the draft legislation. Post-breach part-year net losses and breach of continuity of shareholding of a company A question has been raised regarding the operation of the sections IE 1(2) and IG 2(4) of the 2004 Act in relation to the carrying forward of a “part- year net loss” attributable to the period following breach of continuity in a tax year (or corresponding income year). The question raised is whether a company may carry forward the amount of a “post-breach part-year net loss” irrespective of the result of the calculation of the taxable income of the company for the tax year in which the breach of continuity occurred. The question is based on the argument that section IE 1(1) intends that the benefit of a “part-year net loss” is to be obtained by the same group of persons that bear the net loss. The current rules are designed to reflect the general policy intent of allowing shareholders the benefit of losses generated by a company while they were shareholders. Although this may give rise to anomalies at times, these rules have been retained to avoid undue legislative complexity. One such anomaly occurs when a company has a “net loss” in a part-year period after a shareholding change but when combining the before and after transfer tax positions, the company has “net income” for the entire tax year. In this situation, the company uses the net loss to offset against the pre-sale net income, thereby reducing the taxable income for the year, rather than carrying the loss forward. Not exceeding net loss for the year If the “post-breach part-year net loss” is less than or equal to the “net loss” of the company for the tax year, the amount added to the balance of the general pool of “tax losses” is equal to the “post-breach part year net-loss”. This ensures that the new group of shareholders is entitled to obtain the benefit of the “post-breach part-year net loss”. Draft legislation for Part I 9 Example 1 illustrates this effect. E XAMPLE 1 Pre-breach part-year (net loss) Post-breach part-year (net loss) (Net loss) for tax year Amount to add to balance of tax losses (100) (75) (175) (75) Exceeding net loss for the year The “post-breach part-year net loss” may be greater than the “net loss” of the company for the tax year. This result will arise where the company has an amount of “pre-breach part-year net income” and, in calculating its income tax liability for the tax year, has applied the “post-breach part-year net loss” against the “pre-breach part-year net income”. The amount to add to the general pool of tax losses can only be the residual amount, being the net loss for the tax year. Example 2 illustrates this point. E XAMPLE 2 Pre-breach part-year net income Post-breach part-year (net loss) (Net loss) for tax year Amount to add to balance of tax losses 50 (75) (25) (25) Having net income for the year A company may have net income for the tax year, but still have a “post- breach part-year net loss”. This situation arises when the “pre-breach net income” exceeds the “post-breach part-year net loss”. The group of shareholders at the end of the tax year obtain the benefit of the “post-breach part-year net loss” by reducing their income tax liability for the tax year. This means that the shareholders will not be able to add any part of the “post-breach part-year net loss” to the general pool of “tax losses”. Draft legislation for Part I 10 Example 3 illustrates this point. E XAMPLE 3 Pre-breach part-year net income Post-breach part-year (net loss) Net income for tax year Amount to add to balance of tax losses 200 (80) 120 0 Submissions We invite comment on whether the draft legislation correctly clarifies the law in respect of the ability of a company to carry forward part or all of an amount of a “post-breach part-year net loss” of the company following a breach in continuity. Comments on the detail of the draft legislation are also welcome. Carrying forward tax losses into year of breach A question has been raised regarding the operation of the current sections IE 1(2) and IG 2(4) in relation to the carrying forward and grouping of tax losses against an amount of “part-year net income” attributable to the period before the breach of continuity in a tax year (or corresponding income year). The question raised is whether a company may carry forward or apply the grouping rules to the amount of a “pre-breach part-year net income” irrespective of the result of the calculation of the taxable income of the company for the tax year in which the breach of continuity occurred. The question is based on the argument that section IE 1(1) of the 1994 Act intends that the benefit of a “part-year net loss” is to be obtained by the same group of persons that bear the net loss. Having net income for the year If the company has net income for the tax year in which the breach of continuity occurs, the amount of tax losses that may be carried forward from an earlier tax year to the breach year may not exceed the pre-breach net income. This amount may be increased when grouping applies (as in section IG 2(2)(b)(B) in the 1994 Act. This ensures that the pre-breach shareholders obtain the benefit of tax losses they have borne. Draft legislation for Part I 11 Examples 1 and 2 illustrate this point. E XAMPLE 1 Pre-breach prior year balance of tax losses Pre-breach part-year net income Net income (net loss) for year Amount of “tax loss” from prior year to carry forward to pre-breach period Taxable income (net loss) of company (100) 100 50 (50) 0 EXAMPLE 2 Pre-breach prior year balance of tax losses Pre-breach part-year net income Net income (net loss) for year Amount of “tax loss” from prior year to carry forward to pre-breach period Taxable income (net loss) of company (100) 100 200 (100) 100 Having net loss for the year If the company has a “net loss” for the tax year in which a breach of continuity occurs, the company may not carry forward any part of the prior year’s balance of tax losses to the year of breach. This applies irrespective of whether the company has an amount of “pre-breach part-year net income”. Example 3 illustrates this point. E XAMPLE 3 Pre-breach prior year balance of tax losses Pre-breach part-year net income (net loss) Net income (net loss) for year Amount of “tax loss” to carry forward from pre- breach year Taxable income of company (100) 100 (50) 0 0 Draft legislation for Part I 12 Submissions We invite comment on whether the draft legislation correctly clarifies the law in respect of the ability of a company to carry forward part or all of an amount of a loss balance to deduct from the “part-year net income” of the loss company or another group company before a breach in continuity (or commonality in the case of grouping). Comments on the detail of the draft legislation are also welcome. Relationship of Part I with provisions having general effect The proposed structure for tax losses contains a prescriptive basis for carrying forward and applying those losses. A question arises, however, as to how these prescriptive rules may be affected by amended assessments. Under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner may issue an assessment that amends a tax position. Such an amended assessment may affect the quantum of net loss for a tax year, the compulsory and elective uses of tax losses and the balance of tax losses at a tax year. Examples of provisions that may lead to an amended assessment could include, among others, sections FB 2 (apportionment of income partly derived in New Zealand and elsewhere) and GD 13 (transfer pricing rule). The current law does not explicitly address the effect of an amended assessment on the amount of tax losses that arise, and correspondingly, their uses. In line with the objectives of the Rewrite, it is proposed that the “tax loss” rules provide for adjustments to the amounts of tax losses and their uses, to give full consequential effect to a Commissioner’s assessment. For example, if the net loss is reduced in one tax year, this should affect the loss balance carried forward and have a consequential effect on the amount used in subsequent tax years. We propose to make this explicit in the legislation. Submissions We invite comment on whether the proposed provision is an appropriate reflection of current practice. Comments on the detail of the draft legislation are also welcome. Draft legislation for Part I 13 Ordering rule Under current law, it is not clear whether amounts converted to available net losses (for example, converted imputation credits) and a limited number of ring-fenced net losses (for example, excess expenditure of investment funds) are to be applied on the first-in first-out basis provided for in section IE 1(3). We propose to rationalise the ordering rule by having the same rule apply to all types of tax losses, whether generally available or ring-fenced. We consider that having a single ordering rule provides clarity for readers, thereby meeting a key objective of the Rewrite. Submissions All aspects of the suggested rationalisation are offered for comment. We are particularly concerned about whether the proposed ordering rule may affect positions taken by taxpayers. Comments on the detail of the draft legislation are also welcome. Spread back of certain petroleum mining expenditure Section IH 3 of the 2004 Act applies to a petroleum miner that has a net loss for a tax year and in that year has: • expenditure incurred on removal or restoration operations under section DT 16; or • deferred deductions allocated to that tax year or corresponding income year under section EJ 12. Section IH 3 has two intended effects for the tax year in which the petroleum miner has a net loss. It • reduces the net loss for that year by the amount of these two types of deduction; and • provides a spread-back rule to earlier tax years for the amount of reduction in the net loss for the current tax year. Draft sections IS 5 addresses the limit on the net loss and draft section EJ 12B (located within the spreading rules relating to petroleum mining) places the spread-back rule in Part E, as this is an allocation rule. Draft legislation for Part I 14 However, it seems possible for a different approach to this issue to be adopted. The practical effect of the current law is to ensure these two types of deductions cannot give rise to a petroleum miner having a net loss for the tax year. Adopting this approach could lead to section IS 5 would be omitted and section EJ 12B being drafted to limit the amount of deduction allocated to the current tax year under section DT 16 and EJ 12 to ensure the petroleum miner could not have a net loss for that year. Submissions We invite comment on whether the draft legislation correctly clarifies the law in respect of the limitation on the net loss and the allocation rule. We also invite comment on whether the policy intent would be better reflected as an allocation rule that overrides the effect of section DT 16 and EJ 12, with the loss rule omitted. DRAFTING CHANGES TO MODERNISE THE STYLE AND LANGUAGE The main drafting changes relate to: • distinguishing the current year concept of “net loss” as one of the types of tax losses that may be used under Part I; • rationalising the part-year rules and placing them in one subpart for application to continuity, grouping, consolidation, and amalgamation; and • ordering the subparts containing the various loss provisions from the most generally applicable to the more specific. Submissions Comments on the detail of the draft legislation are welcome. REMOVAL OF REDUNDANT MATERIAL AND RELOCATION TO SUBPART IZ Sections IH 4(1) and IH 5 Sections IH 4(1) and IH 5, relating to specified mineral mining, provide for a reduction in the value of tax losses. These provisions are historic in nature and relate to the period before 1986, when specified mineral miners were entitled to a concessionary tax rate, being two-thirds of the company tax rate. Draft legislation for Part I 15 At that time a specified mineral miner was taxed on income from mining at 33%, rather than to the corporate tax rate of 48%. At the same time, a specified mineral miner could also derive non-mining income. The loss provisions now located in sections IH 4(1) and IH 5 were designed to ensure that mining losses were adjusted to reflect the concessional nature of the tax rate on net income from mining. This was also the case for the provisions reducing the value of mining expenditure being used to deduct from non- mining income (now set out in section DU 7 of the 2004 Act). The concessionary tax rate for specified mineral miners was repealed with effect from 1 October 1986. Since that date, income from mining has been taxed at the same rate as income from other sources. Even so, the “tax loss” provisions in sections IH 4(1) and IH 5 and the deduction adjustment in section DU 7 were retained, although the policy for having done so is not clear. These provisions are redundant. From a policy perspective, there does not seem to be any reason to retain rules that do not reflect that mining and non- mining income of a specified mineral miner are taxed at the same basic rate. Therefore we propose to omit sections IH 4(1) and IH 5. Submissions We invite comment on the appropriateness of this proposal. Section IG 1(4) Section IG 1(4) is a provision that was enacted before the current core provisions and ensures that special provisions in the Act relating to certain taxpayer companies (such as mining and life insurance) are still applicable in determining the income of those companies. One of the objectives of rewriting the Act is to consolidate and clarify its scheme. This objective was largely accomplished with the enactment of the 1994 Act and then the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, which clarified that the scheme of the Act is based on a global gross concept rather than a schedular approach. Schedular groups of rules were divided into their income, deduction and timing components, and this was further clarified through the enactment of the 2004 Act. As a result, section BB 2 requires every company (whether in a group of companies or not) to calculate its income tax liability for a tax year, and satisfy that tax liability on the basis of the scheme set out in subpart BC. It no longer seems appropriate to retain section IG 1(4) because it is an historic provision relating to a now redundant schedular approach to taxation of different types of companies. Draft legislation for Part I 16 Therefore we propose to omit section IG 1(4). Submissions We invite comment on the appropriateness of this proposal. Relocations to subpart IZ It is proposed to move current sections IE 2, IH 1(2), and IH 2 to subpart IZ. Section IE 2 Section IE 2 regulates the use of carried forward tax losses (specified activity net losses) a person has from investing in or operating various types of agricultural, aquacultural, horticultural and land leasing activities. The last of the rules leading to increases in the amount of specified activity net losses were repealed at the end of the 1990-91 tax year. In general terms, this rule restricts to $10,000 the amount of these tax losses that a person can subtract from their net income for a tax year under section BC 5. Because these losses are finite, and it has been over ten years since these types of losses could arise, this provision is moving toward the end of its useful life. Therefore it is proposed to relocate the provision to subpart IZ. References to losses for 1981-2 and 1991-2 tax years It is proposed to move these references to Part IZ, but retain their effect within the loss grouping rules through a linkage. As these losses will terminate over time, it is more appropriate to draft the grouping provisions on the basis of losses that will arise from the application date of the legislation. This is consistent with the approach taken in rewriting Parts C, D, and E of the Act, for example, the depreciation rules in sections EZ 8 to EZ 26 that apply to terminating depreciation rules. Sections IH 1(2) and IH 2 Sections IH 1(2) and IH 2 are ring-fencing rules relating to the carry- forward and use of tax losses of petroleum mining companies to the licence area in which the “tax loss” arose. These provisions relate to now repealed petroleum mining rules. Under the current petroleum mining rules, there is no such restriction on the use of net losses from petroleum mining, and we therefore propose that these provisions be relocated to subpart IZ. Draft legislation for Part I 17 Submissions We invite comment on the appropriateness of these relocations.
Part I 1 Subpart IA — General rules for tax losses IA 1 Outline of subpart This subpart— (a) defines the relationship between the core provisions of this Act, the provisions of this Part, and other provisions in this Act that allow a person with a tax loss to use the amount of the loss in a tax year to reduce their taxable income; and (b) establishes the general rules for using a tax loss and the priorities for that use, first, in carrying it forward and subtracting the amount from net income for a following tax year or years, and secondly, in certain general and particular circumstances.

A borrower may also enter a securities lending transaction because they need to meet margin requirements on an unrealised loss and can do this more cheaply by borrowing securities than by depositing cash. Alternatively, a taxpayer may enter into a securities loan because they are acting as an intermediary between longer term lenders and shorter term borrowers. Imputation trading Where a shareholder who is unable to use imputation credits, transfers their shares, on a temporary basis, to another taxpayer who is able to use the credits. Lender The owner of the securities who enters into a securities lending transaction in order to obtain an additional return by way of lending fees on top of returns attaching to the security itself. Often a pension scheme or superannuation fund. Margin requirements Where a taxpayer with an unrealised loss is required as a condition of their securities transaction to deposit an amount to cover an agreed portion of this loss. Repurchase agreement A transaction where securities are sold for cash consideration. The seller is obligated to repurchase the securities at some later point in time at a higher price which reflects a premium (or interest) to the buyer. Typically, such transactions do not extend beyond interest or payment dates. These transactions are also known as “Repos”. Securities lending transaction An agreement where securities are lent in consideration for the return of equivalent securities at a later date (plus payment of a fee). Substitute payment A payment by a borrower to a lender to reimburse the lender for any dividends and interest paid on the securities over the term of the securities lending transaction. This is also known as a “manufactured dividend”. 2 3 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Internationally, securities lending, which is lending securities for a fee, usually to make up a shortfall, represents a substantial part of the daily settlement value in many transaction systems. It can also play an important role in facilitating market liquidity. 1.2 New Zealand does not have a significant domestic securities lending market, at least in part owing to the potential for securities lending transactions to be taxed on the basis of their legal form rather than their economic substance. 1.3 When New Zealand companies wish to enter into securities lending transactions they are required to go offshore to other markets (Sydney, Hong Kong or London). The size of the offshore securities market consisting of New Zealand investors is estimated to be approximately US$1 billion. Taxing securities lending transactions 1.4 New Zealand, unlike many other jurisdictions, does not have special tax rules for securities lending transactions. For New Zealand tax purposes, they are taxed on the basis of legal form rather than economic substance. 1.5 The current New Zealand tax treatment of securities lending transactions is inconsistent with international trends, with the economic substance of these transactions (being a securitised loan agreement rather than a sale or disposition) and with the treatment of other commercial transactions, such as hire purchase agreements and finance leases. 1.6 These inconsistencies mean a negative international perception of New Zealand as an investment destination. This has led to calls for a change to the tax treatment of securities lending transactions. 1.7 Although removing barriers to commercial transactions is important, the government is also concerned about tax avoidance opportunities offered by the current tax treatment of securities lending transactions. There is evidence that securities lending transactions are being used to trade in imputation credits, avoid non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and exploit the lack of specific tax rules in this area in New Zealand. It is estimated that tax lost to date from such transactions is in excess of $100 million. Objectives 1.8 The purpose of this discussion document is to seek feedback on proposals for reforming the tax treatment of securities lending transactions. 4 1.9 The discussion document examines the current New Zealand tax treatment of securities lending transactions. It considers the pros and cons of reforming the New Zealand tax legislation in this area, including special tax rules for securities lending transactions. At the same time, it seeks to address concerns about transactions that use securities lending to give rise to undue tax advantages. Scope of this discussion document 1.10 This discussion document outlines a number of proposals on which the public is invited to comment. The aim is that any changes the government decides upon from this review would be included in amending tax legislation next year. 1.11 If the government proceeds with the proposals outlined here, amendments will be required to the Income Tax Act 2004. It is intended that they would be included in a 2005 taxation bill. The new securities lending rules would apply for income years beginning on or after the date the legislation is enacted, and the new anti-avoidance rules from the date the bill containing amending legislation is introduced into Parliament. Summary of proposals Proposals to clarify the current tax treatment and reform the treatment of securities lending transactions cover two broad areas: • introduction of specific securities lending rules to allow taxation of qualifying transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form; and • strengthening the imputation and NRWT anti-avoidance rules to ensure that non-qualifying securities lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost. New securities lending rules for qualifying transactions The new securities lending rules will operate as follows: • Qualifying transactions, which must meet a strict list of criteria, will be taxed on their economic substance rather than legal form. There will not be a disposal for tax purposes on entering a qualifying securities lending transaction. Neither the initial transfer of securities nor the subsequent reacquisition of the same or identical securities back to the lender will be treated as a taxable event for income purposes. 5 • The borrower will be treated as having acquired the borrowed security at its market value and to have returned the replacement security at the same market value. • Any distribution (dividend or interest) received during the term of a securities lending transaction will be passed on to the lender. This includes any tax credits attached to a dividend. The borrower will also be required to pay a substitution payment to compensate the lender for any distribution made to a third party purchaser of the borrower securities during the term of the securities lending transaction. • When a taxpayer fails to complete a securities lending transaction in accordance with the qualifying conditions, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given the discretion to continue to apply the securities lending rules to the transaction if the Commissioner is of the opinion that at a later time the transaction will be a qualifying transaction. • When the Commissioner is of the opinion that the transaction will never constitute a qualifying transaction, the taxpayers affected will be required to amend the tax treatment of the transaction to reflect the general income tax rules. Qualification criteria • The new securities lending rules will be applicable to the following securities: – shares, units, bonds, debentures, convertible notes or rights or options issued by a company or unit trust listed on a recognised exchange or that are ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public; and – bonds, debentures or similar securities issued by a government (in New Zealand or elsewhere). • Agreements will need to be in writing, and any consideration received by the lender from the borrower (such as the lending fee) must be clearly identified in the agreement. • Taxpayers will be able to use standard international agreements as the basis for their New Zealand lending agreements. • To qualify for the securities lending rules, identical securities will need to be returned at the end of the lending transaction, along with the return of the collateral, less the agreed lending fee. The replacement securities will need to be the same securities as those originally lent or identical securities. • Reacquisition of identical securities will need to take place within 12 months of the original disposal. • The securities lending transaction must be on arm’s-length terms and must not be between associated borrowers and lenders. 6 New anti-avoidance rules for non-qualifying transactions When a securities transaction falls outside the new securities lending rules, additional anti-avoidance measures will be applied to the transaction: • Imputation credits will be cancelled if they are paid to a shareholder who lacks economic ownership in the securities and is under an obligation to make a related payment passing on the benefit of receiving tax credits to the economic owner of the shares. • A similar test will be introduced for NRWT, under which the substitute payment will be deemed to be gross income of the borrower. • The government is still considering how “lack of economic ownership” and “related payment” will be defined. • The introduction of a “safe harbour” mechanism for small investors is also being considered. Benefits of change 1.12 The introduction of specific tax rules for securities lending is expected to be beneficial for the New Zealand economy. If securities lending is encouraged, or at least not discouraged, through the introduction of special tax rules, it will allow institutional investors to “lend” their securities, increasing the number of possible transactions in the market. In theory, this will increase the number of actively traded shares, improve liquidity and lead to a more efficient capital market. It will also resolve many of the problems identified with the current tax treatment of these transactions and will: • create greater consistency with the treatment adopted in other jurisdictions; • create greater consistency with economic reality; • create greater consistency with the treatment of other commercial transactions; • increase taxpayer certainty; and • improve the perception of New Zealand as an investment destination. 1.13 At the same time, introducing new anti-avoidance measures for the imputation and NRWT rules will protect the tax base and prevent unintended policy outcomes with respect to securities lending. 7 1.14 The government recognises that there may be an increase in compliance costs associated with the proposals – for example, in ensuring that securities lending transactions meet the qualification criteria and calculating the level of economic ownership for non-qualifying transactions. On the other hand, the government will attempt to minimise any such increase. By making the qualification criteria consistent with international rules, borrowers and lenders will be able to use standard international agreements. The government is also planning to exempt small investors from the need to comply with the new anti-avoidance rules by introducing a “safe harbour” mechanism as part of the proposals.

It provides a relatively risk-free way for larger holders of shares, such as banks, insurance companies, and funds managers, to increase their overall portfolio returns. 2.2 A significant part of the stock market is held by passive institutional investors. Securities lending provides a way for these institutional investors to “lend” securities to financial intermediaries for a fee. This lending “fee” is an additional return to the institutional investor. Financial intermediaries enter these transactions because it enables them to complete more sale contracts and generate additional income. The percentage of shares actively traded increases, improving market efficiency by providing additional liquidity. 2.3 These transactions also benefit lenders who are able to obtain an additional return by way of fees paid by a borrower on top of returns attaching to the security itself. 2.4 Borrowers enter into the transactions for three main reasons: • because they need to sell or complete a sale of securities and they do not own the securities they are intending to sell; • because they need to meet margin requirements and, in some circumstances, it may be cheaper to do this by borrowing securities than by depositing cash; and • because they are acting as intermediaries between longer term lenders and shorter term borrowers. 2.5 Securities lending transactions are typically entered into when a financial intermediary (the “borrower”) does not have sufficient securities to complete a sale. To cover the sale, the borrower obtains the securities needed to complete the sale from a third person (the “lender”). After completion of the sale, the borrower returns replacement securities to the lender, together with an amount equal to any dividends or interest that may have become payable over the loan period. The lender is also paid a fee for the use of the securities. Both before and after the transaction, the lender holds the same number and type of securities. The transactions have the essential characteristics of loan transactions because the lender receives back the equivalent of what was lent. 9 2.6 All lenders give, and all borrowers require, either actual title to securities or such signed transfers and the like as are necessary to be able to give title to third parties. This means that lending transactions will generally be treated as sales and repurchases of securities for tax purposes. Commercially, however, these transactions are described and treated as loans, because in the longer term such transactions do not alter a lender’s portfolio. There is a future contractual obligation to reverse or unwind the transaction. 2.7 Example 1 illustrates how a securities lending transaction works. Example 1: A securities lending transaction Borrower (B) needs to cover a short sale position with certain government securities. To obtain the needed securities, B enters into an agreement with an owner (L) of the necessary securities. L lends the securities to B and takes back cash as collateral. During the term of the loan, L receives interest income from the investment of the collateral. B receives any coupon payments made on the securities during the term of the agreement. At the end of the loan term, B returns identical securities to L. L returns the collateral to B. L also pays over to B the interest earned on the collateral net of any agreed fee and any coupon payments received by B. Securities loan – key characteristics 2.8 The legal form of securities lending agreements varies and the tax implications will depend on the specific facts. However, securities lending transactions generally have the following characteristics. T 0 T 1 T end Sells securities $$$ Cash Invests cash Interest Returns securities Returns cash and interest net of agreed fee. Amount returned takes into account any distributions made to B during the loan period L B L B L B Interest or dividends $$$ Cash 10 2.9 The initial loan and eventual return of the securities. A securities owner (the lender) agrees to lend securities to a financial intermediary (the borrower) for a set term. To effect the securities “lending” it is necessary for the securities to be “sold” by the lender to the borrower. At a pre-determined time the borrower returns the same amount of securities borrowed to the lender. The replacement securities must be similar in all respects to those transferred to the borrower. 2.10 Dividends/interest. Dividends and interest paid during the term of the transaction are paid to the new registered owner of the securities. This could be either the borrower or a third party to whom the securities have been transferred. 2.11 Substitute payments. The borrower is required to pay to the lender an amount equal to any such dividends and interest. This is typically known as a “substitute payment” or “manufactured dividend”. 2.12 Loan fees. In return for the securities, the borrower provides the lender with collateral. This can be in the form of cash, other securities, or a letter of credit, equal or greater in value than the securities loaned. The collateral is generally indexed to the market value of the securities on a daily basis and is increased or decreased as necessary. If the borrower does not return an equivalent amount of securities at the agreed time the collateral is forgone. There may also be fees payable to intermediaries who represent the securities lender, arrange the loan and handle remittances and collections. 2.13 How the securities lender is compensated for lending its securities depends on the character of the collateral provided: • Cash collateral. Collateral is invested for the benefit (and at the risk of) the securities lender. The collateral earns interest over the period of the loan. At the cessation of the loan, the lender returns the collateral and the interest to the borrower (the collateral rebate), minus an amount that has been pre-determined as the fee for the use of the securities. • Non-cash collateral. If the collateral is securities or a letter of credit, the securities borrower will pay a predetermined fee to the securities lender. Securities loan versus repurchase agreement 2.14 In summary, securities lending is an agreement whereby securities are lent in consideration for the return of identical securities at a later date. In economic terms the transaction is a loan. However, because the securities are being obtained to complete a sale contract, the borrower must obtain legal title to them. Therefore the lender must legally dispose of the securities to the borrower. 11 2.15 A securities loan is often confused with a repurchase agreement, or “repo”, as the distinction between the two is a fine one. In a repurchase agreement, the owner of the securities sells them to another party for cash consideration under an agreement obligating the owner to repurchase the securities at some later point in time. At the termination of the agreement, the original owner repurchases the securities at a higher price than the securities were originally sold for. The inflated purchase price reflects a premium, or interest, paid to the buyer. Typically, repos do not extend beyond interest or dividend payment dates. Example 2 shows how such an agreement works. Example 2: A repurchase transaction L needs to raise cash. L lends securities to B and takes back cash as collateral. During the term of the loan, L receives interest income from the investment of the collateral. At the end of the loan term, B returns identical securities to L. L returns the collateral to B. L also pays over to B the interest earned on the collateral net of any agreed fee. 2.16 Although there are similarities between securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements, there are arguments against adopting a comparable tax treatment because: • the format of the transactions is different; • the transactions are used for different purposes; • other jurisdictions exclude repos from their securities lending rules; and • the government is not aware of any problems with the tax treatment of repurchase transactions. T 0 T end Sells securities $$$ Cash Invests cash Returns securities Returns $$$ and interest net of agreed fee B B Interest L L 12 2.17 On this basis, the government has decided to limit the changes discussed in this document to true securities lending transactions, although submissions on whether repurchase transactions should be included in the proposed changes are invited. 13 Chapter 3 PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT TAX TREATMENT 3.1 At present, there are no specific rules for the taxation of securities lending transactions in New Zealand. Furthermore, the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 were not written in contemplation of these types of transactions. 3.2 For New Zealand tax purposes, securities lending transactions are taxed on the basis of legal form rather than economic substance. The initial lending of the securities gives rise to a disposal. When the securities lent are financial arrangements, such as government stock or debentures, the transfer to the borrower will trigger a base price adjustment under the accrual rules. This crystallises the lender’s income or expenditure as at the loan date. During the period of the “loan”, the lender and the borrower must account for the accrual income or expenditure under the accrual rules. 3.3 When the securities lent are excepted financial arrangements, such as shares, any gains or losses solely attributable to the shares are not taxed under the accrual rules. Instead, when the securities lent are revenue account property of the lender, the gain or loss on sale will be taxed under the other, non- accrual provisions of the Act. Reforming the tax treatment 3.4 A number of arguments have been raised in support of reforming the current tax treatment of securities lending transactions in New Zealand. Concerns can be broadly divided into four categories: • lack of consistency; • lack of certainty; • the need to improve the perception of New Zealand as an investment destination; and • base maintenance. Lack of consistency 3.5 The current treatment of securities lending is consistent with the concept of taxing on realisation which, for pragmatic reasons, is often preferred in New Zealand’s tax system. However, taxing securities lending transactions on a realisation basis does lead to a number of inconsistencies. 14 Inconsistent with international treatment 3.6 In Australia (1990), Canada (1989), the United Kingdom (1989) and the United States (1983), specific legislation and regulations have been introduced to tax securities lending transactions on the basis of their economic substance. The key details of these international securities lending rules are summarised in the appendix. Typically, the relief provisions are written to limit their application to genuine securities lending transactions rather than those entered into to obtain a tax advantage. 3.7 For New Zealand to compete for international investment dollars it is necessary to provide similar investment opportunities as those available in other jurisdictions. This requires a tax framework that is consistent with international trends. Inconsistent with economic treatment 3.8 Taxing securities lending transactions on a realisation basis is inconsistent with the economic substance of these transactions. 3.9 The current tax treatment of securities lending does not reflect the fact that, in substance, the transaction is a securitised loan agreement, not a sale or disposition. Even though a transfer of legal title is required for commercial reasons, the lender does not, in substance, intend to dispose of the securities. Inconsistent with the treatment of other commercial transactions 3.10 Although New Zealand’s tax system tends to operate on a form-over- substance basis, the current tax treatment of securities lending transactions is inconsistent with the treatment of other commercial transactions. For example: • Hire purchase agreements. Under a hire purchase agreement, the legal form determines that title does not pass until the final instalment has been paid. As a matter of economic, accounting and taxation practice, the benefits and obligations of ownership pass at the outset. The legal form merely provides the financier with effective security in the event of default. • Finance leases. The tax and accounting treatment of a finance lease also mirrors economic substance. For tax purposes, the leasing of an asset is treated as a sale of that asset to the lessee. The lessee is treated as receiving a loan from the lessor to purchase the asset. No depreciation deduction is available to a lessor during the lease term. Instead, the lessee as economic owner is able to claim depreciation. • Livestock bailment. A bailment of livestock exists when livestock is not in the owner’s care, as in livestock grazing arrangements or share- farming transactions. For tax purposes, the bailee is deemed to own the livestock and must take the stock into account at year end. 15 Lack of certainty 3.11 In analysing the taxation treatment of securities lending, the New Zealand income tax system draws a distinction between two types of corporate fund raising: • Debt finance – which is subject to the accrual rules; and • Equity or share finance – which is generally outside the ambit of the accrual rules. This is because shares are “excepted financial arrangements”. Even when equity/share finance is part of a wider financial arrangement, equity returns remain outside the accrual rules if they are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. 3.12 Because New Zealand does not have specific tax rules for securities lending transactions, taxpayers and their advisors are required to determine, without much guidance, when an item is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. This interface between the accrual rules and the taxation of equity is, at some points, obscure. Improving New Zealand as an investment destination 3.13 The lack of special tax rules for securities lending in New Zealand may mean a negative international perception of New Zealand’s capital markets. This could have adverse consequences on New Zealand as an investment destination. Base maintenance concerns 3.14 Although ensuring consistency and certainty are important objectives in the securities lending context, the government is equally concerned that New Zealand’s tax base not be undermined. Any tax rules for securities lending transactions must, therefore, minimise the risk of unintended tax advantages and current concerns in this respect should be addressed. Circumventing the policy intent behind the imputation rules 3.15 The 1987 Consultative Document on Full Imputation 1 outlined the policy intent of the imputation rules: “The economic objective of full imputation is to tax a company’s income at the marginal rates of shareholders. In principle, imputation credits should therefore be pro-rated across shareholders in proportion to their rights to the company’s net cash flows. Rules are therefore needed to ensure that companies are not able to direct credits to those shareholders best placed to use them.” 1 Consultative Document on Full Imputation, Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform, December 1987, p.13. 16 3.16 One of the fundamental principles of the imputation rules is that credits are available only to those shareholders who owned the company when the tax was paid, in proportion to shareholding. To support this policy intent, the imputation rules have anti-streaming and shareholder continuity rules. 3.17 Despite these rules, taxpayers not in a position to use imputation credits may, in certain circumstances, be able to use a securities loan to temporarily transfer their shares to taxpayers who can use the credits. “Lenders” retain economic ownership and exposure to the performance of the underlying shares through swap payments and options. However, by using a securities loan they are able pass imputation credits to another entity able to make better use of the tax credits. In return, they receive a non-taxable swap payment. “Borrowers” are able to obtain tax credits from shares they do not economically own. Allowing taxpayers to manipulate ownership in order to pass on the benefit of imputation credits is inconsistent with the underlying intent of the imputation rules. Circumventing the current anti-streaming rules 3.18 The 1998 Full Imputation: Report of the Consultative Committee 2 discussed the requirements for an imputation anti-avoidance rule: “In order to reinforce the effect of the anti-streaming rules and to reduce the scope for trading and recycling of credits, a specific anti- avoidance rule, buttressed by disclosure requirements, should be included in the legislation. The rule should include a provision to counteract temporary transfers of interests aimed at avoiding the allocation rules... \[A\]nti-avoidance provisions \[should\] be included to counteract trading in or recycling of credits and temporary transfers of interests in companies in order to obtain a tax benefit.” 3.19 Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 1, Number 1, July 1989 summarised the purpose of the current imputation anti-avoidance provision in section GC 22: “This section has two purposes: To prevent shareholders buying and selling shares in order to pass imputation (and dividend withholding payment) credits to those best able to use them; and To prevent companies “streaming” credits to those shareholders best able to use them. 2 Full Imputation: Report of the Consultative Committee, Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform, April 1988, pages 23-25. 17 The rationale for these anti-streaming provisions is that all shareholders have borne the company tax and the credits should be allocated to them all in proportion to their shareholding. In addition, if streaming is permitted, there is a greater cost to the Revenue in imputation.” 3.20 Section GC 22 (former section 394ZG of the Income Tax Act 1976) was enacted to ensure that imputation credits are allocated consistently between shareholders and on a basis that reflects actual rights to company cash flows. 3.21 In some cases it has been concluded that the section does not apply because securities lending transactions have a commercial purpose, and any tax benefit obtained is merely incidental. However, if the return from the securities in economic terms belongs to the lender, the non-application of section GC 22 would appear to be inconsistent with the policy intent of the imputation rules. Circumventing the policy intent behind NRWT 3.22 Even if a New Zealand company has no imputation credits, a non-resident can potentially lend securities to a resident and avoid NRWT being withheld by the issuer of the dividend. NRWT applies to non-resident withholding income derived by a non-resident from New Zealand. Non-resident withholding income includes dividends. 3.23 In a securities lending transaction, a non-resident lender is able to exchange a dividend subject to NRWT for a non-taxable swap payment, while retaining economic ownership of the shares. This treatment is inconsistent with the policy intent of the NRWT rules. 3.24 The NRWT rules do contain a specific anti-avoidance rule in section GC 14A. However, this is aimed at transfers of commercial bills to avoid NRWT, not the transfer of shares. 3.25 As such, in the case of schemes to avoid NRWT on dividends, the current rules rely on the general anti-avoidance provisions in sections BG 1 and GB 1. However, the application of the general anti-avoidance provision does not provide sufficient certainty with respect to these transactions. The ability to remove an NRWT liability on dividends by lending securities and obtaining an equivalent swap payment is contrary to policy intent of the NRWT rules and needs to be addressed legislatively. 18 Chapter 4 NEW RULES FOR QUALIFYING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS Proposed changes • Qualifying transactions that meet a strict list of criteria will be taxed on their economic substance rather than legal form. There will be no disposal for tax purposes on entering a qualifying securities lending transaction. Neither the initial transfer of securities nor the subsequent reacquisition of the same or identical securities by the lender will be treated as a taxable event for income tax purposes. • The borrower will be treated as having acquired the borrowed security at its market value and to have returned the replacement security at the same market value. • Any distribution (dividend or interest) received during the term of the securities lending transaction will be passed on to the lender. This includes any tax credits (imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits) attached to a dividend. • The borrower will be required to pay a substitution payment to compensate the lender for any distribution made on the borrowed securities during the term of the securities lending transaction. • When a taxpayer fails to complete a securities lending transaction in accordance with the qualifying conditions, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given the discretion to continue to apply the securities lending rules if the Commissioner is of the opinion that at a later time the transaction will be a qualifying transaction. • When the Commissioner is of the opinion that the transaction will never constitute a qualifying securities lending transaction, the taxpayers affected will be required to amend the tax treatment of the transaction to reflect the general income tax rules. Qualification criteria • The new securities lending rules will be applicable to the following securities: – shares, units, bonds, debentures, convertible notes or rights or options issued by a company or unit trust listed on a recognised exchange or that are ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public; and 19 – bonds, debentures or similar securities issued by a government (in New Zealand or elsewhere). • Agreements will need to be in writing, and any consideration received by the lender from the borrower (such as the lending fee) must be clearly identified in the agreement. • Taxpayers will be able to use standard international agreements as the basis for their New Zealand lending agreements. • To qualify for taxation under the securities lending rules, the transaction must involve identical securities being returned at the end of the lending transaction, along with the return of collateral, less the agreed lending fee. The reacquisition will need to take place within 12 months of the original disposal. • The securities lending transaction must be on arm’s-length terms and not be between associated borrowers and lenders. 4.1 Internationally, there are three areas in which national authorities have made changes to encourage the development of their securities lending markets: • increased clarity; • efficiency improvements; and • removal of barriers (such as the introduction of specific tax rules). 4.2 New Zealand has already introduced greater efficiencies in its securities lending markets through electronic trading. This has reduced settlement times and was expected by the NZX to lead to the development of a market for securities lending as time constraints would make meeting delivery obligations more difficult. However, securities lending does not appear to have increased. This is at least in part attributable to a lack of clarity surrounding the tax treatment of securities lending in New Zealand and a less favourable taxation treatment than that available in international markets. 4.3 In the absence of special tax rules, transfers of securities under a securities loan will generally give rise to a disposal or acquisition for New Zealand income tax purposes. In such cases, the borrower becomes the owner of the securities for the period during which they hold the securities. 4.4 This would change, however, if New Zealand introduced special securities lending rules, similar to those which operate in other international jurisdictions. Under such rules, the transfer of the securities by the lender is not considered to be a taxable disposal of the securities. In addition, the lender is considered to retain beneficial ownership of the securities for tax purposes and is taken to acquire the replacement securities at the cost base of the original securities at the time of the loan. In order to fall within the rules, the securities lending transaction needs to satisfy specific conditions. 20 4.5 The government considers that the introduction of specific tax rules for securities lending would be beneficial for the New Zealand economy. If securities lending was encouraged (or at least not discouraged) through the introduction of special tax rules, it would allow institutional investors to “lend” their securities, thus increasing the number of possible transactions in the market. In theory, this would increase the number of actively traded securities, improve liquidity and lead to a more efficient capital market. It would also resolve many of the problems identified with the current tax treatment of these transactions and would: • Create greater consistency with the treatment adopted in other jurisdictions. Adopting a consistent tax treatment for securities lending transactions is likely to lead to an enhanced international perception of New Zealand’s capital markets. It may also assist with integration of the New Zealand and Australian equities markets. • Create greater consistency with economic reality. Introducing special rules to tax securities lending transactions on the basis of economic reality would reflect the fact that, in substance, the transactions are securitised loan agreements and not a sale or disposition. • Create greater consistency with the treatment of other commercial transactions. Taxing securities lending transactions as loans rather than sales of shares would also ensure a consistent treatment between securities lending and other commercial transactions taxed on the basis of their substance rather than legal form – such as hire purchase agreements, finance leases and livestock bailment. • Increase taxpayer certainty. The introduction of specific rules would resolve much of the uncertainty surrounding the treatment of securities lending transactions. • Improve the perception of New Zealand as an investment destination. As well as ensuring that New Zealand offers the same investment opportunities as other jurisdictions, introducing tax rules which encourage securities lending should improve liquidity in the New Zealand market. Internationally, securities lending represents a substantial part of the daily settlement value in many transaction systems and can play an important role in facilitating market liquidity. • Protect the tax base. By designing specific rules to cater for securities lending, the government will be able to ensure that the transactions which benefit from an economic substance approach are well defined and that others, when appropriate, are subject to specific anti-avoidance rules. This will improve consistency with the policy intent of the imputation and NRWT rules. 21 Designing specific tax rules for securities lending 4.6 Although the government sees the advantages in moving to specific tax rules for securities lending, there are many associated technical problems that will need to be resolved before these can be implemented. 4.7 Specific tax rules for securities lending are likely to be based on those operating in other countries and, in particular, Australia. This will ensure international consistency and provide a tested framework for implementing these changes in New Zealand. 4.8 The aim of any New Zealand securities lending rules will be to allow qualifying transactions that meet a strict list of criteria to be taxed on their economic substance rather than legal form. There will be no disposal for tax purposes on entering a qualifying securities lending transaction. 4.9 Progressing the proposal will require working through a significant number of detailed technical considerations. These questions primarily concern the inter-relationship of other parts of the Income Tax Act 2004 and ensuring that no unforeseen consequences arise. 4.10 The following section discusses some of the key decisions that will need to be made in designing securities lending rules for New Zealand. Qualification criteria 4.11 All the countries which have introduced securities lending rules have made a considerable legislative effort to carefully define the range of securities lending activities that are eligible for relief. The major difficulty will be to ensure that the list of qualifying criteria are general enough to allow for commercial variation while specific enough to exclude tax driven transactions. 4.12 Using international securities lending rules as a guideline (see the appendix for a summary of the individual rules) a number of qualification criteria have been proposed. What securities should be covered? 4.13 To provide a boundary around which transactions are eligible for taxation based on economic substance, a number of the key overseas jurisdictions specifically list which types of securities qualify for securities lending rules. The government proposes to adopt a similar approach, making the following securities eligible for the securities lending rules: 22 • shares, units, bonds, debentures, convertible notes, rights or options issued by a company or unit trust listed on a recognised exchange or ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public; and • bonds, debentures or similar securities which are issued by a government (in New Zealand or elsewhere). Will there be a prescribed form for the securities lending agreements? 4.14 It is a standard requirement for most international securities lending rules that agreements need to be in writing. As this would be normal commercial practice, the government plans to adopt a similar requirement. 4.15 Should the government also require taxpayers to use industry standard agreements? This appears to be a requirement of the Australian rules, which require qualifying transactions to be “of the kind known as a securities lending arrangement”. Given the objective of ensuring consistency between New Zealand’s securities lending rules and comparable international rules, it would be appropriate to require taxpayers to use standard international agreements. This would also reduce the need for taxpayers to have lending agreements approved by the Inland Revenue. Will identical securities need to be returned? 4.16 One of the key features of a securities lending transaction is that identical securities must be returned at the end of the lending transaction. Therefore the government plans to include this as one of the qualification criteria for the New Zealand securities lending rules. The replacement securities must be the same securities as those originally lent or identical securities. 4.17 The reacquisition of the identical securities must also take place within 12 months of the original disposal. This is consistent with international rules. 4.18 “Identical securities” for the purposes of the new rules will require the same number of shares in the same company, conferring identical rights and imposing identical conditions, to be returned. Relief is not available if non- identical securities are returned. Example 3 A lender transfers 100 ordinary shares in ABC Limited to a borrower under a securities lending agreement. The borrower must return 100 ordinary shares in ABC Limited to the lender. The shares must also have the same rights and obligations as those which were originally lent. Relief will not be available if the lender returns 100 preference shares or 100 debentures in ABC Limited. 23 How will the rules deal with distributions and substitute payments? 4.19 A number of practical complications arise when a dividend or coupon is paid during the term of a securities lending transaction – for example, how to deal with imputation credits attached to a dividend and the tax treatment of any substitute payment made to the owner of the securities. 4.20 Although distributions create added challenges to introducing special tax rules for securities lending transactions, the government considers that excluding transactions which cross distribution dates would be too restrictive. Therefore distributions and the payment of substitute payments will be addressed under the proposed rules. 4.21 Special provision will also be made for the case when, during the period of the securities lending agreement, a right or option is issued or, if the borrowed securities are rights or options, the rights or options are exercised. 4.22 One of the key arguments for introducing special tax rules for securities lending transactions is that the current treatment does not reflect economic reality – in other words, that the transaction is a loan and that the lender is still effectively the owner of the shares throughout the transaction. Therefore it is important that transactions qualifying for the special tax rules have this characteristic. The qualification criteria should also include the requirement for any corporate actions in relation to the securities, such as the payment of a dividend, to benefit the lender. The lender must retain the risks and rewards of ownership. What consideration will be required? 4.23 It is also a common feature of international securities lending rules to require adequate consideration or arm’s-length terms. The government plans to include a similar requirement in the qualification criteria for the New Zealand rules. However, this is likely to be a general requirement for arm’s- length terms rather than a requirement for a pre-determined level of consideration. 3 4.24 Any consideration received by the lender from the borrower in addition to the replacement securities must be clearly identified in the written agreement. The loan fee (whether interest or a flat payment), indemnity payments for variations in the market value of the securities and any other payments must be clearly identified in the securities lending agreement. 4.25 To ensure that transactions occur on arm’s-length terms, the government also plans to exclude any transactions between associated lenders and borrowers from the securities lending rules. 3 The Canadian rules require collateral to equate to 95% of market value. 24 Tax treatment under the securities lending rules 4.26 Once a securities lending transaction meets all the qualification criteria, the next question is what impact this has on the tax treatment of the transaction. The following section summarises the proposed tax treatment of a qualifying securities lending transaction. Transactions which do not qualify for the new rules will generally continue to be taxed on a realised basis under the current rules, subject to the proposals for improving the anti-avoidance provisions in this area. Income from securities lending 4.27 Under a qualifying securities lending transaction, the lender will not be subject to any tax consequences other than those arising from receiving the lending fee and any distribution over the term of the transaction. Neither the initial transfer of securities nor the subsequent reacquisition of the same or identical securities will be treated as a taxable event. 4.28 This will require an exemption under the tax rules. The initial loan and the return of the securities should not constitute an event requiring a base price adjustment or be taken into account in any future base price adjustment calculation. Similarly, when a securities lending transaction would have been taxable under the general tax rules, rather than the accrual rules, the transaction will now be ignored, apart from the transaction fee and any distributions which occur over the term of the transaction. Cost base to the borrower 4.29 Under the proposed rules, the borrower will be deemed to have acquired the borrowed security and to have returned the replacement security at the same market value (the market value at the date of acquisition). Example 4 Company A lends a parcel of eligible securities to Company B. The transaction meets all of the securities lending qualification criteria. Company B disposes of the securities to Company C. Under the proposed securities lending rules, Company B is deemed to have acquired the securities from Company A at their market value. When Company B returns either the original or identical securities to company A, Company B is deemed to have disposed of the securities to Company A at the same market value. Company B has not, therefore, made either a profit or loss on the loan transaction. Any profit by Company B derives only from the difference between the price at which the securities were sold to Company C and the market value of the securities. 25 Distributions made over the term of the transaction 4.30 It is intended that any distribution (dividend or interest) received during the term of the securities lending transaction should be passed on to and be taxable to the lender. This includes any tax credits (imputation credits and dividend withholding payment credits) attached to a dividend. A number of practical issues arise in trying to achieve this end. 4.31 Submissions on how distributions should be dealt with as part of introducing specific tax rules for securities lending transactions are welcomed. 4.32 One possible option is to deem both the dividend and tax credits to be received by the lender, who would be subject to tax on these in the normal way. There would be no tax consequences to the borrower as a result of a distribution being paid on the securities. 4.33 Alternatively, the borrower could be taxable on the dividend received and be required to make a non-deductible “substitution payment” to pass on the cash received to the lender. The borrower would also be required to impute the “substitution payment” to the same level as the underlying dividend. 4.34 When the “borrowed” securities have been transferred to a third party and a distribution is made during the term of the securities lending transaction, the third party will continue to keep both the cash distribution and any associated tax credits. However, the borrower will be required to make a “substitution payment” to the lender equivalent to the cash distribution. The borrower will also be required to impute the substitution payment to the same extent as the underlying dividend. To the extent the underlying dividend was not fully imputed, the substitution payment will be subject to NRWT as if it were a dividend. How is the fee paid by the lender to the borrower treated? 4.35 The loan fee (whether interest or a flat payment) will generally be taxable to the lender and deductible to the borrower. What happens if a transaction is not completed? 4.36 Taxpayers will not be certain that a transaction qualifies for the proposed securities lending rules until the time the transaction is completed. However, they will need to make assumptions about qualification at the start of the transaction. 4.37 What happens when, for some reason, a taxpayer fails to complete a securities lending transaction in accordance with the qualifying conditions? For example, what happens when the borrower is unable to obtain identical securities? It is expected that this situation will be fairly rare. However, it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given the power to apply the securities lending rules to such a transaction, if of the opinion that at a later time the transaction will be a qualifying transaction. Taxpayers will 26 need to apply to Inland Revenue to request that the Commissioner exercises his discretion with respect to a given transaction. 4.38 When the Commissioner is of the opinion that the transaction will never constitute a qualifying securities lending transaction, the taxpayers affected will be required to amend the tax treatment of the transaction to reflect the standard income tax rules. This restatement should occur at the time the transaction fails the qualification criteria. Depending on the circumstances, shortfall penalties may apply. 27 Chapter 5 NEW ANTI-AVOIDANCE MEASURES FOR NON-QUALIFYING TRANSACTIONS Proposed changes • Imputation credits will be cancelled if they are paid to a shareholder who lacks economic ownership in the securities and is under an obligation to make a related payment passing on the benefit of receiving tax credits to the economic owner of the shares. • A similar test will be introduced for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), under which the substitute payment will be deemed to be gross income of the borrower. • The government is still considering how “lack of economic ownership” and “related payment” will be defined. • The introduction of a “safe harbour” mechanism for small investors is also being considered. 5.1 A necessary part of reviewing the tax treatment of securities lending transactions is ensuring that the tax rules protect and maintain the revenue base. All the countries reviewed that have introduced securities lending have strengthened their tax rules as part of the package. 5.2 Although the majority of securities lending transactions are not tax-driven, any changes to produce increased certainty and consistency would affect a number of different tax rules. Great care needs to be taken to ensure that the new rules do not create new base maintenance concerns and that existing ones are adequately addressed. 5.3 The rules which exist in other jurisdictions provide some guidance as to the level of risk for New Zealand. The ability to use the rules for transactions which result in an unintended policy outcome has generally been mitigated by setting strict conditions for what constitutes a qualifying securities lending transaction. Jurisdictions have also enacted anti-avoidance provisions targeting imputation trading and similar transactions. 5.4 Therefore, as part of the move to clarify and improve the taxation treatment of securities lending, the government has reviewed the application of the imputation and NRWT rules in this context. 28 Are new rules required? 5.5 The first step in determining whether new rules are required is to conduct a review of the existing provisions. The current measures in place can be divided between specific and general anti-avoidance provisions. Specific anti-avoidance measures 5.6 The current imputation anti-avoidance rule (section GC 22) was designed to ensure that the imputation credits are allocated consistently between shareholders and on a basis that reflects actual rights to company cash flows. It is aimed at arrangements whose predominant underlying purpose is to transfer imputation credits from one party who is unable to use those credits to another party who is able to use them. 5.7 The first three paragraphs of section GC 22(1)(a) are so broadly worded that they would catch the majority of share sales. In practice, therefore, sub- paragraph (iv) provides the only test for distinguishing between transactions that are subject to attack under section GC 22(1)(a) and those that are not. GC 22 IMPUTATION: ARRANGEMENT TO OBTAIN TAX ADVANTAGE (1) For the purposes of this section, there is an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage where – (a) there is an arrangement for the sale or other disposition of shares or issue of shares where – (iv) the purpose, not being an incidental purpose, of the arrangement is that a party to the arrangement would obtain any such tax advantage. 5.8 There is no question that a “tax advantage” arises from an imputation trading arrangement. The term “tax advantage” is very broadly defined to include both the allowance of a credit of tax, and a credit arising to an imputation credit account. The “borrower” can receive both forms of credit in a securities lending transaction. The issue is determining whether this tax advantage is more than a merely incidental purpose of the arrangement. 5.9 Determining whether an arrangement involves more than a merely incidental purpose of obtaining a tax advantage involves considering the effect of the transaction. Is it to achieve a manufactured tax advantage or does any tax advantage merely arise from prudent attention to the tax implications of a course of action? 5.10 The effect or end the taxpayer seeks to achieve is determined objectively by looking at the terms of the transaction. This involves considering the economic reality of a given transaction against whether it involves exploitation of the tax statute. Factors that could be considered are: 29 • the term of the transaction; • the commerciality of the payment flows under the respective legs of the transaction; • the commerciality of the interest rate charged (influenced by the credit rating of the “borrower”, the fact that shares are provided as security and the existence of any guarantees); and • whether the transaction was driven by the need to realise funds, rather than a situation where shares were acquired for the purpose of entering into the transaction. 5.11 Because securities lending transactions are recognised commercial transactions, it can be difficult to establish that a tax advantage gained from any particular transaction is more than merely incidental. 5.12 There is no specific anti-avoidance provision in relation to NRWT. Reliance is placed on the general anti-avoidance provision. General anti-avoidance provision 5.13 Under section BG 1, a tax avoidance arrangement is void against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Under Part G of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage obtained by a person from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. A transaction constitutes such an arrangement if tax avoidance was the purpose of the arrangement and “not merely incidental”. 5.14 A merely incidental purpose is something which is necessarily linked to some other purpose. An incidental purpose is one which is a subsidiary or minor purpose when compared to the other purposes associated with an arrangement. 5.15 As with section GC 22, because securities lending transactions are recognised commercial transactions, it can be difficult to establish that a tax advantage gained from the arrangement is more than merely incidental. The government needs more certainty in this area. Strengthening the New Zealand rules 5.16 One of the underlying principles of the imputation system is that the benefits of imputation should be available only to the true economic owners of shares, and only to the extent that those taxpayers are able to use the imputation credits themselves. To support this policy intent, the imputation rules have anti-streaming and shareholder continuity rules. 30 5.17 Despite these rules, taxpayers not in a position to use imputation credits may, in certain circumstances, be able to use a securities loan to temporarily transfer their shares to taxpayers who can use the credits. “Lenders” retain economic ownership and exposure to the performance of the underlying shares through swap payments and options. However, by entering into the scheme they are able to convert a taxable dividend into a non-taxable swap payment. “Borrowers” are able to obtain tax credits from shares they do not economically own. Allowing taxpayers to manipulate ownership in order to pass on the benefit of imputation credits is inconsistent with the underlying intent of the imputation rules. 5.18 The proposed securities lending rules will ensure the correct tax policy result for qualifying transactions by transferring imputation and dividend withholding credits to the economic owner of the securities. However, ensuring the correct policy outcome for securities lending transactions which fall outside the strict qualification criteria will be dependent on the anti- avoidance provisions. If the current tax rules cannot ensure the right policy result with respect to securities lending transactions, new rules are required. On this basis, the government is considering introducing new anti-avoidance measures for the imputation and NRWT rules. What form will the new rules take? 5.19 In introducing a new anti-avoidance measure to prevent unintended policy outcomes with respect to securities lending transactions, there are a number of possible options. “Lack of economic risk” 5.20 The new anti-avoidance rule should ensure that shareholders have economic ownership in the underlying shares before they are able to access imputation credits. Therefore one option is to deny imputation credits when there is lack of economic risk. 5.21 If such a measure is introduced, one of the key questions will be how to define lack of economic risk. 5.22 One option is a general requirement for shareholders to have economic ownership in the underlying shares before imputation credits can be accessed. However, what constitutes “economic ownership”? A general requirement without some specific measure would lead to taxpayer uncertainty as to when the anti-avoidance provision applied. 5.23 Including a precise method for determining when there is a lack of economic ownership increases taxpayer certainty. However, it also increases complexity, as evidenced by the rules operating in other jurisdictions. 31 5.24 Australia introduced extensive legislation in 1998 to address avoidance concerns with respect to the trading of franking credits. The Australian rules measure whether economic exposure exists for a share by determining the delta of the taxpayer’s position in a share. If the delta of a taxpayer’s position in a share is less than 0.3, the taxpayer is deemed not to have economic exposure to the shares, and no tax credit is allowed. 5.25 Delta is a well-recognised financial concept that measures the change in value of the taxpayer’s position for a $1 change in share price. Taxpayers highly exposed to share price volatility have a high delta and are deemed to have economic risk. Taxpayers who have a low delta do not have much exposure to movements in the share price and are deemed not to have economic risk. Example 5 Jack holds 1000 shares in a company and writes a call option with a delta of 0.6 in respect of those shares. He will not have a materially diminished risk because his net position in relation to the shares will be in excess of 0.3. To determine the net position, the delta of the sold call option is subtracted from the delta of the shares (the delta of a share against which the delta of an option or other derivative is calculated is, by definition, +1.0). Accordingly, the net position of the taxpayer is: ((1000\*1) – (1000\*0.6))/1000 = 0.4 In contrast, Jill who holds 1000 shares and writes a call option with a delta of 0.9, will have a materially diminished risk because her net position is 0.1. Focusing on the related payment 5.26 There is a risk that focusing solely on lack of economic risk could unintentionally catch ordinary business transactions which do not result in a tax treatment contrary to policy intent, such as transactions aimed at hedging risk. 5.27 It appears that for an imputation trading transaction to be tax effective, the unintended tax advantage must be passed on through some form of deductible payment from the borrower to the lender. Such a payment is made in return for the receipt of tax credits, such as imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits, or to share the benefit of NRWT being avoided. Therefore another possible option for the new anti-avoidance rule would be to focus on there being a related payment passing on the tax benefit of the transaction. This will necessitate a wide definition of “related payment”. 32 5.28 The Australian legislation includes a detailed definition of what is meant by “related payment”: (i) Causing a payment(s) to be made to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or (ii) Causing an amount(s) to be credited to, or applied for the benefit of, the other person(s); or (iii) Causing services to be provided to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or (iv) Causing property to be transferred to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or (v) Allowing any property or money to be used by the other person(s) or by someone nominated by the other person(s); or (vi) Causing an amount(s) to be set off against, or to be otherwise applied in reduction of, a debt(s) owed by the person(s) to the taxpayer or associate; or (vii) Agreeing to treat an amount(s) owed to the other person(s) by the taxpayer or associate as having been increased. 5.29 Although this definition does cover a number of scenarios, there may be other situations which need to be included – for example, alteration of the sale price of the shares and the interest rate paid by the “lender”. The effectiveness of the new provision will rely heavily on the definition of related payment. For the provision to operate effectively, the term “related payment” must be interpreted widely. Requiring a set holding period 5.30 A further option could be to require shareholders to have held shares for a set period before imputation credits are available. 5.31 To prevent trading of franking credits, Australia denies franking credits if the taxpayer effectively has no interest in the dividend because of an obligation to pass it (or an equivalent payment) to another taxpayer. 5.32 The measure applies when the taxpayer has not effectively held the shares for 45 days (measured from 45 4 days before to 45 days after the shares became “ex-dividend”). 5.33 Although a holding period test has the advantage of simplicity, there are also significant disadvantages with this measure. It potentially penalises a taxpayer on the basis of an arbitrary time period. It also introduces additional record-keeping requirements because taxpayers will need to calculate the number of days they hold shares in relation to the payment of a dividend. 4 The rule is 90 days in the case of preference shares. 33 Preferred option 5.34 The government’s preferred approach is to combine options one and two. This will ensure that (non-qualifying) securities lending transactions are taxed in a way which is consistent with the imputation and NRWT rules, while targeting those transactions aimed at obtaining an unintended tax benefit. 5.35 On this basis, the government is proposing to introduce a further requirement to the imputation rules which will require shareholders to have economic ownership in the underlying shares before they are able to access imputation credits, if the benefit of obtaining the tax credits is passed on through a related payment. A similar test will be introduced for NRWT, although the mechanism for removing the tax benefit obtained will be different. It is not intended that a holding period test be introduced. 5.36 In order to reduce compliance costs, the government is considering introducing a safe harbour mechanism (likely to be based on the value of securities held) to exempt small investors from the need to comply with the new anti-avoidance rules. This exemption would operate in a similar way as the cash basis person mechanism in the accrual rules. Submissions on how a safe harbour should operate are welcomed. What happens if the test applies? 5.37 The tax benefit of entering into a securities lending transaction will be eliminated by focusing on the benefit derived by the “borrower”, namely denying the tax credits the borrower receives on any dividends. 5.38 This approach is: • consistent with the underlying principle of the imputation rules that imputation credits are available only to the true economic owners of shares; • consistent with the intended effect of the existing anti-avoidance rule in section GC 22; • consistent with the approach adopted in other jurisdictions; and • easy to administer as the target of the rule, the recipient of the dividend, is within the New Zealand tax base. 5.39 Although this approach will prevent imputation trading, it could not be replicated if the problem involves a non-resident lending shares to a resident to circumvent NRWT. In this case, there will not be any tax credits to cancel. 5 5 The New Zealand borrower is likely to hold a certificate of exemption and will not be subject to the resident withholding tax rules. 34 5.40 Instead, when the issue is NRWT avoidance, the substitute payment would be taxable, as occurs already under section GC 14A. Section GC 14A is a specific anti-avoidance provision aimed at preventing non-residents from avoiding NRWT on a redemption payment by disposing of a commercial bill to a resident immediately before its maturity. Section GC 14A does this by including the redemption payment in the resident person’s gross income if the sale or transfer from the non-resident to the resident “has the purpose of avoiding non-resident withholding tax or the approved issuer levy”. Submission points 5.41 The government is interested in obtaining feedback on the proposed new anti-avoidance test, and whether it is appropriate to determine economic ownership through a delta test. 5.42 The government is also interested in comments on the definition of “related payment” and whether this will be a suitable way of limiting the application of the anti-avoidance provision to those transactions whose purpose is obtaining a tax advantage. 5.43 Finally, comments are welcomed on the proposed method for eliminating the unintended tax benefit, both for imputation and NRWT purposes, and the proposed safe harbour mechanism. 35 Appendix SUMMARY OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES LENDING RULES Australia United Kingdom Canada United States Date introduced 1990 1989 1989 1983 Conditions for qualifying transactions Agreement in writing Y Y Y Return of securities Y Y Y Y Substitute payments required Y.

UK treasury stock, stock exchange listed securities of UK companies and non-UK companies where within UK withholding tax rules, overseas securities. 7 The UK stock lending rules specifically exclude repos. These are covered by separate tax rules. Shares, bonds, debentures, notes, warrants, rights, options and similar instruments of Canadian public companies. Shares listed on prescribed foreign exchanges, government securities also qualify. 6 If borrower provides collateral (qualifying security) with a market value equal to 95% of the market value of the securities borrowed, the substitute payments will retain the character of the underlying payments. 7 The original UK stock lending rules avoided problems relating to UK tax on overseas dividends by making approved lending impossible where such tax would arise. The stock lending rules were subsequently extended to cover overseas securities, subject to adequate accounting for tax on manufactured overseas dividends. The widening of the provisions resulted from industry pressure. For overseas securities not within the UK withholding rules, the UK Inland Revenue treats substitute payments in the same manner as if true dividends or interest were received. The regulations are not as stringent as there are fewer approvals over the parties involved. Instead there are detailed accounting rules involving memoranda accounts to ensure that tax on dividends is properly accounted for to the Inland Revenue. The principles underlying the accounting procedures are that the lender should receive any manufactured dividend with the same amounts deducted as the overseas and UK tax that would have been deducted from the real dividend had the stock not been lent, and that this tax should be accounted for to the UK Inland Revenue.

Cash payments are widespread in some industries and are often an indication of tax evasion. 1 A cash payment with no invoice or receipt is not easily traceable, involves no permanent record, and is often instrumental in understating income and thus evading tax. The practice is, of course, not limited to household services but extends across a wide range of industries. 1.2 Tax evasion is a problem that affects everyone. Those who evade tax contribute less than their fair share to the government revenue that funds essential services such as education, health care and the police, but they still make use of those services. At the same time, honest taxpayers have to pay more to cover the shortfall left by those who are dishonest. 1.3 New Zealand’s tax law provides for severe penalties to apply to people who are caught evading tax. The law also allows for reduced penalties when people voluntarily disclose their evasion to Inland Revenue. These rules reflect the government’s view that there should be no tolerance of people who are determined not to pay tax and will do so only if forced. Entrenched evasion 1.4 On the other hand, it can be difficult for people who have evaded tax in the past, and who want to begin complying with the law, to come forward and sort out their tax affairs. This is particularly so when tax evasion is prevalent across a whole industry. 1.5 Tax is a cost that businesses have to factor into their processes and pricing. A business that pays tax when its competitors do not suffers a pricing disadvantage than can render it uncompetitive and financially unviable. Furthermore, an Inland Revenue reassessment of back years can result in large debts for a business that has been understating income. The debt is made worse by the addition of penalties and interest, even if they are reduced because the operator made a voluntary disclosure of undeclared income. 1 For information on evasion in the New Zealand economy, see chapter 7, “Tax Evasion and the Hidden Economy”, in Tax Compliance – A Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998. Available at: http://www.executive.govt.nz/96-99/compliance/chapter7.htm 2 1.6 Whether it is because they are bankrupted over tax debts or they lose out to competitors, operators who try to stop evading tax often face a huge risk of being driven out of business. When this happens, it further entrenches tax evasion within the relevant industry, since only non-compliant businesses will survive. 1.7 The existing tax rules do not deal with the problem of industry-wide tax evasion because they are designed to apply to individual businesses. It may well be, however, that a different approach to promoting compliance is required when an evasion becomes common place within an industry. The thinking behind the proposals 1.8 The proposals described in this discussion document would allow Inland Revenue to offer limited amnesties to targeted industries or other groups, giving businesses within those industries a last chance to “clean up their act” and begin complying with the law. Income tax evasion would be the main subject of the amnesties but they could also extend to other taxes, such as GST, depending upon the circumstances. The limited amnesties would be backed up by intensive enforcement activity against those who did not take up the offer. 1.9 It is very important to understand that the proposal is not about simply letting evaders off the hook. Rather, it is about improving the incentive to come forward for those who are willing to begin complying with the law, allowing Inland Revenue to focus more resources on those who continue to evade tax. To improve this incentive, it may be necessary to offer a concession by limiting the number of past years for which tax would be assessed under an amnesty. The concession would be part of a trade-off designed to improve compliance in the long run, increasing the total tax ultimately collected from participating businesses. 1.10 Similar considerations apply to social policy programmes based on assessed taxable income, such as family assistance, child support and student loans. Although a limit on the number of past years that are reassessed for income tax purposes means some assessments may never reflect an evader’s real income, if an amnesty could bring the evader into the tax system it would mean that more accurate assessments could be made for the most recent years and would continue to be made in the future. Custodial parents who received underpaid child support from a tax evader over a number of years might be better off receiving the correct amount in future years – rather than waiting in vain for underpaid child support from the past that may not be collectible. 1.11 It must also be stressed that a limited amnesty could be justified only if it reduced the level of evasion within a specific industry or area of the economy where evasion is rife, and eased the competitive pressure to evade tax in the future. 3 1.12 For this reason, each amnesty would be offered only for a limited time to a specific industry that had been identified as having ingrained evasion. There would be no guarantee that any given industry would ever be offered an amnesty, and there would be no general amnesty for all taxpayers – it would be counter-productive if taxpayers could simply wait until the next amnesty before taking steps to improve their compliance. Following an amnesty, Inland Revenue’s audit and enforcement activity would be stepped up, and people who were caught evading tax would be subject to the full penalties and other enforcement measures available under the law. Anyone already being audited by Inland Revenue when an amnesty was announced would not be eligible to participate. 1.13 Because it is uncertain whether limited amnesties would prove to be effective, a number of safeguards are proposed. They include: • requirements for Inland Revenue to report to Ministers and Parliament on the success or otherwise of any amnesty; • Inland Revenue monitoring the idea by reviewing the results of the first two to three amnesties and reporting on outcomes; and • providing for the power to offer amnesties to be removed by Order in Council. These safeguards mean the government can be seen as piloting the proposals initially, to ensure the intended benefits are being realised. Amnesties when the law is changed 1.14 Apart from dealing with evasion, amnesties might also have merit when a change in tax law highlights previous, possibly unintentional, non- compliance – for example, non-compliance that results from uncertain tax laws that are later clarified. 4 Summary of proposals Limited amnesties would be offered to operators in some industries in which tax evasion presents a particular set of problems that could be unnecessarily costly for the tax administration to tackle using traditional tax education and audit systems. The limited amnesties would: • be a one-off opportunity for people in a targeted industry to come forward and disclose their past evasion; • allow Inland Revenue to offer amnesties to some industries or other groups, at its discretion; • offer an attractive advantage for evaders to disclose undeclared income under the terms of an amnesty by limiting the number of years for which income would have to be disclosed; and • be backed up by intensive audit activity focused on those who within the industry in question do not come forward under an amnesty offer. The conditions of the limited amnesties proposed here would limit the amount of core tax that would be assessed for past periods of evasion. However, penalties and interest would still apply to the tax that was assessed, and any repayments of family assistance or back payments of child support and student loans for the disclosure period would still have to be made. If these amnesties were not successful, the power to offer them would be removed. The purpose of offering a limited amnesty to a targeted industry would be to provide tax evaders with an incentive to stop evading tax permanently. A successful amnesty would improve overall tax compliance in the long run, without being seen as unfair to those who have complied with their tax obligations. Limited amnesties would be considered in conjunction with changes in tax law on a case-by-case basis. Submissions 1.15 The government invites submissions on the proposals set out in this discussion document. It recognises that the proposals may raise concerns about fairness, particularly in relation to people who have voluntarily complied with their tax obligations. We believe our preferred amnesty option will strike a fair balance between the concession offered to past evaders and the increased future compliance that will result in exchange. However, we welcome any comments on whether we have got the balance right, and on how the proposals might be made fairer in the eyes of people who already comply with the law. Although the document often identifies specific issues for consultation, views on any of the issues raised are welcomed. Submissions should be made by 1 October 2004. 5 1.16 Written submissions should be addressed to: Limited tax amnesties c/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON 1.17 If making a submission in electronic form please put “Limited amnesties” in the subject line.

Some evaders, for example, may believe that they should not have to pay tax at all. Others may believe they can get away with evasion because they are small players and the authorities will not notice. Or they may want to hide the fact that they have received income from a criminal activity or to commit benefit fraud. Still others may evade tax because to pay it would put them at a commercial disadvantage, since their industry is one in which evasion is ingrained. The last are the subject of this discussion document. 2.2 Tax law does not attempt to distinguish between different motivations for evading tax. In the statutory scheme, evasion is evasion and it is unacceptable, whatever the reason behind it, which is reflected in the severe sanctions provided in the law. Penalties for tax evasion Tax evasion is the most serious type of non-compliance in our tax law. Evaders’ names are published, and in some cases criminal prosecution can be taken, which can lead to court-imposed fines or imprisonment. On top of this, evasion attracts a shortfall penalty, which can be substantial. The penalty is calculated as follows: • The basic penalty is 150 percent of the difference between the tax returned and the correct tax payable. • In recognition that it is better if evaders voluntarily disclose hidden income, even at a late stage, rather than have it uncovered by an Inland Revenue audit, the penalty is reduced by 75 percent if they disclose the evasion purely of their own accord, or by 40 percent if they disclose the evasion after being notified that an audit is to be conducted. • The penalty is reduced by 50 percent if it is the first offence, to give first-time evaders a chance to comply with the law in the future, rather than simply being shut down by an unmanageable level of debt. • Another 25 percent can be added to the penalty if they obstruct the audit. The penalty for evasion, therefore, ranges from a minimum of 18.75 percent of the shortfall (if both the 75 percent reduction and the 50 percent reduction apply) to a maximum of 175 percent (if there are no reductions and the additional 25 percent for obstruction applies). Because the shortfall penalty is payable on top of the actual tax and interest, evaders who are caught can face substantial debts. The law does not allow these debts to be written off on grounds of hardship, so if they cannot be repaid, bankruptcy or liquidation is the likely result. Both bankruptcy and a criminal conviction for evasion will limit someone’s ability to run a business, and so will limit their opportunity to continue evading tax. 7 2.3 Even so, evasion may require a wider range of responses, depending upon the underlying attitudes of the evaders, as shown in figure 1. Traditional enforcement measures may not be effective against certain types of evasion, particularly when it is built into business practices across a whole industry. F IGURE 1: Best practice for promoting compliance Different attitudes to paying tax may require different responses to collecting tax. Inland Revenue uses this model to show how it meets different attitudes with different responses designed to encourage and support tax compliance. The model represents best practice in this area internationally. Source: The way forward – achievements and future direction Inland Revenue Department, August 2003 The aim for this model is to move people who are not complying into a position where they are. The amnesties proposed in this discussion document are intended to help ease the transition to compliance for those willing to change. For those not willing to change, the full force of the law would then be applied, with the hardcore of evaders attracting the severest penalties. Structural evasion 2.4 Industry-wide evasion can become ingrained. A business that is able to achieve savings in its operating costs by not paying tax increases its profit margin. This may result in the extra money simply being pocketed by the operator, or in the saving being passed on to customers in the form of lower overall charges or discounts for cash jobs. Tax evasion, therefore, gives the operator either a direct financial advantage or a competitive advantage over other businesses within the same industry that do not evade tax. 8 2.5 The result is that there is a constant pressure on businesses within highly non-compliant industries to continue to evade tax simply in order to survive. 2.6 When evasion is an industry-wide problem, an industry-wide approach may be required. For there to be sustained future compliance within certain industries, the underlying pressures to evade tax must also be addressed. But it is extremely difficult to do this by using a standard business-by-business approach, for several reasons. Low incentive to disclose evasion 2.7 The likelihood of facing large tax debts reduces the incentive to disclose evasion. There is no limit to the number of years that Inland Revenue can assess for evasion. For this reason, when the correct back-tax is assessed for a business, whether as a result of a voluntary disclosure on the part of the operator or as a result of an Inland Revenue audit, a large debt will often be the result. 2.8 For example, a small business that declares $30,000 of income a year but has failed to account properly for or has hidden an extra $100 a week ($5,200 a year) for four years would be liable to pay about $11,560 in income tax when detected by Inland Revenue. If, instead, the operator disclosed that income voluntarily, penalties would be reduced and the liability would be $6,650. 2.9 Even with the reduction for voluntary disclosure, however, the debt for back- tax may be too high for a small business to face, especially while meeting its present tax obligations as well. The psychological and financial barrier for a business to come forward and disclose tax evasion can, in such circumstances, be high. Uncollectible back-tax 2.10 Evaders may not be in a position to repay the resulting debt when Inland Revenue assesses them for back-year evasion. Most of the money they saved as a result of tax evasion is likely to have been either passed on to customers through reduced fees or spent by the time the evasion comes to light. The longer the time that has passed since the evasion, the more likely this is. 2.11 In most situations, the law relieves people from tax debt if repayment would place them in hardship. Relief can take the form of either a write-off of debt or an arrangement for repayment by instalments over time. Debts resulting from evasion, however, can be written off only following bankruptcy or liquidation. 2.12 From an administrative perspective, it is not efficient for Inland Revenue to invest resources in assessing evaded tax, only to have to write that tax off under bankruptcy or liquidation and collect little or nothing. Assisting future compliance is likely to be a better use of such resources. 9 2.13 Instalment arrangements for repaying tax debt might be more viable, but a large debt will typically take a long time to repay or will require large instalments. A key risk is that businesses that are just beginning to pay tax correctly and are adjusting to the extra cost of tax to their operation will not be able to afford debt repayments on top of that. Therefore the resources invested in setting up an instalment arrangement may only delay insolvency a little longer. Effect on whole industries 2.14 The problem is larger than any one bad taxpayer. Because disclosure of past evasion can result in large amounts of reassessed tax that become debts, there is a high risk that a business that finds itself in this situation will not be able to pay its debt and also begin to pay tax on a regular basis. If it cannot, the result is likely to be that the business will fail financially and will simply be shut down, with little or no tax ever collected. 2.15 If this happens, there will be no increase in overall compliance by either the business or the industry. Indeed, evasion will be further entrenched in the industry if those businesses that do attempt to begin complying end up being shut down and their customer base is absorbed by the remaining businesses that have no intention of ever complying. 2.16 Furthermore, the failure of businesses that attempt to move into compliance may create social costs in terms of the loss of a source of income for operators, their families and employees. These costs may also translate to fiscal costs to the government in the form of unemployment benefits being claimed, and far outweigh the value of the tax that is actually collected – if any is collected at all. 2.17 Even if operators who come forward do manage to pay their debt for back tax, the competitive pressure to begin evading again will still be there, and the operators may ultimately be forced back into evasion. 2.18 Dealing with businesses individually does not solve the problem of the competitive pressure in an industry as a whole, and so will do little to reduce the overall level of evasion within an industry. 10 Chapter 3 WOULD LIMITED AMNESTIES HELP COMBAT INDUSTRY-WIDE EVASION? 3.1 An incentive is needed for businesses within highly non-compliant industries to stop evading tax. The best approach may be to make it possible for the benefits to a business of coming forward with a voluntary disclosure outweigh those of gambling on not being detected by Inland Revenue. 3.2 As an incentive, the government is proposing to allow Inland Revenue to offer limited tax amnesties to businesses in targeted industries. These limited amnesties would, however, be accompanied by comprehensive audit of the industries involved and full penalisation of those who were caught evading tax. 3.3 Under a limited amnesty, as described in this discussion document, businesses coming forward with voluntary disclosures of evasion would have less back tax to pay than they would if detected, which would make it an easier debt to manage. On the other hand, there would be increased risk for those who still chose not to make voluntary disclosures that they would be caught by Inland Revenue and penalised heavily. Fairness of amnesties 3.4 Any kind of amnesty will allow people who have not complied with their obligations to be dealt with more favourably than they otherwise would. Clearly, this can be seen as unfair by those who have complied with the law fully and see non-compliant people being let off. 3.5 The unfairness to honest taxpayers is a concern, especially if the limited amnesties proposed here are not seen as a useful tool for Inland Revenue to use in enforcing and promoting compliance. The government’s view is that, even though a key part of the proposal is to offer a more favourable treatment to some people, to do so would still be consistent with the key principles of tax administration, particularly those directed to encouraging voluntary compliance. Efficient use of Inland Revenue resources 3.6 Although Inland Revenue would need to allocate additional audit resources to a targeted industry, one of the benefits of offering a limited amnesty to the industry is that it would improve Inland Revenue’s audit efficiency. 11 3.7 If some people within an industry came forward with disclosures and Inland Revenue were able to assess them simply on the basis of those disclosures, more audit resources would be freed to be used on those within the industry who did not come forward. 3.8 An amnesty targeted at a specific industry would allow for the collection of detailed information on that industry. Developments in information technology are increasingly allowing such information to be matched and cross-matched with information from other sources to help identify key areas where audit resources should be targeted. This kind of information might also be useful for continued monitoring to check that compliance within a targeted industry had increased as a result of an amnesty. 3.9 Finally, making debt more manageable for the businesses involved would reduce the likelihood of resource-intensive debt collection procedures on Inland Revenue’s part. The resulting savings could be used to pursue the worst offenders. Highest net revenue over time 3.10 In terms of revenue collected, any amnesty is very much a trade-off. On the one hand, tax, penalties or interest may have to be forgone to make voluntary disclosures attractive to past evaders. On the other, some additional tax is likely to be collected if those past evaders are successfully brought into the tax system and begin paying the correct tax. 3.11 It has to be borne in mind that in some cases the tax forgone might never have been detected by Inland Revenue anyway, or would have been impossible to collect. Furthermore, when the tax debt arising from an Inland Revenue assessment resulted in a business going under, the potential future revenue from that business would also be lost. 3.12 A successful amnesty would be consistent with the goal, set out in law, that Inland Revenue should collect the maximum net revenue over time. That goal is already reflected in various tax provisions, such as those allowing for debt repayment by instalments when the alternative could be bankruptcy – and no tax collected at all. The role of amnesties 3.13 As well as getting evaders within a targeted industry to begin complying with the law, a limited amnesty followed by intensive, industry-wide audit would also send an important message to the non-compliers – that their evasion is unacceptable and will be punished severely when they are caught. 12 3.14 Ideally, this message would be taken on board by people in other industries. In fact, it should be made clear that it would be pointless for them to wait for an amnesty to be offered to them before they began to comply with the law, since there would be no guarantee that their industry would ever be offered one. The doubt whether an amnesty would ever be offered to them would be an important factor because it would reinforce the message that everyone should be complying with the law already, and if they are not the best time to start is now. 3.15 It should be remembered that the proposal is for a limited amnesty that is targeted to specific industries, not a general amnesty. The potential for people to anticipate a general amnesty and lower their current level of compliance while they wait for it is a key risk. Furthermore, some of the benefits of a targeted amnesty would be lost in a general amnesty. The gains to Inland Revenue’s audit efficiency would be lower, and the resources required to undertake audits across the entire taxpayer base, to back up the amnesty, would be significant. 3.16 One of the few times when an amnesty for all taxpayers might be justified is if there had been major changes to the tax system and the amnesty provided a way to get everybody into the new system, or if the amnesty was intended to help people clean up their tax affairs before a new, more stringent system of penalties was introduced. These are not factors in the proposal discussed here. Tax amnesties – worldwide experience Most studies on tax amnesties have shown that the cost/benefit outcomes of tax amnesties are highly variable. The reason for the success of some tax amnesties is typically because of their specific design. Tax compliance literature indicates that an amnesty must offer incentives, and these incentives should contain both reward and consequence components – reward for taking up the amnesty offer, and consequences for not taking up the offer. In the United States, state taxing authorities have generally held amnesties just before increasing enforcement activity or making significant changes to the tax system. Experimental statistical studies show that the average level of compliance falls after an amnesty, although a well designed amnesty may be able to overcome this problem. If post-amnesty enforcement efforts increase, aggregate compliance has been found to increase. In fact, post-amnesty compliance can be higher when an amnesty is accompanied by increased enforcement efforts than when enforcement increases without an amnesty. An amnesty may, therefore, be an effective tool for easing the transition to new and tougher tax rules. 13 Advantages Some studies indicate that amnesties can be used to ease the transition to enhanced enforcement and seem to generate immediate revenue efficiently. Revenue comes sooner and at a lower cost with a tax amnesty. Moreover, if society is more willing to forgive evasion when it is an isolated case (as it seems to be for many amnesty participants) than when it is a continuing practice, an intervening amnesty period may make the change in rules appear fairer. The guilt felt by many basically honest taxpayers can be relieved without imposing severe penalties, while strengthened tax enforcement is left to deal with the “hardcore” evaders who choose not to participate. An amnesty also allows a tax authority to reduce its administrative backlog of paperwork and arrears, thereby saving in administrative costs. An amnesty is also a good source of data on tax evaders. Disadvantages The literature highlights a number of risks associated with amnesties. A study of the 2002 Michigan amnesty found that most non-filers who came forward had failed to comply for a single year only, perhaps indicating that chronic non-filers do not come forward in amnesties. Therefore the long-term addition to revenue from new taxpayers brought into – or back into – the system is likely to be small, and might easily be offset if the amnesty has any negative effects on the compliance behaviour of other taxpayers. It is also held that tax amnesties bring in much less incremental revenue than is reported – evidence indicates that much of the inflow is likely to be money that would have been collected regardless of the amnesty. Although amnesties can accelerate the collection process, more than half of the cash inflow in overseas amnesties has come from accounts receivable, or tax liabilities that had already been identified as due. Tax amnesties are also perceived as costly and many people believe that they give the wrong message to taxpayers. To be successful, general amnesties have to be a one- off occurrence. Even so, it has been shown that amnesties can be “habit-forming”, as many countries that have held multiple tax amnesties that resulted in failure have found. Amnesties also provide taxpayers with better information about the extent of undetected tax evasion, which can have a negative effect on future compliance. Integrity of the tax system 3.17 Just as there is a risk that people would come to expect to be offered an amnesty and would lower their compliance in anticipation of it, there is also a risk that people who would otherwise be honest taxpayers would react negatively to the fact that evaders were being given favourable treatment and would choose not to comply in the future, despite the potential consequences. 3.18 Any concession to those who have evaded tax is potentially unfair in the eyes of those who have not. Several tax rules already reflect this, and it is often incumbent on Inland Revenue to strike a fair balance between being pragmatic about enforcement of tax obligations and ensuring that taxpayers are made aware of the need to meet those obligations. 3.19 For example, Inland Revenue can provide financial relief in cases of serious hardship by writing off outstanding tax. In this process wider considerations of a person’s welfare are provided for. This helps maintain the integrity of the tax system and prevent inefficient results by putting someone in a position that would require other kinds of government assistance. 14 3.20 Another example is that the law provides for reductions in penalties if taxpayers make voluntary disclosures of evasion. The reality is a voluntary disclosure is preferable to a lengthy audit, particularly in terms of Inland Revenue’s resources and the costs to the taxpayer of being audited. 3.21 People who make a voluntary disclosure outside the terms of an amnesty may feel that those allowed to use an amnesty offer get an unfair advantage. It is true that the two outcomes may be different, but the offer of an amnesty should be seen as providing an extra incentive for those targeted, rather than denying something that should be available more widely. 3.22 Even if limited amnesties are considered to be a useful tool in improving voluntary compliance, there is a risk that, in practice, they could fail to meet their objectives – for several reasons, including the unpredictability of people’s behaviour. If this were to happen, monitoring and reports by Inland Revenue would detect this, and its power to offer amnesties would be removed. Thus the initial amnesty offers could be seen as piloting the proposal, with the government retaining options to refine or remove the ability to offer them in the future. Key questions Would it be acceptable to offer limited amnesties to tax evaders? Would limited amnesties help evaders to begin complying with the tax laws? Would it be fair to offer amnesties, even limited ones, as a last chance for tax evaders to get their tax affairs in order? Are there other options instead that would deal with industries or areas of the economy where there is ingrained evasion? 15 Chapter 4 HOW WOULD LIMITED AMNESTIES WORK? Summary of proposals • Limited amnesties could offer a one-off, short-term opportunity to business operators within a targeted industry to enter the tax system by disclosing past evasion, and paying tax correctly on a continuing basis. • The offer would include relatively favourable terms designed to limit the tax debt resulting from disclosure so that the risk of unmanageable debt would be less of a disincentive to coming forward. • The targeted industry would be subject to increased audit, and evasion detected by this means would be subject to the full range of penalties and other sanctions provided for in the legislation. • The results of pilot amnesties would be closely monitored and their benefits, risks and costs evaluated. 4.1 Inland Revenue would select an industry or group in the economy to be targeted with the offer of a limited amnesty. The offer would specify who was eligible to participate, the start and end date between which eligible people could come forward and the terms and conditions that would have to be met to qualify for the benefits of the amnesty. Eligibility could be specified in a number of ways, depending on the circumstances of the amnesty. 4.2 To participate, business operators would need to contact Inland Revenue and provide information about their evasion as required by the terms of the amnesty offer. Inland Revenue would then check that information against other information it held, which could well be sourced from third parties and others participating in the amnesty. An incentive to disclose evasion 4.3 Limited amnesties would provide an incentive and opportunity for evaders – be they small or big-time – to come forward on their own, under conditions that would limit the amount of tax they could be assessed for and have to pay. 16 4.4 An incentive to make a voluntary disclosure of evasion can be provided in two main ways. One is by suspending the application of rules that would normally impose penalties and interest, assessing just core tax amounts. The other is by limiting the extent to which core tax amounts can be assessed, but applying the normal penalties and interest to the assessed amounts. 4.5 The proposals considered here are based mainly on the second approach, so that most of the usual rules would apply from the moment someone came forward under an amnesty. Although penalties would apply, they would be at the reduced rates provided for under law and would depend on the personal circumstances of the individual. The principle behind this is to provide the opportunity for the evader to choose to participate fully in the tax system on a continuing basis, with the amnesty concession applying only to some back years. 4.6 For both the evader and the tax system there would be a trade-off between tax for back years that was not assessed or collected and the promise of future tax compliance. The main area where a judgement has to be made is which years should be subject to disclosure and assessment of tax, and to what extent any given year should be assessed for the full amount of tax. These parameters would affect the incentive for an evader to come forward. Conditions to a limited amnesty 4.7 Business operators qualifying under the terms of an amnesty would be those who earn income from a particular industry. Although more than one industry might be targeted over time, those who worked in more than one industry would be eligible to make use of one amnesty only. In all cases, people already being audited by Inland Revenue would not be eligible to participate. 4.8 Because the key purpose of offering an amnesty would be to get people to comply in the long run, the concessions offered under an amnesty would be contingent on full disclosure and future compliance. Inland Revenue might require additional information on top of tax returns and would monitor participants closely to ensure they did continue to pay tax correctly. 4.9 Full disclosure is much easier if the periods involved are more recent. However, even for recent periods, full and detailed information might not be available, so Inland Revenue would aim to achieve an assessment that reflected an evader’s overall income, even if not backed up by full records. 4.10 Similarly, although there would have to be an expectation that compliance would continue, amnesty participants would not be subsequently disqualified from the protection of an amnesty if they incurred a tax debt or filed a tax return late. Once they had moved into the tax system, the normal rules for debt and return policing would apply. 17 4.11 Evaders who came forward under an amnesty could expect to be subject to greater scrutiny in future years – possibly leading to somewhat higher compliance costs – than would other taxpayers. Instalment arrangements for paying back-tax 4.12 Evaders’ ability to pay the debt assessed under amnesty conditions is an important consideration in their decision to come forward and comply with the law in the future. Instalment arrangements could be entered into for the payment of tax debt assessed under an amnesty in the same way that other tax debts can be paid by instalment. 4.13 As such, it might in some circumstances be necessary for Inland Revenue to write off some of the tax assessed, to avoid placing someone who comes forward under the terms of an amnesty in serious hardship. Such write-offs are prohibited under the normal rules in cases of evasion or other abusive tax positions. Nevertheless, it is not intended that coming forward should result in serious financial hardship, as defined under the tax administration rules. Managing changes in the tax system 4.14 An amnesty could also provide extra flexibility to deal with problems that arise when tax laws change. For example, the legislative clarification of a tax issue might highlight that interpretations applied previously were not consistent with government policy, thereby increasing the risk of penalties. The problem could be dealt with by offering a limited amnesty, with its associated monitoring and reporting requirements. Such amnesties would be considered on a case-by-case basis by Ministers in relation to any legislative reform. Treatment of existing debt 4.15 Existing tax debt would not be within the scope of limited amnesties. The remission of existing tax debt would continue to be determined under the rules for instalment payments and, if appropriate, the writing off of tax. 18 The income that can be assessed for back-tax 4.16 Even if full income for a back year were to be disclosed, the limited amnesty could, depending on the option 2 implemented, provide for only a portion of that income to be assessed for tax. This would decrease the amounts payable and so increase the incentive to come forward, particularly if a longer disclosure period were used. For example, a four-year disclosure period with assessments for half the normal income tax in all but the most recent year would be roughly equivalent to assessing tax over two and a half years, but would allow Inland Revenue to collect four years’ worth of income information. The benefit would depend on the extent to which the information provided about those four years was accurate and useful. The disclosure period for unreported income 4.17 Because the purpose of a limited amnesty would be to encourage an immediate switch to paying tax in full, no tax relief could be provided in respect of the most recent year for which tax was due. Providing relief from taxes currently due would, in effect, provide an opportunity for all operators in the targeted group to mitigate their taxes, even if they would otherwise have complied with the rules. This would be unfair to taxpayers not in the targeted group. To prevent this, those who came forward would have to fully disclose their income for the most recent year, in addition to whatever else was required for other back years. 4.18 The general time limit on reassessments of income, excluding evasion, by Inland Revenue is four years. The disclosure period for the limited amnesty could be aligned with that time limit, or could be made shorter. As there is currently no limit on the years that can be reassessed when evasion is involved, any limit on back years would provide some incentive to disclose it. The further back reassessments were allowed, the more like the normal rules the proposal would be, and the lower the incentive would be. 4.19 Business operators who evade tax or who work in cash-based industries often do not create or keep good records and may not be able to reconstruct them. Therefore one concern about requiring full disclosure over a long period of back years is that the operators involved might have difficulty providing the information required, or fear that Inland Revenue would not be satisfied with the information they provided. A related concern is that the further back the information went, the harder it would be for Inland Revenue to check it. These concerns suggest that a relatively short period for disclosure would have advantages. 2 The options are discussed in the next chapter. 19 4.20 The relative merits of a two, three or four-year disclosure period are the subject of the next chapter. Key questions What conditions should an amnesty specify? What should happen when people come forward and do not have an accurate record of their income? 20 Chapter 5 HOW MANY YEARS’ BACK-TAX SHOULD BE ASSESSED? Summary of proposals • A minimum of two years’ income and back-tax would be assessed under the terms of a limited amnesty offer, with the normal penalties and interest rules applying. • A two-year period would provide a greater incentive than would a three or four- year period, and would be relatively easier to administer, although not everyone may perceive shorter disclosure periods as fair. 5.1 The main incentive to take part in the limited amnesty described in chapters 3 and 4 is that an amnesty would limit the number of back years’ income that participants would have to disclose. The options presented here are based on a minimum of the equivalent of two years’ back-tax being assessed, with the normal penalties and interest rules applying. A relatively short period, such as a two-year period, would probably provide the most effective balance between ensuring a sufficiently attractive incentive and the wider interests of the taxpaying community. However, the government is open to considering all options. 5.2 This chapter looks at the merits of setting assessment periods for back-tax of two, three or four years, and what this would mean to amnesty participants in dollar terms. Figure 2 summarises the proportions of tax that would be assessed under the three options detailed in this chapter. F IGURE 2: Proportion of tax assessed under the three options The period for which income must be fully disclosed Most recent year assessed Second most recent year assessed Third most recent year assessed Fourth most recent year assessed 2 years 100% 100% - - 3 years 100% 50% 50% - 4 years 100% 50% 50% 50% 21 Two-year disclosure of income 5.3 Under a two-year disclosure period, Inland Revenue would assess tax on all income not previously disclosed in the first and second most recent tax years. Earlier years would not be assessed as long as participants met the conditions of the amnesty. This option should be particularly attractive to those who have evaded tax over a long period, since they would have a greater incentive to come forward, in view of the consequences they would face when caught and audited. 5.4 From an administrative point of view, the main benefit of a two-year disclosure period is that it would be simpler and easier to communicate and administer than a three-year or four-year period. 5.5 From the point of view of someone taking advantage of the amnesty, a two- year disclosure period would provide an attractive incentive. It would still be reasonably attractive when matters such as student loans, child support and family assistance were taken into account – as discussed in the next chapter. 5.6 Penalties would be reduced under the voluntary disclosure rules by 75 percent and, if applicable, a further 50 percent for a first offence. Three-year disclosure of income 5.7 A three-year period would obviously cover a longer period of evasion, but three years’ income would not necessarily need to be assessed. The equivalent of about two years’ income could be assessed over a three-year period by assessing all the income in relation to the most recent year, and half the income disclosed in each of the second and third most recent years. 5.8 The first most recent year would have to be fully assessed – otherwise there could be an incentive for people to defer paying tax currently due by under- reporting their income in their returns, only to report it later under an amnesty. Because returns cannot be changed once filed, half the income disclosed could be assessed for the second and third most recent years, to keep the overall dollar result roughly in line with the amount that could be assessed for two full years of tax. 5.9 Under this three-year option, someone disclosing two years’ evaded income would be assessed only for one and a half years’ tax rather than for two full years’ tax. This could be a strong incentive for some people to disclose. 5.10 A three-year disclosure period could make it more difficult for participants to be confident about coming forward, because it might be too difficult for many to be sure of what their income was three or so years ago. This could discourage longer term evaders from coming forward. 22 5.11 The overall risks associated with using longer disclosure periods are driven by practical concerns such as how easy the terms of an amnesty could be communicated, understood and administered to provide sufficient certainty to encourage evaders to come forward, even when they are unlikely to remember what their real income was two, three or more years ago. Four-year disclosure of income 5.12 Extending the disclosure period a further year to four years would cover a period closer to that set by the statute bar rules – which, for taxpayers who comply with the law, provide the standard limitation to being reassessed by Inland Revenue. Again, to limit the total liability that might result from evaders coming forward, and to provide an incentive for their doing so, some years would be assessed for half of the income disclosed. Thus, for example, under a four-year disclosure period, all income would be assessed for the first most recent year, while half of the previously undisclosed income could be assessed for each of the second, third and forth most recent years in that period. 5.13 If the amount of undeclared income were the same each year, the total of tax assessed, penalties and interest would be closest to the tax shortfall that would be assessed under current rules for four years. This is shown in figure 3. 5.14 As with the three-year option, the same risks would arise in relation to the effectiveness of the incentive offered and the compliance and administrative difficulties of requiring disclosure of income over relatively long periods. The options compared 5.15 For an amnesty to have a real effect, the advantages it provides must be more attractive than those provided by existing law. 5.16 Under current law, tax evaders face a substantial total liability for tax, penalties and interest. This would be significantly smaller if they voluntarily disclosed the same evasion. Even then, however, and particularly when evasion may be an accepted part of an industry, the total liability faced by evaders can still be large. For example, the total tax, penalty and interest debt arising from someone not declaring $100 cash a week over just four years would be about $11,560. If the hidden income were voluntarily disclosed, the tax bill would be $6,650. 3 3 That is, with a 75% reduction in the penalty rate for making a voluntary disclosure. 23 5.17 The amnesty options discussed here would further reduce the tax debt for evaders but not eliminate it completely. The resulting liability should be manageable and repayable while still allowing them to comply with their present tax obligations. The four-year option would result in about $4,075 being owed, the three-year option in $3,152 and the two-year option in $3,087. 5.18 Figure 3 compares the effect, in relation to income tax, of someone being assessed under a number of conditions. The tax amounts used are based on the person involved pocketing $100 a week – $5,200 a year – on which tax is not paid, though he or she pays tax on a salary of $30,000. 4 The standard penalty rates for evasion and voluntary disclosure are used.

The second column shows the effect if the evader makes a voluntary disclosure of the hidden income, which reduces penalties. Both show the effects of the current law, but in both cases only four years’ tax is assessed, although it would be possible to assess any tax evaded in any prior years without any time limit. 4 If no taxes have been paid, a person may be liable to additional penalties – for example, late payment penalties. 24 5.20 The relative merits of the three amnesty options considered here are summarised in table 1. T ABLE 1: Merits of the three disclosure period options 2-year 3-year 4-year Attractiveness of amnesty incentive in dollar terms to a person 9 9 - Attractiveness of incentive in terms of being able to comply with amnesty disclosure requirements 9 - - Accuracy of disclosure easily verifiable 9 - - Closest match to effect of current law - - 9 Relative simplicity 9 - - Minimisation of tax forgone - - 9 Incentive for evasion of less than two years - 9 9 5.21 On balance, the two-year option would appear to provide the most effective incentive for disclosing income because: • Limiting the payment of evaded taxes to two years provides a meaningful incentive for evaders to come forward. • The payment of two years of taxes recognises and provides a reasonable balance to the interests of all other taxpayers. • A two-year period is clear and simple to communicate and understand. • A two-year period provides more certainty than longer periods that the information required to be disclosed can be provided and verified by Inland Revenue. 5.22 The three-year and four-year options are potentially fairer but more complex than the two-year option. They still provide an incentive that would be attractive to encourage people back into participating fully in the tax system under the terms of a limited amnesty targeted to their industry. 25 5.23 All these options focus on longer term evasion and may not provide much incentive to disclose more recent one-off or very short-term evasion. The requirement to assess all tax due in the first most recent year cannot change, although there may be scope to forgive use-of-money interest. Key questions Would full tax assessments for only the two most recent years provide an appropriate level of incentive for people to disclose past evasion and stop evading tax? Does the proposal strike a fair balance between encouraging evaders to comply with the law and recognising that other people have already complied voluntarily? Are there any circumstances when disclosure of income for only the most recent year might be more appropriate? Should use-of-money interest be forgiven as part of an amnesty, particularly to provide an incentive for shorter term evasion to be disclosed? How could these options be improved? 26 Chapter 6 IMPLICATIONS FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE, CHILD SUPPORT AND STUDENT LOANS Summary of proposals • The same limited amnesty proposed in relation to income tax could also apply to social policy measures that are determined by income and administered through the tax system – family assistance, child support and student loans. • If hidden income were disclosed under the terms of a limited amnesty, as proposed in this discussion document, the evader’s family assistance entitlements could decrease and child support liability and student loan repayments could increase. • The changes may apply to the number of back years of income disclosed under the terms of an amnesty, but not to earlier years. 6.1 An amnesty for income tax evasion could mean that the same partial immunity would be provided in relation to family assistance, child support and student loans. The reason is that these programmes use taxable income in making associated calculations of entitlement or liability, and they would be affected to the extent that income changed because of disclosures made under an amnesty. Inland Revenue could also transfer the new income figure to other agencies with whom it has information-matching agreements, where it could be used to determine entitlement to other social assistance. 6.2 There may be greater potential for concern about the equity or fairness of an amnesty if it applied to social policy measures as well, particularly when third parties are involved – as in the case of child support. Family assistance Family assistance is provided to low-income families with dependent children by way of a series of tax credits that abate against taxable income. Entitlements may be received fortnightly, based on estimated earnings or as a lump sum at the end of the year. Family assistance is made up of two components, Family Support and Family Plus. Family Support is a tax credit designed to help families with dependent children 18 and under, and the amount received depends on the number and ages of the children. Family Plus is designed to support working families by providing three further tax credits. These are the family tax credit, the child tax credit and the parental tax credit. 27 Student loans The tax system is used to collect student loan repayments, with borrowers required to make repayment deductions at the rate of 10 percent of their income, above a specified repayment threshold. Full-time, full-year students and those whose income falls below a set threshold are eligible for a full interest write-off. Other students whose income is below the repayment threshold are entitled to have the “base interest” written off so that their loans increase only at the rate of inflation. If the base interest charged exceeds 50 percent of the borrower’s repayment obligation, the base interest charge is reduced to 50 percent of the borrower’s loan repayment obligation. Child support Child support is also administered by Inland Revenue, with a liable parent’s child support liability normally being calculated according to a statutory formula. The calculation is based on the liable parent’s taxable income from the previous year or the income from the year before, plus an uplift factor. The calculation also takes into account the liable parent’s current family status through a living allowance and the number of children being supported. Inland Revenue passes on child support payments to custodial parents, provided that they are not social welfare beneficiaries. 6.3 Including family assistance, child support and student loans within an amnesty might increase the amount outstanding that an evader had to repay, a matter that he or she would obviously take into account in deciding whether or not to take up the amnesty. Excluding them from the amnesty might undermine the incentive to come forward, because any benefit in relation to income tax could easily be more than offset by the repayments of family assistance or back-payments of child support or student loans that would be required. Family assistance 6.4 If evaders coming forward under a limited amnesty had claimed family assistance during the disclosure period, their taxable income for the number of years in question would be increased. The consequential decrease in their entitlement to family assistance could mean that part or all of that assistance would have to be repaid. Although family assistance payments are made to the principal caregiver, both partners are jointly liable for any overpayments, even if they subsequently separate. Thus, in principle, family assistance debt resulting from past evasion being disclosed could end up being recovered from an ex-partner, although, in practice, hardship provisions in the Tax Administration Act would probably apply. Child support 6.5 As a separate initiative, the government is also proposing other measures to encourage the repayment of child support debt, similar to the limited amnesties proposed here. They will involve writing off a portion of the incremental penalties accrued on child support debt when a liable parent enters into an instalment arrangement. This, like the proposal for limited amnesties, is designed to bring non-payers back into the payment system. 28 6.6 Income declared under a limited amnesty could affect an evader’s child support liability. Since child support is based on the income of the liable parent, a lower declared income will result in less child support having been paid. However, under the terms of the amnesty proposed here, any additional payments of child support resulting from an evader coming forward would be limited to the years of the disclosure period. 6.7 For example, an amnesty involving a two-year reassessment for income tax would also mean a two-year reassessment for child support. This means that an additional child support liability that arose as a result of someone coming forward under an amnesty could be treated on the same basis as income tax under the amnesty. 6.8 Custodians who did not receive their full child support entitlement because of the liable parent under-reporting income would be able to get their full entitlement but only for the years specified under the amnesty. Effectively, these custodians would bear the cost of the concession extended to evaders. Similarly, the Crown, which receives child support payments on behalf of custodial parents who are on a social welfare benefit, would not be able to recover underpayments outside the disclosure period. 5 6.9 The amnesty would not apply to existing child support debt, just as it would not apply to other pre-existing tax debts. Student loans 6.10 Student loan repayments would also be affected by an income tax amnesty, since repayments are based on ten percent of a borrower’s income over a certain threshold. Evaders with a student loan to repay who disclosed hidden income under an amnesty would face higher loan repayments if their reassessed total income exceeded the threshold. Their disclosure might also affect their entitlement to a full interest write-off, a base interest write-off or a base interest reduction. Government exchange of information 6.11 An amnesty could involve information-matching between government departments. Inland Revenue transfers information on individuals’ taxable income to other government departments to help them determine entitlements to social assistance or earnings-related compensation, or to calculate ACC levies. 5 Only about 35 percent of custodial parents are non-beneficiary custodians. Custodial parents who receive a social welfare benefit do not receive additional payments for child support unless the amount of child support paid by the liable parent exceeds the amount of their benefit. The payment received by the Crown from the associated liable parent is used to offset some or all of the benefit paid to the custodial parent, with any child support that exceeds the amount of the benefit passed on to the beneficiary custodial parent. 29 6.12 If individuals coming forward under an amnesty were receiving forms of social assistance which Inland Revenue did not administer, and if Inland Revenue transferred new information about their adjusted taxable income to another government department under an information-matching agreement, their entitlement to other forms of social assistance could be adjusted. Increased income would probably add to the money that had to be repaid. The amnesty would not extend to programmes administered by other government agencies. How much would have to be repaid? 6.13 Figure 4 illustrates the amount of tax and social assistance that would have to be repaid under an amnesty for a family that received family assistance and was also liable for student loan repayments and child support. For illustrative purposes, these numbers have been based on there being a child support liability for two children under 13 and a salary of $30,000. (An estimate of GST payable is also included to provide a more complete picture of the total incentive effect of the options being considered.)

An amnesty would provide a significant incentive for non-compliant taxpayers to disclose previously undeclared income. 6.15 Once again, there is a risk that giving immunity to those who have not complied with the rules of family assistance, child support or student loans could be regarded as unfair to those who have complied. In fact, the risk may be more acute in relation to social policy programmes than for it is for tax, particularly when the terms of an amnesty have the effect of limiting the number of years for which child support payments can be assessed. 6.16 As with tax, however, the key issue is that it is necessary to balance the recovery of some money against the probability of not recovering any. In this regard, the government’s view is that assessing evaders under an amnesty for two years of income would provide an appropriate balance, both for tax purposes and for social policy purposes. Key questions Should a tax amnesty that applies to income tax also apply to family assistance, child support and student loans? Would this raise additional concerns about the fairness of offering amnesties? 31 Chapter 7 SAFEGUARDS Summary of proposals • Inland Revenue would be required to report to responsible Ministers and to Parliament before proceeding with any limited amnesties at the conclusion of any other amnesties run in a year. • Inland Revenue’s power to offer limited amnesties could be removed by Order in Council. • Existing administrative process would be applied in relation to debt, penalties and interest, except in relation to criminal penalties under the tax Acts, to prevent evaders placing themselves under double jeopardy. 7.1 An important part of running any limited amnesty or a series of amnesties over time would be to be able to determine their effectiveness. The inclusion of monitoring and reporting requirements is an important part of the overall proposal, to ensure that the overall objective of improving compliance is advanced without detriment to the integrity of the tax system or principles of responsible fiscal management. Reporting 7.2 Before offering an amnesty, Inland Revenue would be required to report to the Minister responsible for fiscal matters, usually the Minister of Finance, on the reasons for its implementation in the context of a targeted industry or group. Although the Minister would not have a role in selecting target groups, such reports would ensure transparency and accountability. 7.3 The reports should, as far as possible, include information on the group the amnesty would apply to, as well as information on the extent to which compliance (or non-compliance) in the group was significant enough to be considered for an amnesty offer. This is an important consideration because in some cases an audit-based approach might be a more appropriate response. The reports should also outline the anticipated strategy in relation to following up the limited amnesty, both immediately and in the future, by means of audit and other activities. 32 7.4 Inland Revenue would also be required to report to Ministers on the success of an amnesty and include reference to those results in the department’s annual report. This could include quantitative and qualitative assessments of changes in revenue, interest and penalties; comment on changes in levels of compliance, public attitudes and perceptions of the integrity of the tax system; and comment on the consequential effects on social policy programmes. 7.5 To ensure that the objectives of an amnesty were being achieved, Inland Revenue would also be required to report specifically on the effectiveness of the first two or three amnesties. Power to remove limited amnesties 7.6 The purpose of reporting on the success or otherwise of offering limited amnesties would be to monitor the effects on the wider tax system. If the effect of offering limited amnesties were unsustainably negative, it might be appropriate to remove Inland Revenue’s power to offer them, to counter the negative fiscal risks. With this in mind, the amnesties initially offered would, in effect, be treated as piloting the proposal. 7.7 The government would be able to remove Inland Revenue’s power to offer amnesties, as appropriate, depending on the results. Legislation allowing limited tax amnesties would need to provide that their operative provisions would come into force and be taken out of force by Order in Council. In this way, if at any time it were considered that continuing with a programme of limited amnesties would compromise voluntary compliance, the set of rules for allowing them could easily be rendered inoperative. Criminal penalties and prosecution 7.8 The standard penalty for evasion or a similar act is 150 percent of the resulting tax shortfall. The name of the person involved is published in the Gazette. There are also criminal penalties for evasion, including imprisonment for up to five years or a fine of up to $50,000. 7.9 It is necessary to provide some assurances in respect of coming forward under an amnesty that people would not be placing themselves in double jeopardy of paying some tax but identifying themselves as a target for prosecution. Therefore the terms of a limited amnesty would prevent criminal penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994 being imposed for: • absolute liability and knowledge offences; • evasion or similar offences (other than the offence of pretending to be another person); 33 • an offence committed by an employee or officer to the extent that it would be an offence if committed by the taxpayer and the taxpayer would qualify for the amnesty; and • aiding or abetting someone to commit an offence to the extent it would be an offence if committed by the taxpayer and the taxpayer would qualify for the amnesty. 7.10 Immunity would not extend to offences under other enactments, such as the Crimes Act 1961 or Serious Fraud Act 1990. Key question Would the proposed reporting requirements and Parliament’s ability to remove Inland Revenue’s power to offer limited amnesties be appropriate safeguards?

If we are to make the most of our opportunities and maximise growth, capital must flow to the most productive areas of our economy. In some cases, however, the tax depreciation rules appear to be distorting investment decisions towards tax- favoured but less productive investment. 1.2 This issues paper is the result of a review of the current depreciation rules by tax policy officials. It looks at both the problems identified and suggests legislative changes. 1.3 Part 1 of this paper introduces the issues to be discussed in the document, outlines our goals for depreciation reform and reviews current depreciation rules. 1.4 The second part of the paper provides a framework for analysing how depreciation provisions can affect incentives to invest, and the impact of inflation and the economic loading. We then outline possible policy reforms to address the problems we see with the current rules. Here we are asking some fundamental questions. For example, at present, most assets are depreciated smoothly over their estimated economic life to a residual value of 13.5 percent of acquisition cost. Is this a sensible way of calculating economic depreciation? 1.5 The importance of uncertainty should be stressed at the outset. The reforms discussed in the first part do not have the impractical goal of “getting things right”. Our knowledge of how assets actually depreciate will always be too imprecise for us to have any prospect of getting depreciation rates right or even knowing if we did. The more modest goal is to avoid having depreciation rates that are too badly wrong. 1.6 The third part of the paper considers the specific issues relating to rules that have been identified by taxpayers, their advisors and officials. The largest of these issues is the tax treatment of rental housing, although the tax issues relating to site-restoration costs are also significant. 1.7 The analysis in Part 2 of this paper, especially chapter 3, is, by necessity, complex, although all efforts have been made to simplify the presentation where possible. It is not necessary to read chapter 3, which covers the economics of depreciation, to understand the subsequent chapters, which outline our concerns and suggestions for improvement. Even so, chapter 3 helps in the understanding of why a number of tax biases exist. 4 Background 1.8 In January 2003 the Minister of Finance announced that he had asked officials to look at whether the present definition of “economic life” accurately reflects commercial reality. This announcement resulted in a series of submissions from taxpayers on issues of specific concern. The structure of this paper reflects our approach of addressing both the broad concern expressed by the Minister as to whether the rules were reasonable and the specific issues raised by those making submissions. 1.9 This paper also incorporates discussion on certain depreciation-related issues have also been raised by some of the growth and innovation task forces. Scope of the discussion paper 1.10 The scope of this review is focussed on ensuring that the overall structure of the depreciation rules is as good as is practicable and that the detailed design of our tax rules can cope with the complex, real-world issues that arise. However, this paper and the overall review by officials do not consider whether Inland Revenue has set individual rates of depreciation correctly for individual assets. Reviewing the economic life of all assets would be a very substantial task which is well beyond the scope of the current review. We judge that greater overall benefits arise if our advice to the government focuses on the wider issues we have identified. If there is a concern with a specific rate, it can be raised with Inland Revenue Adjudication and Rulings. 1.11 We are, however, interested in finding whether there are generic problems with current depreciation economic lives. If there were widespread concerns that estimates of economic lives were dramatically wrong there would be grounds for a more general review of economic lives. Principles underlying the analysis 1.12 Our starting point is recognition that in the absence of taxes, investment would flow to the most productive areas of the economy, maximising our welfare. Taxes, however, can distort people’s decisions, with the result that lightly taxed activities will attract more investment, even though they have lower risk-adjusted, pre-tax returns than other investments. Correspondingly, that investment will be at the expense of investment in activities with higher risk-adjusted, pre-tax returns but which are more heavily taxed. 1 The outcome is, as a society, we are poorer and we have lower growth than otherwise would have occurred. 1 This change in investment patterns will cause the returns on investing in the lightly taxed activities to fall and the returns on heavily taxed activities to rise until, on a risk-adjusted basis, after-tax returns from investing in different sectors are equalised. 5 Example Rose has $100 to invest and has a choice between two investments for a year, both with the same risk. The first investment provides a 5 percent tax-free return. The second investment provides a 7 percent return but is taxed. As Rose has a 39% tax rate, her choice is between a 5 percent after-tax return from the first investment or a 4.27 percent after-tax return from the second. She therefore chooses the first investment. In the absence of tax, she would, of course, have chosen the second investment, which had a higher return. 1.13 We are concerned about distortions in investment patterns, whether they are accidental or deliberate. We have, therefore, included analysis on the impact of both the current depreciation rules and the “20 percent economic loading” applied to those rules. Growth and Innovation Framework The review of the depreciation rules has been undertaken by tax policy officials as part of the government’s formal commitment to growth and innovation. One motivation for the review has been the often expressed private sector concerns that the current tax system discourages investment in plant and machinery, especially if the investment is in areas where there is significant technical innovation. There is reason to believe that the current tax rules bias investment away from shorter-lived equipment towards longer-lived structures. Our goal is not to advantage any form of investment relative to other form of investment. Instead, the goal is to ensure tax is as neutral as possible across different forms of investment. 1.14 We conclude that unless there are important and quantifiable spill-over benefits associated with certain forms of investment but not others, it is attractive to try to ensure that investment decisions are biased as little as possible by tax considerations. 2 In effect, this means our starting point is one of making the tax depreciation provisions mirror actual economic depreciation (the fall in market value of assets) as closely as possible. 3 2 A spill-over benefit is when the benefits from investment by one firm are not fully captured by that firm. For example, the benefits of an innovative investment by one firm may not be fully captured by that firm if other firms are able to copy the innovation without paying for it. 3 As is explained in chapter 3, economic depreciation would lead to the investment decisions of individuals being independent of their tax rates. 6 1.15 Even so, there is an important concern that the principles we propose applying in this area could conflict with policy goals in other areas of our tax system. By itself, a shift to economic depreciation would lead to higher tax rates on foreign equity investment in New Zealand. Excessive taxes on foreign equity investment are typically passed on to New Zealand in an economically inefficient way. At the same time, major reductions in capital taxation would narrow the base and place upward pressure on tax rates. Summary of the issues paper PART 1 – REVIEW OF THE DEPRECIATION RULES Introduction (Chapter 1) Chapter 1 sets out the background of the depreciation review, its scope and the principles underlying the analysis contained in later chapters. Overview of the current rules (Chapter 2) Chapter 2 outlines the current tax depreciation rules. The current rules provide a statutory deduction for depreciation for “depreciable property” (any property that might reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income). Depreciation rates are set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under a statutory formula. The formula is based on a diminishing value method (with a constant percentage of an asset’s book value allowed as a deduction), although an equivalent under the straight-line method (a constant percentage of the asset’s cost) is also typically calculated. Special rules exist for applying to the Commissioner for a depreciation rate that is higher (or lower) than the general prescribed rate (the “special tax depreciation rate” rules). A 20 percent loading applies on depreciation rates for most new assets. The majority of current depreciation rates were set as part of a comprehensive review of depreciation in 1993. PART 2 – STRUCTURE OF THE RULES Economic depreciation, accelerated depreciation, and incentives to invest (Chapter 3) Chapter 3 presents a highly stylised and simplified discussion of how taxes and different depreciation provisions can affect incentives to invest. It provides an introduction to the economics of different depreciation provisions. It starts by ignoring inflation and discusses the prima facie case for allowing economic depreciation (allowing deductions based on how assets actually fall in value) rather than more accelerated systems of depreciation. More accelerated forms of depreciation can make investments that would be unprofitable for non-taxpayers profitable to taxpayers. 7 The chapter also examines biases that can be introduced by small rates of inflation (within the Reserve Bank’s 1 to 3 percent target range). Here we discuss why if depreciation deductions did mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, inflation can produce a bias discouraging investment in shorter-lived assets and encouraging investment in longer-lived assets. The aim of chapter 3 is to provide some background for understanding the biases that are examined in chapters 4 and 5. Readers may, if they wish, skip this chapter on an initial reading of the document. Effects of the current tax depreciation rules (Chapter 4) Chapter 4 examines how New Zealand’s current depreciation provisions, including the 20 percent loading, can affect incentives to invest. In analysing this issue, it considers a wider set of assets than were discussed in chapter 3. For reasons discussed in chapter 3, we find that the cost of capital (the minimum pre- tax rate of return at which investment is profitable) depends on the way that depreciation deductions are calculated, whether or not a loading is available and on inflation. If depreciation deductions were to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation and there were no inflation and no loading, costs of capital would be the same for all assets. The tax system would not bias investment decisions for domestically owned firms. With small rates of inflation and no loading, there is a tax bias favouring longer-lived assets. In the absence of inflation, the depreciation loading would tend to bias investment in favour of shorter-lived assets. If inflation is in the Reserve Bank’s target range of 1 to 3 percent, however, the bias produced by the loading in favour of shorter-lived assets would be insufficient to offset the inflation-induced bias in favour of longer-lived assets. Our overall conclusion is that the loading may end up making incentives to invest more neutral than would be the case if there were no loading. This analysis is all dependent on depreciation deductions mirroring how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation. In practice, there may be systematic biases caused by the current assumption that assets depreciate smoothly to 13.5 percent of their initial value. To our knowledge, there have been no studies of how assets actually depreciate in New Zealand. Also, the international evidence is scanty. The best international studies would suggest, however, that there are reasons to believe that the current method of calculating depreciation may be too slow for shorter-lived equipment and too fast for longer-lived structures. Finally, the chapter discusses the way in which assets with the same economic lives may have different time profiles of economic depreciation. In principle, this would provide grounds for allowing depreciation deductions to differ for assets with the same economic lives. In practice, difficulties of measurement mean that it may be impossible to take account of this complication. This means that there will inevitably be some element of “rough justice” in setting depreciation provisions. 8 Directions of reform: structural issues (Chapter 5) Chapter 5 discusses some possible structural changes to the way in which depreciation deductions are calculated. It suggests that there is a prima facie case for replacing the current assumption that assets decline smoothly to 13.5 percent of their initial value. Instead, it suggests that plant and equipment might better be depreciated on a double declining balance basis and buildings and other structures on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. The double declining balance method for plant and equipment would mean that an asset with an estimated life of, say, 20 years would be depreciated as follows. Instead of allowing straight-line depreciation deductions of 5 percent per annum over the 20-year life, the asset would receive diminishing value depreciation deductions of double this rate (a diminishing value rate of depreciation of 10 percent per annum). The aim of these changes would be to better reflect how assets are actually likely to depreciate. The changes would tend to reduce depreciation deductions for buildings and other structures. For example, buildings can be currently depreciated at a diminishing value rate of 4 percent or a straight-line rate of 3 percent per annum. Shifting to straight- line deductions over a building’s estimated economic life of 50 years would involve a switch to allowing straight-line depreciation deductions of only 2 percent per annum. A diminishing value alternative with a similar present value of deductions would involve diminishing value deductions of 3 percent per annum. One concern with this approach is that it would increase depreciation deductions significantly for very short-lived equipment, and there is a lack of data on how these very short-lived assets depreciate. There is a case for obtaining more information on how they actually depreciate before changing depreciation provisions. A second concern is the limited information on how buildings and other structures depreciate. Chapter 5 also discusses possible changes to the 20 percent depreciation loading which currently applies to most assets. The current loading, while having the disadvantage of encouraging investments which might be unattractive to non- taxpayers, does have the advantage of narrowing biases between investments that different firms can undertake. However, it would be possible to reduce biases further (provided inflation remains in the Reserve Bank’s 1 to 3 percent target range) by increasing the loading for shorter-lived assets and decreasing the loading for longer- lived assets. The chapter discusses some possible approaches which will have different revenue costs. It is suggested that the final choice between these approaches should depend on revenue costs, which are still being estimated. Consistent with the goal of making incentives to invest as neutral as possible across different assets, it is also suggested that the scope of any loadings be extended to second-hand assets and used imported motorcars. This chapter also discusses other potential concerns about current depreciation provisions. It seeks comments on whether there are major generic problems with current estimates of economic lives for assets, on whether the current set of 14 depreciation bands involves too many or too few bands and on whether there are other practicable ways of better measuring how assets actually depreciate. 9 PART 3 – SPECIFIC ISSUES Suggested changes to the tax depreciation rules (Chapter 6) Chapter 6 looks at a number of technical issues where useful improvements to the current rules are possible. Deductibility of expenditure incurred in preventing, combating and rectifying pollution The rules governing deductions for capital expenditure incurred in preventing or combating pollution should be clarified. It is intended that this be done by revising section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. It is also suggested that a deduction for site restoration expenditure be allowed in the year that this expenditure is incurred, with businesses allowed to match the cost of site restoration against income previously generated from business operations. When depreciation can begin for patents When a patent is granted, any depreciation from the time that the patent is given legal effect (when the complete application is lodged), up to the date of grant, should be allowed in the first income year in which depreciation can be claimed. Changes to the special tax depreciation rate rules A number of changes are being suggested in relation to the special tax depreciation rate rules. A key suggested change is relaxing the requirements on the Commissioner when considering special tax depreciation rate applications. This would mean that in the case of “tied” assets, for example, replacing the need for the Commissioner to be “absolutely” certain about the actual economic life of an asset with a requirement for the assessment to be only “reasonably” certain, before a special rate can be issued. Another suggested change is extending the special tax depreciation rate rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property if the Commissioner is satisfied that the actual economic life of the property will be less than its legal life. We would like further feedback on both options. We also suggest a number of technical amendments to the rules, including clarifying that the Commissioner can have regard to a broader range of factors than just the rate of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes when considering a special tax depreciation rate application; widening the Commissioner’s ability to prescribe special tax depreciation rates using a method other than the diminishing value formula in the legislation (if such a method is more appropriate); and extending the six-month time bar on the Commissioner to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rate applications. 10 Plant variety rights included as depreciable intangible property Plant variety rights (granted under the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987) should be added to the list of depreciable intangible property in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act. As a clarification, the right to use plant variety rights should also be included as depreciable intangible property. Definition of “depreciable intangible property” The definition of “depreciable intangible property” should be clarified so that it is clear that property listed on Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act can be depreciated without having further regard to whether that property can, for example, be used for tax avoidance purposes. Losses on disposal of buildings Deductions for losses on destruction of buildings as a result of natural disasters (such as the February 2004 storms, earthquake and fire) should be allowed. In principle, it would seem desirable to allow losses on voluntary destruction of buildings and losses on disposal more generally (such as losses on sale). However, we doubt whether this is practicable because of taxpayers’ scope to manipulate valuations to generate artificial losses on disposal of buildings. We consider that a loss incurred on the destruction of a “temporary building” is deductible for tax purposes, and the Income Tax Act 2004 clarifies this. Issues about which more information is needed (Chapter 7) Chapter 7 examines a number of depreciation issues about which we need further information before we can suggest changes. Deductibility of asset disposal costs Consideration should be given to full deductibility for the costs associated with disposing of depreciable assets. Currently, it is unclear whether deductions for these costs can be taken in full or are limited to the amount of any consideration derived on disposal. We would like further information on what these costs are and the circumstances in which they arise, to assist us in considering more fully the implications of such a change. Higher threshold for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets A higher threshold ($2,000) for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets and a higher total threshold ($20,000) for immediately deducting the cost of “low- value” assets purchased at the same time from the same supplier does not seem to be justified. This is because we do not consider that the compliance costs savings of such measures are likely to offset the significant fiscal implications. However, we would like further information on the write-off thresholds adopted for financial reporting purposes, the types of assets likely to be purchased by taxpayers at the same time and from the same supplier and the costs involved, and the potential compliance benefits from expensing versus, say, using the pool method of depreciation. 11 Changes we do not agree with (Chapter 8) Chapter 8 looks at a number of specific concerns raised by taxpayers that we do not consider should be progressed because the changes would not result in increased efficiency or are contrary to policy objectives. Use of financial reporting depreciation rates for tax purposes We do not consider that taxpayers should be allowed to use depreciation rates used for financial reporting purposes for tax purposes. This is because the Commissioner is already required to have regard to depreciation rates used by taxpayers for financial reporting purposes, both when setting general economic depreciation rates and special tax depreciation rates. The latter provides a mechanism whereby taxpayers can apply to the Commissioner for a depreciation rate that is lower or higher than that prescribed generally. Moreover, as has been discussed, we are considering extending the factors the Commissioner can consider when setting special depreciation rates. Depreciation of buildings (and other fixtures) on land held by a dealer in land The current requirement that land held by a dealer in land be treated as being held on revenue account for a period of ten years from the date of acquisition should not, in our view, be amended to allow depreciation on buildings and other fixtures constructed on the land. We do not consider that workable rules to achieve this can be devised without providing significant scope for manipulation of those rules. However, we would like feedback on any solutions that may be workable. Treatment of property that changes use We do not consider that the rules governing depreciation previously allowed in respect of depreciable assets that change use (for example, move to being held on revenue account) need clarification. The tax depreciation rules trigger a deemed disposal at market value (with the resulting loss or gain on disposal being taxable). Depreciation rates under the industry and asset categories A clarification is not needed, in our view, in relation to the process for selecting the most applicable depreciation rate in respect of an asset under the current depreciation schedules. The current tax depreciation rules already provide a number of steps for selecting the most appropriate economic depreciation rate under the industry and general asset categories. 12 Difference between estimated useful life and economic life There is no material difference between the concept of “economic life” and the term “estimated useful life”, as used in the Income Tax Act. Estimated useful life requires the Commissioner to take into account a number of factors that are relevant to the calculation of economic life, such as the impact of technological obsolescence on an asset. Tax treatment of rental housing (Chapter 9) Chapter 9 considers various aspects of the tax treatment of rental housing. We consider that there may be an element of tax advantage for investment in residential rental property and buildings more generally. Our analysis also suggests that investment in rental property may be providing a tax shelter for income from other sources. There appear to be two key ways in which these investments are tax-advantaged. First, the current method of calculating depreciation on buildings assumes that buildings depreciate smoothly to 13.5 percent of their initial value over their economic lives. We consider that this method of calculating depreciation may lead to depreciation deductions that are too quick for rental property, along with other buildings and structures. The shift to straight-line depreciation or the diminishing value equivalent for buildings and other structures examined in chapter 5 would remove this bias. The second problem is that an increasing number of residential rental property owners are claiming separate depreciation deductions for different parts of a building. Examples include separate depreciation deductions for electrical wiring, plumbing, hot water systems, carpets and internal walls. In principle, the more assets which are depreciated separately at rates that exceed the building depreciation rate, the lower the appropriate depreciation rate on the remaining shell. There is some uncertainty as to what assets can be depreciated separately, and this can lead to substantial differences in deductions claimed by two landlords with identical properties. We suggest making the rules more certain by providing landlords with two options. Under the first option, a set of separately depreciable assets would be identified, as happens in Australia. These would include lifts, domestic appliances, hot water cylinders, air conditioning systems, light fittings and carpets. However, the set of separately depreciable assets would be limited, and the remainder of the building – including wiring, plumbing and internal walls – would be depreciable at the building depreciation rate, as part of the building. This option would require taxpayers to obtain market values of these separate assets at purchase and sale to determine the tax basis for depreciation rates and to determine any gain or loss on sale. An alternative would be to depreciate all of these assets as part of the building, which would remove any need for separate valuations on purchase or sale. It would also be appropriate for taxpayers adopting this latter approach to have wider scope for deducting expenses as repairs and maintenance. For example, a replacement hot water cylinder would be capitalised and depreciated for taxpayers depreciating these assets separately, but would normally be a deductible expense for taxpayers depreciating these assets as part of the building. 13 Roads, other land improvements and “black hole” expenditure (Chapter 10) The last chapter looks at depreciation issues being considered as part of separate projects. These include the tax treatment of depreciable land improvements, primarily in the context of road construction projects, and the tax treatment of “black hole” development expenditure. The latter relates to capital expenditure that, at present, is neither deductible nor depreciable. Application date 1.16 Given that this issues paper represents the start of the policy development process, it is too early to include any discussion on the possible application date of any reforms. This is especially the case in relation to the suggestions in the second part of the paper, which should be thought of as longer term possibilities only. In principle, we are of the opinion that, as far as possible, any changes should not affect existing investments. However, this would add to the complexity of transitional arrangements, and submissions are invited on the issue. 1.17 There are two exceptions, however, where there are strong reasons for any new rules to apply to investments that are in place at the application date of any new legislation. First, we are particularly concerned about the effects on investment in equipment. If faster depreciation rates for equipment are adopted, our view is that they should be available from the application date for all equipment purchased after the release of the issues paper, so that firms do not have artificial incentives to delay equipment investment. 1.18 The second exception is building fit-out for rental housing. Because some taxpayers have been using aggressive fit-out practices, we will recommend to the government that there be no “grandfathering” in this area should the change be implemented This will not constrain the Commissioner from undertaking audit action for years prior to a change in law. Timeline 1.19 Our intention is to report to the government on the submissions received, and our work more generally, following the receipt of submissions. Our aim, at present, is to recommend that those more detailed measures raised in chapter 6 of this paper be included, at the earliest, in a tax bill to be introduced later this year. It is likely that the complexity of the issues raised in Part 2 and in chapter 9 will necessitate further consultation with key submitters. Measures arising from this work will, therefore, take longer. They also raise more complex issues as to fiscal cost, which will have to be considered. 14 Submissions 1.20 Specific issues for submission are addressed in the relevant chapters. However, the key issues on which submission are requested are: Part 2 – the general framework of our analysis; – the conclusions as to the effect of the current rules and the economic loading, with and without inflation, presented in chapter 4; – removing the assumption of a 13.5 percent residual value and adopting double declining balance depreciation for plant and equipment and straight-line depreciation or a diminishing-value equivalent for buildings and other structures; – whether there are viable ways of getting better measures of economic depreciation for short-lived plant and equipment and for buildings and other structures; – introducing an increased economic loading for short-lived assets, with a reduced loading for longer lived assets; – whether the scope of the economic loading should be extended to include second-hand assets and second-hand imported motor vehicles. Part 3 – the suggested amortisation provision for capital expenditure incurred in preventing, combating or rectifying pollution and a provision allowing site restoration expenditure to be deductible against previous income; – options to make it easier for taxpayers to apply for a special tax depreciation rate (for example, in the case of “tied” assets) and extending the special tax depreciation rules to fixed life intangible property; – asset disposal costs – what these costs are and in what circumstances they arise; – higher thresholds for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets; – the tax treatment of revenue account property – options for allowing depreciation of such property when the property is not purchased with the purpose or intention of resale; – whether there are major distortions from treating the structural components of a residential rental building as a single entity; how the boundary between a building and other separately identifiable assets can be better defined; other problems with taxation of rental housing; and the other options for dealing with the taxation of rental housing which are not supported by us. 15 1.21 Submissions should be addressed to: Depreciation Review C/- the General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.22 The closing date for submissions is 31 August 2004 for the detailed policy measures discussed in chapters 6, 7 and 8.

Depreciable property includes buildings, fixtures on land, certain land improvements, and intangible property listed in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act as depreciable intangible property. 5 Depreciable property does not include trading stock, land, financial arrangements under the accrual rules, certain types of intangible property for which an estimated useful life cannot be calculated, such as goodwill, and property for which the cost is deductible under other provisions of the Income Tax Act. 2.3 Under the tax depreciation rules, taxpayers can elect to use either the straight-line or diminishing value method to depreciate capital assets. Under the straight-line method, a constant percentage of the cost of the asset to a taxpayer is deducted from the property’s adjusted tax-book value. Under the diminishing value method, a constant percentage of the adjusted-tax-book value is deducted each year. 6 As will be discussed in greater detail later, the Commissioner prescribes depreciation rates for use under the diminishing value method and then sets an equivalent depreciation rate for use under the straight-line method. This is achieved by ensuring, as much as possible, that the present value of the depreciation deductions under each method are equivalent. 2.4 There is also an adjustment for depreciation for the proportion of the income year the property is owned and used or is available for use in business. So, for example, if an asset becomes available for use in a taxpayer’s business half-way through the income year, the depreciation deduction in that year will be apportioned to reflect the fact that the asset was available for use for only half the year. 7 4 The current rules were the result of recommendations made by the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the “Valabh Committee”) in 1992. 5 Depreciable intangible property includes: - the right to use a copyright; - the right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right; - a patent or the right to use a patent; - the right to use land; - the right to use plant or machinery; - the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software; - the right to use a trademark; - management rights and licence rights under the Radiocommunications Act 1989; - certain consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991; and - copyright in sound recordings. 6 DV allows a larger deduction in the earlier years of the life of an asset. 7 The formula is a \* b \* c / 12 where a: the annual depreciation rate; b: the adjusted tax value or cost of the asset; and c: the number of months in the income year the asset was used or was available for use. 17 Setting economic depreciation rates 2.5 In setting depreciation rates for different assets, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must have regard to the estimated useful life of the particular asset. The estimated useful life of an asset is the time over which the asset might be expected to be useful in earning taxable income. This time must take into account factors such as the wear and tear, exhaustion, and obsolescence of an asset, as well as the period the asset is likely to be used by all its New Zealand owners. It is also based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance of the asset. 2.6 Estimated useful life focuses on the potential usefulness of a depreciable asset to any business in New Zealand and takes into account only the effect of factors that cause the asset to depreciate. This is known as the “total life approach”. It focuses on the estimated useful life of an asset or asset class, and does not relate to a particular taxpayer. It is also consistent with the final recommendation of the Valabh Committee on Taxation. 8 2.7 Estimated useful life attempts to mirror, broadly, the economic life of an asset. This means that rates calculated by Inland Revenue are an attempt to approximate economic depreciation. Economic depreciation rates for different assets will never be able to be measured with precision, as discussed in a later chapter. The legislation refers to rates prescribed by the Commissioner as economic depreciation rates. 2.8 Economic depreciation rates are set having regard to the following legislative formula: 1 – ((residual value / cost) (1/ estimated useful life) ) where residual value is at least 13.5% of cost. 2.9 The formula calculates diminishing value economic depreciation rates, and Inland Revenue can then prescribe a straight-line equivalent depreciation rate. 9 Economic depreciation rates are “banded” (meaning the resulting rates are rounded to the nearest band). 10 2.10 Inland Revenue is required to determine economic depreciation rates for all depreciable assets other than fixed-life intangible property, which is any depreciable intangible property that on its purchase or creation, can reasonably be expected to have an economic life which is the same as its legal life. Fixed-life intangible property must be depreciated over its legal life using the straight-line-method. 8 The Committee commented that “The definition \[of estimated useful life\] reflects our view that the useful life on an asset for depreciation purposes is not the life for which an asset could technically be used, but the life for which it is or will be useful in the income earning process. ... it is necessary to note that it is the useful life of the asset which is the important criteria for determining depreciation rates, not necessarily the length of time for which it will be used by any particular taxpayer. This means that where an asset will be disposed of to another taxpayer for use by that taxpayer, the useful life of the asset needs to be calculated having regard to the entire period for which the asset will be used, not just the period for which the asset is first used by the taxpayer.” \[letter to NZ Government of 14 November 1991\] 9 See schedule 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 10 See schedule 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 18 Pooling method of depreciation and “low-value” assets 2.11 Assets valued at $2,000 or less (either costing this amount or by having been depreciated individually to an adjusted-tax-book value equal to or less than $2,000) can be pooled and depreciated as a single asset. Taxpayers can apply to Inland Revenue to increase this maximum pooling value and can also maintain multiple pools. The depreciation rate to be used in respect of a pool is the lowest single rate applying to any asset in the pool. 2.12 The pooling method of depreciation allows assets below a certain value to be combined and depreciated at a single rate, thereby reducing the compliance costs associated with depreciating each individual item separately (and maintaining an asset register in respect of them). 2.13 An immediate deduction is available for depreciable property costing less than $200. This is commonly referred to as the “low-value” asset threshold. Loading on economic depreciation rates 2.14 A 20 percent loading applies to economic depreciation rates for most new depreciable property. 11 Exceptions to the loading are buildings, second-hand imported motor vehicles and fixed-life intangible property. The loading allows depreciation rates to be set at 120 percent of estimated economic depreciation. Special tax depreciation rates 2.15 Taxpayers can apply for special depreciation rates that are higher (or lower) than those prescribed by Inland Revenue if they consider the prescribed general depreciation rate is substantially different from the rate that should apply. This may arise, for example, if a depreciable asset is being used in a way that is different than that considered by Inland Revenue when determining a general economic depreciation rate for the asset. A special rate may also be applicable if the economic life of a depreciable asset is dependant on certain factors, such as the length of a taxpayer’s income- earning process or business (and cannot be salvaged at the end of it). However, the onus is on the taxpayer to prove that a special depreciation rate is warranted by, for example, providing evidence that an asset will cease to be useful to them or any other taxpayer after a certain date. The taxpayer is also required to provide the appropriate data to be considered by Inland Revenue. 2.16 When considering a special depreciation rate application, Inland Revenue must have regard to the legislative formula for calculating economic depreciation rates, as well as the depreciation rate adopted by a taxpayer for financial reporting purposes. 11 Property that has not previously been used or available for use in New Zealand by any other owner. 19 2.17 Taxpayers can apply for a provisional depreciation rate for an asset if no applicable prescribed rate currently exists. This may arise in the case of newly invented assets. 2.18 Special and provisional depreciation rate applications are considered by Inland Revenue Adjudication and Rulings. Repairs and maintenance 2.19 The cost of repairing or maintaining assets is generally treated as a deductible expense in the year such expenditure is incurred. However, if the work adds to or improves the asset, this may constitute capital expenditure, with the cost having to be capitalised and depreciated over future years. The issue of what constitutes repairs and maintenance and what is a capital improvement can be a grey area in certain circumstances. 12 Disposal of depreciable assets 2.20 A taxpayer can deduct the remaining tax-book value of a depreciable asset (except buildings and pooled depreciable property) that is no longer used in deriving gross income or in a business. To access this write-off, the cost of disposing of the asset must exceed any consideration that would be received from its disposal. 2.21 If depreciable property is disposed of by a taxpayer for a price exceeding its tax-book value, the excess amount (up to the asset’s original cost) is treated as gross income. This amounts to a “claw-back” of depreciation allowed on the asset. If a depreciable asset is disposed of for less than its tax-book value the difference is generally allowed as a deduction. 13 2.22 Disposal of depreciable property is defined to include a change in the use of the property, a cessation of its use in New Zealand or the loss or theft of the property. When depreciable property changes use or ceases to be used in New Zealand, the property is typically treated as being disposed of for a consideration equal to its market value. 2.23 Specific rules exist for disposal of depreciable property as a result of certain transfers – for example, under matrimonial property agreements and between associated parties. 12 The distinction has been examined in case law – for example, in Bulcroft Main Collieries Ltd v O'Grady (1932) 17 TC 93, a replacement chimney in a factory was held to be an improvement and so capital in nature, whereas in Samuel Jones & Co (Devondale) Ltd v CIR (1951) 32 TC 513, such a chimney was held not to be an improvement and so a deductible revenue expense. In Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967, the case involved the reconstruction of a trotting track which the court held was a capital expenditure and not repairs to the old track. 13 A loss on disposal of buildings is not allowed as a deduction. 20 The economic depreciation rate-setting process 2.24 In anticipation of the introduction of the current tax depreciation rules in 1993, Inland Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of economic depreciation rates. The purpose of the review was to assist the department in setting economic depreciation rates, and it drew on three main sources of information: a taxpayer survey, interviews with businesses and independent valuers’ reports. 2.25 The taxpayer survey involved about 10,000 businesses from various industries and obtained information about asset classes and data on estimated useful lives and residual market values. Respondents were asked when providing estimates to take into account expected obsolescence, exhaustion, and wear and tear. 2.26 The second main source of information was from interviews with businesses representing different industries. Here, information was obtained about depreciation policies, asset classes and depreciation lives and rates used for financial reporting purposes. 2.27 The third source of information was independent reports from registered valuers, who advised on the design of the asset classification system used by Inland Revenue in setting economic depreciation rates (the industry and general asset categories 14 ) as well as estimated useful lives and residual values for different asset classes. 2.28 Since 1993 there have been minor adjustments to the economic depreciation rates schedules, to take account of new types and categories of assets. 14 Assets peculiar to specific industries are listed and can be depreciated according to the rates set under the industry category, while assets typically used in a variety of different industries are listed in the asset category. 21 Part 2 Structure of the rules Part 2 examines the structure of the depreciation rules. Chapter 3 provides a simplified exposition of how taxes, depreciation provisions and inflation can affect incentives to invest. This helps explain some of the biases identified in chapter 4. These biases may result in New Zealand’s investment being less productive that it might be. Chapter 5 discusses possible ways of addressing these biases. 22 23 Chapter 3 ECONOMIC DEPRECIATION, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND INCENTIVES TO INVEST Summary • In the absence of inflation, tax depreciation rates should equal actual economic depreciation if they are to avoid distorting investment decisions. • Expensing of assets or accelerated depreciation can allow investments to be profitable at pre-tax returns that are less than the pre-tax cost of borrowing. • Inflation has a significant impact on depreciating assets, especially as we use historical cost depreciation. • For short-lived assets, historical cost depreciation is similar to nominal economic depreciation. For long-lived assets, the current rules approximate real economic depreciation. This variation favours long-lived assets. 3.1 The prima facie case for economic depreciation may not be well understood. For this reason, this chapter discusses the effects of economic depreciation and other possible depreciation provisions on incentives to invest. 3.2 Standard economic analysis suggests that as more and more is invested in an activity, returns eventually get depressed. This means that measures such as accelerated depreciation that lower the cost of investment will cause investment to expand. As investment expands, returns will be bid down until it is no longer possible for firms to expand investment further. 3.3 To build up the analysis as simply as possible, this chapter initially ignores inflation and abstracts from uncertainty. This approach allows us to examine how tax provisions can affect investment incentives as simply as possible. This is also an important case to consider. If depreciation rules would not work well in the absence of uncertainty, they will almost certainly not work well in the presence of uncertainty. Of course, it is real-world uncertainties that make measuring economic income difficult. These are at the heart of problems that will be discussed in later chapters. 24 General framework 3.4 An important policy issue is how best to minimise tax biases to investment decisions. If taxes are not to interfere with investment decisions, it would be necessary for the investment decisions of taxpayers and non-taxpayers to be identical. As people will wish to invest if the present value of the benefits from an investment exceeds its cost, this requires that asset valuations be independent of tax rates. 3.5 For asset valuations to be independent of tax rates, economic depreciation (the fall in market value of assets) must be deductible. 15 Conversely, if assets rise in value, the accruing capital gain (the rise in the market value) would need to be taxed, irrespective of whether or not assets were sold. As will be discussed later, in the presence of inflation there is some ambiguity about how best to define “economic depreciation”. For the time being, inflation is ignored. 3.6 It should be noted that a tax system in which valuations were independent of tax rates would not mean that taxes had no effect on investment decisions. For example, taxes are likely to affect savings and labour supply decisions, wage rates and other prices. A tax system in which asset valuations were independent of tax rates would merely ensure that, given the prices arising in the presence of taxes, taxpayers and non-taxpayers would place the same values on assets. 3.7 As we have discussed, for asset valuations to be independent of tax rates, it would be necessary to tax accruing capital gains. In practice, there are formidable problems in taxing accruing capital gains, and even countries with capital gains taxes generally do not levy taxes on accruing gains. However, most business assets depreciate. Allowing deductions for economic depreciation for depreciating assets would, at least in theory, be a way of ensuring that, at least for these assets, investment decisions are independent of tax rates. 3.8 There are severe difficulties in measuring economic depreciation and estimates of economic depreciation will be imprecise. This means that even if tax depreciation provisions are as close to economic depreciation as feasible, investment distortions will remain. The practical problem is how best to reform depreciation provisions, given the real-world uncertainties that exist. 15 This proposition is often referred to as the “invariant-valuations proposition”. For a formal discussion see P.A. Samuelson (1964), “The Deductibility of Economic Depreciation to Insure Invariant Valuations”, Journal of Political Economy, 72(6), 604- 606. Samuelson’s article ignores uncertainty. For an extension which considers uncertainty see, G. Fane (1987) “Neutral Taxation under Uncertainty”, Journal of Public Economics, 33, 95-105. 25 3.9 A complication in analysing the effects of different possible depreciation provisions is the vast variety of revenue profiles of different possible investments. Three simple profiles that have been assumed in the economic literature are as follows: • An asset which provides a constant revenue stream for a fixed number of periods and then expires. Such assets have constant underlying productivity through their life. For example, an asset might generate revenue of $10 per annum for each of 20 years and then expire. For such an asset, the productivity of the original investment does not deteriorate until the asset suddenly expires and is no longer used. The asset will, however, depreciate over time as its future useful life declines. • An asset whose underlying productivity falls in a straight-line fashion for a number of periods and then expires. For example, an asset might provide revenue of $20 in year one, $18 in year two, $16 in year three and so forth, ending with $2 in year ten and then expire. Such an asset will depreciate over time more quickly than on a straight line basis as both its productivity and future life decline. • An asset whose productivity falls in a geometric manner at some rate, δ where δ lies between 0 and 1. For example, suppose that such an asset’s productivity fell by 10 percent per annum (δ = 0.1). Suppose also that it generated revenue of $10 in year one. Then it would generate revenue of $9 ($10(1)δ−) in year two, $8.10 ( 2 $10(1)δ−) in year three and so forth. 3.10 Of course, assets have a vast variety of different possible cash flows, and even the same asset used in two different activities or by two different firms may provide substantially different cash flow profiles. A number of overseas studies have examined economic depreciation across a broad set of assets in which second-hand markets exist. The data tend to strongly reject the proposition that economic depreciation profiles are generally consistent with either of the first two types of assets. Both of these types of asset would depreciate much too slowly in early years to be consistent with the data. The third type of asset would have an infinite economic life, which clearly conflicts with the facts. This type of asset is also rejected by the data but, at least in early years, economic depreciation appears to follow a profile which is more consistent with this asset than either of the other two. 16 In part as a result and in part because of the tractability of the analysis, it is extremely common for international studies to assume that cash flows take this form. 3.11 In this chapter we will illustrate key ideas as simply as possible by considering two special polar cases of assets with geometrically declining productivity. These are as follows: • a two period asset ( 1=δ ) which is purchased at the end of year 0 for a fixed cost of, say, $100, which provides a single positive cash flow one year later and then expires; and 26 • a non-depreciating asset (0=δ) which costs, say, $100 at the end of year 0 and provides a constant revenue stream in each future year. Investment decisions in the absence of tax 3.12 In the absence of taxes and uncertainty, a non-taxpayer would have incentives to keep on investing until the rate of return on further investments was driven down to the interest rate. 17 Suppose that an individual can borrow or lend at the market interest rate of 5 percent and assume for the time being that there is no inflation. Table 3.1 shows cash flows for a non- depreciating marginal investment and for a two-period marginal investment. Marginal investments are investments with a zero net present value (investments where the individual ends up being just as well off as if money were deposited in a bank). A non-depreciating asset which costs $100 in year 0 and provides revenue of $5 per annum would be a marginal investment, as would a two-period investment which costs $100 in year 0 and provides $105 one year later. Table 3.1 Non-taxpayer Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Revenue 5 Cost 100 Revenue 105 3.13 If an asset costs A and provides revenue of a in each future year, its rate of return is Aa/=ρ . Thus an asset which costs $100 and provides revenue of $5 per annum has a rate of return of 5 percent. If an asset costs A and provides revenue of a 1 one year later and nothing in any future year, its rate of return is 1/ 1 −=Aaρ . Thus an asset which costs $100 and provides revenue of $105 one year later and nothing in any future year also has a rate of return of 5 percent because 0.05 = 105/100 – 1. 3.14 Thus, in the absence of taxes, assets would need to generate a rate of return equal to the interest rate to make it just worthwhile for investors to hold them instead of putting their money in the bank. 16 For a discussion, see C.R. Hulten and F.C. Wykoff, 1996, “Issues in the Measurement of Economic Depreciation”, Economic Inquiry, January, 34, 1, pp. 10-23. 17 Here the analysis is on the long-run determinants of investment. In the long run, it would be expected that investment would expand until further investment would earn just the interest rate and further investment would not be profitable. In the short run, there may be many other extremely important determinants of investment including, for example, sales or the cash flow of firms. 27 Investment decisions for a taxpaying individual: no inflation 3.15 Now suppose (to keep numbers simple) that the investor is taxed at a rate of 40 cents in the dollar. So long as true economic depreciation is deductible, asset values will be independent of tax rates. Thus a marginal investment for a non-taxpayer will be a marginal investment for a taxpayer. This means that the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment (or the cost of capital) will still be equal to the interest rate. This is illustrated for our two polar-case investments in table 3.2, which shows that the assets with the pre-tax cash flows outlined in table 3.1 are still marginal on an after-tax basis. Table 3.2 Economic depreciation Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Revenue 5 Cost 100 Revenue 105 Economic Depreciation 0 Economic Depreciation 100 Tax 2 Tax 2 ATCF -100 3 -100 103 3.16 For the non-depreciating asset, true economic depreciation is zero. As in table 3.1 it is assumed that the asset costs $100 at the end of year 0. In subsequent years taxable income will be equal to revenue of $5 minus true economic depreciation of nil. Thus $2 of tax will be paid, leaving an after- tax cash flow (ATCF) of $3. For the two-period asset costing $100, true economic depreciation in year one will be $100 because after year one the asset will be valueless, so it depreciates by $100 over the year. Thus pre-tax income in period 1 is $5 (revenue of $105 minus depreciation of $100) and tax is $2. 18 3.17 Investments which are marginal for a non-taxpayer continue to be marginal for a taxpayer provided true economic depreciation is deductible, because taxes reduce both the after-tax interest rate and the after-tax rate of return on the investment by the same proportion. The taxpayer, just like the non- taxpayer, gains exactly the same after-tax cash flows from these assets as could be obtained by depositing $100 in a bank. 3.18 There is nothing special about the particular examples we have chosen. If true economic depreciation is deductible, investments which are marginal for a non-taxpayer will be marginal for taxpayers on any tax rate. 18 These examples are clearly stylised and the two-period example ignores the possibility of part-year depreciation in year 0. In principle, if an asset did provide a single positive cash flow, the asset would not depreciate until the time when this cash flow is derived so no depreciation deduction should be allowed until this time. In practice, allowing part-year depreciation deductions is likely to be broadly appropriate when assets provide revenue continuously throughout an income year rather than at a single point in time. 28 Effect of expensing and scope for tax arbitrage 3.19 If tax depreciation is faster than economic depreciation, this will drive down the pre-tax rate of return on marginal investments below the interest rate. An extreme but easy case to analyse is that of immediate deductibility or expensing. In this case, provided the investor’s tax rate remains the same in each future year, the cost of capital will be equal to the after-tax interest rate. This is illustrated in table 3.3, where it is shown that if the interest rate remains 5 percent, investments earning a pre-tax rate of return of 3 percent become marginal. 3.20 For both the non-depreciating and the two-period asset, the $100 of expenditure in year 0 leads to a tax saving of $40, so the after-tax cost in year 0 is $60. If the non-depreciating asset provides revenue of $3 per annum (a 3 percent pre-tax rate of return), this will lead to a tax liability of $1.20 in each subsequent year and hence an after-tax cash flow of $1.80. This is exactly equal to the after-tax interest the investor would receive if $60 were placed in a bank account earning 5 percent interest, which would provide $3 per annum of pre-tax interest rate and $1.80 of after-tax interest. Similarly, for the two-period asset, an investment with a 3 percent pre-tax rate of return is marginal on an after-tax basis. 3.21 There are several reasons for this result: • Irrespective of depreciation provisions, there will always be incentives to invest until the after-tax rate of return is bid down to the after-tax interest rate, which is 3 percent in this example. • Provided tax rates remain constant, expensing leads to after-tax costs and revenues falling in the same proportion. This means that the pre- tax rate of return will be equal to the post-tax rate of return. • Thus, in equilibrium, the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment will equal the after-tax interest rate. Table 3.3 Expensing Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Rev 3.0 Cost 100 Rev 103.0 Deprec 100 Deprec 0.0 Deprec 100 Deprec 0.0 Tax Saving 40 Tax 1.2 Tax Saving 40 Tax 41.2 ATCF -60 1.8 ATCF -60 61.8 29 3.22 The preceding analysis leads to an obvious concern with expensing (or, to a lesser extent, with other accelerated depreciation measures). In the absence of taxes, borrowing (or reducing lending) at a 5 percent interest rate to invest at a 5 percent rate of return is marginal. With economic depreciation and a tax rate of 40 percent, borrowing at 5 percent to earn 5 percent is still marginal. However, with expensing, borrowing at 5 percent to earn 3 percent becomes marginal. It becomes profitable for investors to invest at a lower rate of return than the interest rate because investments are effectively subsidised by the tax system. 3.23 Economic depreciation leads to similar incentives to invest for both taxpayers and non-taxpayers. By contrast, taxes and accelerated depreciation can provide taxpayers with incentives to invest in cases where investment would be unprofitable for a non-taxpayer. 3.24 Not only is there the obvious inefficiency associated with encouraging the economy to borrow on world capital markets at 5 percent to invest at 3 percent, but there is also the potential problem of tax arbitrage. Suppose that the interest rate is 5 percent but that real assets earn 3 percent. Those on tax rates lower than 40 percent will have incentives to lend rather than investing directly in real assets. When this happens, negative amounts of tax can be collected on investment income. 3.25 To illustrate this, consider the case of a tax-exempt charity which has $60 which it could invest in a proportionately scaled-down version of the non- depreciating asset described on the left-hand side of table 3.3. If it were to do so, it would earn tax-free revenue of $1.80 per annum, providing a 3 percent return on its investment. Instead, however, it lends the money to a 40 percent marginal rate taxpayer who invests in $100 of the real asset. The $60 borrowed, together with the tax saving of $40, allows $100 of real asset to be acquired. In future years, income from the asset will balance the interest expense and there will be no tax to pay. Thus in year 0 this investment reduces taxes paid by $40 without any offset in future years, so the investment is negatively taxed. 3.26 This is shown in table 3.4. On the left-hand side we record cash flows from the 40 percent marginal rate taxpayer’s perspective. In year 0 the cost of the asset is financed by borrowing $60 and a tax saving of $40, leaving an after- tax cash flow of $0. In future years, revenue from the asset balances the interest expense, leading to a zero tax liability and an after-tax cash flow of $0. From the government’s perspective, $40 is lost in year 0 without any offsetting future gain. 3.27 These tax arbitrage opportunities mean that a business income tax base with heavily accelerated depreciation provisions can end up collecting negative amounts of revenue. 30 Table 3.4 Expensing and tax arbitrage Taxpayer’s perspective Government’s perspective Year 0 Future years Year 0 Future years Cost 100 Revenue 3.0 Tax -40.0 0.0 Deprec 100 Deprec 0.0 Tax Saving 40 Interest Expense 3.0 Borrowed Funds 60 Tax 0.0 ATCF 0.0 0.0 3.28 The analysis so far has considered the cases of economic depreciation and of immediate expensing as an example of accelerated depreciation. Now consider the opposite case, where tax depreciation is too slow. This can result in capital investment being taxed and the cost of capital rising above the interest rate. For an extreme example, consider the case of a two-period asset, but this time assume that no depreciation is allowed for tax purposes. Once more, assume that $100 is invested in year 0 and the interest rate is 5 percent per annum. A taxpayer on a 40 percent marginal rate would need to earn $103 after tax to be as well off as by putting money in the bank. This would require pre-tax revenue of $171.67 = $103/(1 – 0.4), or a real pre-tax rate of return of 71.67 percent. This would clearly discourage investment with higher pre-tax returns than the 5 percent cost of funds to the economy. Failure to allow economic depreciation for assets which do depreciate is likely to be very inefficient. 19 Investment decisions of companies 3.29 By themselves, the previous examples would appear to suggest a strong case for eliminating any element of accelerated depreciation and ensuring that tax depreciation is neither faster nor slower than economic depreciation. The preceding analysis has applied to investment by unincorporated enterprises owned by New Zealand residents. Qualitatively similar results would hold for investment by companies owned solely by New Zealand residents. This is because under the New Zealand full imputation scheme, distributed income ends up being taxed once at the marginal tax rates of shareholders. By itself, this bolsters the case for economic depreciation. 19 Of course, this is likely to bias decisions on who undertakes investment. For example, if there were heavily taxed investments earning 71.67 percent when the interest rate was 5 percent, there would be strong incentives for non-taxpayers to invest in such assets rather than lending. 31 3.30 There is, however, a very important balancing consideration. New Zealand currently allows accelerated depreciation through a 20 percent loading on depreciation rates for plant and equipment. Removing accelerated depreciation provisions would boost effective tax rates on foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio equity investment, which would discourage foreign equity investment. This is of concern because taxes on foreign equity investors could ultimately be borne by domestic residents but in a more costly way than if domestic residents were taxed directly. 3.31 The key problem is that depreciation deductions provide one instrument for addressing two quite separate problems. An across-the-board move to eliminating any element of accelerated depreciation could increase the efficiency of investment decisions for firms that are operated in the interests of domestic resident shareholders, but decrease the efficiency of investment decisions for firms that are operated in the interests of foreign shareholders. Of course, there may be better ways of addressing concerns about foreign equity investment in New Zealand than through the size of depreciation deductions. Work on such issues, however, is beyond the scope of the current depreciation review. Inflation 3.32 Now we once more consider investment by an unincorporated enterprise owned by an individual on a 40 percent marginal tax rate but this time examine how modest levels of inflation can affect the analysis. We assume a 2 percent inflation rate, which is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target range. We assume that inflation has no effect on the real interest rate faced in New Zealand, so the nominal interest rate rises in line with inflation. We also assume that inflation of 2 percent per annum means that all prices rise at this rate. In practice, the cost to consumers of inflation is smaller than the measured inflation rate because of the way in which consumers can substitute towards goods and services whose relative price declines. 3.33 Minor levels of inflation will have two effects on investment. First, provided changes in inflation do not affect the real interest rate, they will tend to boost the subsidy conferred by accelerated depreciation. Second, if depreciation rates were set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, they would tend to produce a bias favouring longer-lived investments over shorter-lived investments. 20 20 This is well known. For example, the United States Treasury, Report to Congress on Depreciation Recovery Periods and Methods, July 2000 (page 48) states, “All else equal, an unindexed tax system favours investment in long-lived over short-lived assets.” An early reference is Auerbach, A.J., 1979, “Inflation and the Choice of Asset Life”, Journal of Political Economy, 87(3), 621-638. 32 3.34 With a real interest rate of 5 percent per annum and an inflation rate of 2 percent the nominal interest rate will be 7.1 percent. 21 The real after-tax interest rate will be approximately 2.22 percent. 3.35 First, consider the case where capital expenditure can be expensed (the easiest case to consider). In this case, the real pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment will be bid down to the real after-tax interest rate of 2.22 percent, compared with 3 percent in the absence of inflation. Thus inflation reduces the cost of capital. Borrowing at a real interest rate of 5 percent to earn a real pre-tax rate of return of 2.22 percent becomes marginally profitable. 3.36 Table 3.5, which can be compared with table 3.3, records the real (inflation adjusted) cash flows generated on the two types of asset. 3.37 Consider first the two-period asset. The asset costs $100 in year 0 and provides real revenue of $102.22, or nominal revenue of 02.122.102$26.104$×= in year one. On an after-tax basis the asset costs $60 and provides an after-tax real cash flow of $61.33, or nominal cash flow of 02.133.61$56.62$×= in year one. The investor ends up exactly as well off as if $60 were placed in a bank for a year. Table 3.5 Inflation and expensing Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Revenue 2.22 Cost 100 Revenue 102.22 Deprec 100 Deprec 0.00 Deprec 100 Deprec 0.00 Tax Saving 40 Tax 0.89 Tax Saving 40 Tax 40.89 ATCF -60 1.33 ATCF -60 61.33 3.38 The non-depreciating asset costing $100 in year 0 will provide real revenues of $2.22 in each subsequent year. This is equivalent to nominal revenues of $2.26 = 02.122.2$× in year one, 2 02.122.2$31.2$×= in year two and so forth. Again, the taxpayer ends up just as well off as if $100 were deposited in a bank account and additional deposits were made at the end of each year to maintain the real value of the deposit. 21 If r denotes the real interest rate, π the inflation rate and i the nominal interest rate, the relationship between the real and nominal interest rate is given by )1)(1(1π++=+ri or ππ++=)1(ri or, conversely, \]1/\[\]\[ππ+−=ir. With a tax rate, m, the after-tax real interest rate will be \]1/\[\])1(\[' ππ+−−=mir. 33 3.39 The more complex case to consider is that of economic depreciation. In times of inflation there are a number of ways in which economic depreciation might be defined. For asset values not to depend on tax rates, so long as nominal interest income is taxed and nominal interest expense is deductible, it would be necessary to allow a deduction for the fall in the nominal market value of assets (and to tax accruing nominal gains). We will refer to this as “nominal economic depreciation” or NED). If nominal economic depreciation is deductible (and nominal gains are taxed as they accrue), we say that an asset is being taxed on its full “nominal economic income”. Economists have more often used the words “economic depreciation” to mean the fall in the real market value of assets. We will use the words “real economic depreciation”, or “RED”, to refer to this definition of economic depreciation. If real economic depreciation were deductible (and real gains taxed on accrual), we say that an asset is being taxed on its “real economic income”. 3.40 In practice, the way that Inland Revenue computes rates of economic depreciation for most assets takes no account of inflation at all. Its method of calculating depreciation seems more likely to provide an extremely rough proxy for the way in which assets might depreciate if there were no inflation. We will refer to such a measure as “historical cost approximation for economic depreciation” or “HCA”. 3.41 To see the difference between these measures, consider an asset which in the absence of inflation would be worth $200 at the end of year 0, $100 at the end of year one and $0 at the end of year two. Suppose, however, that there is 2 percent inflation each year so the asset is worth $200 at the end of year 0, $102 at the end of year one and $0 at the end of year two. Nominal and real values of nominal economic depreciation, real economic depreciation and the historical cost approximation over years one and two are recorded in table 3.6. Table 3.6 Possible depreciation deductions with 2 percent inflation Nominal asset values Nominal values Real values Year 0=π 02.=π NED HCA RED NED HCA RED 0 200.0200.0 1 100.0102.0 98.0100.0102.096.198.0 100.0 2 0.00.0 102.0100.0104.098.096.1 100.0 34 3.42 Consider first the middle set of columns, “nominal values”. If nominal economic depreciation were deductible, the taxpayer could deduct $98.0 in year one (the fall in the asset’s nominal value from $200 to $102) and $102 in year two. Under the historical cost approximation, $100 would be deductible in each of years one and two. This measures how the asset would depreciate in the absence of inflation. To calculate real economic depreciation in year one, the taxpayer would be allowed to subtract the current value of the asset ($102) from its inflation-adjusted acquisition cost ( 02.1200$204$×=). This would leave the asset with a book value of $102 at the end of year one. Likewise, in year two the taxpayer could deduct the current value of the asset (viz., $0) from its inflation-adjusted book value ( 02.1102$104$×=). The final three columns give the real (inflation- adjusted) value of these deductions. 3.43 It might be observed that in the simple example in table 3.6 there is little difference between the present value of depreciation deductions under nominal economic depreciation and the historical cost approximation, but there is a bigger difference between the historical cost approximation and real economic depreciation. This will generally be the case for short-lived assets such as the three-period example in table 3.6. By contrast, for very long-lived assets, the historical cost approximation will be much closer to real economic depreciation than to nominal economic depreciation. 3.44 Although a switch to a nominal economic income base is not being suggested, it is worthwhile thinking through the implications of both a nominal economic and a real economic income base. This helps in understanding the effects of the historical cost approximation. At one polar extreme (the two-period asset), the historical cost approximation will result in nominal economic income being taxed. At the other polar extreme (the non-depreciating asset), the historical cost approximation will result in real economic income being taxed. Nominal economic income base 3.45 If nominal economic depreciation was deductible for all assets and nominal gains taxed as they accrued so assets were taxed on their full nominal economic income, the cost of capital for all investments would be equal to the real interest rate, which is 5 percent in our examples. This is illustrated in table 3.7. Consider first the two-period asset, which generates real revenue of $105 in year one (a real pre-tax rate of return of 5 percent). The nominal depreciation deduction in year one would be $100 and the real value of this deduction would be $98.04 ($100/1.02). The real tax payment would be $2.78 (40 percent of \[$105 minus $98.04\]). The investor would earn a real after-tax rate of return of 2.22 percent, which equals the after-tax real interest rate of 2.22 percent derived earlier. 35 Table 3.7 Nominal economic depreciation Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Rev 5.00 Cost 100 Rev 105.00 Cap Gain 1.96 Deprec 98.04 Tax 2.78 Tax 2.78 ATCF -100 2.22 ATCF -100 102.22 3.46 Now consider a non-depreciating asset which generates real revenues of $5 per annum (a real pre-tax rate of return of 5 percent). In year one the asset will generate a nominal capital gain of $2, which is $1.96 ($2.00/1.02) in real terms. The real tax liability would be $2.78 (40 percent of $5.00+$1.96). The real after-tax cash flow will be $2.22. In future years, real tax liabilities and real after-tax cash flows will be the same, so the taxpayer will end up earning an after-tax rate of return of 2.22 percent, which is once more equal to their required after-tax real interest rate. Thus these investments earning a 5 percent real pre-tax rate of return are marginal on an after-tax basis. 3.47 Under a comprehensive nominal economic income base, all investment returns would be taxed on the same basis as interest. This is why the cost of capital does not depend on tax rates in this case. Real economic income base 3.48 If real economic depreciation was deductible for all assets and real gains taxed as they accrued so assets were taxed on their real economic income, the cost of capital for all investments would be equal to 3.70 percent. This means that the real post-tax rate of return will be equal to 3.70%×(1- 0.4)=2.22%, which would be the real after-tax interest rate that investors demand. This is illustrated in table 3.8. 3.49 First consider the non-depreciating asset. As this asset does not depreciate in real terms, real economic depreciation is zero in each year. Investors need to earn a 2.22 percent real after-tax return to be as well off as they would be from earning interest. The asset needs to provide pre-tax real income of $3.70 or $2.22/(1-0.4) to be as attractive on an after-tax basis as interest. 3.50 Now consider the two-period asset. If this provides real revenue of $103.70 in year one, and benefits from a real depreciation deduction of $100 in that year, the investor will earn a real after-tax cash flow of $102.22 in that year, which is as good as could be derived by putting money in the bank. 36 Table 3.8 Real economic depreciation Non-depreciating asset Two-period asset Year 0 Future years Year 0 Year 1 Cost 100 Rev 3.70 Cost 100 Rev 103.70 Deprec 0.00 Deprec 100.00 Tax 1.48 Tax 1.48 ATCF -100 2.22 ATCF -100 102.22 Historical cost approximation 3.51 Finally, consider the historical cost approximation. For the two period asset a nominal deduction of $100 (a real deduction of $98.04) would be allowed in year one. This is exactly the same as would be allowed under a nominal economic income base. It is less generous than allowing for inflation indexed depreciation deductions as would be provided under a real economic income base. 3.52 By contrast, consider the non-depreciating asset. In the absence of inflation, this would neither appreciate nor depreciate, so under the historical cost approximation, there would be neither depreciation deductions nor capital gains taxation. However, this is the treatment that would be afforded under a real economic income base. It is more generous than would be afforded under a nominal economic income base, under which nominal capital gains would be taxed. 3.53 Thus, under the historical cost approximation, there is a built-in bias favouring long-lived relative to short-lived assets. At the extreme, for two- period assets, both the real and the inflationary component of income are taxed, whereas for a non-depreciating asset only the real component of economic income is being taxed. This insight is important in understanding the tax biases analysed in chapter 4. Concluding remarks 3.54 Even in the absence of inflation, the best way of calculating depreciation provisions is a complex issue. If there were no foreign equity investment in New Zealand, there would be strong grounds for attempting to eliminate accelerated depreciation and getting depreciation deductions as close to economic depreciation as possible. This would minimise tax biases to investment decisions. However, by itself, removing accelerated depreciation provisions would boost taxes on foreign equity investment in New Zealand in ways which are likely to be undesirable. 37 3.55 Inflation, together with historical cost depreciation, creates an additional complication. Even if depreciation deductions were to measure accurately how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, allowing historical cost deductions would introduce biases in the presence of inflation. These would favour long-lived relative to short-lived investments. 3.56 A problem to be discussed in chapter 4 is that the current method of calculating depreciation provisions seems arbitrary and may not be the best way of calculating economic depreciation, even in the absence of inflation. 3.57 The reforms discussed in this paper are aimed at reducing biases to investment decisions without increasing overall taxes on capital income. 38 Chapter 4 EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT TAX DEPRECIATION RULES Summary • There are two ways in which current depreciation provisions may bias investment away from shorter-lived equipment towards longer-lived structures. • This is an intrinsic feature of a system of historical cost depreciation in the presence of inflation. • It may be reinforced by the way that depreciation deductions are calculated using an assumed 13.5 percent residual balance. This chapter explores how inflation can affect costs of capital and examines biases that can be introduced by the 13.5 percent residual balance formulation. 4.1 In chapter 3, we discussed how in the absence of inflation and uncertainty, economic depreciation would lead to the cost of capital (or minimum pre-tax rate of return at which investment becomes profitable) for an unincorporated enterprise being set equal to the interest rate. We also examined how accelerated depreciation or inflation could lead to costs of capital being driven down below the real interest rate. To present the analysis as simply as possible, we considered two polar cases: a two-period asset and a non- depreciating asset. 4.2 This chapter examines how current tax rules and inflation affect incentives to invest in a wider set of cases. To start with, we make the assumption that rates of depreciation allowed for tax purposes would mirror economic depreciation in the absence of inflation. In practice, there are grounds for querying whether current depreciation provisions do provide a good proxy for economic depreciation but we ignore this issue initially. We start by also ignoring the 20 percent loading to depreciation rates available for most assets and calculate costs of capital in the absence of any loading. We then extend the analysis to take account of the 20 percent loading. 4.3 The current method of calculating depreciation may not be the best way of calculating economic depreciation. The normal method of calculation uses estimates of economic life. A rate of diminishing value depreciation is calculated on the assumption that an asset’s value is 13.5 percent of its acquisition cost at the end of its economic life. The chapter discusses the appropriateness of this method of calculating economic depreciation. 4.4 Assets with the same economic life may have very different cash flow profiles. Implications for economic depreciation are also examined. 39 4.5 This chapter focuses on the effects of current depreciation provisions. Chapter 5 will examine directions for possible reforms. Recognition of impact of uncertainty and variability on analysis Our analysis abstracts from many factors, such as the impact of the business cycle or exchange rates on asset valuations, which, in the practical world, may have a more significant effect on the accuracy of depreciation for taxpayers than some of the issues which concern us in this paper. The variability of inflation must affect how successful our suggestions to address the impact of inflation will be. Even if the Reserve Bank keeps CPI inflation within the 1 percent to 3 percent range, the volatility of individual asset prices can obviously be much greater. Nevertheless, we consider that, to the extent problems can be identified with the current rules, we should attempt to address them while still recognising that real- world uncertainties exist. Costs of capital 4.6 Suppose that assets provide revenues that decline at a geometric rate δ . For example, if 0.1δ= and an asset provides $10 at the end of year one, it provides $9 at the end of year two, $8.10 at the end of year three, $7.29 at the end of year four and so forth. The two-period asset, discussed in chapter 3, can be considered as the special polar case where 1δ= and the non- depreciating asset as the special polar case where 0δ= . Here we extend the analysis to allow for other possible cases. 22 4.7 Table 4.1 outlines estimates of costs of capital (the minimum pre-tax rate of return at which investment becomes profitable) for an unincorporated enterprise in the absence of any loading, assuming that Inland Revenue’s estimated rates of depreciation (without the loading) would mirror economic depreciation in the absence of inflation. 23 This is a strong assumption which will, at best, be an approximation to the truth. This means that investment biases are likely to be larger than analysed later. We assume that taxpayers adopt the diminishing value basis for depreciation and consider only assets with depreciation rates in the midpoint of a banded depreciation rate. Again, this will tend to understate depreciation biases. 4.8 In practice, inflation will be uncertain and variable. We abstract from this complication and assume a constant, perfectly anticipated rate of inflation. A real interest rate of 05.0=r and a tax rate of 39.0=m are also assumed. 22 A further assumption is that so long as δ is less than 1, assets are never retired from service. 23 The cost of capital is given by ()() 1' 1 mZr m δ ρδ −+ =− − where m is the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate (assumed to be 39 percent in each period), Z is the present value of depreciation deductions, per dollar of investment, and r’ is the real after-tax cost of funds. Exactly the same formula arises if, rather than assuming that assets provide a single cash flow each year, they are assumed to provide cash flows continuously throughout each year. 40 Table 4.1 Costs of capital: unincorporated enterprises – no loading Inflation rate Depreciation rates 0.00π= 0.01π= 0.02π= 0.03π= 0.50 5.00 4.98 4.95 4.92 0.33 5.00 4.96 4.90 4.84 0.22 5.00 4.93 4.84 4.73 0.18 5.00 4.91 4.80 4.67 0.15 5.00 4.89 4.76 4.61 0.12 5.00 4.87 4.71 4.52 0.075 5.00 4.81 4.58 4.31 0.06 5.00 4.77 4.51 4.21 0.04 5.00 4.71 4.37 4.01 0.02 5.00 4.60 4.16 3.70 0.00 5.00 4.37 3.75 3.14 4.9 In the absence of inflation, the cost of capital for all forms of investment would be equal to the interest rate, in line with the discussion in chapter 3. We saw in chapter 3 that in the presence of inflation, costs of capital remain equal to the real interest rate if 1=δ (the asset is a two-period asset). This is because the full nominal economic income from such an asset is being taxed on the same basis as interest. 4.10 For assets depreciating at a diminishing value rate of 50 percent per annum, costs of capital are close to the real interest rate of 5 percent. In other cases, costs of capital fall because assets are taxed on less than their full nominal economic income. At a 2 percent inflation rate )02.0( =π, the cost of capital for a non-depreciating asset ( 0=δ ) is 3.75 percent. 4.11 Most assets used in New Zealand other than buildings qualify for a 20 percent depreciation loading. For non-depreciating assets a depreciation loading is clearly of no benefit. For depreciating assets, the depreciation loading increases the present value of depreciation deductions, which reduces the cost of investment and the cost of capital. 4.12 Table 4.2 considers the case of the depreciation loading. The 20 percent loading would have no effect on incentives to invest in non-depreciating assets but would increase incentives to invest and lower costs of capital for depreciating assets. In the absence of inflation, costs of capital would fall most for assets which depreciate faster. 41 Table 4.2 Costs of capital: unincorporated enterprises – 20% loading Inflation rate Depreciation rates 0.00π= 0.01π= 0.02π= 0.03π= 0.50 4.69 4.61 4.54 4.45 0.33 4.70 4.61 4.51 4.40 0.22 4.71 4.60 4.47 4.34 0.18 4.72 4.59 4.45 4.30 0.15 4.72 4.59 4.43 4.25 0.12 4.73 4.58 4.40 4.20 0.075 4.76 4.55 4.32 4.06 0.06 4.77 4.54 4.27 3.98 0.04 4.80 4.52 4.19 3.84 0.02 4.86 4.47 4.05 3.60 0.00 5.00 4.37 3.75 3.14 4.13 In the absence of inflation, there would appear to be two unattractive features of the depreciation loading. First it tends to subsidise investment, encouraging investments at lower pre-tax rates of return than would be profitable for a non-taxpayer. This encourages investment that earns lower pre-tax rates of return than the cost of funds to the economy. Secondly, it favours faster-depreciating relative to slower-depreciating assets. Investment in faster-depreciating assets may displace investment in slower-depreciating assets merely because of a relative tax advantage. 4.14 At higher rates of inflation, however, our estimates suggest that the loading only partially offsets the bias caused by inflation. Costs of capital are lowest for assets which depreciate most slowly. The loading may have the unattractive feature of increasing investment subsidies. For example, at an inflation rate of 2 percent per annum and with a depreciation rate of 0.5, the cost of capital falls from 4.95 percent to 4.54 percent as a consequence of the depreciation loading. At the same time, however, the loading reduces the spread of costs of capital. At an inflation rate of 2 percent per annum, costs of capital would vary between 3.75 percent and 4.95 percent in the absence of any loading but only vary between 3.75 percent and 4.54 percent in the presence of the loading. This means that if inflation is in the Reserve Bank’s target range, the loading may reduce investment biases. 42 4.15 The figures in table 4.2 suggest that capital investment by unincorporated enterprises in New Zealand is under-taxed, not over-taxed. Similar results are likely to emerge if the analysis is extended to consider the case of companies owned solely by New Zealand residents. However, for companies owned solely by foreign non-resident equity investors, the opposite conclusion can emerge. In this case, the depreciation loading may reduce excessive taxes on foreign equity investment while, at the same time, reducing biases between investments of differing durability. 4.16 Because depreciation allowances affect incentives to invest for both domestically owned and foreign-owned firms, there is some genuine uncertainty as to whether a change to the rules which increased costs of capital without changing their variability would be in the country’s best interests. However, measures which reduce variability of costs of capital without changing average costs of capital would appear desirable. 4.17 A key concern of the depreciation review is whether or not there are likely to be practical reforms which work in this direction. One such step might be to increase capital write-off provisions for shorter-lived assets while reducing them for longer-lived assets. Chapter 5 explores how this sort of measure might be used to improve the neutrality of investment decisions. This sort of measure might lead to a small but nonetheless noticeable improvement in neutrality. Calculation of economic depreciation 4.18 So far, it has been assumed that tax depreciation, ignoring the 20 percent loading, would mirror economic depreciation in the absence of inflation. 4.19 The current way economic depreciation is estimated for assets which are likely to have a residual value at the end of their economic life, T, of less than 13.5 percent of their acquisition cost is to assume that the diminishing value rate of depreciation is δ where 135.0)1(=− T δ. The diminishing value depreciation rate is rounded to the nearest banded rate. Taxpayers have the option of adopting the diminishing value depreciation rate or a slower straight-line rate. The straight-line rate is chosen to lead to a similar present value of deductions to the diminishing value rate. 4.20 Whether or not this is the best way to calculate economic depreciation is an open question. When this formula was devised, there was no detailed justification that this would be a good way of measuring how assets depreciate over time. The formulation has been criticised as being arbitrary. 43 4.21 To our knowledge, there have been no studies of economic depreciation in New Zealand. There have, however, been a number of studies of economic depreciation in the United States. 24 Probably the most influential work has been a series of studies by Hulten and Wykoff, 25 although much of this work is dated. Moreover, it involves studies of economic depreciation in the United States, and economic depreciation may differ between the United States and New Zealand. 4.22 At first sight, it might appear that the obvious solution would be to attempt a study of rates of economic depreciation in New Zealand. However, studies of this nature are difficult, expensive and complex. For example, the Hulten and Wykoff studies which led to their estimates of economic depreciation occupied most of the decade of the 1970s. One analytical problem is that for many assets, second-hand markets are thin. Even for assets where there are significant second-hand sales, such as buildings, calculating economic depreciation can be problematic. As Hulten and Wykoff have pointed out, using second-hand sales introduces a bias because information is available only on surviving assets. 4.23 In the absence of good New Zealand studies, the best indications of how to calculate economic depreciation may come from overseas studies. The Hulten and Wykoff direct estimates of economic depreciation were from second-hand sales for a large set of assets which collectively constituted about 50 percent of the population of depreciable assets in the United States. For these assets they found that economic depreciation, while not strictly geometric, was approximately so (that is, economic depreciation is reasonably approximated by a constant diminishing value rate of depreciation). They estimated the best geometric approximation for economic depreciation. To extrapolate their results to other assets they imputed rates of economic depreciation, d, as follows. They set d=X/T where T is the economic life of the asset and X is a number. From the categories of asset on which empirical data were available, they estimated X using estimates of economic lives, T, used for statistical purposes and their own estimates of the best geometric approximation to economic depreciation. Thus they used information on T and d to find X. They found that X was, on average, approximately 1.65 for equipment and 0.91 for structures. They extended their results to assets on which second-hand sales were thin by using the formula d=X/T. These studies have been widely used. For example, they are the basis of United States Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates of economic depreciation. 26 Their values of X for equipment vary between 1.31 and 2.26, with a value of 1.65 being used as the default. Values of X for structures vary between 0.89 and 0.97 with 0.91 being used 24 For a survey of studies on economic depreciation for buildings see Gravelle (2000), “Depreciation and the Taxation of Real Estate”, CRS Report for Congress, Congressional Research Service, October. 25 See, for example, C.R.

B Robinson, 2003, “Preview of the 2003 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts: Statistical changes”, Survey of Current Business, September. 44 as the default. Estimates of average values of X have changed over time. A later study by Hulten and Wykoff reports a higher value of X of 1.86 for equipment. 27 4.24 There will be no great precision in any of these estimates. However, they clearly provide an alternative to the current, fairly arbitrary assumption of a 13.5 percent residual value when calculating depreciation rates. The current formulation is equivalent to setting X = 2 and assuming d = 2/T for sufficiently long-lived assets. The shorter the economic life, the lower the implicit value of X. For example, an asset with a two-year economic life has a 63.5 percent diminishing value rate of depreciation which is equivalent to assuming X = 1.27. 4.25 If the diminishing value rate of depreciation for equipment were assumed to be given by d = 1.65/T, this would increase depreciation rates for short-lived assets with economic lives of less than five years and decrease depreciation rates for assets with economic lives of more than five years. If instead, the diminishing value rate of depreciation were assumed to be given by d = 1.86/T, this would increase depreciation rates for a wider set of short- lived assets (with economic lives of ten years or less). It would reduce depreciation rates by very minor amounts for longer-lived equipment. This suggests that the current method of calculating depreciation may be understating depreciation for shorter-lived equipment. If the diminishing value rate of depreciation for structures were assumed to be 0.91/dT= , this would tend to reduce rates of depreciation for structures. Thus these studies suggest that the 13.5 percent residual value assumption may provide a tax bias against shorter-lived equipment in favour of longer-lived structures. This is quite separate from any bias favouring longer-lived assets relative to shorter-lived assets flowing from the combination of inflation and historical cost depreciation that was discussed earlier. Thus there would appear to be a prima facie case that current tax provisions may provide a double bias against shorter-lived equipment relative to longer-lived structures. 4.26 Chapter 5 explores the possibility of drawing on these studies to help inform decisions about economic rates of depreciation. We believe that there is likely to be an improvement in neutrality relative to the status quo from drawing on these studies and argue there is a prima facie case for cautious moves in this direction. Assets with rapidly declining cash flows 4.27 There will always be some strong element of “rough justice” in depreciation provisions. The Hulten and Wykoff studies suggest that for assets on average economic depreciation (at least in early years) is roughly geometric. However, averages can mask important differences among assets. 27 Hulten and Wykoff, 1996, ibid. 45 4.28 If two assets have identical economic lives but the first has a less rapidly declining profile of cash flows, it will depreciate more slowly than the second. In principle, this would provide an argument for providing slower rates of depreciation for the first asset than for the second. In practice, it may be very difficult for tax authorities to take this into account. 4.29 To analyse the implications for economic depreciation, we consider first investment in an asset which provides a constant revenue stream for six years and then expires. To analyse this issue as simply as possible, we ignore inflation. 4.30 Suppose that the interest rate is 5 percent per annum. Also suppose that an asset costs $101.51 at the end of year 0 and then provides a constant cash flow of $20.00 at the end of each of the next six years and then expires. This would be a marginal investment for a non-taxpayer as the cost of the asset is equal to the present value of its cash flows because 6 05.1/2005.1/2051.101$++=K . Table 4.3 reports the “ex-dividend” value of the asset (the value of the asset immediately after its cash flow for the year). For example, immediately after the year one cash flow the asset is valued at 5 05.1/2005.1/2059.86$++=K. Table 4.3 also reports cash flows and economic depreciation over each year. For example, economic depreciation over year one is the difference between the value of the asset at the beginning of the year ($101.51) and its value at the end ($86.59). Table 4.3 Asset with constant cash flows: no technological advance Years 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Revenue 20.0020.0020.0020.0020.00 20.00 Value 101.51 86.5970.9254.4637.1919.05 0.00 Economic Deprec ($) 14.9215.6716.4517.2818.14 19.05 Economic Deprec (%) 14.7015.4416.2117.0217.87 18.76 4.31 Now suppose that because of, say, technological advance, from year four onwards revenues drop dramatically. Technological advance could reduce the price of existing products by allowing similar products to be produced more cheaply or through creating preferred alternative products. In table 4.4 it is assumed that after the first three years the revenue drops from $20 to $5. In this case, more than 75 percent of the asset’s economic value has depreciated over the first three years. 46 4.32 Suppose that rates of depreciation for assets with an economic life of six years were set in line with economic depreciation for the asset with the constant revenue stream in table 4.3. Clearly, this would be appropriate for assets where revenue streams remain constant throughout their economic life. However, depreciation allowances set in the expectation of no technological innovation would tend to be too slow if technological innovation led to declining cash flows. If taxpayers know that productivity improvements are likely to lead to the assets they own having heavily reduced cash flows, this is likely to lead to an inefficiently low level of investment in such assets. Table 4.4 Asset with declining cash flows: technological advance Years 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Revenue 20.0020.0020.005.005.00 5.00 Value 66.23 49.5432.0213.629.304.76 0.00 Economic Deprec ($) 16.6917.5218.404.324.54 4.76 Economic Deprec (%) 25.2026.4627.786.526.85 7.19 4.33 Technological obsolescence may be one reason why Hulten and Wykoff’s studies find that allowing equipment to be depreciated on a straight-line basis over its economic life will tend to understate depreciation in early years. Increasing technological obsolescence may also be a reason for estimates of Hulten and Wykoff’s X for equipment having increased over time. 4.34 The examples in this chapter show that economic depreciation on assets with rapidly declining cash flows is faster than on assets with more constant cash flows. Although this provides a prima facie case for allowing faster depreciation for assets with rapidly declining cash flows, in chapter 5 we will not recommend doing so because we doubt whether moves in this direction are feasible. 47 Chapter 5 DIRECTIONS OF REFORM: STRUCTURAL ISSUES Summary • There is a prima facie case for adopting double declining balance depreciation for equipment, and straight-line depreciation for buildings and other structures. However, one concern is that this would increase depreciation deductions quite significantly for short-lived assets, and there is little data on how very short- lived assets depreciate. A second concern is that this would significantly reduce depreciation deductions on buildings and other structures, and our estimate of how these assets depreciate is not very certain. • There are grounds for finding whether data exist on second-hand sales prices for very short-lived equipment and for further study on building depreciation. • Subject to this further information, there appears to be a case for increasing the depreciation loading for shorter-lived assets and decreasing it for longer-lived assets. The aim of these suggestions is to make incentives to invest more neutral. 5.1 The earlier chapters have outlined some potential biases within the current depreciation provisions, especially the issue that minor levels of inflation can produce a bias favouring longer-lived relative to shorter-lived assets. This chapter provides some suggestions as to how the depreciation rules may be able be amended to introduce greater neutrality. 5.2 A problem in assessing the benefits of these suggestions is our lack of knowledge concerning how major the problems we have identified are in practice. For example, if there are dramatic inaccuracies in measures of average asset lives, any biases between short-lived and long-lived assets may be of minor importance. 5.3 Our view of is that the current depreciation provisions are probably not extremely distortionary, given the important real-world difficulties in measuring economic depreciation. Even so, it may be possible to reduce investment distortions further. 5.4 Our suggested amendments fall into three categories: • whether there are better ways of estimating economic depreciation in the absence of inflation; • the issue of if and how best to offset biases caused by inflation; and 48 • whether there are other amendments that would help make depreciation provisions more neutral. 5.5 Our general framework for reforming the depreciation provisions is, first, to derive the best possible estimates of how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation and, second, to analyse how depreciation loadings should be adjusted to make incentives to invest in long-lived or short-lived assets as neutral as possible. Getting better depreciation rates in the absence of inflation 5.6 In this section we put inflation to one side and ask whether there are simple and low-cost ways of improving our estimates of economic depreciation of assets. If the decline in asset values could be measured accurately and costlessly and these measures were open to verification, this work would be simple; we would simply propose allowing deductions for the fall in the market value of assets in each year. Given it is arguable that none of these factors applies in the case of most assets, the focus in the section is on feasible improvements to the current system. Two possible improvements are examined: • moving from calculating diminishing value depreciation using an assumed 13.5 percent residual value; and • whether there are improvements that can be made to calculations of average economic lives. Diminishing value depreciation and the assumed 13.5 percent residual value 5.7 As has been discussed in chapter 4, for most assets, diminishing value depreciation is calculated assuming that an asset’s value declines smoothly to 13.5 percent of its acquisition cost over its estimated economic life. An exception to this formulation applies in the case of assets which are expected to have a residual value of more than 13.5 percent of acquisition cost at the end of their useful economic lives. 28 5.8 There is no detailed justification for the current method of determining the diminishing value of an asset. Therefore we have considered whether there are alternative methods of determining diminishing value which would not be unduly costly and may better reflect the actual decline in the value of assets. In so doing we have been mindful that there may be considerable difficulties in best estimating average economic lives, especially for long- lived assets such as buildings. Buildings are currently estimated to have a 50-year economic life. Making estimates of economic lives of assets such as these involves a high degree of judgement and uncertainty. In principle, judgements might be informed by going back 100 or 150 years and finding the fraction of buildings that were available then that are still standing. 28 For example, taxis are assumed to have a residual value of 25 percent of acquisition cost at the end of four years. The general formula for the estimated diminishing value rate of depreciation is d where (1 – d) T =c where T is the estimated economic life and c is the higher of the expected residual value as a proportion of the acquisition cost and 0.135. 49 However, whether or not this will be very relevant in estimating the likely economic life of new buildings is open to question. 5.9 Standard accounting treatment would involve allowing straight-line depreciation deductions over an asset’s economic life. This would tend to be less beneficial to taxpayers than using the 13.5 percent residual value formulation. 5.10 The Hulten and Wykoff studies suggest an argument against moving back to straight-line depreciation for plant and equipment. As discussed in chapter 4, in extending their results from assets on which second-hand sales data existed to other assets, Hulten and Wykoff’s approach was to set /dXT= where X was 1.65 for equipment (later revised up to 1.86). This general formulation is used in estimating rates of economic depreciation for statistical purposes in the United States. Compared to the Hulten and Wykoff estimates, allowing straight-line depreciation over equipment’s economic life will tend to lead to a profile of deductions which is too slow to reflect economic depreciation. 5.11 We recognise that there must be considerable uncertainty about translating research on United States assets into New Zealand tax law. Also, we recognise that the estimates of X from this research have changed over time, further adding to the uncertainty issue. However, we see benefits in this approach if our goal is to come up with the best feasible approximation for how assets actually depreciate. There are few arguments to support the status quo. The Hulten and Wykoff general estimates of economic depreciation appear to have stood up well to considerable scrutiny over the last twenty- five years. Proposed treatment of equipment 5.12 If there were assets (for example, a possibility might be cars) on which good second-hand price data were readily available, this would always be the best way of estimating economic depreciation. In other cases, a pragmatic approach, given the large potential errors in measuring economic depreciation, might be to set a value of 2X= for equipment. Borrowing North American terminology, we will refer to this as double declining balance depreciation. 29 As at present, it is envisaged that taxpayers also be given the option of claiming straight-line depreciation deductions on equipment, with the lower straight-line rate aimed at generating a similar present value of depreciation deductions. Proposed treatment of structures 5.13 How best to allow for depreciation on structures is a more complex problem and involves balancing conflicting considerations. An important class of structure is residential rental housing. It might seem that the most obvious direct way of checking whether current depreciation rates are reasonable would be to use data on government valuations. We have examined 29 As noted earlier, the current rules are equivalent to double declining balance depreciation for sufficiently long-lived assets. However, for shorter-lived assets they are harsher than double declining balance depreciation would be. 50 government valuations for houses, as published between 1995 through to 2002. 30 The data reflect unweighted average valuations across the different local authorities and are presented in table 5.1 below. 5.14 Between 1995 and 2002 the average capital value of housing rose from $105,594 to $142,791, a 35.2 percent increase. Of course, it is possible that capital values might rise, even if buildings fall in value, if land is appreciating sufficiently quickly. As is discussed further in chapter 9, it is appropriate to allow a deduction for depreciation on buildings if they depreciate, even if there is an overall increase in the value of properties because of land appreciation. Table 5.1 also provides data on average values of land and improvements. Between 1995 and 2002 land rose from $32,548 to $51,021 (a 56.8 percent increase) and improvements rose from $73,046 to $91,654 (a 25.5 percent increase). Thus, even if one focuses solely on the value of improvements, government valuation data would seem to suggest that housing is appreciating, not depreciating. Moreover, the appreciation in the value of improvements appears higher than inflation. For example, the CPI rose by 12.2 percent between December 1995 and June 2002. Table 5.1 Data from Valuation New Zealand and Quotable Value 1995 1998 2000 2002 Average capital value $105,594 $121,994 $130,480 $142,791 Average value of improvements $73,046 $82,166 $86,027 $91,654 Average land value $32,548 $39,829 $44,453 $51,021 5.15 At first sight, this data would appear to provide a case against allowing any depreciation deductions for residential rental accommodation. However, there are at least two obvious qualifications. First, there may be important cyclical elements in building prices. For example, variations in supply and demand for construction could affect construction prices and the value of improvements, and this may be a partial explanation for the increased value of improvements in table 5.1. Second, and more fundamentally, there is an obvious problem arising because the government valuation data reflect average values of buildings. Even if buildings depreciate, the data may increase through time because of higher value new homes or because of extensions and capital improvements to existing homes. Nonetheless, the data provide us with concerns that current depreciation rates for rental housing may be set too high. 30 Note that publication date includes a three year spread of valuations. For example, the 1995 publication has valuation dates from 1993 to 1995. The valuation dates differ between local authorities, but are always within a three-year band. The publication dates selected reflect the three-year valuation cycle and are based on July end, with the exception of 1995, which is December year-end. 51 5.16 An alternative approach is to make use of the Hulten and Wykoff studies. A similar rounding exercise to that used for equipment might involve setting 1X= for structures and allowing structures single declining balance depreciation. However, this would, for example, lead to an asset with an economic life of 50 years receiving 2 percent as a diminishing value rate of depreciation. This is clearly less favourable from a taxpayer’s perspective than the 2 percent straight-line depreciation that would be afforded under standard accounting treatment. A reason for being cautious about moves in this direction is that the empirical estimate of X =0.91 is based on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates of the economic lives of longer-lived structures, about which there must be considerable uncertainty. Particular concerns are that BEA estimates of the economic lives of many classes of building may be measured with error and are relatively short when compared to New Zealand’s estimate of 50 years for most buildings. 31 If estimates of economic lives used to estimate X are too low, this will bias down estimates of X. Translating these results to an economy with longer estimated economic lives may lead to rates of depreciation that are too low. In our view, there would need to be a strong onus of proof to move depreciation deductions for buildings to a less advantageous treatment than straight-line over economic life. 32 5.17 In our view, the Hulten and Wykoff studies do not provide strong enough grounds for providing taxpayers with a less favourable treatment than straight-line depreciation for structures. Nor do they support the status quo, however. Currently, the 13.5 percent assumed residual value formulation comes close to allowing double declining balance depreciation for long-lived assets such as most structures. To our knowledge, unlike the case of plant and equipment, the empirical evidence does not suggest that allowing straight-line depreciation over an asset’s life would lead to an inappropriately low present value of depreciation deductions for buildings and other structures. Thus for buildings and other structures, we suggest there is a prima facie case for allowing straight-line deductions over their economic life. This would be consistent with the current tax treatment of intangible property. As at present, taxpayers investing in structures could be given the choice of a diminishing value alternative where the diminishing value rate was chosen to lead to a present value of deductions similar to that which straight-line depreciation would provide. 5.18 Most buildings currently have an estimated economic life of 50 years. This would convert to a straight-line depreciation rate of 2 percent per annum. The diminishing value equivalent rate would be approximately 3 percent. 31 For example, BEA estimates of economic lives are currently 31 years for industrial buildings, 36 years for office buildings, 40 years for commercial buildings and 48 years for religious buildings, educational buildings and hospitals. Some estimates are also longer, including 80 years for new one to four-unit residential structures and 65 years for new five or more unit structures. 32 To some extent, concerns about the accuracy of estimates of economic lives are also relevant for equipment. In our view, this is likely to be less of a problem given the much shorter economic lives that are typical of equipment. 52 5.19 Although economic depreciation rates will never be measured with precision, these rates do not appear to us to be out of line with international studies of economic depreciation for buildings. Perhaps the most well known studies of economic depreciation are by Hulten and Wykoff, 33 who estimated declining balance (a diminishing value equivalent) rates of depreciation for various building types, but excluding rental housing. Their best geometric approximations to economic depreciation were 2.02 percent for retail stores, 2.47 percent for offices, 2.73 percent for warehouses and 3.61 percent for factories. A study by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) extended the analysis to owner-occupied housing, finding a rate of economic depreciation of 1.3 percent. 34 Based on the results of empirical studies on the prices of used structures in the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has estimated economic depreciation rates which include 1.14 percent for new residential buildings with one to four-unit structures (with an 80-year economic life) 1.40 percent for new residential structures with more units (with a 65-year economic life) 35 , 3.14 percent (31-year economic life) for industrial buildings and 2.47 percent (36-year economic life) for office buildings. 5.20 It should not be thought, however, that estimates of economic depreciation rates on buildings are settled or uncontroversial. There are some higher estimates of rates of building depreciation. In a study commissioned for a consortium of real estate organisations, Deloitte and Touche estimated economic depreciation rates of between 2.10 and 4.48 percent for different classes of building. 36 For residential property the estimated depreciation rate was 3.95 percent. 37 5.21 A recent study by Gravelle, J. (2000) 38 provides an excellent survey of studies on economic depreciation for buildings, including the Deloitte and Touche study, and concludes that buildings probably depreciate at rates in excess of 2 percent, but probably less than 4 percent. 39 This conveys a good impression of the imprecisions and uncertainties involved in estimating economic depreciation. However, it implies that at least United States data would suggest that the current 4 percent diminishing value rate of depreciation on buildings may be a little high but is not very dramatically wrong. It also suggests that switching to a single declining balance formulation and allowing 2 percent as a diminishing value rate of depreciation is likely to be too harsh. It further implies that a diminishing value rate of 3 percent ends up being well within the bounds of plausible estimates of economic depreciation, although economic depreciation rates in New Zealand and the United States may differ. 33 The Measurement of Economic Depreciation Using Vintage Asset Prices: An application of the Box-Cox Power Transformation, Hulten, Charles R. and Franck C.

As is discussed later in this chapter, we do not support this direction of reform. 38 Depreciation and the Taxation of Real Estate, Gravelle, J. CRS Report to Congress (October 2000). 39 This study is cited in support of the Hulten and Wykoff estimates of building depreciation in Report to the Congress on Depreciation Recovery Periods and Methods, United States Treasury, July 2000 (page 116). 53 5.22 There would be obvious attractions in using New Zealand data, if feasible, to test the reasonableness of depreciation rates. One option that is currently being explored is to use New Zealand valuation data on a sample of properties for which no consents for structural improvements have been given. This may be a way of finding how the value of improvements has changed over time without the data being biased as a result of structural improvements to existing properties. 5.23 Any reform along the lines suggested would require a definition of assets which are structures and assets which are plant equipment. We would envisage defining structures to be buildings and structures listed in that category in current depreciation schedule and the categories of depreciable land improvements listed in Schedule 16 of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, submissions are sought on whether this would capture classes of structure which are likely to be more akin to equipment than to buildings. A particular concern would be the case of assets that are expected to depreciate rapidly throughout their economic lives, perhaps because of high levels of technological innovation. The primary data used by Hulten and Wykoff to estimate a value of 0.91X= for structures were almost totally composed of buildings. Impact of moving to proposed treatment 5.24 Table 5.2 demonstrates the impact of the suggested introduction of straight- line depreciation for structures and double declining balance for equipment (ignoring the economic loading). For structures which tend to be longer lived, both the straight-line rate and a broadly equivalent diminishing value rate are provided for assets with economic lives of 12.5 years or more. The changes would end up boosting depreciation rates for shorter-lived equipment and reducing depreciation rates for structures. 5.25 One concern with moving depreciation deductions for plant and equipment in this direction is that the biggest changes in rates of depreciation for plant and equipment would be for shorter-lived equipment with economic lives of five years or less. This is an important issue, given that the fastest rate of depreciation discovered by Hulten and Wykoff was 0.33 percent for automobiles. Under a double declining balance formulation, this converts to an economic life of six years. Thus the biggest change to depreciation would be to assets not included in the Hulten and Wykoff sample. There is no evidence from US BEA estimates that this is a problem. Moreover, a recent United States study of economic depreciation on personal computers concludes that economic depreciation is close to a 50 percent diminishing value rate, with estimates of annual price decline tightly clustered between 47 and 52 percent. 40 In New Zealand the estimated economic life of a personal computer is four years so double declining balance depreciation would convert to a 50 percent diminishing value rate. Thus allowing double declining balance depreciation would not appear excessive for these assets. However, to check on the robustness of the double declining balance approach for short-lived assets, it would be helpful to find whether any 40 W. E. Dunn, Doms, M.E., Oliner, S. D., and Sichel, D. E., 2004, “How Fast Do Personal Computers Depreciate? Concepts and New Estimates”, NBER Working Paper 10521, May. 54 further data are available on second-hand sales prices of these shorter-lived assets.

However, this approach is likely to overstate economic depreciation for assets with substantial residual value. Currently, equipment with an estimated residual value of more than 13.5 percent can be depreciated at a diminishing value rate, which leads to book value being equal to the estimated residual value at the end of the economic life. The current method of calculating depreciation for such assets may be most appropriate in these cases. 5.27 The acid test of whether moves in the direction outlined here are likely to be welfare enhancing is whether they lead to better estimates of economic depreciation. Officials welcome submissions on this issue. Improvements to measures of economic lives 5.28 Subject to concerns about the out-of-sample problem with short-lived plant and equipment and whether there are useful New Zealand data that would allow a check on the revised depreciation rates for buildings, switching to allowing double declining balance depreciation on plant and equipment and straight-line depreciation for buildings and other structures is likely to improve the neutrality of investment decisions, provided current estimates of 55 economic lives are not too bad. There is always a danger, however, that inaccuracies in measuring economic lives may be a much more important issue than the way in which depreciation deductions are calculated, once estimated economic life has been determined. 5.29 There may be general concerns about estimates of economic lives. We are not interested in submissions on the accuracy of estimated economic lives for different forms of equipment. These can be contested and ruled on by Inland Revenue Adjudication and Rulings. We are, however, interested in finding whether there appear to be generic problems. Officials welcome submissions on this issue. 5.30 If there were widespread concerns that estimates of economic lives were dramatically wrong, one possibility might be to use studies in different countries of estimates of economic lives, perhaps those used in Australia for tax purposes (which are aimed at reflecting economic life) and those used for statistical purposes in other countries, including the United States. If there appears to be a consistent bias in our rules compared to those of other countries, there may be a case for modifying current estimates of economic lives either down or up. Getting better depreciation rates with inflation 5.31 We have suggested the adoption of straight-line depreciation and double declining balance depreciation rates be introduced for structures and equipment respectively to ensure that, in the absence of inflation, depreciation deductions mirror, as far as possible, how assets actually depreciate. As discussed in earlier chapters, however, the combination of inflation and historical cost depreciation creates a bias favouring longer-lived assets relative to shorter-lived assets. We now consider how the bias caused by inflation can be reduced. 5.32 We have identified a number of ways the impact of inflation can be reduced: • Eliminate the 20 percent depreciation loading and comprehensively index the income base. The 1989 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital examined this approach but rejected it on the grounds of excessive complexity. Officials agree with this analysis. • Eliminate the 20 percent depreciation loading while inflation-indexing depreciation deductions and allow a deduction for inflationary gains on trading stock but leave nominal interest income taxable and deductible. This would have the attraction of removing any bias between shorter-lived and longer-lived assets. However, partially indexing the income tax system would itself introduce considerable distortions. One disadvantage is that this would increase the effective subsidy to investment in depreciable assets for unincorporated enterprise and for companies owned by domestic residents. Indexation might also involve a substantial increase in complexity. Officials do not advocate a move in this direction. 56 • Eliminate the 20 percent depreciation loading and set historical cost depreciation schedules in a way which provides a present value of deductions equal to those that would be provided under real economic depreciation. Moves in this direction (albeit starting from a different point, where the present value of depreciation deductions for equipment exceeds the present value of deductions that would be allowed under real economic depreciation) have been considered in the United States. 41 Because of concerns about increasing investment subsidies, we would also not support this measure. • Eliminate the 20 percent depreciation loading and consistently allow deductions for only the nominal component of economic depreciation. If inflation were 2 percent per annum and an asset had an economic depreciation rate of 10 percent, this would involve allowing a depreciation deduction of only 8 percent. Again, this would remove biases between shorter-lived and longer-lived assets. Instead of the costs of capital depicted in table 4.2, costs of capital would all be 5.0 percent. This would achieve neutrality domestically but, without other changes, would increase taxes on foreign equity-financed investment. We also do not support this measure. 5.33 One possible line of argument would be that, given other uncertainties, especially the major uncertainty about how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, the biases caused by inflation are not too large. It could be argued that if inflation is of big enough concern to do something about, the tax system should be comprehensively indexed for inflation. Otherwise inflation should be ignored. In this case, an argument could be advanced that the 20 percent loading should be scrapped, although this would lead to an increase in taxes on foreign equity investment. 5.34 We have seen that while having the disadvantage of increasing subsidies to investment financed by unincorporated enterprises and New Zealand-owned firms, the 20 percent depreciation loading does have the benefit of reducing the spread of costs of capital across different forms of investment. Therefore an intermediate option, and one supported by officials, may be to modify the depreciation loadings by increasing them for shorter-lived assets and decreasing them for longer-lived assets. Moves in this direction would appear to have the potential to improve neutrality. 5.35 A key problem with any moves in this direction is that the best rates will depend sensitively on the assumed rate of inflation, assumed tax rates (including taxes on foreign equity investment) and the assumed real interest rate. 41 See, for example, US Department of Treasury, Report to the Congress on Depreciation Recovery Periods and Methods, July 2000, or Deloitte and Touche, 2000, ibid. 57 Possible modification to the depreciation loading 5.36 We accept that there is some bias favouring longer-lived assets which could be eliminated only by taxing real economic income, nominal economic income or completely removing inflation. However, the variable loading ensures that at target rates of inflation, biases between different forms of short-lived assets are smaller than with either no loading or with a 20 percent across the board loading. 5.37 Our goal is to adjust these rates in a way which does not increase overall tax rates on capital income. 5.38 We have identified two options for achieving our aim of reducing investment biases at an assumed inflation rate of 2 percent per annum. We think this inflation assumption is reasonable as this is the mid-point of the Reserve Bank’s inflation target range. 42 Our analysis also assumes that investors are taxed at the top personal marginal tax rate of 39 percent and that the real interest rate is 5 percent per annum. 5.39 To set the scene, we start by considering the effects of a system with no loadings. The “no loading” line in figure 5.1 examines the costs of capital in this context. It is a graphical presentation of table 4.1, although drawn for a different set of rates of economic depreciation. In drawing this graph, it is assumed that the double declining balance depreciation for equipment and the diminishing value equivalent of straight-line depreciation for buildings would mirror rates of economic depreciation in the absence of inflation. 5.40 The analysis should be interpreted with some caution. Costs of capital have been calculated on the assumption that economic depreciation has been accurately measured and incorporated into the diminishing value depreciation rate. Difficulties in measuring economic depreciation mean that costs of capital will be considerably more variable in practice than these tables would suggest. As discussed previously, a system with no loadings leads to higher costs of capital for assets with higher rates of economic depreciation, as reflected in figure 5.1. 5.41 The figure also shows costs of capital with a 20 percent depreciation loading. As was discussed in chapter 4, at 2 percent inflation the loading tends to reduce biases between long and short-lived investments. 42 In principle, a better index of inflation would be the capital goods price index rather than the CPI. The implicit assumption is that, in the long run, both indices will increase at similar rates. Over the 14 years from December 1989 to December 2003 the CPI grew by an average of 2.03 percent per annum and the capital goods price index by 1.53 percent per annum. If this trend continues into the future, allowing for expected CPI inflation would overstate the relevant inflation rate. 58 Figure 5.1: Cost of capital with and without economic loading and possible variable economic loadings 5.42 To further reduce investment biases, rates of depreciation loading could be adjusted, with shorter-lived assets receiving higher rates of loading and longer-lived assets receiving lower rates of loading. There are many possible ways of structuring such variable loadings. Choices between these options would, to some extent, be determined by estimates of fiscal costs, taking account of the costs of other measures such as getting better estimates of economic depreciation. Two such options are: • Option A: A variable rate of loading which is aimed at making costs of capital for shorter-lived assets as close as possible to (without being significantly lower than) those of assets with a 3 percent diminishing value economic rate of depreciation. • Option B: Is similar to option A but sets the costs of capital for shorter- lived asset as close as possible to a 4 percent diminishing value economic rate of depreciation. 3.5% 3.7% 3.9% 4.1% 4.3% 4.5% 4.7% 4.9% 5.1% 0.67 0.50 0.400.30 0.25 0.200.160.130.100.080.060.040.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 no loading 20% loading Option A (table 5.3) Option B (table 5.3) economic depreciation 59 Table 5.3 Rates of economic loading under options A and B Diminishing Value Rate Economic Loading Option A Economic Loading Option B 100% - - 67% 35% 30% 50% 35% 30% 40% 35% 30% 30% 35% 30% 25% 35% 25% 20% 30% 25% 16% 30% 25% 13% 30% 20% 10% 25% 20% 8% 25% 20% 6% 20% 10% 4% 10% - 3% - - 2% - - 1% - - 0% - - 5.43 The effects of these two options are shown in table 5.3. 43 Under either option no loading is calculated for two-year equipment which would qualify for a 100 percent depreciation deduction as it is not altogether clear how a loading could be applied to assets with a 100 percent diminishing value depreciation rate. 44 5.44 Submissions are sought on whether there is merit in moving to a declining economic loading as discussed here. 43 It is straightforward to extend to include other options, such as a higher cost option of provide a loading to keep costs of capital as close as possible to those of an asset with a 2 percent diminishing value rate of depreciation or a lower cost option of maintaining the 20 percent loading for shorter-lived assets and reducing the loading for longer-lived assets. 44 In principle, it would seem desirable to extend some tax benefit to these assets in lieu of a depreciation loading to maintain neutrality. One simple option might be to allow expensing for these assets. 60 Incorporation of assumption of inflation into tax rules 5.45 Relative to no loading or to a uniform 20 percent loading, these measures appears to make investment decisions more neutral if inflation is within the Reserve Bank’s target range of 1 to 3 percent. These results also appear to be robust to reasonable alternative assumptions about the marginal rate of taxation. 5.46 An unattractive feature of the reforms is that they would be aimed at offsetting a predicted average rate of future inflation. If inflation rates change in the future, the reforms could be much less attractive. Indeed, if inflation were eliminated, the reforms would end up introducing tax biases. However, the Reserve Bank currently has the mandate of keeping inflation in the 1 to 3 percent range and, at these rates of inflation, investment decisions would appear to be more neutral. Figure 5.2 shows costs of capital under inflation rates of 0, 1, 2 and 3 percent per annum. 5.47 Note it is not envisaged that loadings would be changed from year to year as inflation rates change. To do so would be likely to be complex and add considerable uncertainty to the system. This means that some biases are likely to remain. There would be a case for reconsidering loadings, however, if it there were any change in the Reserve Bank’s target range for inflation. Figure 5.2: Demonstration of impact of varied rates of inflation on option A 3.0% 3.5% 4.0% 4.5% 5.0% 5.5% 0.670.500.400.300.250.200.160.130.100.080.060.040.030.020.010.00 Return zero 1% 2% 3% Inflation rates Economic depreciation rates 61 5.48 Figure 5.2 shows that for an inflation rate of 2 percent, the option A variable loading does a reasonable job in equalising rates of return on investment in assets with different depreciation rates. At an inflation rate of 3 percent, however, the variable loading is not as effective, reflected in the steeper rate of decline as asset lives increase. Correspondingly, if there were no inflation, the loading would clearly benefit short-lived assets over long-lived assets. Other issues Asset depreciation bands 5.49 At present, there is a set of 14 depreciation bands. The number of bands involves a compromise between simplicity and neutrality. A problem with depreciation bands is that close to a point of switching from one band to another there may be a significant bias between assets with very similar economic lives which fall into different bands. Increasing the number of depreciation bands reduces this problem but at the cost of greater complexity. 5.50 Submissions are sought on whether there should be more or fewer depreciation bands. Second-hand assets, used imported motorcars and buildings (if relevant) bands 5.51 Currently, second-hand assets, used imported motorcars and buildings do not qualify for any depreciation loading. 5.52 If the goal of depreciation provisions is to make investment decisions as neutral as possible, it seems difficult to justify why there should be a lower rate of depreciation for second-hand than for new assets. In the absence of a loading for second-hand assets, there would appear to be an artificial tax bias discouraging firms from acquiring second-hand assets when these can be the most sensible assets to acquire. Thus there would appear to be a prima facie case for extending any loading to second-hand assets. Of course, providing loadings for second-hand assets would add to the fiscal cost of the loadings and, for a given revenue cost, reduce the loadings that could be paid. 5.53 Similar issues arise in the case of used imported motorcars. As depreciation loadings are aimed at creating as neutral as possible an environment for investment, it is difficult to see why any particular assets should be excluded except if assets already benefit from concessional depreciation rates. Identical issues would arise in the case of buildings as well if they were estimated to depreciate sufficiently quickly to qualify for a loading. 5.54 Submissions are sought on whether there are any good policy reasons for excluding second-hand assets, used imported motorcars or buildings (if relevant) from depreciation loadings. 62 Any other methods of better measuring economic depreciation 5.55 Submissions are sought on any other practical measures to better help depreciation provisions to mirror economic depreciation. For example, we have discussed in chapter 4 the way in which two assets with the same economic life need not have the same profile of economic depreciation. A severe practical problem is that estimating an average economic life in order to provide a basis for calculating economic depreciation seems to be a difficult task in itself. Refining this measure for the way in which cash flows on individual assets decline seems impossible. 5.56 International studies suggest that allowing double declining balance may be a more accurate way of measuring depreciation than, say, allowing straight- line depreciation for equipment. This is in large part because cash flows may decline rapidly for a number of reasons, including rapid technological improvement. Although recognising that this may accelerate depreciation deductions relative to economic depreciation for some assets and decelerate depreciation deductions for others, this may have to be accepted as one of the unavoidable difficulties of attempting to levy an income tax. Submissions We invite submissions on these issues. In particular, we would like to receive submissions on: • introducing double declining balance depreciation for plant and equipment and straight-line depreciation for buildings and other structures; • the best ways of checking on the double declining balance approximation for shorter-lived plant and equipment; • the best way of using New Zealand data to check the appropriateness of allowing straight-line depreciation or a diminishing value equivalent for buildings and other structures; • how the suggested rules should address assets with substantial residual values; • whether there are major generic problems with current estimates of economic lives; • introducing an increased loading for shorter-lived assets matched with a lower loading on longer-lived assets; • narrowing the depreciation rate bands into which assets are classified; • extending the economic loading to second-hand goods, buildings and other structures and used imported motorcars; and • any other method of calculating depreciation more accurately. 63 Part 3 Specific issues This part of the issues paper considers more detailed aspects of the current rules and possible improvements to those rules. Issues are examined in the context of the current tax depreciation rules, including, for example, the way in which depreciation rates are set. Accordingly, the current rules relating to the assumed 13.5 percent residual value for economic depreciation rates may remove some of the difficulties discussed in this part. The issues considered in Part 3 are those that have been raised with officials by taxpayers or their representatives since the depreciation review was announced by the government, in early 2003. Part 3 also considers the tax treatment of rental housing. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 outline the various submissions received, our comments in relation to the concerns raised and, where applicable, suggested changes to the tax depreciation rules to address concerns and further improve the operability of the rules. It is our intention to report to the government on those measures we consider should be progressed (and are supported in feedback received on this issues paper) later this year. Chapter 9 considers various aspects of the tax treatment of rental housing including depreciation (in the context of breaking buildings into smaller depreciable assets). Chapter 10 outlines a number of depreciation issues that are being considered as part of other proposals. 64 65 Chapter 6 SUGGESTED TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE TAX DEPRECIATION RULES Summary • The rules in relation to claiming deductions for certain expenditure incurred in preventing or combating pollution should be clarified by giving an amortisation deduction for these expenditures. • A deduction should be allowed for site restoration expenditure in the year that this expenditure is incurred, with businesses allowed to match the cost of site restoration against income previously generated from their business operations. • When a patent is granted, any depreciation from the time that the patent is given legal effect (when the complete application is lodged) up to the date of grant, should be allowed in the first income year in which depreciation can be claimed. • Changes should be made to the special tax depreciation rate rules to: – relax the threshold on the Commissioner for considering special tax depreciation rate applications by replacing the need for the Commissioner to be “absolutely” certain about the actual economic life of an asset with a requirement for the Commissioner to be only “reasonably” certain, before a special rate can be issued; – clarify that the Commissioner may have regard to a broader range of factors than just the rate of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes, when considering an application for a special tax depreciation rate; – widen the Commissioner’s ability to prescribe special tax depreciation rates using a method other than the diminishing value formula in the legislation, if such a method is more appropriate; – extend the six-month time bar on the Commissioner to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rate applications; and – extend the special tax depreciation rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property, such as patents, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the actual economic life of the property will be less than its legal life. • Plant variety rights (granted under the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987) should be added to Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act as depreciable intangible property (with the right to use plant variety rights also included in Schedule 17 as a clarification). 66 • The definition of “depreciable intangible property” should be clarified so that it is clear that property listed on Schedule 17 can be depreciated without having further regard to whether that property can, for example, be used for tax avoidance purposes. • Deductions for losses on destruction of buildings as a result of natural disasters (such as the February 2004 storms, earthquake and fire) should be allowed. The issue of losses on disposal of buildings more generally (including voluntary destruction) raises a number of avoidance concerns. • It should be noted that a loss incurred on the destruction of a “temporary building” is deductible for tax purposes and that the Income Tax Act 2004 clarifies this. 6.1 This chapter examines issues for which we consider change is feasible and may be warranted (thereby providing useful technical improvements to the tax depreciation rules). Chapter 7 discusses issues about which we require further information before we can make recommendations. Chapter 8 analyses issues which we do not consider warrant changes to the rules. 6.2 Although we have tried to address a number of technical issues relating to the tax depreciation rules, we recognise that the list of issues we have so far considered is not exhaustive. Consequently, we welcome submissions on other issues or problems that taxpayers face with the tax depreciation rules and any suggestions for improving them. Expenditure incurred in preventing, combating or rectifying pollution 6.3 It has been submitted that a number of issues arise in relation to the ability to claim deductions in respect of certain expenditure incurred in preventing, combating and rectifying pollution. Background 6.4 Business taxpayers may claim a tax deduction for expenditure to prevent or combat pollution of the environment in three ways: 45 • under section BD 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 for normal operating (revenue) expenditure; • under the depreciation rules for certain types of capital expenditure, such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumping machinery and screens; and • under section DJ 10. 45 The review of environmental costs focuses on the treatment of these costs generally and does not consider industry-specific provisions (such as for the primary sector, mineral and petroleum mining). 67 6.5 Section DJ 10 allows business taxpayers to claim a deduction for the cost of constructing on land in New Zealand any earthworks, ponds, settling tanks or other similar improvements primarily for the purpose of treating industrial waste in order to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. 6.6 If a deduction is available, it must be spread evenly over five years, beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred (that is, a deduction for 20% in each year beginning with the year the expenditure was incurred), although amounts less than $1,000 can be deducted in full. 6.7 Section DJ 10 and its forerunners (section 124 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and section 113E of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954) were introduced by the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1972 in response to a recommendation from the 1970 Physical Environmental Conference. 6.8 The speech notes and papers accompanying the Amendment Act indicate that the section was introduced to permit business taxpayers a deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of treating industrial waste if no other allowance might otherwise be possible. 6.9 Despite the existence of a specific section to provide for deductions of this nature, certain costs incurred in preventing or combating pollution are not currently deductible. There is uncertainty as to the scope of the tax deduction permitted, as the legislation refers to expenditure incurred primarily for the purpose of treating “industrial waste” (not defined). Furthermore, section DJ 10 allows a deduction only for capital expenditure incurred in constructing earthworks or similar improvements. 6.10 It appears that no deduction is available for dealing with non-industrial waste or for expenditure which does not give rise to an identifiable land improvement. This is illogical and results in the incorrect calculation and taxation of income from business activities and has led to taxpayer submissions calling for a change to the legislation. We are therefore currently undertaking work on clarifying the scope of tax deductibility of expenditure to prevent or combat pollution of the environment. 6.11 A separate submission has also been received on the related issue of restoration costs (reconstructing or returning a site to its original state). The tax treatment of restoration costs is also uncertain, which makes it difficult to correctly measure cessation costs. We are therefore also considering issues relating to the deductibility of costs incurred at cessation of business (such as those in relation to site restoration). Comment Expenditure to prevent or combat pollution 6.12 To clarify the scope of deductions available for expenditure incurred to prevent or combat pollution, we are considering revised tax rules for these costs. 68 6.13 Our preferred approach would be for pollution prevention assets to be included within the depreciation rules in order to bring environmental expenditure in line with the treatment of capital expenditure generally. However, for a number of practical reasons, 46 a depreciation approach is not feasible. Instead, officials are likely to recommend the following revised treatment of expenditure incurred to prevent or combat pollution: • section BD 2 deduction for normal operating (revenue) expenditure; • depreciation deduction for depreciable assets; and • amortisation deduction under a revised section DJ 10 for other capital expenditure incurred in preventing or combating pollution, with no distinction made between treating industrial and other forms of waste. We will need to consider further the appropriate categories of expenditure and amortisation rates. Restoration expenditure 6.14 As part of revising section DJ 10, a deduction would be allowed for capital site restoration expenditure. This reflects the legal and moral obligations imposed on businesses to rectify pollution and ensures that business income is not overstated for tax purposes. However, even when site restoration expenditure is deductible (revenue deduction, depreciation or section DJ 10) this is of little use when incurred after a company has ceased business. At cessation of business, a taxpayer may incur expenditure related to deriving past income but have no current income against which to offset that expenditure. 47 In such a situation, no benefit is obtained for the resulting loss, even though the taxpayer may have paid significant amounts of tax in the past. Under existing law, there is no ability to match this expenditure against income derived while carrying on the business. 6.15 Our view is that businesses should be allowed to match the costs of site restoration against income generated from their past business operations, and we are considering what would be an appropriate mechanism for achieving this. 6.16 Matching income and deductions could be achieved by allowing a tax deduction for accounting rehabilitation provisions. However, allowing a deduction for an estimate of restoration costs would be open to manipulation and would contradict the established taxation treatment of provisions for other costs. 46 For example, there are difficulties in classification, calculating estimated useful life and treatment on disposal. The amortisation provisions are driven off categories of expenditure, so asset classification is not an issue. There is also no claw-back or loss on disposal, so issues regarding valuation on disposal are avoided. 47 In relation to the closure of a business, there is an issue as to whether post-business cessation expenditure is necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business and, accordingly, whether that expenditure is deductible. The courts have considered this issue and established the general principle that expenditure incurred post-cessation will be deductible to the extent that the expenditure is sufficiently proximate to a company’s pre-cessation, ordinary business activity. Refer to the decisions in: Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s Ltd) v FCT (1935) 54 CLR 295, AGC (Advances) Ltd v FCT 75 ATC 4057, FCT v Riverside Road Pty Ltd (In Liqtn) (1990) 23 FCR 305, Placer Pacific Management Pty Ltd v FCT 95 ATC 4,459, and C of T v Brown (1999) FCA 721. As part of resolving the matching issue for restoration costs, thought will be given to clarifying the tax deductibility of costs incurred on cessation which relate to prior business activity. 69 6.17 Jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom deal with this issue by allowing businesses to calculate a terminal loss on cessation of trade. The terminal loss may then be offset against earlier profits of that entity. The introduction of a loss carry back is not supported by officials because it is inconsistent with the general structure of New Zealand tax legislation and would create significant operational problems for both taxpayers and the Inland Revenue. For example, tax returns would have to be amended and reassessed. Instead, thought is being given to two other options which would provide a mechanism for matching expenditure incurred at cessation of business against income derived from business operations. Establishment of a restoration fund 48 6.18 Under this option, a taxpayer would be able to establish a restoration fund with Inland Revenue. While the business is operating (and pollution resulting from its operations) a cash deposit could be made into the fund. This would be similar to establishing an accounting provision for site restoration but would give rise to a deduction for tax purposes equivalent to the gross amount of the deposit. 49 Inland Revenue would enter the deposit into a restoration fund account with the Reserve Bank in the name of the taxpayer. At cessation of business, the taxpayer would request a refund from the restoration fund which would give rise to taxable income at the gross amount of the refund. 50 However, any income would be offset by a tax deduction for restoration expenditure incurred by the taxpayer. Formulaic loss offset 6.19 As an alternative to the restoration fund, we are also considering a proposal to permit taxpayers to claim a refund for the lesser of: • the tax effect of restoration costs incurred; and • tax paid in a specified number of earlier periods. 6.20 The refund would relate to the year the restoration costs were incurred and, as such, would not require re-filing and reassessment of earlier tax returns. 6.21 Each of these options has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the restoration fund more accurately mirrors the accounting treatment, and allows matching over a longer period, while the formulaic loss rule gives a better result when there are unexpected levels of restoration costs. 48 A number of practical issues will need to be considered if either of the matching options is to be progressed further – such as links with restoration provisions maintained for accounting purposes, implications of a change in continuity, impact on taxpayers' imputation credit accounts and how and whether interest would apply. 49 For example, if the deposit is $33, the tax deduction would be $100. 50 For example, if the refund is $33, gross income for the taxpayer will be $100. 70 Suggested changes 6.22 We suggest that the rules in relation to claiming deductions for certain expenditure incurred in preventing, combating and rectifying pollution be clarified by giving an amortisation deduction for capital expenditure incurred in preventing, combating or rectifying pollution. We also suggest allowing a deduction for site restoration expenditure in the year that this expenditure is incurred, with businesses allowed to match the cost of site restoration against income previously generated from their business operations. 6.23 This work is primarily being progressed by way of targeted consultation with those directly affected by the narrow scope of section DJ 10 and those with significant site restoration costs. However, we would welcome submissions from other taxpayers on the proposed changes. When depreciation can begin for patents 6.24 It has been submitted that patents should be depreciable from the time a patent application is lodged, as the delay between lodging an application and the eventual grant of the patent can be several years. Background 6.25 Under current tax law, depreciation deductions in respect of patents are allowed from the date a patent is granted. Concerns have been raised that this “date of grant” approach has no regard to the date from which legal protection applies (the date when a complete patent application is lodged) or the time at which the underlying invention was used or was available for use. 6.26 It is worth noting, however, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers that the correct interpretation of the current rules is that the term of depreciation (legal life of twenty years) be reduced by the time taken for the patent to be granted (from lodgement date to grant date). This would result in higher depreciation deductions throughout the life of the patent (starting from the date of grant), than if full legal life was used. Comment 6.27 In our view, the correct start date for depreciation in respect of a patent is when it is granted, as this is when the asset (the legal protection over the rights to benefit from the underlying invention) comes into existence. Allowing patents to be depreciated starting from the time a patent application is lodged would effectively recognise the benefits conferred by a patent, for tax purposes, before the asset comes into existence. (For example, there is a risk that the patent may not be granted.) 71 6.28 The depreciation rules should, however, recognise that once a patent is granted, legal protection applies from the date a complete specification of the invention was lodged. Consequently, a portion of the depreciable life of a patent will have been expended in the period the patent is pending. Although, from a policy perspective, we consider that depreciation should start from the date a patent is granted, we recommend that the first depreciation deduction include any depreciation relating to the period from when the application was lodged to the time the patent is granted. Suggested change 6.29 We suggest that when a patent is granted, taxpayers be able to claim any depreciation from the time that the patent is given legal effect (that is, when the complete application is lodged) up to the date of grant, in the first income year in which depreciation is allowed. When economic life is linked to an income-earning process or constrained by other factors (“tied assets”) 6.30 It has been submitted that when the economic life of an asset is inextricably linked to the life of an income-earning process that is significantly shorter than the estimated useful life of the asset, for tax purposes, this should be better reflected in the tax depreciation rules. Background 6.31 Concerns have been raised that when the usefulness of an asset is tied to an income-earning process or business, the length of which is significantly shorter than the asset’s estimated useful life for tax purposes, application of the tax depreciation rules will result in an incorrect depreciation rate being applied. This is because the rate allowed will reflect a longer economic life than is actually the case. An example is plant and machinery employed in mining activities, when the estimated useful lives of these assets, for tax purposes, may be significantly higher than the duration of these activities (and when the activity is completed these assets, arguably, have no residual value). 6.32 These assets are typically referred to as “tied” assets. Typically, a deduction for the remaining tax-book value will arise if a tied asset can no longer be used. However, this creates problems if, for example, there is insufficient income against which to apply the resulting deduction. Also, in respect of assets such as buildings, no loss on disposal will arise. 72 Comment 6.33 Taxpayers with so called tied assets can apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax depreciation rate if the estimated useful life underlying the economic depreciation rate for an asset does not mirror its actual economic life. An instance where a special tax depreciation rate may be applicable is if a taxpayer will cease to be in business after a particular date, and the relevant asset cannot be salvaged for use by another taxpayer. 6.34 A key requirement when applying for a special tax depreciation rate is, however, that taxpayers be able to provide sufficient information to the Commissioner in support of an application. This includes identifying the actual economic life of an asset with a very high degree of certainty. Although a depreciation rate for financial reporting purposing may assist in this, if the actual economic life of an asset cannot be clearly ascertained, a special tax depreciation rate will generally not be allowed. This has implications for tied assets employed in certain activities, such as mining, where the date of cessation of the activity is unlikely to be known with any great degree of certainty. Here, at any given time, only an estimation of (remaining) economic life can be made. 6.35 When taxpayers apply for a special tax depreciation rate, the requirement on the Commissioner to have a very high degree of certainty in relation to when an asset will cease to be useful should be relaxed. For example, we are interested in exploring approaches that would lower the current threshold on the Commissioner to be “absolutely” certain about economic life when considering special tax depreciation rate applications. One option is to lower this threshold to require the Commissioner to be only “reasonably” certain about the actual economic life of a depreciable asset, before a special tax depreciation rate can be prescribed. 6.36 The difficulty that arises is defining what is “reasonably” certain. The definition of “reasonably” certain could include, for example, an assessment of economic life based on data and other best estimates available at the time of a special tax depreciation rate application. In effect, a reasonableness test would take into account a range of factors such as the size of the business and the value of the asset. We would welcome feedback on the criteria that should be considered when considering the validity of a taxpayer’s special tax depreciation rate application. 6.37 A relaxation of the rules would, however, need to be supplemented by measures to prevent taxpayers misusing special tax depreciation rates. Although a current provision, section EG 10(6) of the Income Tax Act, provides for revocation of special tax depreciation rate determinations, we consider these rules should be extended. Taxpayers would need to inform the Commissioner when the circumstances underlying a special tax depreciation rate have changed. Failure to notify the Commissioner or providing false information should result in application of penalties. 73 Suggested change 6.38 We are interested in options to relax the threshold on the Commissioner for considering special tax depreciation rate applications – for example, replacing the need for the Commissioner to be “absolutely” certain about the actual economic life of an asset with a requirement for the assessment to be only “reasonably” certain, before a special rate can be issued. A lower threshold would need to be buttressed by rules to prevent misuse of the special tax depreciation rate mechanism. The special tax depreciation rate rules 6.39 A number of technical problems also arise in relation to the special tax depreciation rate rules, which can make it difficult for the Commissioner to make special tax depreciation rate determinations in certain circumstances. We consider that a number of improvements can be made to these rules. Background 6.40 Section EG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 contains the rules in relation to applications by taxpayers for special tax depreciation rates. The factors the Commissioner is required to have regard to include the legislative formula for calculating economic depreciation, and the rate of depreciation adopted for financial reporting purposes. The Commissioner can decline a special tax depreciation rate application if, generally: • the rate calculated under the application would not differ significantly from the general Commissioner-prescribed economic depreciation rate; or • the general economic depreciation rate is already under review by the Commissioner and the new general economic rate will be equal to or greater than the rate calculated under the application; or • insufficient information has been supplied to the Commissioner to calculate the appropriate rate. 6.41 A special tax depreciation rate issued by the Commissioner can be revoked if the circumstances that applied at the time the determination was issued no longer exist or have materially changed. Comment 6.42 The first issue is the requirement under section EG 10(2) of the Income Tax Act for the Commissioner to have regard to the rate of depreciation (if any) adopted by a taxpayer for financial reporting purposes, along with the statutory depreciation rate formula (in section EG 4(3)). This creates difficulties if the rate adopted for financial reporting purposes is, for example, a straight-line rate, as the statutory depreciation formula is based on the diminishing value methodology. Consequently, when applying section EG 10(2) in respect of a special tax depreciation rate application, it is unclear 74 whether the Commissioner must have regard only to the rate used by the taxpayer, when it may also be appropriate to consider the taxpayer’s assessment of economic life, residual value and the method of depreciation. 6.43 We suggest that the special tax depreciation rate rules be clarified so that the Commissioner is able to have regard to the taxpayer’s assessment of economic life, residual value and method of depreciation. Any clarification should include the ability to set a residual value of less than 13.5 percent (the current minimum in the legislative formula) if so warranted. A discussion on the relevance of (and problems with) the 13.5 percent residual value is provided in an earlier chapter. 6.44 Furthermore, the special tax depreciation rate provisions do not seem to provide a clear legislative authority for taxpayers to be allowed depreciation methods other than diminishing value, for tax purposes. If a taxpayer applies to the Commissioner to adopt for tax purposes the straight-line depreciation rate that is used for financial reporting purposes, under the special tax depreciation rules that will generally not be allowed. This is because the straight-line depreciation rate used for financial reporting purposes is likely to be calculated in a different way from that calculated for tax purposes. For tax purposes, the rate is based on a diminishing value formula, with the aforementioned 13.5 percent residual value. An “equivalent” straight-line depreciation rate is then calculated. For accounting purposes, the straight- line depreciation rate may incorporate different parameters (for example, a 0 percent residual value), resulting in the financial reporting straight-line rate differing from that for tax purposes. 6.45 These problems become even more pronounced when the depreciation method adopted for financial reporting purposes is neither diminishing value nor straight-line. An example is the “unit of production” depreciation methodology which determines depreciation based on the “...number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset or the enterprise”. 51 6.46 There is scope for looking at widening the powers of the Commissioner to prescribe special tax depreciation rates that are not calculated having regard to the legislated diminishing value formula, if another depreciation method would provide a more economically correct result and can be applied with a “reasonable” degree of certainty. 6.47 Finally, a problem arises in relation to the six-month time limit that is imposed on the Commissioner for issuing a special (or a provisional tax depreciation rate for that matter) under section EG 14(1). Under that provision, the Commissioner must either issue the rate sought or notify the taxpayer of the decision not to issue a determination within the specified period. 51 The decline in economic value is calculated per unit of use or production. The “unit of production” methodology has application in industries such as mining. 75 6.48 Owing to the potentially complex nature of some special and provisional tax depreciation rate determinations, however – such as the need to source accurate information about estimated useful lives and the time taken to consult with applicants on their applications – this six-month deadline can be breached. This can theoretically result in a special or provisional tax depreciation rate application being declined, not because the application is deficient but, rather, the time available to the Commissioner to consider it has expired. In practice, Inland Revenue attempts to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rate applications outside this period, if a taxpayer agrees to this. The issue that arises is whether determinations issued after the six-month time limit are supported in legislation. 6.49 We consider that the law should be clarified and greater flexibility should be allowed to the Commissioner to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rates outside the six-month time bar, if it is apparent that the deadline will be breached and the applicant agrees to such an extension. Suggested changes 6.50 We suggest changes to the special tax depreciation rate rules to clarify that the Commissioner may have regard to a broader range of factors than just the rate of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes, when considering an application for a special tax depreciation rate. We also suggest that consideration be given to widening the Commissioner’s power to prescribe special tax depreciation rates using a method other than the legislated diminishing value formula, if such a method is more appropriate. Consideration should also be given to extending the six-month time bar on the Commissioner to consider special and provisional tax depreciation rate applications. Economic life of patents and other fixed-life intangible property 6.51 It has been submitted that the twenty-year depreciation period for patents has no regard to real economic life, which is effectively the commercial life of the underlying invention (including the technological obsolescence of the invention) and the period within which competitors can develop alternatives to work around the patent. Submissions have commented that patents should be allowed to be depreciated over the economic life of the underlying invention, not the legal life of the patent. Background 6.52 Although patents have a maximum legal life of twenty years, they must be renewed at the end of the fourth, seventh, tenth and thirteenth years for legal protection to be ongoing. A taxpayer can choose, by not renewing a patent, to cease use of the patent. For tax purposes, a deemed disposal will typically arise, allowing any non-depreciated capitalised costs then to be written off. 76 Comment 6.53 Although taxpayers may cease use of a patent before the cessation of its potential legal life, the length of time over which legal protection is available is the most easily accessible proxy for the economic life of patents (and most other types of depreciable intangible property). This is because the actual economic lives of most intangible property are often quite difficult to ascertain with any degree of certainty. If taxpayers were to use the commercial life of the underlying invention – for example, as a proxy for the economic life of a patent, significant verification issues would arise. 6.54 It may be possible, however, to extend the use of the special tax depreciation rate rules to patents, and other fixed-life intangible property, if a taxpayer can show that the economic life of the patent (or the other property) will be less than its legal life. This would enable taxpayers to depreciate fixed-life intangible property over a period which more closely reflects the true economic life of that property, if the Commissioner is satisfied that economic life is sufficiently different to legal life. 6.55 At present, section EG 10(1) of the Income Tax Act prohibits the Commissioner from prescribing a special tax depreciation rate in respect of fixed life intangible property. This approach has been due to concerns about the ability to abuse the tax depreciation rules in respect of assets that cannot easily be valued. We consider that these concerns are largely still valid. Consequently, any extension of the special tax depreciation rules in respect of patents and other fixed-life intangible property would require the Commissioner to be satisfied, with a high degree of certainty, that the actual economic lives of the property in question were sufficiently different from their legal lives. Owing to the nature of the property involved, we do not think it is unreasonable for the Commissioner to meet a “high” certainty threshold before a special tax depreciation rate is allowed (rather than the suggested “reasonable” certainty threshold in the case of depreciable property such as plant and machinery). This could include, for example, requiring taxpayers to explicitly link, say, a patent to the economic life of the underlying invention or process. We are interested in submissions on how this could be achieved. 6.56 We have also considered whether it is possible to allow specific tax depreciation rules for patents (and other fixed-life intangible property), similar to those allowed for the copyright in a sound recording. A copyright in a sound recording can be depreciated from the time it might reasonably be expected to be first useful in deriving gross income to the year in which it is reasonably expected that 90 percent of all the income from the copyright will be derived – calculated at one year. This depreciation treatment was determined after extensive consultation with valuers and asset owners, and it may be possible to do a similar quantitative exercise in relation to other fixed-life intangible property. The concern we have with using this type of method to prescribe a general depreciation rate in respect of, for example, patents (other than the scope and cost of such an exercise) is that such an analysis may not necessarily result in an accurate measure of economic life because the results may vary significantly, depending on the type of patent 77 (which will depend on the underlying invention). Consequently, we do not prefer such an option. Suggested change 6.57 We suggest that consideration be given to extending the special tax depreciation rules to apply to fixed-life intangible property, including patents, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the actual economic life of the property will be less than its legal life. Plant variety rights included as depreciable intangible property 6.58 It has been submitted that plant variety rights should be added to the list of depreciable intangible property (in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act), with the property being depreciable over the commercial life of the underlying plant variety. Background 6.59 A grant of plant variety rights under the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 gives the holder the exclusive right to produce for sale and to sell propagating material of the plant variety for a period of twenty or twenty-three years (depending on the plant material). Comment 6.60 The criteria for inclusion as depreciable intangible property includes having “...a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition” and “if made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes”. 52 We consider that plant variety rights meet these criteria, as useful life can be equated with legal life – a period of approximately twenty or twenty-three years – and the process that must be followed for a grant of plant variety rights is reasonably robust (set in statute). Plant variety rights should therefore be added to Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act. 6.61 Although it has been submitted that plant variety rights should be depreciable over the commercial life of the underlying plant variety, it would be difficult to align useful life for tax purposes with the commercial viability of a plant variety (for the same reasons that it is difficult to do so in the case of a patent, which is very similar in nature to plant variety rights). Consequently, as a starting point, we consider plant variety rights should be depreciated over their legal life – twenty or twenty-three years, depending on the plant variety – on a straight-line basis. This is consistent with the treatment of fixed-life intangible property (including patents). However, if included as depreciable intangible property in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act, the suggested change to extend the special tax depreciation rate rules to fixed-life intangible property should apply equally in the case of plant variety rights. 52 Refer definition of “depreciable intangible property” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 78 6.62 In terms of expenditure that should be capitalised and depreciated, we consider that costs incurred in registering plant variety rights, acquiring outright interests in plant variety rights, licensing the right to use plant variety rights, and protecting or enhancing plant variety rights would qualify. We note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we would like further information on the types of expenditure that may be associated with plant variety rights applications and, where possible, the likely quantum of such expenditure. 6.63 As a further clarification, we consider that the right to use plant variety rights should also be added to the list of depreciable intangible property in Schedule 17. Suggested changes 6.64 We suggest that plant variety rights (granted under the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987) be added to Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act as depreciable intangible property, with depreciation over legal life. As a further clarification, the right to use plant variety rights should also be included in Schedule 17. Clarifying the definition of “depreciable intangible property” 6.65 We consider that the definition of “depreciable intangible property” should be clarified. Background 6.66 Section EG 1 of the Income Tax Act allows a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by a taxpayer in an income year. Depreciable property does not include intangible property unless that property is depreciable intangible property. Section OB 1 defines depreciable intangible property to be: “...property of a type listed in schedule 17, which schedule describes intangible property that has- (a) A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (b) If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes:” 79 Comment 6.67 The issue that arises is in relation to the definition of depreciable intangible property (above), and the wording following the reference to Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act \[in italics\]. It is unclear whether the wording is a preamble to Schedule 17 or has legislative force – that is, whether in addition to being an intangible asset listed on Schedule 17, it must have a finite useful life, and more importantly, a low risk of being used for tax avoidance purposes, before depreciation can be claimed. 6.68 A clarification is necessary to ensure that the relevant wording is interpreted simply as an introduction to Schedule 17 – that is, a description of the characteristics of the property included in Schedule 17 – and therefore carries no legislative weight. 53 This is because the policy intention is for Schedule 17 to list exhaustively the types of intangible property that are depreciable and if listed, such property should be depreciable, without further consideration being having to be paid to whether, for example, the property can be used for tax avoidance purposes. Suggested change 6.69 We suggest that the definition of “depreciable intangible property” be clarified so that it is clear that property listed on Schedule 17 can be depreciated without having further regard to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition. Deductibility of losses on disposal of buildings and other structures 6.70 There is merit in looking at allowing a deduction for losses on disposition of buildings. Background 6.71 Under section EG 19(3) of the Income Tax Act, deductions for losses on disposal of buildings are not allowed. Similarly, section EG 12(1) does not allow a deduction for the remaining tax-book value of a building, if the building is no longer used (and the cost of disposition would exceed any consideration derived). The government is, however, considering whether losses in relation to buildings used to derive gross income that are damaged in natural disasters should be deductible, in response to the damage caused by the storms in February of this year. 53 There would be significant compliance costs associated with the use of Schedule 17 if taxpayers were required to come to a conclusion on whether depreciable intangible property listed on it also met paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition. 80 Comment 6.72 At first glance, there would seem to be an asymmetry in the current depreciation rules for buildings. When buildings are sold for more than their written-down tax-book value (as for other assets) excess depreciation is clawed back on sale. However, differently from other assets, if buildings are sold or otherwise disposed of for less than their written-down tax-book value, the loss is not deductible. 6.73 In 1992 the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) reviewed the depreciation treatment to be applied to business assets. It concluded that it could see no justification for discriminatory treatment between different types of depreciable property, and that all depreciable property should be treated in an identical manner on disposal. It recommended that losses on disposal of buildings should be deductible in the same way as losses on disposal of other assets, a recommendation not supported by the government at that time. 6.74 We agree that there is a prima facie case for allowing a general deduction for losses on disposition of assets. However, there is an important balancing consideration. If buildings are sold for more than their original purchase price, while depreciation is clawed back (so the difference between the acquisition cost and the written-down tax-book value is taxed), no tax is normally levied on the difference between the disposition proceeds and the acquisition cost (because New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax). Although buildings may normally be expected to depreciate over time, rates of depreciation are typically low. On the other hand, the value of land improvements (including buildings) is normally calculated as the difference between the overall value of a property and unimproved value of the land. As the overall value of a property and the unimproved value of land are both subject to fluctuations, the value of improvements can be quite variable. If gains are not taxed when buildings appreciate, there is an argument for not allowing deductions for losses on sale. Although similar issues can arise for other assets, this is likely to be a particularly important problem for buildings because of their low depreciation rates and the way that the value of improvements is calculated. 6.75 This issue is different, however, in the case of buildings that are destroyed. In principle, there would be strong grounds for a general deduction for losses when buildings are destroyed. Buildings can be destroyed either voluntarily (for example, to build a superior building) or involuntarily because of catastrophic events (such as the recent floods). In the case of voluntary demolition, there is, however, a potential concern. It is often difficult to be certain exactly how much of the acquisition cost of a property is attributable to the building and how much is attributable to the land. If losses for voluntary destruction were deductible, there would appear to be scope for taxpayers to acquire buildings shortly before they were due to be destroyed in order to obtain a tax deduction on disposal. Taxpayers might also be able to attribute a substantial proportion of the value of the property to the buildings to create an artificial loss, which might be difficult to police. 81 6.76 Neither of these issues appears relevant, however, in the case of properties that are destroyed because of natural disasters (such as floods, earthquakes and bushfires). This is because the scope to manipulate the rules is unlikely to be significant in such circumstances. 6.77 The list of circumstances could also be widened to include losses arising from the requirement to destroy a building by a local or a public authority (such as the reclamation of land for public works purposes – such as the construction of new roads). 6.78 In the case of losses on voluntary destruction of buildings, the greatest scope for manipulation appears to arise when an asset outside the tax base is sold to a business shortly prior to its destruction. 6.79 A solution may be to limit losses more generally to buildings that have predominantly been inside the tax base – such as buildings used in a taxpayer’s income-earning process. There are, however, a number of problems with this, particularly in relation to asset definition – for example, the boundary between “business” and “non-business” buildings is difficult to define and enforce. We invite submissions on how such a boundary could be defined and maintained. 6.80 Limiting deductibility to losses on destruction of buildings also creates a tension in relation to other forms of “disposal”, namely the sale of buildings for consideration below their tax-book value. If losses on voluntary destruction of buildings are allowed but losses on sale are not, this could result in a “lock-in” effect in favour of a particular type of disposition, which would be inefficient. Consideration, therefore, needs to be given to the issue of the wider tax treatment of losses on disposal of buildings. However, the tax avoidance concerns that arise in relation to allowing losses on voluntary destruction of buildings would arise equally (if not more so) if losses on sale of buildings were allowed. These concerns would have to be balanced against the potential improvements to the efficiency of the tax depreciation rules. We have identified no solution which we consider achieves our efficiency goals at acceptable revenue risk. 6.81 Any change to extend deductibility on destruction of disposal of buildings could also extend to involuntary destruction of farming land improvements. Suggested change 6.82 Although we consider that deductions for losses on destruction of buildings should be allowed if the destruction is involuntary (e.g. the result of a natural disaster), the issue of allowing deductibility for losses on voluntary destruction of buildings and losses on disposal more generally (for example, on sale) is more difficult as there is substantial scope for manipulation of the rules. We invite submissions on potential solutions. 82 Deductibility of losses on disposal of temporary buildings 6.83 It has been submitted that clarification is needed that a loss on the disposal of a “temporary building” is deductible for tax purposes. Background 6.84 A “temporary building” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act as any building which has been erected: • under a permit issued by a local or public authority which is subject to demolition or removal on instruction by a local or public authority; or • at a construction site and is to be demolished or removed on or before completion of the construction; or • which was erected and is used for the purpose of housing plant or machinery and would have to be demolished in removing or replacing the machinery. 6.85 Section EG 19(3) states that when depreciable property is disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration that is less than its depreciated value (for tax purposes), the difference is allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer. The exception to this rule is if the depreciable property is a building. On the other hand, section DD 1(1)(c) states that no deduction is allowed for any loss incurred on the demolition or destruction of any premises, other than a temporary building. Comment 6.86 The policy intention is for losses on the disposal of a “temporary building” to be deductible, if the building is destroyed. This has been clarified in the re- written Income Tax Act 2004, in section DB 14 of that Act, which states that: “A person is allowed a deduction for a loss that they incur through the destruction of a temporary building.” 6.87 The Income Tax Act 2004 applies from the 2005-06 income year and, consequently, we do not consider an urgent change to existing legislation is necessary. Suggested change 6.88 It should be noted that a loss incurred on the destruction of a “temporary building” is deductible for tax purposes and that the Income Tax Act 2004 clarifies this point. 83 Chapter 7 ISSUES ABOUT WHICH MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED Summary • Although in principle, asset disposal costs should be fully deductible, greater information is required on what these costs are and in what circumstances they may arise, to assist in more fully considering the implications of such a change. • A higher threshold ($2,000) for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” and a higher total threshold ($20,000) for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets purchased at the same time from the same supplier does not seem justified as the fiscal cost is likely to exceed any compliance cost savings. To be able to deal with the matter, however, we request further information on this issue, including the write-off thresholds adopted for financial reporting purposes. Deductibility of asset disposal costs 7.1 It has been submitted that when a depreciable asset is disposed of and the consideration derived is less than the costs incurred in disposing of the asset, any excess expenditure should be deductible for tax purposes. Background 7.2 A deduction for asset disposal costs is allowed under the definition of “consideration” in section EG 19(10) of the Income Tax Act. Under paragraph (b) of that definition, the amount of any consideration derived is reduced by the amount of any asset disposal costs. This effectively means that a deduction for disposal costs is allowed to the extent these costs reduce consideration, and this reduction gives rise to a loss on disposal (under section EG 19(3)). 54 7.3 What is unclear is whether asset disposal costs in excess of the consideration derived (thereby resulting in a negative figure for consideration) are allowed as a deduction – that is, whether the legislation supports the concept of “negative consideration”. Under this concept if, for example, no net consideration is derived on the disposal of an asset because significant disposal costs are incurred, a loss on disposal (amounting to the remaining tax-book value of the asset plus any excess disposal costs) would nevertheless arise. 55 54 Or a reduction in any claw-back of depreciation (under section EG 19(2)). 55 For example, an asset has been depreciated to a tax-book value of $30,000. The asset is disposed of for a (gross) consideration of $20,000, but the cost of disposing of the asset is $25,000. Under section EG 19(10), it is unclear whether a deduction is allowed for $30,000 (the disposal costs reducing consideration to $0, hence a loss on disposal of $30,000) or $35,000 (the disposal costs resulting in “negative consideration” of $5,000 and consequently a loss on disposal of $35,000). 84 Comment 7.4 The potential non-deductibility of certain asset disposal costs can result in harsh outcomes when significant disposal costs arise in respect of depreciable assets. In some cases disposal in a particular manner is a prescribed condition of the right to use or right to construct a particular asset – for example, if the use and subsequent disposal of an asset has implications under the Resource Management Act 1991. Here, taxpayers may effectively be “locked into” incurring these costs. We therefore agree in principle that these costs should be deductible in full. 7.5 To assist us, however, in fully considering the implications of allowing full deductibility for asset disposal costs (including the fiscal cost) we would like further information on these costs, including specific examples, and the instances in which they may arise. Process for further consideration 7.6 We request further information on asset disposal costs, including what these costs are and in what circumstances they may arise, to help us to consider this issue more fully. Higher threshold for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets 7.7 It has been submitted that the thresholds for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets should be raised, from the current level of $200 to $2,000, with a total threshold of $20,000 for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets purchased at the same time from the same supplier (currently $200 as well). Background 7.8 Under section EG 16 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the cost of assets acquired for $200 or less can be immediately deducted, provided principally that the assets are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies (unless the total cost is $200 or less). The thresholds are there to minimise the compliance costs associated with depreciating large numbers of “low-value” assets when there is little gain in accuracy in income measurement between depreciation and expensing. Comment 7.9 The issue of raising the “low-value” asset thresholds was considered by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in 1998. The committee concluded that although the benefit of raising the threshold for immediately expensing “low-value” assets would be a reduction in compliance costs, it had to be weighed against other factors, including the resulting economic distortions and the fiscal implications for government. In relation to the former, the committee recognised that raising the threshold would accelerate 85 deductions for a bigger set of assets, relative to those assets for which immediate deductibility was not allowed. More importantly, it considered that the revenue costs of such a measure, although transitional, would be significant, especially upfront. 56 Further, an increase in the “low-value” asset threshold could increase the possibility that the rules could be abused. Finally, the committee considered that the pool method of depreciation could be used for assets valued between $200 and $2,000, thereby resulting in simpler depreciation rules. For these reasons, and because “...taking into account the revenue cost, it was not clear that the compliance cost savings would be equally significant”, the committee did not recommend increasing the $200 threshold for immediately expensing “low-value” assets. 7.10 In relation to assets purchased at the same time from the same supplier, the committee considered that the $200 threshold imposed compliance costs that were out of proportion to the cost of items purchased by taxpayers. For example, if items valued below the $200 individual “low-asset” threshold are bought in bulk from the same supplier, the resulting purchase is required to be capitalised and depreciated. However, if the items are purchased not in bulk but in a number of separate transactions, each item is immediately deductible. This imposes compliance costs because taxpayers have to make related purchases of property under $200 in value in multiple transactions (or over multiple days) to avoid the application of the depreciation rules. Therefore the committee recommended raising the threshold (to $500) subject to the reduction in compliance costs mirroring the revenue cost. The committee did not consider that the revenue cost of raising the threshold for immediately expensing items bought from the same supplier at the same time could be accurately quantified without a wide-ranging survey of taxpayers and purchased assets. However, if the revenue cost for increasing to $500 the $200 “low-value” asset threshold is indicative (see footnote), the cost of any change in this area is unlikely to be insignificant. Consequently, we consider it unlikely that the revenue costs of such a change would be offset by the compliance cost benefits. Even so, we invite further submissions on this issue, particularly in relation to the thresholds adopted by taxpayers for immediately expensing the cost of assets for financial reporting purposes. Other information that would be useful includes information on the types of assets likely to be purchased by taxpayers at the same time and from the same supplier, the costs involved, and the compliance benefits from expensing versus, say, using the pool method of depreciation. Process for further consideration 7.11 Although we do not suggest a change to the thresholds for immediately deducting the cost of “low-value” assets, owing to the potential revenue costs involved, we invite further submissions on this issue. 56 Advice provided by officials, at the time, on a $500 threshold for “low-value” assets suggested a revenue cost of $115 million in the first year of such a change, $405 million in the second year, and $117 million in the third year. 86 Chapter 8 CHANGES WE DO NOT AGREE WITH Summary • Taxpayers should not be allowed to use depreciation rates used for financial reporting purposes for tax purposes. The Commissioner is already required to have regard to depreciation rates used by taxpayers for financial reporting purposes, both when setting general economic depreciation rates and special tax depreciation rates. • The requirement that land held by a dealer in land be treated as being held on revenue account for a period of ten years from the date of acquisition should not be amended to allow depreciation on buildings and other fixtures constructed on the land. We do not consider that workable rules to achieve this can be devised without providing significant scope for manipulation of those rules, although we invite feedback on this issue and any solutions that may be workable. • No clarification is required in respect of the rules governing depreciation previously allowed in relation to depreciable assets that change over to being held on revenue account. The tax depreciation rules trigger a deemed disposal at market value. • No clarification is necessary in relation to the process for selecting a tax depreciation rate that most reasonably reflects an asset’s economic life, as the current tax depreciation rules already provide a number of steps for selecting the most appropriate depreciation rate in respect of an asset, having regard to factors such as use in different industries. • There is no material difference between the “economic life” of an asset and its “estimated useful life”, for tax purposes, as the latter requires the Commissioner to take into account the factors that are relevant in the calculation of economic life. Therefore no change is recommended. Use of financial reporting depreciation rates for tax purposes 8.1 It has been submitted that greater reliance should be placed on allowing taxpayers to use financial reporting depreciation policy for tax purposes, if it is appropriate. For example, estimated useful life adopted for accounting purposes, when it conforms to financial reporting standards and law (such as Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles, or GAAP) and is applied consistently from year to year, with specific anti-avoidance measures to bolster this approach, if necessary. 87 Background 8.2 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, when determining economic depreciation rates for different assets, is required to consider rates adopted in respect of those assets, for financial reporting depreciation purposes. Administratively, economic depreciation rates are typically set by the Commissioner after consultation with affected taxpayers and independent valuers. This is designed to ensure that the resulting economic depreciation rate for an asset is at least broadly comparable to financial reporting depreciation rates. 8.3 There are, however, certain material differences in the way economic depreciation rates are calculated by Inland Revenue, namely the use of a 13.5 percent residual value. Consequently, depreciation rates for tax purposes are unlikely to perfectly match accounting depreciation rates. The validity of the 13.5 percent residual value assumption and alternative economic depreciation methodologies are discussed in earlier chapters. Comment 8.4 Our concern about allowing blanket alignment of tax depreciation rates with financial reporting depreciation rates is the potential for accounting policy to drive tax outcomes. This raises issues in relation to the accounting treatments that are acceptable and the treatment of taxpayers who are not required to follow prescribed financial reporting standards. Although taxpayers applying financial standards, such as GAAP, are required to have regard to the substance of transactions rather than the form, if there is no requirement (or incentive) to comply there may be opportunities to use accounting policies for tax avoidance purposes. This is particularly a concern in relation to many small taxpayers as they will not be subject to financial reporting standards. Consequently, there is a risk that they may overestimate the depreciation rate on assets, as there will be no constraints against them doing so. Although it may be possible, as suggested, to design specific anti-avoidance rules to mitigate such activity, this would simply add complexity to the rules. 8.5 More importantly, we consider that the current tax depreciation rules have appropriate mechanisms to deal with instances where taxpayers have concerns with depreciation rates prescribed by the Commissioner being significantly different to those used for accounting purposes. As noted earlier, if a depreciation rate thus prescribed does not accurately reflect actual economic life, taxpayers can apply for a special tax depreciation rate. The special tax depreciation rules in section EG 10(2) of the Income Tax Act require the Commissioner to have regard to the depreciation rate used for financial reporting purposes. The suggested changes to broaden the factors that the Commissioner must have regard to when considering an application for a special tax depreciation rate should further increase the incidence of tax depreciation rates not being significantly divergent from the accounting treatment. The suggested changes to broaden the applicability of special tax depreciation rates should also encourage greater use of these rules if there are 88 genuine discrepancies between, for example, actual economic life and estimated useful life for tax purposes. Conclusion 8.6 We suggest that there be no change to the Commissioner’s prescription of general economic depreciation rates. The Commissioner is required to consider depreciation rates used by taxpayers for financial reporting purposes, both when setting general economic depreciation rates and special tax depreciation rates. The latter provides a robust mechanism for taxpayers to challenge depreciation rates prescribed by Inland Revenue. The proposals discussed earlier to provide greater flexibility in the application of the special tax depreciation rules should also improve the overall operability of the tax depreciation rules. Depreciation of buildings (and other fixtures) on land held by a dealer in land 8.7 It has been submitted that when land is not acquired with the purpose or intention of resale, depreciable assets constructed on the land should be depreciable from the day the assets are available for use. If a taxpayer is a dealer in land (for example, a property developer) any land acquired is generally deemed to be held on revenue account for a period of ten years, even if acquired with no purpose or intention of resale. It has been submitted that buildings and fixtures constructed on the land cannot, therefore, be depreciated until this period has lapsed. Background 8.8 Section CD 1(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 treats as gross income any amount derived from the sale of land if a taxpayer is in the business of dealing in land and the land is sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within ten years after the date on which the taxpayer acquired it. 8.9 Section CD 1(3) provides an exemption from section CD 1(2)(b) to the extent that the land comprises “... premises acquired and occupied by a taxpayer primarily and principally as premises from which substantial business is carried on by the taxpayer” or is used by the taxpayer “...primarily and principally as a residence” (subject to certain other conditions). Comment 8.10 When land and buildings are being used as premises for carrying on a business, even if a taxpayer is a dealer in land, the land is generally not treated as being held on revenue account. Consequently, depreciation can be claimed in respect of buildings and other fixtures constructed on the land. 89 8.11 When land (caught by section CD 1(2)(b)) is not acquired for the purposes listed in section CD 1(3), any buildings or other fixtures constructed on the land will arguably not be depreciable. This is because the land (inclusive of the buildings and fixtures) will be revenue account property, 57 and proceeds from the sale of revenue account property are gross income, for tax purposes, with a deduction allowed for the cost of the property. Here, cost would include the cost of constructing the buildings and fixtures and is allowed as a deduction under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or (ii) of the Income Tax Act. Paragraph (b)(vi) of the definition of “depreciable property” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act specifically excludes property whose cost is allowed as a deduction under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or (ii). 8.12 We have considered whether the correct treatment for revenue account property is for such property to be depreciable. Arguably, no depreciation deduction should be allowed in relation to revenue account property that is acquired and held solely for resale. This is because a deduction for the cost of the property will be allocated to the year of sale under section EF 2 of the Income Tax Act and, therefore, allowing depreciation would result in a mismatch with income derived from the sale of the property. 8.13 There may be instances, however, when an asset may be owned by a taxpayer who is subject to tax on its sale because the selling of the property is an integral part of their business, but the property is used until sale to produce income – that is, buildings subject to section CD 1(2)(b). For example, if a building is revenue account property under section CD 1(2)(b)(ii) but is used as a rental property, arguably, a deduction for depreciation should be allowed. This is because the asset will result in income from two sources: income derived on sale and the rental activity. The matching concept would indicate that some part of the expenditure on the asset should be allowed against the income earned from the property while it is held. 8.14 An option is to allow depreciation in respect of an asset if it is revenue account property as defined in the Income Tax Act and is used or available for use in deriving gross income other than the proceeds of sale with a deduction for the cost of the asset 58 deferred until the asset is disposed of. However, we have concerns about applying such a solution to buildings when the owner is a dealer in land. 57 “Revenue account property” is defined in section OB 1 as “...property which is trading stock of the person or otherwise property in respect of which any amount derived on disposition would be gross income”. 58 Reduced for any depreciation allowed. 90 8.15 The ten-year rule in section CD 1(2)(b)(ii) is designed to remove the uncertainty and the risks associated with determining intention in relation to transactions involving land when one of the parties to the transaction is a dealer in land. We are not confident that the option above would be effective in differentiating between land purchased for resale and land purchased for other purposes, without creating significant opportunities for tax avoidance. By extension, we are not confident that a workable rule could be designed to allow depreciation in respect of buildings and fixtures on land not held for resale without providing opportunities for taxpayers to abuse the rule in respect of assets constructed on land that is held for resale. Even so, we invite feedback on this issue and the form of any other such solutions and how they would deal with tax avoidance concerns. Conclusion 8.16 We do not consider that the current requirement that any land held by a dealer in land be treated as being held on revenue account for a period of ten years from the date of acquisition should be amended. We invite feedback, however, on this issue and any workable solutions that would address our principal concern. Treatment of property that changes use 8.17 It has also been submitted that when buildings move from capital account to revenue account, as a consequence of, for example, land subdivisions and the buildings have been depreciated before the move, the treatment of the depreciation correctly claimed by the taxpayer before the transfer is uncertain. Background and comment 8.18 Under section EG 19, a deemed disposal arises when any depreciable property changes use in a year, 59 including moving between capital and revenue account. Section EG 19(7) treats the property as having been disposed of for a consideration equal to its market value if the disposal is triggered by a change in use. Consequently, depending on whether market value is less than (or greater than) the tax-book value, a loss on disposal (or a claw-back of depreciation allowed) will arise. In the case of buildings, although depreciation may be clawed back, no loss on disposal will arise. Conclusion 8.19 We do not consider that a clarification is required as the depreciation rules trigger a deemed disposal at market value when property moves between capital and revenue account. 59 See paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “disposal” in section EG 19(9). 91 Depreciation rates under the industry and asset categories 8.20 It has been submitted that it is not clear whether taxpayers are intended to have a choice between default depreciation rates in the asset and industry categories if particular assets are not specifically provided for in either, yet broadly fit within both. It has been submitted that the depreciation rules should be clarified to confirm that taxpayers are able to choose the depreciation rate that most reasonably reflects economic life. Background 8.21 The asset and industry categories were introduced as part of the 1993 review of the tax depreciation rules – as determination DEP 1. The steps shown in figure 8.1 should be followed to find the most suitable depreciation rate in respect of an asset. Figure 8.1: Process for finding the most suitable depreciation rate \* Not the default rate for the industry or asset category Industry category available Rate available for asset\* Use rate Asset category available Rate available for asset\* Use rate Asset listed in alphabetical listing Use rate - if multiple listings use rate for closest industry Asset category available Industry category available Apply for provisional rate Use default rate for relevant asset class Use default rate for relevant industry No No No No No YesYes YesYes Yes Yes Yes No No 92 8.22 Depreciation rates for assets under the industry category are determined having regard to industry-specific use and, consequently, should generally be used only by taxpayers in the relevant industry. 60 When an asset is used in more than one industry, and not all the relevant industries are represented in the industry category, a general depreciation rate for the asset is also determined under the asset category. Depreciation rates under the asset category are set having regard to the potentially different uses of an asset in different industries. 8.23 The default rates under the asset and industry categories are an average of all assets in the relevant asset class (in the case of default asset category depreciation rates) and the relevant industry (in the case of default industry category depreciation rates). These rates should be used only if a rate for a specific asset under either the industry or asset categories is not available. Comment 8.24 The process for selecting a tax depreciation rate is a step-by-step one, as illustrated in figure 8.1. The process is designed to ensure that taxpayers choose the most suitable rate. 8.25 For taxpayers in a particular industry, use of industry category depreciation rates (if available) should most accurately reflect the economic lives of the assets used in that industry. A depreciation rate under the asset category should, therefore, be used only if a depreciation rate for an asset under the relevant industry category is not available. It is worth noting that taxpayers can also apply for a special tax depreciation rate if a rate is available under the industry or asset categories but is substantially higher (or lower) than that used by a taxpayer for financial reporting purposes, for example. 8.26 If neither an industry nor general asset category depreciation rate is available in respect of a particular asset, consideration should be given to using the default rate under the relevant asset or industry category, although taxpayers can also apply for a provisional tax depreciation rate in these circumstances. If so, the default rate under the relevant asset category should be used in the first instance because the assets listed in each asset category are likely to be more similar than assets in the industry categories. Conclusion 8.27 We consider that the current tax depreciation rules already provide a number of steps for selecting the most suitable depreciation rate in respect of an asset, having regard to factors such as use in different industries. 60 An exception to this rule applies in the case of step three – that is, the asset is listed in the alphabetical listing. To the extent the relevant industry is not available a taxpayer should use the rate for the next closest industry. 93 Difference between estimated useful life and economic life 8.28 It has been submitted that economic depreciation rates are set having regard to an asset’s “estimated useful life”, which is different from economic life. An asset’s economic life will be lower than its useful life, owing to, for example, known technological advancements. Background 8.29 The Commissioner is required to have regard to the estimated useful life of an asset when calculating a basic economic depreciation rate for that asset (under section EG 4(3) of the Income Tax Act). “Estimated useful life” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act as “...the period over which \[depreciable\] property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand, having regard to such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance”. Comment 8.30 The legislative definition of “estimated useful life” is consistent with the concept of “economic life”, if economic life is defined as the period over which an asset will generate economic income for its owners. Over time, the economic income generated should fall as a result of loss of physical productivity as well as technological obsolescence. This should also be reflected in a falling market value for the asset. The definition of estimated useful life, in the tax rules, requires the Commissioner to consider these factors. Consequently, we do not consider there to be a material difference between “economic life” and “estimated useful life”. 8.31 Part 2 of the issues paper looks more broadly at the concept of economic depreciation and evaluates whether the current framework can be improved. One of the concerns raised in that section is whether there are generic problems with the estimation of “economic life” under the current tax depreciation rules. Conclusion 8.32 We consider that there should be no material difference between the “economic life” of an asset and its “estimated useful life”, for tax purposes, as the latter requires the Commissioner to take into account a number of factors that are relevant in the calculation of economic life. 94 Chapter 9 TAX TREATMENT OF RENTAL HOUSING Summary • There is some uncertainty as to the extent to which different parts of a building – such as the electrical wiring, plumbing and internal walls – can be split out and depreciated separately. This can lead to considerable variation in the tax liabilities of two different taxpayers with otherwise identical properties but who take different approaches to splitting out building components. This issue is of particular concern with respect to residential rental properties. • We suggest allowing owners of residential rental property two options. The first, which would have higher compliance costs, would allow splitting out for a certain group of separately identifiable assets but would require structural components such as wiring, plumbing and internal walls to be depreciated as part of the building. The second would be to depreciate all building assets as part of the building, but allow greater scope to deduct replacements as repairs and maintenance. 9.1 New Zealanders have approximately $19 billion invested in rental property. We have looked at the tax treatment of rental property because of frequently expressed concerns that the tax rules might encourage over-investment in housing, which might, in turn, lower the overall quality of investment decisions and lower national income. 9.2 It is important to note that the scope of the review includes only buildings used to derive rental income. The review does not consider the tax treatment or otherwise of owner-occupied housing. The government has a clear view that owner-occupied housing should remain outside the tax base. 9.3 As discussed in chapter 1, our goal is to ensure that effective tax rates are as even-handed and consistent across different forms of investment as possible. Any tax reforms ought not to be inconsistent or ad hoc when compared to the general tax system. Our starting position, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, is that the tax rules for rental housing should be consistent with the rules for rental of other buildings, the rules for business occupying their own building and the rules applying to other longer-lived assets. 95 Background 9.4 Buildings used to derive gross income are taxed under rules similar to those relating to other business assets. Owners of these buildings are liable for income tax on income (rental income) and are able to claim deductions for expenses incurred in deriving that income. 9.5 Research completed in 2002 on the net worth of New Zealand households 61 identifies the percentage of the population that own assets and the proportion of total asset value for a range of asset categories. Table 9.1 summarises the findings. 62 Table 9.1 Asset composition of economic units Asset type Population with asset (%) Total value (million $) Proportion of total asset value (%) Median ($) Maori assets 3 8,790 2 15,000 Trusts 4 28,709 6 216,000 Farms 4 38,257 9 350,000 Businesses 12 38,574 9 43,000 House, living in 48 159,205 36 160,000 Time share 1 137 0 8,000 Holiday home 2 4,361 1 80,000 Rental property 6 18,887 4 135,000 Overseas property 1 4,194 1 40,000 Commercial property 2 7,343 2 150,000 Other property 4 9,863 2 95,000 Superannuation 21 24,737 6 25,000 Life insurance 14 8,797 2 15,000 Credit cards (positive balance) 3 95 0 500 Bank deposits (including bonus bonds) 91 26,000 6 2,300 Shares 21 13,986 3 5,000 Managed funds 9 11,864 3 23,900 Other financial assets 5 5,792 1 30,000 Money owed to respondent 8 3,835 1 5,000 Motor vehicles 77 16,871 4 8,000 Cash 3 191 0 1,600 Collectibles 25 6,857 2 5,000 Other assets 44 6,685 2 3,000 Total value 444,030 125,300 61 The Net Worth of New Zealanders, Retirement Commissioner and Statistics New Zealand, 2002. 62 Note that there may be some understatements of housing and rental investments owing to the use of trusts and companies for ownership purposes. 96 9.6 Figure 9.1 shows the numbers of taxpayers returning rental income between 1991 and 2002. Over the period, taxpayer numbers increased about 150 percent (or 95,000). The fact that more New Zealanders are now investing in rental properties increases the need for the tax rules for rental property to be broadly correct. Figure 9.1: Number of taxpayers returning rental income 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Incom e tax ye ar Number of IR3 returns 9.7 If the amount of deductions exceeds the amount of rental income, as can frequently occur, the resulting tax losses can normally be used to reduce income from other sources. Rental income trends for the period 1991 to 2002 are shown in figure 9.2. Net rental income reduced between 1994 and 1999, as the amount of negative income from rental property investments increased. Net rental income was negative in both 1999 and 2001. However, in 2002 and 2003 it appears that the trend for annual net rental revenue may have turned positive. Net rental income for 2002 was +$137 million, and the provisional estimate for 2003 is +$190 million.

Typical deductions for buildings include depreciation, repairs and maintenance, rates, interest costs from any associated borrowing and insurance. As noted earlier, there has been a significant increase in total deductions, relative to rental income, since 1994. Non tax-factors that influence housing investment decisions 9.9 Tax is only one consideration that influences decisions to invest in residential housing. A range of possible non-tax factors encouraging investment in rental housing includes: • In nominal terms, residential property generally increases in value, giving a profit on sale. • Property is perceived to have less downside risk than many other investments, which also makes it easier, and generally cheaper, to borrow against. • A lack of confidence in other forms of investment, such as equity markets and managed funds, encourages direct investment in housing. • Property investors may feel a sense of involvement in the investment and are able to generate tax-free gains from personal effort, such as do- it-yourself renovations. • Many people are more knowledgeable about property than other possible investments. • Lifestyle trends – the move to apartment living, for example, may have widened the choice of small, easily manageable rental properties. • Specific factors such as migration patterns may lead to changing traditions about renting versus buying property. 9.10 Recent research indicates that the long-run economic determinants of house prices are changes to the size of the housing stock, changes in user cost of capital (and so nominal interest rates, inflation rates and tax rates) and changes in regional economic activity. 63 Table 9.2 indicates some of the trends influencing these determinants. 63 What drives the housing market in New Zealand? Motu Economic & Public Policy Research, 2003. 98 Table 9.2 Trends influencing house prices 64 Demand Supply In the year ended February 2004, about 30,000 more people arrived in New Zealand than left. Thousands of short-term foreign students come to study in New Zealand each year (one estimate for 2003 is 80,000\]. There has been a long-standing drift of New Zealanders north and into towns. Social changes are seeing the average number of people per house reduce. Lifestyle changes are increasing demand for new kinds of accommodation, such as inner city apartments and coastal and lakeside properties. Unusually low interest rates and expectations on future interest rate movements may cause debt-to-income ratios to rise. There have been anecdotes regarding capital gains from the sale of housing assets, investment seminars offering advice on how to maximise the returns on investment in property and television programmes enthusing over the housing market. There was an approximate 20 percent increase in the number of people receiving net income from rental investments between 1998 and 2001. 65 Strong household income growth – for the year to June 2003 the average household income had increased by five percent. Residential investment is expanding the housing stock rapidly, 66 but demand continues to outstrip supply. A lower than normal level of house building in 2001 has compounded the supply problem. Many builders, in Auckland particularly, were caught up with building apartments to fill the need created by foreign students and others, reducing the pool of workers available to build other housing. New regulations applying to the building industry will probably tighten supply. Our analysis of investment in rental housing 9.11 Achieving efficiency of investment involves more than simply ensuring that legal arrangements for investors do not explicitly discriminate in favour of residential rental properties. Consistency of treatment in a legal sense does not necessarily imply that the economic consequences are the same. In practice, taxation under the same legal rules may defer or encourage investment in real estate relative to other business assets. Therefore our central concern has been to ensure that the cost of capital is as even-handed and consistent as possible across different forms of investment. 9.12 Figure 9.3 suggests that there may be an element of tax sheltering of “other income” through the use of rental property investment. Losses generated from investment in rental property – including interest and depreciation deductions – may be sheltering income from other sources for higher income earners. On the other hand, many lower income earners, perhaps often retirees, gain significant amounts of positive rental income. 64 The relative weightings of these trends may change across time. 65 Household Expenditure Survey, Statistics New Zealand, 1998 and 2000/01. 66 Building Consents Issued, Statistics New Zealand, September 2003. 99 Figure 9.3: Net rental by amount of other income 9.13 There appear to be two key ways in which investment in residential rental properties may be tax-advantaged. First, the depreciation rate on rental property and other buildings, more generally, may be excessive. Second, the growing practice of taxpayers splitting residential rental property into smaller parts is further increasing the overgenerous building depreciation rate. Are current building depreciation rates over generous? 9.14 As discussed in Part 2, there may be little justification for the current method for calculating depreciation with its 13.5 percent residual value. This leads to buildings with a 50-year economic life having a depreciation rate of 4 percent diminishing value. This rate is equal to the depreciation rate calculated under a double declining balance approach. Moving rental property along with other buildings and structures onto a straight-line system of depreciation (or the diminishing value equivalent) is likely to better reflect the present value of economic depreciation. As proposed earlier, this would mean a 2 percent straight-line depreciation rate or a 3 percent diminishing value depreciation rate. Breaking buildings into smaller depreciable assets 9.15 There is a growing practice on the part of residential rental property owners of re-characterising their buildings into separate depreciable parts. They then claim higher depreciation deductions than the deduction available for depreciating the building as a whole. These taxpayers are using assets and depreciation rates set out under the building fit-out category in Determination DEP1. 67 67 Tax Depreciation Rate Determinations, Income Tax Act 1994. -40.0 -20.0 0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 N i l / n e g a t i v e 1 0 , 0 0 0 2 0 , 0 0 0 3 0 , 0 0 0 4 0 , 0 0 0 5 0 , 0 0 0 6 0 , 0 0 0 7 0 , 0 0 0 8 0 , 0 0 0 9 0 , 0 0 0 O v e r $ 9 0 , 0 0 0 Amount of non-rental income Net rental income ($M ) 1998 2001 100 9.16 By breaking the building out into sub-categories (for example, claiming depreciation on electrical wiring, plumbing and internal walls), landlords are able to access higher depreciation rates and, in some cases, the 20 percent depreciation loading. Although it is accepted that there is some scope for identifying assets and depreciating them separately from the building itself, some of the parts or components currently being depreciated separately are arguably not separately identifiable assets. The effect of this practice is to reduce taxable income. Although the legislation provides that depreciation is clawed back by Inland Revenue when the property is sold, taxpayers are able to enjoy the timing advantages, and in some instances these advantages are permanent. There is a clear argument where this behaviour occurs that the depreciation rate accorded the remaining components of the building should be lowered. 9.17 We are concerned that the current legislative framework is unclear on this point, which creates potential compliance risks for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. The uncertainty also creates the potential for misuse and can lead to depreciation deductions inappropriately varying amongst taxpayers. For example, taxpayers who arrange to have the costs of the building broken down into a schedule of fixed assets may be advantaged. Inland Revenue’s view is that the depreciation rate for buildings should be inclusive of components normally considered to be part of a building’s structure. Others, however, have argued that a better view of the law is that breaking a building into separate parts is allowable. The compliance cost of taxpayers getting valuations in order to do this is an economic loss to New Zealand as a whole. 9.18 Inland Revenue’s interim operational view is the building depreciation rate is inclusive of structural items like electrical wiring and plumbing. Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 5, No. 9 (February 1994) sets out the following view of what is an asset. 68 Inland Revenue considers that a distinct physical unit which can function on its own is a unit against which the extent of any expenditure will be measured. So, if a building is part of a larger complex, the particular building (and not the wider complex) will be the unit if it is a stand alone building. However, each situation will depend on its own facts. Examples of assets considered to be units are: • motor vehicles (the unit is not the fleet of vehicles) • individual buildings (not a complex of attached buildings) • a boat builder’s slipway (not the workshop, slipway and associated plant). 9.19 In addition, Inland Revenue’s Guide to Rental Income (IR 264) includes the following note: 68 This statement was provided in the context of repairs and maintenance, but it is also relevant to determining an asset for depreciation purposes. 101 You can claim depreciation on the cost of the buildings, fixtures and fittings, and chattels. Fixtures and fittings which form part of the building’s structure are depreciated as part of the building. Chattels are depreciated separately. You cannot claim depreciation on the cost of the land. 9.20 But as noted earlier, the facts of each situation are determinative as to whether an asset is a separate asset or merely a component of a larger asset. 9.21 The issue of depreciation allowances for residential property investment has been under consideration by tax authorities in other countries. For example, the Australian Tax Office recently issued a draft principles paper outlining its view that some items associated with residential rental properties, which have historically attracted higher depreciation rates, should receive only the lower building allowance rate. Under the current proposal, the residential building allowance rate would apply to items such as internal walls, built-in cupboards, ducts, pipes, vents and wiring. 9.22 The United States has a similar problem with distinguishing between those assets that form part of a building or structure (defined as 1250 property) and other separately depreciable property (defined as 1245 property). 1245 property has shorter economic lives than 1250 property. A variety of legislative acts, court cases and service rulings has produced complex and often conflicting guidance on the boundary between these two classes of assets. The general test appears to be that if an asset meets the definition of a building structural component it is prima facie a 1250 asset. However, if it can be demonstrated that the structural component either exclusively or mainly services an item of 1245 property, then it may qualify to be depreciated as 1245 property. 9.23 In the United States a distinct industry sector has developed to provide studies for buildings and building projects that distinguish 1245 assets from 1250 assets. These studies are designed to enable taxpayers to maximise depreciation deductions on a building. The results of these studies are sometimes contentious, especially when they seek to treat portions of building components as 1245 property. The contentious nature of the studies is compounded by the lack of standards regarding the preparation of these studies. In response, the Internal Revenue Service is currently consulting on a draft audit guide to provide a foundation for increased understanding of these studies and an examination process that will facilitate the audit process and minimise the burden on taxpayers, practitioners and Internal Revenue Service auditors. 9.24 Given the uncertainty as to whether an item is part of the building, and that taxpayers who arrange to have the costs of the building broken down into a schedule of fixed assets may be advantaged, it may be timely for the law in this area to be defined more clearly. 102 9.25 In better defining the law in this area, we are confining our attention to residential accommodation. The reason for treating residential property differently from commercial property is that changes to the structure or the layout are thought to occur less frequently than they do for commercial buildings. In addition, commercial buildings are used for a diverse range of activities. Often these activities may require additional or specialised structural components. 9.26 In developing our suggested changes, we have been balancing two key considerations. The first is economic efficiency – creating a set of rules that accurately allow the consumption of capital or changes in asset values to be offset against income. The other is to ensure that the costs, including compliance and administration, of these rules are not overly severe. 9.27 We consider that if a building is used to provide residential rental accommodation, structural components like wiring, ducting, plumbing and internal walls must be treated as part of the building. This approach may take the form of a legislative schedule of components which are seen to form the core part of the building. In effect, we consider that there is merit in looking at applying the Australian “list” approach to building depreciation deductions for residential rental property investment. 9.28 Under the list approach, non-core chattels and fixtures could still be separately depreciable if they were clearly separately identifiable assets and not included on the list as being part of a residential rental building. Examples of items we see being treated as separately identifiable assets include lifts, hot water cylinders (but not internal pipes), air conditioning units (but not internal ducting), light fittings, curtains and carpets. 9.29 When a taxpayer is depreciating assets under the list approach, an independent valuation on purchase and sale of the property should be required for the listed assets. This would add to the taxpayer’s costs but would be necessary to determine whether there had been a loss or gain on the disposal of these assets. We also consider that if a taxpayer chose the approach of listing non-core chattels and fixtures, all non-core chattels and fixtures should be required to be depreciated separately. 9.30 Given the compliance costs associated with the list approach, we also consider that taxpayers should be given the option to elect that non-core chattels and fixtures be treated as part of the building and depreciated accordingly. Note that this approach does not exclude taxpayers being able to book and depreciate appliances like stoves and dishwashers separately when they are included in the rental property. If a taxpayer adopted this approach it would be appropriate for there to be wider scope for deducting expenses as repairs and maintenance, since the building is the asset. Repairing or replacing parts of the building when the work is of a minor nature and there is no overall improvement to the building would suggest that the work is of a revenue nature. For example, a replacement water heater might be an expense under this approach, but if a taxpayer opted for the list 103 approach the costs of the water heater and installation would be required to be capitalised and depreciated. 9.31 There is an argument that those who choose to list non-core chattels and fittings separately should be limited to a slightly lower depreciation rate. This is due to the inclusion of a wider range of assets, most of which will not have a 50-year economic life, being depreciated at more than the building depreciation rate. We invite submissions on this issue. 9.32 We do not suggest any changes to the use of the building fit-out category for commercial buildings at present, since the internal structure and layout of a commercial property are likely to change more frequently than those of residential rental property. There is a question, however, as to the boundary between commercial and residential property – for example, whether a hotel should have a treatment similar to a residential rental property or a commercial non-residential building. Our current position is that hotels and their like should be treated as commercial buildings, although this position could be reviewed if boundary concerns also start to arise in this sector. Other options considered but not favoured 9.33 Given concerns that had been voiced about possible over-investment in rental housing, we considered five other measures that could have been used in the context of the tax treatment of rental real estate. None of these options is without problems, all could be seen as arbitrary, and officials do not favour pursuing them. The only grounds for reconsidering any of these options would be if substantial differences in effective tax rates were thought to prevail after the building depreciation rate and fit-out issues are resolved. We do not believe that this will be the case. 9.34 These options are included to demonstrate officials’ thinking on these matters. Although we are not looking to progress them, we would welcome any comments on the options. Denying depreciation deductions 9.35 Officials do not support the option of denying depreciation deductions for rental housing altogether, as such a measure raises a number of concerns. Property prices are typically made up of land and improvements (the asset – house – on that land and any improvements to that asset or the land itself). Denying depreciation deductions entirely might be suggested because properties often appreciate rather than depreciate, although depreciation deductions are aimed at reflecting changes in the value of improvements over time. If the overall value of a property does not change but improvements depreciate while land appreciates, failure to allow for depreciation deductions will discourage economically efficient investment in new improvements. Buildings are scrapped on occasion, and it is clear that at least these buildings have fully depreciated. The evidence presented in chapter 5 provides a rationale for some reduction to building depreciation rates but not for denying depreciation deductions altogether. 104 Repairs and maintenance and capital improvements 9.36 Current tax rules distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure. Capital expenditure is generally not deductible in the year that the expenditure arises, but is depreciated over the life of the asset. Revenue expenditure is generally deductible in the year that it is incurred. In this context, repairs and maintenance expenses are immediately deductible, although it is sometimes difficult for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to distinguish between expenditure on repairs and maintenance and capital improvements. Our view is that it is likely that some capital expenditure may be immediately deducted rather than capitalised and then depreciated. This may be a particular problem for assets like buildings, which are long- lived and can be refurbished to near new condition by maintenance. 9.37 Repairs and maintenance are a cash expense designed to enable the owner to maintain a building. Denying a deduction for repairs and maintenance would effectively increase taxable income by the amount of the repair and maintenance costs incurred each year. 9.38 Officials do not favour denying deductions for repairs and maintenance for the following reasons: • The effect of the measure would vary with the age and state of the buildings. • Legitimate expenditure on repairs and maintenance would not be allowed, for example, if a water cylinder ruptures, leading to water damage to walls and flooring. This may discourage the undertaking of economically efficient levels of repairs and maintenance. • There is no evidence to suggest that rental property is excessively well maintained at present; indeed, it may well be of an overall poorer quality than owner-occupied housing. Discouraging legitimate maintenance of rental properties would also disadvantage tenants. • This capital/revenue boundary issue applies to investment in other types of assets, which would not be addressed under this response. This increases the risk of criticism of the arbitrary use of tax policy. Limiting or denying interest deductions 9.39 There are options for limiting, denying or deferring deductions for interest expenses incurred in deriving rental income. The interest expense is typically large because rental housing is often highly geared, owing to banks’ willingness to lend against land and buildings. It is possible, however, to gear other investment with limited or no cash outlays and defer paying any tax until the investment is eventually realised. 9.40 Beyond simply denying deductions for interest expenses, there is the option of deferring deductions until the time of sale of the rental property or not allowing an interest deduction to the extent that the deduction results in a tax loss. 105 9.41 At first sight, it may appear that allowing interest deductions when people invest in tax-preferred assets creates a tax loophole. However, the loophole – if there is one – is not allowing a deduction for legitimate expenses, but not taxing economic income. Allowing deductions for interest expenses also means that landlords and owners of capital are able to specialise and manage the risks for their particular business activity. The inefficiency caused by denying deductions for interest costs arises because it would inhibit this specialisation and risk-sharing process. 9.42 Limiting or denying interest deductions on money borrowed to invest in rental property would appear ad hoc when interest on money borrowed to invest in other assets, including tax-preferred assets, is fully deductible. Another problem with this approach is that a range of legal entities can own a rental property. It would be complex to deny interest deductions for some of these entities, as they are able to create structures that make it difficult to match borrowing and interest payments to specific (rental housing) assets. However, many investors in residential rental housing are likely to have small and unsophisticated portfolios, so it is not clear that it would be viable or cost-effective for them to take advantage of such structures. Previous experience with tracing rules is that this approach “bites” only with respect to taxpayers who do not know how to, or cannot, plan around these rules. We do not recommend limiting or denying interest deductions. Lack of a capital gains tax 9.43 Some have argued that the absence of a capital gains tax may lead to excessive investment in residential rental properties. This is because depreciation deductions are being given for an appreciating asset, while any gains in the value of the property are untaxed. However, this analysis is somewhat misleading. Real estate consists of both land, which typically appreciates in both real and nominal terms, and buildings, which typically depreciate in real terms but may appreciate in nominal terms. Most countries with a capital gains tax still have a specific exemption for residential property, although in many cases it will target only the principal residence (and not second homes, holiday homes and rental property). 9.44 From an efficiency perspective, it is the investment in buildings and land improvements that is important. It does not matter, from an over-investment perspective, whether unimproved land is taxed or not, because taxation cannot alter the quantity available. The fact that any nominal gain on buildings (as well as other long-lived assets) is not taxed can, however, provide a tax-induced advantage to over-investment in long-lived assets. In principle, therefore, there is an argument for taxing the gains on buildings and other long-lived assets. There are practical problems, however, that pull in the other direction. 106 9.45 A capital gains tax on a realisation basis raises a number of issues: • It provides taxpayers with incentives to defer recognising gains and to recognise losses as soon as possible, which can lower the present value of tax payments. Because of this, countries with capital gains taxes often ring fence capital losses so they can be offset only against capital gains, but this creates other distortions. • In the absence of any capital loss ring fence, it can subsidise risk-taking behaviour because loss-taking (and the attendant tax relief) can be accelerated, whereas profits (and the attendant tax liabilities) can be deferred. In some instances, depending on the holding period and the interest rate over that period, this deferral can result in a significantly lower effective tax rate for an investor. • It creates a “lock-in effect” for taxpayers who, in the absence of a capital gains tax on realisation, would efficiently change their portfolio of assets in response to market conditions. 9.46 An alternative to a capital gains tax is the risk-free return method which would apply a pre-determined rate of return to the value of an asset (in this case a building), with tax calculated on this notional income. As with capital gains tax, there are a number of design problems with this method. They include setting the appropriate assumed rate of return and whether this method should apply to the total value of an asset or only to the net equity held. 9.47 Given these problems, and that the general depreciation review is to look at ways of ensuring more accurate depreciation for long-lived and short-lived assets, we do not advocate a capital gains tax or a risk-free rate of return method in relation to rental housing. Submissions We invite submissions on these issues, in particular: • Do major distortions arise from treating the structural components of a residential rental building as a single entity, and if so what are these distortions? • Should taxpayers who adopt the list approach be restricted to a slightly lower building depreciation rate? • Are there better ways of defining the boundary between the building and other separately identifiable assets? 107 Chapter 10 ROADS, OTHER LAND IMPROVEMENTS AND “BLACK HOLE” EXPENDITURE 10.1 A number of depreciation issues that will be considered outside this issues paper are outlined in this final chapter. Tax treatment of roads and other land improvements 10.2 Issues have also been raised in the context of the tax treatment of roads and other land improvements. Some relate to the tax treatment of capital expenditure on constructing roads and other infrastructure, which can be classified as depreciable land improvements. Depreciable land improvements are listed in schedule 16 to the Income Tax Act 1994. 10.3 The key areas of concern relate to roading construction projects, when the project is undertaken by private enterprise, on land that is leased from the Crown (for example, toll roads). At the end of the lease period the roads (including associated land improvements) revert to the Crown. Some of the concerns raised include: • Ownership of assets: some of the land improvements may necessarily be constructed on land that is not part of the lease (for example, fences constructed around the road on surrounding land). Consequently, the party constructing these assets will not be able to claim depreciation in respect of them. • Beginning of the lease period: capital expenditure incurred before the beginning of the lease (such as pre-construction costs) is not depreciable. • Depreciation rates: the estimated useful lives (for tax purposes) of roads and other depreciable land improvements are typically longer than the lives contemplated for private roads. This can result in significant write-offs in the value of these assets in the final year of lease arrangements. It has been submitted that flexibility is required to ensure roads and other depreciable land improvements are depreciable over the life of the lease arrangements. • Capital improvements: capital improvements undertaken during the life of roading projects are required to be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset that is being improved (for example, a road). This has no regard to the fact that the improvement may, in fact, be made well into the life of the asset being depreciated and should be depreciated over the remaining lease period. 108 Process for consideration 10.4 Our view is that these issues can best be progressed as a separate project, as a number of the issues raised are specific to particular arrangements. We hope to be able to consider the issues raised in relation to the tax treatment of roads and other depreciable land improvements before the end of the year. “Black hole” development expenditure 10.5 In late 2002 the government set up the Private Sector Liaison Group on Research and Development to monitor implementation of the 2001 reforms to the tax rules in relation to research and development expenditure. Under those changes, an immediate deduction is allowed for expenditure on “research” and, equally, expenditure on “development”, except to the extent that an asset is created which requires capitalisation for accounting purposes. Financial Reporting Standard 13 provides the relevant definitions of “research” and “development” and the tests for asset recognition. 10.6 In its report back to the government, the group indicated that depreciation deductions are not available for certain expenditure required to be capitalised under Financial Reporting Standard 13 and, therefore, the expenditure is not deductible for income tax purposes – so called “black hole” development expenditure. In particular, the group asked that the feasibility of allowing either immediate deductions or depreciation deductions for expenditure that has been capitalised but which does not give rise to depreciable property be considered. It considers that examples of such expenditure include: • expenditure incurred in applying for patents when the patent is not granted; • development expenditure towards an asset that is not defined as depreciable property; and • development expenditure that does not give rise to an asset. Comment 10.7 The government has introduced an amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2004 to allow an immediate deduction for costs associated with patent applications when the application is either withdrawn or is not granted. The amendment also covers applications for certain consents under the Resource Management Act 1991 when the application is withdrawn or is refused. In both cases, the deductible expenditure is the cost that would have been depreciable if a patent or resource management consent had been granted. The amendment, once enacted, will apply from the 2004-05 income year. 109 10.8 In relation to the recommendations to allow deductions for various “black hole” development expenditures more generally, the government has asked officials to work with the group to identify situations of particular concern, and consider possible solutions. Process for consideration 10.9 The work involved is complex and is being progressed on a different track from that of the general tax depreciation work. We do, however, welcome submissions on specific expenditures that may be regarded as “black hole” and the magnitude of any such expenditure.
International treaty examination of taxation agreements with the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Chile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of the Philippines, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the following double taxation agreements: • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol • Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income • Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 • Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 2 • Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 • Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims. We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.

We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.
